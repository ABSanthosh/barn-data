The tablet comes not too long after the debut of the Oppo Pad 3, which was launched late last year (and subsequently renamed as the OnePlus Pad in China). READ: OPPO’s Killer Camera Phone Arrives in April Not much is known about the Oppo Pad 4 Pro in the way of specs at the moment, but it’s strongly expected that it will feature Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, which up until now has surprisingly not been used in any current Android tablets, including those from Samsung. Other details such as pricing and availability are a mystery as well, so fans will have to wait for the official launch. As for the Oppo Find X8, Oppo is also expected to unveil several flagship phones under the X8 series, which will include the Dimensity-powered Find X8s as well as the Find X8 Next, a compact and thin handset which sounds like it’s designed to compete with the Galaxy S25 Edge and the rumored iPhone 17 “Air.”",
