With that said, we’re taking a look at the GameSir X5 Lite, a budget-friendly controller that packs some pretty nifty features, all designed to make your smartphone gaming sessions more comfortable. So what can you expect with this one? Let’s take a look. READ: 5 Best Android Gaming Handhelds You Can Get in 2025! Hall effect analogue sticks Membrane triggers, buttons, and D-pad Power via USB-C connection Weighs just 135.4g Available in “Wasabi” green and Black colour options Priced at $34.99 The Good Stuff As far as build quality is concerned, the X5 Lite is pretty lightweight overall, and features an extendable frame that can fit phones between 4.13-8.39 inches in length. The controls are nice and responsive as well, and you even get a few extra buttons such as a Menu button, Home Button, View Button and a dedicated “M” button which can be used to take screenshots, switch layouts, or even turn on a Turbo mode. Like a lot of newer portable controllers, the X5 Lite comes with Hall Effect sticks—simply put, these feature a design that greatly reduces the chances of getting stick drift on your controllers in the long run, something that even a big company like Nintendo still hasn’t implemented on its consoles. It’s also easy to use, with a plug-and-play setup that just requires you to plug the USB-C connector into your phone’s charging port, and carefully insert your phone into the telescopic frame. In addition to being comfortable, the controls are nice and responsive, and the wired connection does mean that you’re unlikely to get lag when using the X5 Lite… In addition to being comfortable, the controls are nice and responsive, and the wired connection does mean that you’re unlikely to get lag when using the X5 Lite with your games. I was able to use it seamlessly with titles such as Grimvalor and Dead Cells for this test. Things to Consider There are some downsides however—being that it relies on a USB-C connection, the controller doesn’t come with a battery of its own, and will draw power from your smartphone in order to work. I did notice a bit of warmth during gameplay on the left side of the controller, although nothing too drastic to worry about. It should be noted that not all the extra keys will work on all games, and this will vary on the title that you’re playing. The way that the frame is positioned behind the phone might also be an issue, depending on which device you’re rocking—in my case, I used it with the Honor 400, and its large camera bump came into contact with the frame, so you’ll need to be extra careful to prevent scratches on your camera. Final Thoughts Given its low price, there are some compromises with the GameSir X5 Lite, such as the lack of an independent power supply and wireless capabilities. On the other hand, you are getting Hall Effect hardware for a more affordable entry point, and its lightweight design and responsive controls are very welcome. For mobile gamers on a budget, the X5 Lite certainly makes for a good addition to your gear collection.
