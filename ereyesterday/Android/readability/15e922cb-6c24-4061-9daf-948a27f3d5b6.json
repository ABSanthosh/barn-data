  "text": "Surface Pro 11 $950 $1400 Save $450 The Surface Pro 11 is Microsoft's best tablet yet, powered by the al-new Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chipset and featuring an optional OLED display for the first time ever, resulting in a stunning visual experience. It also comes with new AI features as part of Copilot+. The Surface Pro 11 is one of the best laptops/tablets that you can buy. Microsoft has really refined this line to its peak with its current version, delivering exactly what you'd want from a computing device running Windows that's compact, thin, and light. Related While this piece of hardware is usually pretty pricey, coming in at $1,400, it can now be had for much less, thanks to a substantial discount of $450. This is the lowest price we've seen on this model, so get it while you can because the Amazon's Big Spring Sale won't be around for long. What's great about the Surface Pro 11? The Surface Pro 11 is just one of those devices that gets so much right. This model features a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip that's paired with 16GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. If that's not enough, you can always upgrade the storage later by swapping out the M.2 SSD for something larger. The Surface Pro 11 provides impressive visuals thanks to its fantastic 13-inch OLED screen that offers vibrant colors and deep black levels. Battery life is also pretty good as well, with up to 14 hours on a single charge, and 65W quick charging that can have you topped up in no time. When it comes to connectivity, you get a decent selection here with two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and a Surface Connect port. There's also Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4 on board as well. While the tablet is pretty good on its own, you'll want to grab a keyboard and stylus if you want to take your productivity to a new level. For the most part, you really can't go wrong here by picking up a Surface Pro 11. This tablet is refined to its peak, offering the perfect balance when it comes to power and portability. And with its $450 discount, it's an absolute no-brainer if you're looking to pick up a new computing device. Just be sure to act quickly because this promotion won't be around for long.
