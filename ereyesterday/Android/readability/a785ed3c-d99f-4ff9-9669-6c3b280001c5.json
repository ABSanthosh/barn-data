If you’re considering switching carriers, now is a fantastic time to buy a new device. I’ve seen several deals on new releases with deep discounts for new customers. Switching carriers is not always ideal, but it might be worth changing if you’re tired of paying outsized monthly bills. When I reviewed the Moto G Power 2025, I mentioned that it was a phone best purchased on a deal. Thankfully, the deals have started, and Cricket has an excellent one. If you port in your number and buy a qualifying plan, you can get a G Power 2025 for free. Even if you need a new number, Cricket will sell you the device for only $40. Either way, it’s an easy way to save on a phone that’ll serve you well. Read our review Why you should buy a Moto G Power 2025 Motorola may not have made wholesale changes to the Moto G Power for 2025, but that’s not bad. It features a large 6.8-inch 1080p LCD screen refreshing at 120Hz. It’s still an LCD, so there are obvious limitations to contrast and color, but overall, it provides a decent viewing experience for games and movies. Motorola upgraded the build quality this year, as the G Power 2025 now carries an IP69 rating and is MIL-STD-810H compliant. It means your G Power won’t break apart from minor damage, and you can feel comfortable rocking it without a case. I was pleased with the Moto G Power’s performance. It has a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset under the hood with 8GB of RAM. That’s a surprisingly capable combination for a budget device, and I’ve enjoyed the Dimensity 6300 in several smartphones over the last two years. You’ll enjoy smooth daily performance when sending WhatsApp messages and scrolling through Instagram. Even light gaming is enjoyable on the G Power. Don’t ask it to do anything more than you’d expect from a budget phone, and you’ll be happy. Battery life is the star of the Moto G Power 2025. Thanks to its power-efficient chipset, LCD screen, and 5,000mAh battery cell, I get two full days of use on a single charge. When it’s time to top off, the G Power includes 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, a spec you don’t see at this price point. All told, the Moto G Power 2025 is an excellent budget choice, especially if you can get one for free. Moto G Power (2025) Motorola's new Moto G Power combines a sleek, attractive green colorway with solid specs for just $300. But whether it's so-so software support and limited camera tools will send buyers looking elsewhere remains to be seen. Its powered by a Dimensity 6300 chipset and 8GB of RAM, giving it decent performance for a budget phone. Battery life is solid from its 5,000mAh battery.",

phones\u003c/a\u003e. You’d be surprised how much smartphone you can get for less money, and discounts allow you to save even more. If you’re considering switching carriers, now is a fantastic time to buy a new device. I’ve seen several deals on new releases with deep discounts for new customers. Switching carriers is not always ideal, but it might be worth changing if you’re tired of paying outsized monthly bills. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWhen I reviewed the Moto G Power 2025, I mentioned that it was a phone best purchased on a deal. Thankfully, the deals have started, and Cricket has an excellent one. If you port in your number and buy a qualifying plan, you can get a G Power 2025 for free. Even if you need a new number, Cricket will sell you the device for only $40. Either way, it’s an easy way to save on a phone that’ll serve you well. \u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n    \n    \n

It features a large 6.8-inch 1080p LCD screen refreshing at 120Hz. It’s still an LCD, so there are obvious limitations to contrast and color, but overall, it provides a decent viewing experience for games and movies. Motorola upgraded the build quality this year, as the G Power 2025 now carries an IP69 rating and is MIL-STD-810H compliant. It means your G Power won’t break apart from minor damage, and you can feel comfortable rocking it without a case. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eI was pleased with the Moto G Power’s performance. It has a MediaTek Dimensity 6300 chipset under the hood with 8GB of RAM. That’s a surprisingly capable combination for a budget device, and I’ve enjoyed the Dimensity 6300 in several smartphones over the last two years. You’ll enjoy smooth daily performance when sending WhatsApp messages and scrolling through Instagram. Even light gaming is enjoyable on the G Power. Don’t ask it to do anything more than you’d expect from a budget phone, and you’ll be happy. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBattery life is the star of the Moto G Power 2025. Thanks to its power-efficient chipset, LCD screen, and 5,000mAh battery cell, I get two full days of use on a single charge. When it’s time to top off, the G Power includes 30W wired charging and 15W wireless charging, a spec you don’t see at this price point. All told, the Moto G Power 2025 is an excellent \u003ca href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/best-budget-android-phones/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebudget choice\u003c/a\u003e, especially if you can get
