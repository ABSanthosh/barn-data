  "text": "There are a few aspects of Windows 11 that have never really resonated with users all that much, and in response that, multiple third-party apps have appeared to allow you to customize certain Windows behaviors. Windhawk and ExplorerPatcher are two such apps, but they're vastly different — aside from the price, at least. These two apps are free, but they take radically different approaches to Windows customization, with one offering a more scoped set of features, while the other has a more open-ended approach. Let's take a closer look at what they offer so you can choose the right one for you. Related Windhawk has dozens of mods The thing that sets these two apps apart right off the bat is their approach to customization. While ExplorerPatcher offers a set of features out of the box and that's it, Windhawk is more of a platform. Windhawk itself includes no changes to Windows, but you can browse the dozens of available mods to find all the customization options you want. This inherently gives Windawk a lot more options, because these mods can be almost anything. The more popular ones change the Start menu, so you can do things like remove the Recommended section, add the All apps list on the side, or just change the overall look of the UI. But then there are mods that modify the taskbar, the clock, the way windows move around. Some mods even affect browsers specifically, such as one that allows you to use the scroll wheel to switch between tabs. Using Windhawk opens up a whole world of possibilities for how Windows looks and feels, and it's all extremely customizable. You only use the mods you want, and you can add, remove, enable, or disable mods on a whim. If you're more technically proficient, you can even make your own mods, since every mod is open-sourced and can be easily forked. Related ExplorerPatcher is more focused It's all about restoring classic Windows features ExplorerPatcher may lack all the openness of Windhawk's mod approach, but there's still some value here compared to Windhawk. ExplorerPatcher aims to bring back a lot of classic Windows features and design elements that have been removed, and it's a potentially easier way to do it compared to Windhawk, since all the capabilities are just built in. You can reverse the taskbar to the Windows 10 style, as well as the Start menu, and along with that, multiple dialogs can be changed too. You can bring back the old calendar flyout, not just from Windows 10, but even the Windows 7 version. You can also restore the Windows 10 Wi-Fi dialog, or the volume slider. Being more focused on specific features also allows ExplorerPatcher to be a bit more polished and consistent. For example, I've had some issues with the All apps list not loading properly when using one of those options in the Start menu mod. Plus, ExplorerPatcher also goes beyond the Start menu and taskbar. One of the more useful things it can do is restore the Windows 10 File Explorer, which includes the convenient Ribbon UI compared to the newer, but more limited Windows 11 approach. Related How to make Windows 11 look like Windows 10 Not everyone is a fan of the look of Windows 11, and if you want to go back to the Windows 10 look, you can do so with these tools. The open-source approach They're similar, but very different Both ExplorerPatcher and Windhawk are built on an open-source approach, but the way each app works is a bit different. Since ExplorerPatcher is an app all on its own, development is centered around the main GitHub prohject, where anyone can contribute directly to the app's features. Windhawk is a bit different because you don't really contribute to Windhawk directly. Instead, every single mod for Windhawk is an open-source project in itself, with the code directly visible to any user of the app, along with the ability to fork a mod to create a variation of it. This results in even more flexibility, since you can directly change the code of a mod to do something specific, and you can then publish your own version of a mod if you want, offering a feature that the existing mod might not. That being said, Windhawk mods still need to be added to the official repository, so adding new mods for others to use is still dependent on the cental development team. But this approach can make it easier to share your work with others. Related Windhawk vs PowerToys: Which Windows customization tool is better? Want to customize Windows to improve your workflow? Find out whether Windhawk or PowerToys is the best option for you. There are some bugs in ExplorerPatcher It's not perfect With any software that directly modifies Windows behaviors, some bugs are to be expected. However, I find that ExplorerPatcher has a few too many problems for its own good, which is especially concerning for an app that has a more limited scope. There are a few smaller problems here and there, but the bigger problem is some features just don't work at all. I tried using the weather icon on the taskbar, but in the current version of the app, the icon gets convrted into a People icon somehow, which was used for the My People feature in Windows 10 that no longer works. It's essentially a useless button. Granted, Windhawk has its little bugs too, but those are mostly up to the individual mods, and I think that's more tolerable due to the much more open nature of Windhawk as a platform. With ExplorerPatcher being a more focused app, I'd expect a more polished experience, but it's not quite there yet. Windhawk is better Having used these two apps fairly extensively, I have to give the edge to Windhawk. There are just a ton of customization options that come with having all these mods to choose from, and each mod offers its own customization options, so the possibilities are very vast here. ExplorerPatcher has a more limited set of features, and it can work better in some cases, but it still has some frustrating issues that are a little harder to excuse. Plus, the unique features it offers only appeal to a very small subset of users, and most will probably prefer what Windhawk can do. Windhawk ExplorerPatcher",

approach, but there\u0026#39;s still some value here compared to Windhawk. ExplorerPatcher aims to bring back a lot of classic Windows features and design elements that have been removed, and it\u0026#39;s a potentially easier way to do it compared to Windhawk, since all the capabilities are just built in.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYou can reverse the taskbar to the Windows 10 style, as well as the Start menu, and along with that, multiple dialogs can be changed too. You can bring back the old calendar flyout, not just from Windows 10, but even the Windows 7 version. You can also restore the Windows 10 Wi-Fi dialog, or the volume slider.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eBeing more focused on specific features also allows ExplorerPatcher to be a bit more polished and consistent. For example, I\u0026#39;ve had some issues with the All apps list not loading properly when using one of those options in the Start menu mod.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePlus, ExplorerPatcher also goes beyond the Start menu and taskbar. One of the more useful things it can do is restore the Windows 10 File Explorer, which includes the convenient Ribbon UI compared to the newer, but more limited Windows 11 approach.\u003c/p\u003e

Since ExplorerPatcher is an app all on its own, development is centered around the main GitHub prohject, where anyone can contribute directly to the app\u0026#39;s features.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eWindhawk is a bit different because you don\u0026#39;t really contribute to Windhawk directly. Instead, every single mod for Windhawk is an open-source project in itself, with the code directly visible to any user of the app, along with the ability to fork a mod to create a variation of it. This results in even more flexibility, since you can directly change the code of a mod to do something specific, and you can then publish your own version of a mod if you want, offering a feature that the existing mod might not.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThat being said, Windhawk mods still need to be added to the official repository, so adding new mods for others to use is still dependent on the cental development team. But this approach can make it easier to share your work with others.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n                        \n                \n    \n

However, I find that ExplorerPatcher has a few too many problems for its own good, which is especially concerning for an app that has a more limited scope.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere are a few smaller problems here and there, but the bigger problem is some features just don\u0026#39;t work at all. I tried using the weather icon on the taskbar, but in the current version of the app, the icon gets convrted into a People icon somehow, which was used for the My People feature in Windows 10 that no longer works. It\u0026#39;s essentially a useless button.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eGranted, Windhawk has its little bugs too, but those are mostly up to the individual mods, and I think that\u0026#39;s more tolerable due to the much more open nature of Windhawk as a platform. With ExplorerPatcher being a more focused app, I\u0026#39;d expect a more polished experience, but it\u0026#39;s not quite there yet.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"windhawk-is-better\"\u003e\n            Windhawk is better\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHaving used these two apps fairly extensively, I have to give the edge to Windhawk. There are just a ton of customization options that come with having all these mods to choose from, and each mod offers its own customization options, so the possibilities are very vast here.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eExplorerPatcher has a more limited set of features, and it can work better in some cases, but it still has some frustrating issues that are a little harder to excuse. Plus, the unique features it offers only appeal to a very small subset of users, and most will probably prefer what Windhawk can do.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\n\n        \n    \n            \u003cul\u003e\n
