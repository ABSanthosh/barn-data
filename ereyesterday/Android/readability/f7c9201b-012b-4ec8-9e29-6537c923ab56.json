  "text": "The push towards the continued development of modern AI products among different software and hardware companies has been a never-ending cycle these past couple of years, and it was only a matter of time before we saw collaborative efforts between some of the biggest names in the industry. With that in mind, MediaTek announced that it’s working with NVIDIA on designing the NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip for NVIDIA Project DIGITS. In other words, both companies are hard at work in developing what MediaTek describes as a “personal AI supercomputer.” MediaTek Vice Chairman and CEO Rick Tsai comments: Our collaboration with NVIDIA on the GB10 Superchip aligns with MediaTek’s vision of helping make great technology accessible to anyone. Along with NVIDIA, we are working to usher in a new era of innovation and make AI ubiquitous. Both companies have worked together before, such as with MediaTek’s automotive chips which integrate NVIDIA-made AI computing, as well as NVIDIA RTX graphics technologies. With that being said though, not much has been revealed about the super computer so far, but we’re bound to get more news later on in the year.",
