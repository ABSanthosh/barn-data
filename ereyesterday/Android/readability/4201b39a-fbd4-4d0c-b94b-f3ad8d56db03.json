The Galaxy S20 series has now reached the end of the road - none of the devices will receive any more software updates from now on. We're talking about the S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra, by the way, which have all reached the five-year mark since their release.

And now all of that has ended, as those devices were only promised support for five years. Since it was released later in the year, the S20 FE still is getting quarterly security updates, but it too will be bumped off in a few months from now. A lot of phone makers these days promise longer and longer software support windows for their flagships at least, which is a welcome trend, but we do have to wonder how long is long enough. We'd love to hear from you - how often do you switch phones? And thus, what number of years is a big enough software support window in your view? Do let us know in the comments. Source",
