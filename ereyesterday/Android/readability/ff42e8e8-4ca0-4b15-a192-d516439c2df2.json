[#InlinePriceWidget,13734,1#] The phone has a standout design, no matter which color you go for. The Neptune Blue and Orion Red both feature vegan leather finishes, while this Glowing Lunar White is unique.

We may get a commission from qualifying sales. 128GB 8GB RAM₹ 25,999256GB 8GB RAM₹ 25,399Show all prices The phone has a standout design, no matter which color you go for. The Neptune Blue and Orion Red both feature vegan leather finishes, while this Glowing Lunar White is unique. The moon's surface is etched under the smooth back panel, and it's infused with \"glowing material\", which lights up in the dark, just like the watch hands of your old childhood watch. The Glowing Lunar model is impressive (the green effect is a bit overdone by our smartphone camera here) Just hit the back with enough light force, and it will glow a light green in the dark. You can see it with your eyes just fine, but we've accentuated it in these photos for you. The Realme P3 Ultra ships with a case, a USB-A to USB-C cable, and an 80W charger. The phone has been available in India and Malaysia and is now becoming available in Europe, with Latin America and Southeast Asia to follow. You have a choice of 8/128GB, 8/256GB, and 12/256GB configurations. The glowing effect is nice but it's something you'll stop caring about pretty soon after you purchase the Realme P3 Ultra. What will last longer is the thinness of the phone. At 7.4mm, it's noticeably svelte. The phone is also impressively light at 186g, given its 6.83-inch display size. It's a big phone, but the thin profile and low weight make it feel nicely pocketable. The slender curve of both the front and rear panels is also pleasant, giving the phone a high-end look and feel. The 10-bit screen leaves little to complain about. It's big, bright, and very punchy out of the box. It's also nicely specced with a 120Hz refresh rate, up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness. Realme UI 6.0 runs smoothly thanks to the display's refresh rate and the 4nm Dimensity 8350 Ultra. Stay tuned for more.",
