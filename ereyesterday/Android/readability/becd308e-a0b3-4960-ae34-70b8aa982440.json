There are also a number of safety features that are used in order to keep you and your devices safe. Overall, you can\u0026#39;t go wrong with this charger, especially with its 18-month warranty. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n        \n\n    \n\n        \n\n\n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
