It's now at its best price at just $90 from Woot. Google has struggled with hardware for a number of years, but just a couple of years ago, things started to really click, with the brand beginning to deliver some of its best devices. The Google Pixel Buds Pro are an excellent example. A fantastic pair of earbuds that deliver excellent sound, powerful ANC, and are packed with a number of impressive features. Related Google Pixel Buds Pro review: Fourth time's the charm It only took five years, but Google finally got it right You also get a design that's quite distinct from the competition. And while these earbuds came in with a pretty high price tag, they can now be had for much less, with a steep discount from Woot that knocks 55% off, dropping them down to just $90 for a limited time or while supplies last. What's great about the Google Pixel Buds Pro? If you've been looking for a pair of Google earbuds, and want to grab something that won't hurt your wallet, now's going to be a great time. We loved these earbuds when we first reviewed them, with Google offering a pair of earbuds that any audio enthusiast would be happy to own. Despite their larger size, the earbuds fit snugly in the ear, while also providing an audio experience that truly delivers. You also get ANC, which can easily block out distracting sounds, and there's also an ambient mode that can pass through sound as well, just in case you need to stay alert and aware of your surroundings. While the stock sound of the earbuds sounds great out of the box, you do have the option to customize the sounds to your liking using the accompanying app. You won't get support for LDAC or aptX here, but there is support for AAC and SBC. For most folks, this shouldn't be an issue, with audio from your favorite music streaming services sounding crisp and full. Of course, you can also use these earbuds for calls as well, with voice clarity being excellent, even in busier environments. In addition to the above, you get the usual perks of a modern pair of earbuds, like multipoint audio, touch controls, Google's Fast Pair technology, and more. Battery life is also pretty good, with the Pixel Buds Pro lasting up to 11 hours in our tests. The case holds another two full charges, which means you can take these earbuds on a long trip and won't have to bring a charging cable with you. As stated before, we loved these earbuds when they were first released, even with the hefty $200 price tag. So now that they are just $90, it's an absolute no-brainer if you've been looking to pick up a pair of solid earbuds for less. You can grab them from Woot with this huge discount, and if you're an Amazon Prime member, you'll be able to get free shipping. Otherwise, you'll need to pay a flat $6 shipping fee. Overall, not a bad deal at all for a pair of quality earbuds. Just be quick because supplies are limited.",

In addition to the above, you get the usual perks of a modern pair of earbuds, like multipoint audio, touch controls, Google\u0026#39;s Fast Pair technology, and more. Battery life is also pretty good, with the Pixel Buds Pro lasting up to 11 hours in our tests.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe case holds another two full charges, which means you can take these earbuds on a long trip and won\u0026#39;t have to bring a charging cable with you.
