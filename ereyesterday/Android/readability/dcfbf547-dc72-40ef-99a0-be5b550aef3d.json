READ: More Details Emerge on Google’s Cancelled Pixel Tablet 2 For those unfamiliar with the name, Murena is a software and hardware company that designs and sells Android devices free from Google’s own platform elements, which instead run on /e/OS. According to the company, /e/OS provides a user experience with a greater focus on privacy, as every aspect of the software is customizable by the end user, meaning you only use the apps and services that you actually need. Murena adds that its custom version of the Pixel Tablet was pushed to meet “significant demand” from loyal fans. With that in mind, the device still comes with pretty much the same hardware specifications as on the “regular” Pixel Tablet. This includes an 11-inch display, Google’s Tensor G2 chipset as well as 8GB of RAM and up to 256GB of internal storage. There’s also a large 7,000 mAh battery onboard, and a pair of 8-megapixel cameras for video calls and photos. The Murena Pixel Tablet retails for $549.",
