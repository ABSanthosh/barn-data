Whether you're shopping for a new work partner, gaming laptop, or something in between, there's a never-ending sea of options to browse through, so it can be challenging. We've reviewed a lot of laptops here at XDA, and to help you out, we've compiled the best ones into this list. There are many factors to consider, including screen size, form, performance, and overall design. It's not the same for everyone, either. The specs that make a great laptop for work don't make a great one for gaming, and vice-versa. And while a gaming laptop can handle other kinds of tasks just fine, it will be very expensive and heavy. The choices we've rounded up below cover a good range of use cases, and we're confident that you'll find something that's perfectly suited to your needs. Dell XPS 13 (2024, Intel Lunar Lake) Best overall Apple MacBook Air (M3, 2024) Runner-up Source: Microsoft Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 Best business Source: Microsoft Our favorite laptops in 2024 Best overall Dell XPS 13 (2024, Intel Lunar Lake) Performance, efficiency, and a beautiful designPacked with Intel's new Core Ultra Series 2 processors, chip, the Dell XPS 13 is better than ever. With a sleek design, excellent display options, and an unrivaled mix of performance and battery life, this is simply one of the best laptops on the market.ProsQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite delivers top-tier performance and efficiencySleek, futurustic designExcellent display options ConsOnly two USB-C ports and nothing else The Dell XPS 13 is no stranger to the spotlight, being one of the best laptops on the market each and every year. And now, it's better than ever thanks to the latest processors from both Intel and Qualcomm. Qualcomm really changed the game with its Snapdragon X Elite processor, but now Intel's Lunar Lake processors have caught up. No matter which version you get, this laptop offers fantastic performance and efficiency, so you can enjoy a great experience even while on batteyr power and without sacrificing battery life. battery life is especially great on the Qualcomm model, but the Intel version is more widely compatible with apps and games, so it's a bit easier to recommend to anyone You can also configure this laptop with up to 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. Related On top of the excellent processor options, the Dell XPS 13 Plus also has some great display options. The base model is a relatively basic, but still quite good Full HD+ 120Hz panel, but you can upgrade to a sharper Quad HD+ display or, if you want the best of the best, opt for the stunning 2.8K OLED display, which also uses the fancy Tandem OLED technology you've probably heard Apple talk about for its latest iPad Pro. No matter your choice of screen, though, you'll get a great experience. Related Dell XPS 13 9345 review: A winner no matter the chipset The Dell XPS 13 now comes with a Qualcomm chipset and is just as winsome as its Intel brethren. All of this comes packaged in a beautifully slender design, with a zero-lattice edge-edge keyboard and an invisible touchpad that make this laptop feel like it comes from the future, even if this design is two years old at this point. There's still nothing like it. You only get two USB-C ports, which is a bit of a bummer, but aside from that, this is a nearly perfect laptop. Runner-up Apple MacBook Air (M3, 2024) A lightweight alternative with great battery life$899 $1099 Save $200 Apple keeps improving its MacBooks with better performance and efficiency, and the M3 MacBook Air is an absolute delight that offers a lot of power while still having unrivaled battery life so you can work all day without a charger. You can choose between 13-inch and 15-inch models, too.ProsApple M3 processor delivers excellent performance and battery lifeSharp display with P3 Wide Color in both 13- and 15-inch optionsVery thin and light ConsTwo external displays are only supported if the laptop is closedmacOS may not be for everyone Not everyone is a Windows fan, and the latest MacBook Air is one of the best laptops if you prefer macOS, or even if you just want to try something new. Thanks to the super-efficient Apple Silicon, the latest iteration of the MacBook Air is \"one of the best mainstream laptops in the world\", as our reviewer Ben Sin put it. 2:15 Related MacBook Air (M3, 15-inch, 2024) review: The Goldilocks laptop size The 15-inch MacBook Air offers an immersive large screen experience while keeping a slim and light(er) body than the MacBook Pro This latest edition comes with with Apple M3 processor, which is the first of the Apple Silicon line to use a 3nm manufacturing process to be even more efficient. It still has the same number of CPU cores, but it's a good bit faster now, and on the GPU side, there are completely new cores that take performance to the next level. If you're editing video, this machine can handle that kind of workload comfortably. The MacBook Air is available in two sizes: 13.6 inches and 15.3 inches. Both have great panels with up to 500 nits of brightness and support for P3 Wide Color and True Tone, and they're nearly identical otherwise. The smaller model has a resolution of 2560x1664, while the larger model goes up to 2880x1864 resolution. They share the same pixels-per-inch count making them equally as sharp. One thing you may not like is the notch at the top of the screen that houses the clear 1080p webcam. The M3 MacBook Air retains the same design as its predecessor, featuring a flat unibody construction that's very thin and light, yet still feels premium. The chassis is entirely made of aluminum, and it comes in four color options, including Silver, Space Grey, Midnight, and Starlight. There aren't a ton of ports in this design, which includes two Thunderbolt / USB4 ports, a headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones, and a MagSafe connector for charging. Unlike previous models, you can use two external displays, but you'll have to close the lid on the laptop to turn off the built-in screen. Best clamshell Surface Laptop 7 Sleek, stylish, and powerfulThe Surface Laptop 7 is one of the first laptops powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon X series processors, and it's also the first big shakeup of the Surface Laptop line. It has a much more modern design with slimmer bezels and a better display that makes this an namazing laptop.ProsQualcomm Snapdragon X Plus and X Elite processors deliver unrivalled performance and eficicnecyUpdated design finally feels modern and comes in fun colorsSignificantly better display than previous generations ConsSome games still won't work Microsoft's Surface Laptop 7 is the best laptop the company has ever made, and it's a very necessary update to one of its most popular products. Inside the Surface Laptop 7 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite chipset, and this is a big deal. This is an Arm-based processor with a fully custom design that delivers performance we;ve never seen from WIjdows on Arm in the past. In a lot of cases, it's faster than any current Intel processor, and on top of that, it's far more power efficient. You can get some insane battery life numbers from this laptop, withj our reviewer Rich Woods getting over 15 hours of battery life at one point. You also get up to 32GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD. Related To go along with the brand-new processor, Microsoft also gave the Surface Laptop 7 a completely new design. Both models are now smaller, and in the case of the 13-inch version, you even get a slightly larger 13.8-inch panel (while still being smaller than its predecessor). This change was long overdue, and to make things better, the screen has also been improved with a brighter panel and better color reproduction. For ports, the Surface Laptop 7 includes two high-speed USB4 connections, a USB Type-A port, a custom Surface Connect port, and a microSD card reader, plus a headphone jack. That's also an upgrade from previous models, and even without proper Thunderbolt, USB4 gives us capabilities that are almost identical (though external GPUs won't work here). Best business Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 Durable and reliablePowered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Eolite, the Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 delivers solid performance and excellent battery life in a chassis designed for professionals. It has the same excellent keyboard Lenovo is known for, and even the speakers are quite good.ProsQualcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip is fast and super efficientExcellent keyboard and a classic designPowerful speakers ConsDisplay in the base model isn't that brightIt has a lower tier of the Snapdragon X ELite compared to some other models Normally, you might expect to see a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon in this spot, but the company decided to go with the T14s to debut the new QUalcomm Snapdragon X Elite chip, and frankly,. that alone makes this the laptop to choose if you're looking for a business laptop. The Snapdragon X Elite chip in the Thinkpad T14s Gen 6 isn't the most high-end configuration available, but make no mistake, this is an excellent chip all the same, and it delivers more performance than its Intel rivals while also being much more efficient, resulting in an experience you can't really get on Intel-based laptops. It lasts over 14 hours on battery, according to our reviewer, who also said the laptop is \"perfect for mobile professionals\". Aside from the processor, you can also get up to 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. Related Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 (14\" Snapdragon) review: A near-perfect business laptop The Lenovo ThinkPad T14s Gen 6 has it all - great performance, long battery life, a comfortable keyboard, and potent speakers in a ultra-light chassis The model we reviewed came with the base display, which is a FUll HD+ IPS panel, and it could be a bit brighter and vibrant. But if you want that, you can opt for the stunning 2.8K OLED panel, which also comes with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate. If you want the best experience, this is absolutely the way to go, but it's not necessary if you're just using the laptop for work. The design is as classic ThinkPad as it gets, with the fully black chassis accented by some red highlights, including the iconic TrackPoint and the duplicate mouse buttons above the touchpad. Of course, it has military-grade durability certification, too, so this is a laptop that can last you a long time. And as more developers embrace Windows on Arm, it will probably be getting better over time, too. Best Windows tablet Surface Pro 11 Fast, efficient, and super portable$981 $1000 Save $19 The Surface Pro 11 isthe best Windows tablet on the market right now. Powered by a Snapdragon X Elite, it's both fast and efficient with great battery life, and it has a better display than ever, including a new OLED option. It's not the best Windows tablet now, it's the best Surface Pro ever.ProsSnapdragon X Elite makes it faster than ever while having great battery lifeIt's the best Surface Pro display everThe new Flex Keyboard is a big upgrade ConsWindows still isn't the best operating system for tablets As far as Windows tablets are concerned, no brand is as well-known as the Surface Pro, and for good reason. They've always been some of the best tablets you can buy, and with the Surface Pro 111, that's more true than ever before. Starting on the inside, the Surface Pro 11 comes with the brnad-new Snapdragon X series chips, with options for the Snapdragon X Plus or X Elite. No matter what you choose, you're getting a very powerful machine that can outclass a typical Intel PC in a lot of use cases. But more importantly, it's also much more efficient, so battery life is better than it's ever been on a Surface Pro. As our Editor-in-Chief Rich Woods put it in his review, \"it's truly exciting to see a Windows tablet with...tablet battery life\". Related But it doesn't stop there. This is also the best display Microsoft has ever used on a Surface Pro. Previous displays were good, but not super vibrant and very reflective. Now, Microsoft made it less glossy and you have an OLED option for the first time, which looks great. It's also a very sharp screen with a 120Hz refresh rate, so it's great all around. If you want to turn the Surface Pro 11 into a proper laptop, Microsoft has also introduced the Flex Keyboard. It's sold separately and pretty expensive, at $400, but it now gives you the ability to use it detached from the tablet, so you have a lot more flexibility. You can use it as a screen cover, but you can also push the screen back if you want to get some distance from your display. All in all, the Surface Pro 11 is a fantastic device that's easy to recommend to anyone wanting a Windows-powered tablet. We suspect it will remain that way for a long while to come. Best convertible HP Spectre x360 14 (2024) It's nearly perfect if you want more versatility$1000 $1450 Save $450 The Spectre x360 14, refreshed for 2024, gets a big performance bump thanks to Intel Core Ultra hardware. The webcam is now 9MP, the four speakers pump out quality audio, and the keyboard and touchpad are comfortable. It's topped off with a 2.8K OLED touch display with 120Hz refresh rate.ProsImproved performance (especially GPU) from Intel Core Ultra9MP webcam, quad speakers, great keyboard2.8K OLED touch display ConsDesign isn't as flashy as previous modelsProfessionals might want a more business-focused PC HP's Spectre series represents some of the most well-known Windows laptops, and the latest Spectre x360, available in 14- and 16-inch sizes for 2024, again demonstrates why this reputation sticks. It's a convertible laptop with plenty of versatility, put together with close attention to detail for a premium feel. Focusing on the smaller device, HP returned the display to 14 inches for this generation. The screen has a 2880x1800 (2.8K) resolution with OLED panel, allowing it to hit 100% sRGB, 95% AdobeRGB, and 100% DCI-P3 as tested in-house. This makes it suited to more specialized work like photo editing, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes it incredibly smooth. Related HP removed chassis accent colors for this generation, doing away with the silver strips around touchpad, frame, and hinges. It still has angled rear corners, where you'll find Thunderbolt 4 and 3.5mm audio ports. The laptop otherwise offers one other Thunderbolt 4 port and one USB-A 3.2 (Gen 2). Quad speakers pump out quality audio from the keyboard surround, and above the display is a 9MP webcam packed with features to make your video conferencing as smooth as possible. HP Spectre x360 14 (2024) Intel's new Core Ultra hardware is available in the Spectre x360 14, giving a bump to CPU performance and a big improvement to integrated GPU performance. In our HP Spectre x360 14 review, XDA Editor-in-Chief Rich Woods noted that it \"is an upgrade that actually allows you to do more with your PC than you could before.\" Battery life isn't phenomenal, but at about six or seven hours on a charge you can still head out without always needing to bring a charger. The Spectre x360 14 is arguably the best HP laptop on the market, and it's also our current favorite for most people. It has the most power we've seen so far in a 14-inch convertible, it has an outstanding keyboard, speaker setup, and webcam, and the 2.8K OLED touch display is a true beauty. We only wish there was an Arm-powered version. Best gaming laptop Acer Predator Helios 16 (2024) So much powerThe Acer Predator Helios is a very powerful gaming laptop with top-notch processors and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 GPU that can can handle any game without issues. It has lso an excellent display with a 250Hz refresh rate, perfect for the most demanding gamers.ProsIncredible performance from both the CPU and GPUExcellent display with a super smooth 250Hz refresh rateLovely design with plenty of RGB ConsFans get very loudBattery life is bad Gaming laptops need a lot more power than your average laptop, and the Acer Predator Helios 16 is more than happy to deliver on that front. It has all the performance you could want and an excellent display to boot, plus it looks cool. Starting with performance, we have a laptop with 14th-gen Intel Core HX-series processors, paired with up to an Nvidia geForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, which can use the full 175W of power it's designed for. You won't be hungry for power, and any and all games should run easily on this laptop without much sacrifice. In fact, our reviewer called it \"one of the most powerful and one of the best laptops of the year\", which is very high praise. You do get bad battery life as a result, but that's expected for a gaming laptop. If that's not enough to convince you, consider this: the Acer Predator comes with a 16-inch QUad HD+ display with a 250Hz refresh rate. That high resolution and refresh rate are frankly more than the laptop's power can deliver in most games, but if you have an esports title you want to play as smoothly as possible, this display delivers. And that's not even mentioning the excellent color reproduction, since the display covers 99% of DCI-P3 based on our measurements. A powerful laptop like this has to be big and bulky, so portability is a notable sacrifice, but you do get a striking design with a ton of RGB lighting making sure your laptop is going to turn heads if you use it in public.You also get plenty of ports, so there's very little to complain about here. Best for creators MacBook Pro (M3, 2023) So much performance with great battery life$1699 $1999 Save $300 Despite already having the best creator laptop on the market, Apple updated the MacBook pro for a second time in 2023 with the M3 family of processors, making the CPU and GPU even more powerful and efficient. The latest MacBook Pro is an absolutely fantastic machine for creative workloads, and it can last much longer on battery than any comparable Windows laptop.ProsApple M3 Pro and M3 Max processors are ideal for all kinds of content creationBattery life is fantastic thanks to the new 3nm Arm processorsStunning mini-LED display with up to 1600 nits of brightnessSix-speaker system makes for an excellent media experience ConsSome might not like the notchExpensive, especially with storage and RAM upgradesThe base M3 14-inch model isn't great for demanding workloads Apple was already way ahead of the pack when it comes to creator laptops, but that didn't stop the company from introducing even more powerful and efficient MacBook Pro models in late 2023 despite the previous models being less than a year old. XDA Senior Editor Ben Sin reviewed the MacBook Pro 16 (M3 Max) and mentioned that those with an M2 model likely won't see a need to upgrade. For everyone else, however, it's the go-to model. Related MacBook Pro 16 (M3 Max) review: Apple’s just flexing The 10-month old M2 Max MacBook Pro is still more powerful than 99% of laptops out there, then Apple released an upgrade with more graphical prowess The latest MacBook Pro models feature the M3 family of processors, and creators will want to focus on the M3 Pro and M3 Max versions. These processors are based on a new 3nm process, making them even more efficient than before, delivering unparalleled battery life while offering excellent performance for demanding workloads like video editing and 3D rendering. Of course, they're also faster than ever, particularly the M3 Max model, featuring a faster CPU and a totally new GPU with ray-tracing support. You also get more RAM than ever, with up to 192GB of unified memory, along with up to 8TB of storage. In terms of the display, the MacBook Pro comes with a 14.2-inch or 16.2-inch mini-LED panel, which are both fantastic. The screen has hundreds of individual dimming zones, delivering high contrast and brightness up to a whopping 1,600 nits, making for a terrific viewing experience. For this generation, the SDR brightness has also been increased to 600 nits, so visibility should be even better outdoors. The resolution varies depending on the size, but both are equally sharp, and to go along with that, you get a six-speaker system, resulting in one of the best media experiences on any laptop. The webcam is also a great 1080p sensor, though there's no facial recognition support. You can use Touch ID, though. The design of the MacBook Pro is fairly standard, being an all-metal laptop with a clamshell design and starting at 3.5 pounds (for the 14-inch M3 Pro model), which is reasonable considering how powerful it is. The M3 Pro and M3 Max variants also come in a new Space Black colorway, in addition to the classic Silver. As for ports, you get three Thunderbolt 4 connections, along with HDMI 2.1, a headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones, an SD card reader, and MagSafe 3 for charging. Best 16-inch Dell XPS 16 Dell's new XPS size looks greatDell's XPS 16 is the new best option for power users and pros who desire extra performance and a larger display. It's taking over for the XPS 17, and it's been redesigned to match the futuristic XPS 13 Plus look that was introduced a couple of years ago.ProsBeautiful displays with plenty of room to workLots of performance thanks to Intel Core Ultra CPUs and discrete Nvidia GPUsOverhauled futuristic design ConsVery expensive even for introductory models Part of Dell's 2024 overhaul of the XPS brand is a new 16-inch form factor. It's replacing the XPS 17 as the largest XPS laptop on the market, and it should remain the right choice for power users and pros who need extra screen real estate and power. It features the same seamless glass touchpad with haptics, capacitive touch function row, and near-gapless keyboard that we first saw on the XPS 13 Plus. Dell offers up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H CPU with 16 cores, up to 64GB of LPDDR5x-7467MHz RAM, and 4TB of M.2 PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage. Integrated Arc graphics come with all models, but you can also spec up to either a Nvidia RTX 4050, RTX 4060, or RTX 4070 Laptop GPU. The 16.3-inch display comes in two flavors, with an FHD+ resolution being the cheapest option. It has about 500 nits brightness, 100% sRGB color, maximum 120Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision, and an anti-glare finish. You can also upgrade to a touchscreen with UHD+ resolution. It favors 100% DCI-P3 color, up to a 90Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision, and an anti-reflective finish. Best budget laptop Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 (14-inch, AMD) Versatile and capable at a reasonable priceThe Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 is a versatile yet affordable laptop powered by AMD Ryzen 8040 series processors. Its convertible style means you can use it as a tablet or a standard laptop, and the high-end specs deliver strong performance across the board.ProsGreat performance with AMD Ryzen 8040HS series processorsSlim and durable design with MIL-STD--810H certificationComfortable keyboard ConsDisplay is a bit washed outSpeakers don't get loud enough As much as buying a new laptop is nice, the idea of spending over $1,000 on one is probably not that enticing to a lot of people. But if you're on a budget, there are still great laptops out there, and right now, the Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 is the one to get. Despite its low price, the Lenovo ideaPad 5 2-in-1 is packing the latest AMD processors with the Ryzen 8040HS series, which delivers great performance and battery life for day-to-day use. Our reviewer Sherri L. Smith found the top-tier model capable of handling even 65 tabs of Google Chrome and other apps open at the same time, but even the cheaper base model should be very good for just about anyone. Related Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 (14-inch, AMD) review: A sub-$1,000 powerhouse The Lenovo IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 (14-inch, AMD) swings for the fences with an alluring mix of power, endurance, and versatility And there's more good to it, too. We also found the keyboard on this laptop to be very comfortable to type on (as you'd expect from Lenovo), and the overall design is very sleek and durable. The screen and speakers aren't going to blwo your mind, but that's the kind of sacrifice you have to expect when buying a cheaper laptop. Rounding things out with ports, the Lenovo Ideapad 5 2-in-1 comes with two USB-C ports, two USB Type-A ports, HDMI, a microSD card reader, and a headphone jack. Wile yo don't get anything like Thunderbolt or USB4, you still have a lot of variety here, ensuring all your peripherals will work just fine. This is simply a great laptop on the cheap, so we highly recommending checking it out if you have a tigher budget. Choosing the best laptop for you These are all excellent laptops to choose from, and it's really just a matter of choosing what suits your specific needs and budget the best. Our top pick has to go to the Dell XPS 13 for a few reasons. For one thing, it's the only laptop available with both Intel Lunar Lake processors or the Qualcomm Snapdragon X Elite, and both of these are phenomenal processors with great performance and battery life unlike anything we've seen in the past. Having that choice makes it that much easier to pick this laptop up since you can just go with the version that suits you best. But any other option on this list is fantastic. Myself, I love a convertible or 2-in-1 PC, so something like the Surface Pro 11 would be one of my favorites, too. Best overall Dell XPS 13 (2024, Intel Lunar Lake) Performance, efficiency, and a beautiful design$1000 $1400 Save $400 Packed with Intel's new Core Ultra Series 2 processors, chip, the Dell XPS 13 is better than ever.

Whether you\u0026#39;re shopping for a new work partner, gaming laptop, or something in between, there\u0026#39;s a never-ending sea of options to browse through, so it can be challenging. We\u0026#39;ve reviewed a lot of laptops here at XDA, and to help you out, we\u0026#39;ve compiled the best ones into this list.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many factors to consider, including screen size, form, performance, and overall design. It\u0026#39;s not the same for everyone, either. The specs that make a great laptop for work don\u0026#39;t make a great one for gaming, and vice-versa. And while a gaming laptop can handle other kinds of tasks just fine, it will be very expensive and heavy. The choices we\u0026#39;ve rounded up below cover a good range of use cases, and we\u0026#39;re confident that you\u0026#39;ll find something that\u0026#39;s perfectly suited to your

It\u0026#39;s sold separately and pretty expensive, at $400, but it now gives you the ability to use it detached from the tablet, so you have a lot more flexibility. You can use it as a screen cover, but you can also push the screen back if you want to get some distance from your display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAll in all, the Surface Pro 11 is a fantastic device that\u0026#39;s easy to recommend to anyone wanting a Windows-powered tablet.

The screen has hundreds of individual dimming zones, delivering high contrast and brightness up to a whopping 1,600 nits, making for a terrific viewing experience. For this generation, the SDR brightness has also been increased to 600 nits, so visibility should be even better outdoors. The resolution varies depending on the size, but both are equally sharp, and to go along with that, you get a six-speaker system, resulting in one of the best media experiences on any laptop. The webcam is also a great 1080p sensor, though there\u0026#39;s no facial recognition support. You can use Touch ID, though.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe design of the MacBook Pro is fairly standard, being an all-metal laptop with a clamshell design and starting at 3.5 pounds (for the 14-inch M3 Pro model), which is reasonable considering how powerful it is. The M3 Pro and M3 Max variants also come in a new Space Black colorway, in addition to the classic Silver. As for ports, you get three Thunderbolt 4 connections, along with HDMI 2.1, a headphone jack with support for high-impedance headphones, an SD card reader, and MagSafe 3 for charging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv data-include-community-rating=\"false\" id=\"27e5-4d32-a78a4d010c2e\" data-nosnippet=\"\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=480\u0026amp;dpr=1\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=70\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=480\u0026amp;dpr=1\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=320\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=320\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=400\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=400\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=300\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=300\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\u003cimg width=\"831\" height=\"831\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"A transparent image of the Dell XPS 16\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dell-xps-16-1.png\"/\u003e \u003c/picture\u003e \u003c/figure\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eBest 16-inch\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch5\u003e Dell XPS 16 \u003c/h5\u003e\u003cp\u003eDell\u0026#39;s new XPS size looks great\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDell\u0026#39;s XPS 16 is the new best option for power users and pros who desire extra performance and a larger display.
