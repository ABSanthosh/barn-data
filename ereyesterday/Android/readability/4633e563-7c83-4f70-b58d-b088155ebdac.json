  "text": "While HTC might be out of the smartphone business for a number of years now, the company has continued to explore other modern consumer technologies including VR and XR as seen with its Vive products. With that in mind, Google recently acquired a part of HTC’s XR division for $250 million, including a non-exclusive license for HTC’s XR intellectual property, as per a press release from HTC. The transaction is expected to close in Q1 2025, which will undoubtedly be a big boost to Google’s strengthened focus on XR technology. Part of HTC’s official press statement reads: This agreement reinforces HTC’s strategy of continued development around the XR ecosystem, enabling a more streamlined product portfolio with a focus on platforms, greater operational efficiency and financial flexibility. HTC’s commitment to delivering innovative VIVE XR solutions such as the VIVE Focus Vision remains unchanged, with existing product lines and solutions to be supported and developed without interruption. Not too long ago, Google unveiled that it was hard at work developing new XR technology, which some see as a second attempt at its ill-fated Google Glass project from many years ago. While Google’s initial announcement hinted at a deep collaborative effort with Samsung, HTC’s work on its Vive products undeniably presented a perfect opportunity for Google to capitalize on an already-existing hardware and software portfolio.
