The iPhone 17 Air is also getting a bar, even if it only has one camera. The only model that's apparently not receiving the same treatment is the 'vanilla' iPhone 17.

Anyway, Google is apparently following mobile world rumors very closely, and so it's released a new ad making fun of Apple for copying it - of course implying that it did the camera bar concept first on its Pixels, without acknowledging that Apple's design for the Pros, while related in theory, is still quite different, and much more reminiscent of Poco phones from a while back than Pixels (aside from the iPhone 17 Air, that one is closer to a Pixel). But it's not Poco poking fun here, it's Google (excuse the pun). Take a look: This video is part of Google's long-running series of ads that anthropomorphize a Pixel and an iPhone and present them as friends. This is far from the cringiest one, by the way - Google can do much worse than this. The Pixel also fondly remembers that time when it launched Night Sight and then the iPhone \"coincidentally\" got Night Mode afterwards, and Magic Eraser followed by Cleanup, and finally - widgets, which have been in Android since the beginning and the iPhone took many years to receive.",
