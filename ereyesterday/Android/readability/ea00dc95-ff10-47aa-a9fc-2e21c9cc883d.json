But before we get to the sceneted box, a word on what's different between this green Pantone Shamrock Edge 60 and its blue Pro counterpart. The Edge 60 has the same display and camera system as the Pro, as well as the same IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance and MIL STD-810H compliance. However, the Edge 60 has a smaller 5,200mAh battery with slower charging (68W vs 90W, no wireless), a less-powerful chip (2.5GHz Dimensity 7300 vs 3.35GHz Dimensity 8350 Extreme), and one less button - the AI key on the Pro's upper left...",

But before we get to the sceneted box, a word on what's different between this green Pantone Shamrock Edge 60 and its blue Pro counterpart. The Edge 60 has the same display and camera system as the Pro, as well as the same IP68/IP69 water and dust resistance and MIL STD-810H compliance. However, the Edge 60 has a smaller 5,200mAh battery with slower charging (68W vs 90W, no wireless), a less-powerful chip (2.5GHz Dimensity 7300 vs 3.35GHz Dimensity 8350 Extreme), and one less button - the AI key on the Pro's upper left side. The Motorola Edge 60 comes in a scented box, packed with a color-matching hard case, a SIM eject tool, and a USB-C cable. You have a pick of a nylon-like Pantone Gibraltar Sea, a leather-like Pantone Shamrock, and a sandpaper-like Pantone Plum Perfect. There's also a choice of memory configurations - a 256GB with 8GB or 12GB of RAM, and a 12/512GB one. Just like the Pro, the Motorola Edge 60 is a quad-curved phone, which is refreshing in these flat-obsessed times. Simply put, Motorola phones of late feel special, and every other maker should take notice - make phones unique again! Just like the Pro, the Edge 60 has Motorola's sharpest and brightest screen yet. It's a 10-bit (1 billion colors) unit with a 120Hz refresh rate and HDR10+ support. It really leaves you wanting for nothing. The speakers are Dolby Atmos-tuned! That's all we have with the Moto Edge 60 for now! Motorola Edge 60 These are the best offers from our affiliate partners.
