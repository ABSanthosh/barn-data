  "text": "Sign in to your XDA account Network-attached storage (NAS) is not limited to simply storing files and backups, although that's precisely what you'll use the device for. These powerful servers can also run apps and services. Are you tired of paying out for Microsft 365? Run your own online collaborative tools, office apps, and email server. Ready to cancel Netflix? Fire up Jellyfin and create a media streaming platform for all your purchased content. You can even use the same NAS device to block advertisements and other unwanted elements. Here are some cool and interesting projects you can run on a NAS. 3 Creating your own Microsoft 365 Microsoft 365 and Google Drive are fantastic options for collaborative work but they're not self-host friendly. This is where Nextcloud can save you money by offering a fully self-contained instance that allows various clients to connect, store, and work using advanced office suites. With Nextcloud installed, you can store files and data as you would with Google Drive, accessing them even if your net disconnects. Opening up external access to Nextcloud isn't an issue either. With reverse proxies, DDNS, or a VPN, you can connect and work on projects even if you're away from the office or home. Although open-source, Nextcloud offers robust and extensive collaborative tools with AI features, security measures, and other points that rival paid solutions from Microsoft, Google, and others. Related How I built a Google Drive alternative on my NAS with Nextcloud If you don't really trust Google Drive, then you can build your own Google Drive alternative with Nextcloud and a NAS. 2 Run an emulator for all your devices Old games are fantastic and are still worth playing. Maintaining old consoles can prove challenging, especially since getting hold of genuine parts can range from impossible to taking apart other units. That's where emulation comes into play. Using an emulator on your NAS, you can stream a classic game on almost any device, so long as it has a web browser. The best part? Your NAS will handle all the heavy lifting. Whether you're into Sonic the Hedgehog on Sega Genesis or the earlier Pokemon titles on Gameboy, solutions such as EmulatorJS can run many classic games. And if you're on a mobile device, the emulator can even utilize the touch screen with on-display controls. It provides a way to centralize all your ROM storage and quickly get multiple clients up and running with little effort, perfect for LAN parties. Related How I turned my NAS into an emulator I could use anywhere Enjoy all my favorite classic games with nothing but a web browser. 1 Create a smarter home Your home is exactly \"dumb\" but even with smart gadgets, nothing talks to one another. You've probably got Philips Hue bulbs on an isolated network with its proprietary hub and a few different branded sockets, so how do you bring everything together? That's where Home Assistant can completely transform how you kit out your home. Home Assistant is incredibly powerful with various features that can take you from a mindset of smart homes being rather annoying and pointless to something you can truly rely on to improve your daily life. It's completely free and has hundreds of integrations with other ecosystems. With Home Assistant, you can control Philips Hue lighting, various smart plug brands, and even throw in your home heating system for good measure. The dashboard is handy with a whole manner of widgets and controls, making quick and convenient access possible with nothing but your smartphone and the official app installed. Related A beginner's guide to setting up Home Assistant Home Assistant is one of the best ways to tame your smart home, and it's free and easy to set up. It's okay to use your NAS for storing data A NAS device can do considerably more than stash files but this is still the cornerstone of network-attached storage. If all you want to do is back everything up from home devices and ensure you have a copy of sensitive data that isn't located somewhere in the cloud, a NAS is still worth considering. We've covered some more affordable options, such as two-bay enclosures from TerraMatser, Asustor, and other brands. Doing more with less is fantastic for some, but don't feel overwhelmed if all you need is a network drive with a few smart features.",

Maintaining old consoles can prove challenging, especially since getting hold of genuine parts can range from impossible to taking apart other units. That\u0026#39;s where emulation comes into play. Using an emulator on your NAS, you can stream a classic game on almost any device, so long as it has a web browser. The best part?

than stash files but this is still the cornerstone of network-attached storage. If all you want to do is back everything up from home devices and ensure you have a copy of sensitive data that isn\u0026#39;t located somewhere in the cloud, a NAS is still worth considering. We\u0026#39;ve covered some more affordable options, such as two-bay enclosures from TerraMatser, Asustor, and other brands. Doing more with less is fantastic for some, but don\u0026#39;t feel overwhelmed if all you need is a network drive with a few smart features.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
