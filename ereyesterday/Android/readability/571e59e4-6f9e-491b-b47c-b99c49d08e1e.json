The company has just announced this seemingly out of nowhere - last we heard anything about the OnePlus Watch 3, it was allegedly launching internationally alongside the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R in January. Needless to say, that never happened. But it will happen next week, and OnePlus isn't shy about showing us the Watch 3 in all its glory and in both of its colorways.

The company has just announced this seemingly out of nowhere - last we heard anything about the OnePlus Watch 3, it was allegedly launching internationally alongside the OnePlus 13 and OnePlus 13R in January.

The similarities to the OnePlus Watch 2 from last year are hard to ignore. The company promises that the Watch 3 will have up to five days of battery life in \"Smart Mode\" - that's full Wear OS for you. That sounds insane - or should we say, insanely good. But it's not a huge surprise, since the FCC already told us this device would have a 29% bigger battery than its predecessor. The Watch 3 has a titanium bezel and sapphire crystal face, and since the frame isn't mentioned we'll go ahead and assume it's stainless steel just like it was in the Watch 2. These are all the details that OnePlus has outed so far, but there's one more thing you need to keep in mind. If you register your details on the official website, you can save $30 or €30 off its price when it launches. And, in specific EU countries (see the list here), you can actually save €80. In the US, while you are saving less, you get a chance to win a OnePlus Pad 2 or a pair of OnePlus Buds Pro 3 for free.",
