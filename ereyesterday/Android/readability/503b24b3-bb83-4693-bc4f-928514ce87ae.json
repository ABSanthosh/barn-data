The OnePlus 13 dropped last week and should be arriving on doorsteps within days for those who ordered right away. If you jumped at this excellent phone from OnePlus (our review soon, I promise), you’ll want to be on the lookout shortly after setup for a big first update. An update showed up on our review unit this morning as build 15.0.0.402(EXO1) with a size of 1GB. It’s a pretty big first update that touches on the camera, connectivity, audio, general stability and performance, and a bunch of apps, including AI being added to Google Messages. Most of this stuff looks like bug fixes and polishing on the original release software, so you shouldn’t notice any major changes after. It’s still OxygenOS 15 and Android 15, but the stability of almost everything appears to be improved. Of course, we’re still putting together our review, have updated to this new build, and will continue testing in order to let you know. The update is live as you read this.
