Indeed, it packs some superior specs to the regular Razr 2025 in most categories. The SoC is a more powerful Snapdragon 8s Gen 3 with more RAM (12GB vs 8GB). It lacks an ultrawide but offers a 50MP 2x zoom instead. Both displays are better - the inner one has 165Hz refresh rate, while the cover screen is larger at 4 inches vs 3.6 inches. Where the Razr+ 2025 is below its counterparts is in the battery capacity - it's 4,000mAh vs the 4,500mAh on the vanilla and 4,700mAh on the Ultra. Our Razr+ 2025 features the Mocha Mousse paint job. There're also Hot Pink, Peach Fuzz, Spring Green, and Midnight Blue versions. There's a single 12/256GB config to choose from, and it ships with a USB-C cable. The Razr+ 2025 is $799 at the time of this article - down from $999. We've said it time and time again, but Motorola is truly in a league of its own when it comes to phone colors. The Razr+ 2025 looks unique. It feels great too, with a very grippy leather-like finish on the back panel. The hinge is perfectly weighed - not too firm, but it's not soft and vague. Top marks on hardware! Motorola Razr+ 2025 in Mocha Mousse There's also something to be said of Motorola's take on Android. Some of us would go as far as calling it the best Android skin there is, thanks to pixel-perfect scaling throughout the OS, and lovely visuals. On the other hand we need to mention a gripe we have with the Razr+ 2025. Its display came in a Neutral color profile by default, and it's lifeless - very desaturated and dull. Not a big issue, though - you can put the screen in a Vivid mode to rectify this. Interestingly, the Razr 2025 came in Vivid by default. Our review is underway so stay tuned!",
