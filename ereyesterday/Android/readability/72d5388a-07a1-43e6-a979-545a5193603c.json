Today the service actually released a dozen new features at the same time, so let's go through them one by one.

Second, you can choose to only receive Highlights from groups, which limits notifications to mentions, replies, and messages from saved contacts. Third, you can now create an event in a 1-to-1 chat, RSVP as \"maybe\", invite a plus one, add an end date and time for longer events, and pin an event in a chat. Fourth, you can tap someone else's reaction to react in the same way to a message. Fifth, you can scan and send documents directly from WhatsApp on iOS, with options to crop and save. Sixth, you can set WhatsApp to be your default messaging and calling app on the latest version of iOS in some places - just go to Settings \u003e Default and pick WhatsApp. Seventh, you can pinch to zoom in video calls on iOS. Eighth, you can add someone to an ongoing 1-to-1 call directly from a chat thread. Ninth, video calls are higher quality and more reliable, with quick jumps to HD quality if you have the bandwidth. Tenth, channel admins can now record and share short videos of 60 seconds or less with followers. Eleventh, you can get voice message transcripts for channels. And finally, twelfth, you can create a QR code that links directly to a channel if you are that channel's admin, so you can easily share it with others. Source",
