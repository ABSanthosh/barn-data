Netflix's latest hit series, “Secrets We Keep,” captivates viewers with its gripping portrayal of a Filipino au pair's disappearance in Copenhagen. Released on May 15, 2025, the show quickly topped Netflix's most-watched list. While the storyline itself is fictional, it shines a spotlight on very real social issues affecting au pairs in Denmark and across Europe. Fiction with roots in reality The Danish thriller “Secrets We Keep” introduces viewers to a tense narrative set in an affluent Copenhagen neighborhood. The story follows two determined women – Cecilie, a wealthy Danish mother, and Angel, her Filipino au pair – as they launch their own investigation into the mysterious disappearance of another young Filipino au pair. Created by Ingeborg Topsøe and directed by Per Fly, the series presents an entirely fictional narrative rather than being based on any specific real-life case. However, its compelling storyline draws heavily from documented societal issues facing foreign au pairs in Denmark. The show's power lies in its use of drama to illuminate systemic problems within the au pair program, particularly those affecting women from Southeast Asia who travel to Europe seeking better opportunities. As the investigation deepens, viewers witness the facade of order in these seemingly perfect homes crumble, revealing uncomfortable truths. Fiction ElementsReality-Based ElementsMain characters and plotWorking conditions of au pairsSpecific disappearance caseEconomic vulnerabilityIndividual family dynamicsReports of exploitation Documented struggles of Filipino au pairs While “Secrets We Keep” tells a fictional tale, it reflects well-documented realities. A 2016 Reuters investigation exposed how many Filipino women faced exploitative working conditions in Denmark, often working far beyond the legally mandated 30 weekly hours without appropriate compensation. Some even experienced sexual harassment from their host families. The Pulitzer Center published extensive investigations detailing these troubling patterns that same year. Despite the Filipino government temporarily banning the au pair program in 1998 following abuse reports, economic necessity drove many young women to continue pursuing these positions through agencies charging substantial fees. The hardships facing these women include: Excessive working hours without proper compensation Isolation in unfamiliar environments Language barriers limit the ability to seek help Financial obligations to families back home Limited legal protections in host countries Human trafficking connections and European regulations A particularly disturbing aspect highlighted in both the series and real-world research is the potential link between au pair programs and human trafficking. In 2010, the Danish Center Against Human Trafficking released a report titled “Au pair and trafficked?” which examined how certain recruitment practices resembled trafficking patterns, particularly targeting economically vulnerable women with inadequate protections. The European Union has worked to address these issues. In 2016, the European Parliament adopted a directive establishing a framework for entry and residence conditions for non-EU citizens coming for study, research, or au pair work. This legislation required member states to: Issue specific residence permits for au pairs Guarantee minimum rights, including accommodation Ensure adequate allowance payment Provide guaranteed rest periods Ensure access to healthcare France implemented this directive in March 2019 by creating the “jeune au pair” visa for candidates aged 18-30. The visa clarifies the ambiguous status of au pairs, who previously existed in a gray area between employee and guest, and limits stays to one year (renewable once). “Secrets We Keep” demonstrates how compelling fictional storytelling can be in bringing attention to real-world problems. By wrapping documented social issues in an engaging thriller format, Netflix has created a series that entertains and educates viewers about the vulnerabilities young women face in the international au pair system. The show's success highlights public interest in stories that blend entertainment with social commentary. Since its May 15 release, the series has remained among Netflix's top-performing international content, generating discussions about the treatment of domestic workers across Europe. The series is particularly impactful because it humanizes statistics and research findings through compelling characters and situations that viewers can connect with emotionally. This approach transforms abstract social issues into personal stories that resonate far more deeply than academic reports alone ever could. Previous Post",
