Windows-based PCs also have Copilot+. Now it looks like Samsung has new laptops that come with Galaxy AI. At CES 2025, Samsung has announced two new laptops – the Galaxy Book 5 Pro and the Galaxy Book 5 360. Both of these laptops come with Galaxy AI which should help enhance the overall user experience. This includes features like AI Select, which is similar to Google’s Circle to Search. Users can select an area that they are looking at and more information about it will be retrieved. Then there’s also Photo Remaster that helps retouch images and clean up blurry photos. In terms of actual hardware, both the Galaxy Book 5 Pro and Galaxy Book 5 360 are powered by the latest Intel Core Ultra CPUs. The laptops feature support for up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. The Galaxy Book 5 Pro is available in 14-inch and 16-inch options, while the Galaxy Book 5 360 is available in 15-inches only. The main difference is that the Galaxy Book 5 360’s display can be spun around turning it into a pseudo-tablet of sorts. Samsung says that both Galaxy AI-powered laptops will be available this February. Unfortunately, the company stopped on mentioning how much they will cost. A graphic novelist wannabe. Amateur chef. Mechanical keyboard enthusiast. Writer of tech with over a decade of experience. Juggles between using a Mac and Windows PC, switches between iOS and Android, believes in the best of both worlds.
