Whether you're a DC fan who loves becoming Batman or just a big fan of the adventures of the Marvel universe, there's something exciting for everyone in the superhero genre. Luckily, there have been a variety of big releases that have taken some of our favorite Marvel and DC superheroes to new heights, redefining how we view some of the greatest heroes of all time. But not everything has been good for fans of superheroes, as a few major projects were unexpectedly canceled. To some, that signifies a change that could lead to studios moving away from projects featuring some of the biggest comic book heroes. However, that couldn't be further from the truth. While the loss of games like Wonder Woman from WB Games and Black Panther from Cliffhanger Games are low points for fans, there are still plenty of games for superhero enthusiasts to look forward to. Players will still be able to get their superhero fix from a number of upcoming titles and current releases that are keeping things going strong. Don't count on video games hanging up the capes and cowls just yet. Here's why superhero games aren't going anywhere, despite a few major blows that rocked our universes. Related 3 big ways Marvel Rivals is the real Overwatch successor Marvel Rivals may be a true successor to Overwatch's audience. Here's why more people are playing it now more than ever. Marvel games are cooking So much happening in this universe If there's one universe of comic book heroes that is keeping things fresh and exciting for gamers, it's definitely the Marvel universe. And the best part about it is that it doesn't solely have to do with any of the Marvel Studios movie releases. There's a wide variety of video game releases currently available and upcoming, based on different Marvel properties, with a broad range of characters showcased. Fighting game fans who love the Marvel vs. Capcom series have something familiar coming from developer Arc System Works with Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, slamming multiple characters together from throughout the Marvel universe into a 4 vs. 4 fighter. It's a game with a unique sense of style for these superheroes, but it's definitely a great spiritual follow-up to a legendary series that Marvel fans have loved over the years. One of the most anticipated games for a while was the Black Panther game being made by Cliffhanger Games. Initially, multiple aspects of the Black Panther mythology were planned to be incorporated into the gameplay, including the choice of who would take on the mantle. But after the game was suddenly canceled, Marvel fans worried there wouldn't be another title to fill its place. However, many had forgotten that the upcoming Blade title being developed by Arkane Lyon was still in the works, originally announced back in December 2023. This third-person action game is set to reintroduce Blade to the public consciousness, while also bringing the world another major title with a black superhero lead, and highlighting the Marvel universe's underworld of vampires. While the Black Panther game would have had a similar impact following the popularity of the Marvel Studios films, there are a lot of people who love Blade as a character, which could lead to his game having a successful release on a similar level. Source: Cliffhanger Games But does that mean Black Panther is just forgotten after his game is canceled? Not at all, because the Black Panther is still part of the upcoming Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra. While it may not be the king of Wakanda that people commonly know, it's still part of the mythology of Black Panther in a way that is interesting to superhero fans. The game is being made by Skydance New Media and is set during the events of World War II, with Black Panther teaming up with Captain America against the forces of Hydra. So even with the Black Panther game being lost, we won't be missing out on the character whatsoever. Other Marvel game releases may or may not include the character at some point, such as titles like Marvel Cosmic Invasion from Tribute Games that include multiple heroes from throughout the universe. However, there's also what everyone is playing online right now: Marvel Rivals. This game made a huge splash on its initial release and has gone on to become a massive success. To many, Marvel Rivals filled a void left by other games, such as Overwatch 2 and Apex Legends. Hero shooters have become a popular genre, but many changes to the titles that were leading the charge were making players feel disenfranchised. Whether it was the balance changes or other factors outside the games themselves, people wanted to play something different. And when Marvel Rivals arrived on the scene, it instantly caught fire with fans. The game continues to find success through its many content updates, which add new content based on Marvel comic storylines and films by Marvel Studios. Related The 10 greatest NES superhero games, ranked Good superhero games were a rarity in the NES age, and these titles managed to stand above the rest. Meanwhile, over at DC The universe is shifting again While the majority of superhero games coming out are based on the Marvel universe, that doesn't mean the DC universe is stagnant. The biggest loss for fans was the cancellation of Wonder Woman, a game that Monolith Productions was developing. The game was canceled in the wake of shifts at WB Games, which led to three studios being shut down, and was reportedly set to utilize the Nemesis system that Warner Bros. once used for the Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor titles. However, changing priorities within the company led to the announcement that Rocksteady Games would be returning to the Batman Arkham series. Up until most recently, the only Batman-related game coming out was Batman: Arkham Shadow, a VR game for the Meta Quest 3 scheduled for release in 2025. Having the studio go back to making Batman Arkham games seems like the best move since each of the three releases from Rocksteady Games were so popular, despite games such as Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League not doing as well upon release. Without the voice talents of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, it's hard to say if a new Rocksteady Batman game will have the same level of success as before. For now, superhero fans will just have to wait and see what happens. Other heroes incoming What's outside the big two Source: Skybound Games Luckily for fans of superhero games, there will be upcoming releases that involve the two biggest comic book publishers in the industry. One franchise thathas become extremely popular is the Invincible comics, which is set to receive a 3-on-3 fighting game for all platforms in 2026. Invincible VS, much like the Marvel vs. Capcom series, brings together characters from the comics and animated series into a big fighting game. The announcement of the game came from the June Xbox Games Showcase, which highlighted the fast-paced nature of the fighting, as well as how crazy combos can get. Main characters like Mark, Atom Eve, and others from the comics and animated show are announced, but it's expected that even more will make an appearance in the game. Fans who love the show will be pleased that the voices for each character are performed by the actors from the show, adding another layer of authenticity to the game. While many would be quick to dismiss Invincible VS as a quick Marvel vs Capcom clone, the brutality and mature nature of the series on full display makes it stand apart from it. The three-character teams and swapping mid-round might be similar, but Invincible VS will have a very different tone in comparison. Between this and Marvel Tokon: Fighting Spirits, there will be no shortage of brawling for superhero fans looking to get into a new fighting game. Superheroes aren't going anywhere Superhero games are stronger than ever right now, given how much there is to look forward to and enjoy at the moment. While Marvel Rivals continues to make Marvel fans hyped for what new additions the game will see next, all the newer projects in development coming over the next year show that superheroes aren't going anywhere. Things may be heavy on the Marvel side of things, but DC Comics fans will eventually be getting their fix as well, with the promise of new games coming down the line in the wake of recent cancellations. There's definitely no shortage of heroics to be had and adventures to go on in video games. Fans will be fighting, shooting, and bursting their way through villains with their favorite superheroes for quite a long time.

Fighting game fans who love the \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/crossovers-want-fighting-games/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMarvel vs. Capcom\u003c/em\u003e series\u003c/a\u003e have something familiar coming from developer Arc System Works with \u003cem\u003eMarvel Tokon: Fighting Souls\u003c/em\u003e, slamming multiple characters together from throughout the Marvel universe into a 4 vs. 4 fighter. It\u0026#39;s a game with a unique sense of style for these superheroes, but it\u0026#39;s definitely a great spiritual follow-up to a legendary series that Marvel fans have loved over the years.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOne of the most anticipated games for a while was the \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/em\u003e game being made by Cliffhanger Games. Initially, multiple aspects of the Black Panther mythology were planned to be incorporated into the gameplay, including the choice of who would take on the mantle. But after the game was suddenly canceled, Marvel fans worried there wouldn\u0026#39;t be another title to fill its place. However, many had forgotten that the upcoming \u003cem\u003eBlade\u003c/em\u003e title being developed by Arkane Lyon was still in the works, originally announced back in December 2023. This third-person action game is set to reintroduce Blade to the public consciousness, while also bringing the world another major title with a black superhero lead, and highlighting the Marvel universe\u0026#39;s underworld of vampires. While the \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/em\u003e game would have had a similar impact following the popularity of the Marvel Studios films, there are a lot of people who love Blade as a character, which could lead to his game having a successful release on a similar level.\u003c/p\u003e    \n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n

Not at all, because the Black Panther is still part of the upcoming \u003cem\u003eMarvel 1943: Rise of Hydra\u003c/em\u003e. While it may not be the king of Wakanda that people commonly know, it\u0026#39;s still part of the mythology of Black Panther in a way that is interesting to superhero fans. The game is being made by Skydance New Media and is set during the events of World War II, with Black Panther teaming up with Captain America against the forces of Hydra. So even with the \u003cem\u003eBlack Panther\u003c/em\u003e game being lost, we won\u0026#39;t be missing out on the character whatsoever. Other Marvel game releases may or may not include the character at some point, such as titles like \u003cem\u003eMarvel Cosmic Invasion\u003c/em\u003e from Tribute Games that include multiple heroes from throughout the universe.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eHowever, there\u0026#39;s also what everyone is playing online right now: \u003cem\u003eMarvel Rivals\u003c/em\u003e. This game made a huge splash on its initial release and has gone on to become a massive success. To many, \u003cem\u003eMarvel Rivals \u003c/em\u003efilled a void left by other games, such as \u003cem\u003eOverwatch 2 \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eApex Legends. \u003c/em\u003eHero shooters have become a popular genre, but many changes to the titles that were leading the charge were making players feel disenfranchised. Whether it was the balance changes or other factors outside the games themselves, people wanted to play something different.

out are based on the Marvel universe, that doesn\u0026#39;t mean the DC universe is stagnant. The biggest loss for fans was the cancellation of \u003cem\u003eWonder Woman\u003c/em\u003e, a game that Monolith Productions was developing. The game was canceled in the wake of shifts \u003cspan\u003eat WB Games, which led to three studios being shut down, and was reportedly set to utilize the Nemesis system that Warner Bros. once used for the \u003cem\u003eMiddle Earth\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cem\u003e: Shadow of Mordor\u003c/em\u003e titles. However, changing priorities within the company led to the announcement that Rocksteady Games would be returning to the \u003cem\u003eBatman Arkham\u003c/em\u003e series.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eUp until most recently, the only \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/best-batman-games/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBatman-related game\u003c/a\u003e coming out was \u003cem\u003eBatman: Arkham Shadow\u003c/em\u003e, a VR game for the Meta Quest 3 scheduled for release in 2025. Having the studio go back to making \u003cem\u003eBatman Arkham\u003c/em\u003e games seems like the best move since each of the three releases from Rocksteady Games were so popular, despite games such as \u003cem\u003eSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League\u003c/em\u003e not doing as well upon release. Without the voice talents of Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, it\u0026#39;s hard to say if a new Rocksteady \u003cem\u003eBatman\u003c/em\u003e game will have the same level of success as before.

Luckily for fans of superhero games, there will be upcoming releases that involve the two biggest comic book publishers in the industry. One franchise that\u003cspan\u003ehas become extremely popular is the \u003cem\u003eInvincible\u003c/em\u003e comics, which is set to receive\u003c/span\u003e a \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/the-5-most-influential-fighting-games-of-all-time/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e3-on-3 fighting game\u003c/a\u003e for all platforms in 2026. \u003cem\u003eInvincible VS\u003c/em\u003e, much like the \u003cem\u003eMarvel vs. Capcom\u003c/em\u003e series, brings together characters from the comics and animated series into a big fighting game. The announcement of the game came from the June Xbox Games Showcase, which highlighted the fast-paced nature of the fighting, as well as how crazy combos can get. Main characters like Mark, Atom Eve, and others from the comics and animated show are announced, but it\u0026#39;s expected that even more will make an appearance in the game.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFans who love the show will be pleased that the voices for each character are performed by the actors from the show, adding another layer of authenticity to the game. While many would be quick to dismiss \u003cem\u003eInvincible VS\u003c/em\u003e as a quick \u003cem\u003eMarvel vs Capcom\u003c/em\u003e clone, the brutality and mature nature of the series on full display makes it stand apart from it. The three-character teams and swapping mid-round might be similar, but \u003cem\u003eInvincible VS\u003c/em\u003e will have a very different tone in comparison. Between this and \u003cem\u003eMarvel Tokon: Fighting Spirits\u003c/em\u003e, there will be no shortage of brawling for superhero fans looking to get into a new fighting game.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch3 id=\"superheroes-aren-39-t-going-anywhere\"\u003e\n            Superheroes aren\u0026#39;t going anywhere\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-superhero-nes-games-ranked/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSuperhero games\u003c/a\u003e are stronger than ever right now, given how much there is to look forward to and enjoy at the moment. While \u003cem\u003eMarvel Rivals\u003c/em\u003e continues to make Marvel fans hyped for what new additions the game will see next, all the newer projects in development coming over the next year show that superheroes aren\u0026#39;t going anywhere. Things may be heavy on the Marvel side of things, but DC Comics fans will eventually be getting their fix as well, with the promise of new games coming down the line in the wake of recent cancellations. There\u0026#39;s definitely no shortage of heroics to be had and adventures to go on in video games. Fans will be fighting, shooting, and bursting their way through villains with their favorite superheroes for quite a long time.\u003c/p\u003e            \n    \n                    \n
