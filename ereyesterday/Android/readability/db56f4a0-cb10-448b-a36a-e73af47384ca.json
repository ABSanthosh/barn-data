But did you know you can also add your passport to your digital wallet, creating an ID pass from it that you can use at various locations, including TSA checkpoints in the U.S., for domestic travel?

ID passes do not support international travel, but they should work with TSA security for domestic travel within the U.S. at selected supported airports.Which airports does this include? See the list linked above, but note that this includes select locations within each state, such as the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas, the Los Angeles International Airport in California, both John F. Kennedy International Airport and LaGuardia Airport in New York, and others.The feature is also only available in the U.S. for now, but it’s possible we may see it expanded to other countries passports and locations in the future.Users are required to have an Android phone with OS 9.0 or higher and must have Bluetooth and Nearby devices on in order for it to work. It’s crucial that you set a screen lock in order to use this feature as well, which is an added security measure.You can’t link your passport to an existing ID pass on Google Wallet. You will need to create a new one. But once you do, you’ll love the convenience of having an ID that’s accepted in certain places to confirm your age and country of residence. The best part is that virtually all of the best Android phones support Google Wallet.Finally, if you decide you no longer want to have a digital version of your passport in Google Wallet, select your ID pass in Google Wallet, select More (the three vertical dots), and select Remove and Remove again. You can also do this remotely at myaccount.google.com. Go to your Personal Info, select IDs, Manage IDs, find and select the passport, select Delete, and then confirm the deletion a second time. google pixel 9Google Pixel 9 OK to payThe Google Pixel 9 is one of the latest in the Pixel line-up and one of many Android phones that support Google Wallet.
