According to the analysts, the ongoing replacement cycle was the main driver from July to September as the competition became tighter than ever. Samsung remained on top, but barely kept its first place for Q3, as Apple had the same market share when the percentage was rounded to the whole number. Xiaomi, Oppo, and vivo rounded the Top 5, but all eyes were on Apple, as the US company achieved its highest third-quarter volume. There was a strong demand for the iPhone 15 and the new devices that are expected to get Apple Intelligence any time this month. Still, the major reason for the uptick in Apple shipments was the market shift towards premium devices. The iPhone 16 performance is expected to help Apple again become the leading smartphone company in Q4 and keep the momentum in H1 2025 once it expands its AI features to more markets like Europe and China, which will have to wait a bit. The market looks healthy going into the the shopping holiday season, with Diwali in India on October 31, Singles' Day in China on November 11 (11.11), Black Friday in late November, and, of course, Christmas at the end of the year.
