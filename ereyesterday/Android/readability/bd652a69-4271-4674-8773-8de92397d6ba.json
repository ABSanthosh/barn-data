The hype surrounding the Nothing Phone (3) is a blend of design obsession and high expectations for a brand finally stepping into flagship territory. The phone is supposedly their first true competitor with Samsung's S series and other high-end brands. At least, it's the closest they have come. A major leak from Gadget Bits on X has recently spilled most of the specifications ahead of the official reveal. Here’s everything we know to be potentially true about Nothing’s next phone. Major (yet unconfirmed) leaks for Nothing 3 The Nothing Phone (3) will feature a 6.7-inch 1.5K OLED LTPO display and use the Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 instead of the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen Elite chip. Battery life is expected to be 5150mAh battery with 100W wired charging, along with wireless and reverse wireless support.  Nothing OS 3.5 will come pre-installed, running on Android 15, with an overhauled Home UI that reflects Nothing’s unique visual identity and minimalist design language. The phone will also receive five major Android version updates and seven years of security patches. https://twitter.com/gadget_bits/status/1936265386384937425 In practical terms, you can expect it to get up to Android 20 as part of its update cycle. That would take you through to around 2030 with the latest features, assuming Google continues its one-version-per-year release cycle. Image: Gadget Bits / X The leak also points to a triple rear setup with a 50MP main, 50MP periscope lens with 3x zoom, and a 50MP ultrawide plus a 50MP front-facing camera. A closer look at the blurred camera image shows the three rear cameras in a triangular layout. The periscope lens is the new addition here and is something previous Nothing phones in this lineup didn't have.  Nothing switches Glyph Interface with dotted matrix system One other thing Nothing has changed on the Phone 3 is its iconic glyph design on the back. The Glyph Interface you once knew has now been replaced with the Glyph Matrix system. It's a next-generation evolution of Nothing’s distinctive rear LED system.  In the previous Phone 1 and Phone 2 devices, the Interface used a series of white LED strips arranged in geometric shapes on the back of the phone. These strips are lit up in patterns for notifications, charging status, volume indicators, and ringtones to give your phone a glanceable, screen-free interaction style. Image: Nothing The Phone (3)  introduces a customizable dot matrix-style LED grid, located in the upper-right portion of the phone’s back. Many fans are not going to like this dramatic alteration, given that the initial design was among the main reasons people were fascinated with the phones in the first place.  It’s not to say that Nothing fans are moths drawn to flashing lights and ready to torch their wallets for a phone that merely glows. But the first layout did spread across the phone’s back and commanded attention. The spatial distribution meant that each part of the light system was not only expressive but functional. You could clearly tell whether your phone was charging, what volume level you were at, who was calling, or how much time remained on a timer without flipping the device. Nothing 3 is coming soon Nothing Phone 3 will launch on July 1st and the rumored pricing for the leaked features brings mixed sentiment. Pricing may fall between $799 and $899, depending on configuration. If the latter is true, then the brand is clearly pushing the Phone (3) toward a market it isn't ready for. People expect more than a new camera layout and better charging speeds. As one commenter bluntly put it, the phone doesn’t “seem flagship in any way” just because of the camera count or specs on paper. Image: Nothing That said, these are still unconfirmed leaks and nothing is set in stone. The final product could end up looking or behaving differently. It’s also worth noting that the brand has a history of controlling the narrative cleverly. Carl Pei is no stranger to hype-building through leaks, cryptic tweets, and well-timed teasers. We'll just have to wait for an official announcement to clear the fog. Irene is an experienced writer with five years' experience in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
