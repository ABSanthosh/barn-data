Despite this, the Saturn had plenty of standout titles that never got the attention they deserved. Unfortunately, these games would never achieve true PlayStation levels of Fame. Which is unfortunate, because some of these Saturn games were as good, if not better, than some of the most beloved PlayStation titles. Related 5 Panzer Dragoon Saga Epic RPG on rails Developed by Team Andromeda, Panzer Dragoon Saga took the fast-paced, on-rails dragon shooting of the earlier games and added deep RPG mechanics. Inspired by the rising popularity of Final Fantasy, the developers packed the game with cinematic cutscenes, branching dialogue, and a more fleshed-out world. Sadly, Panzer Dragoon Saga launched right at the end of the Saturn’s life, meaning hardly anyone got to experience it. However, the game could have easily bested some of the most popular PlayStation titles at the time. Due to a bad launch window, along with Sega’s shrinking market share, it was doomed to obscurity. Panzer Dragoon Saga Released January 29, 1998 Publisher(s) Sega Enter the world of Panzer Dragoon Saga and experience a game like no other: a fusion of classic Panzer action with the most technologically advanced RPG to come to Saturn. 4 Burning Rangers Futuristic firefighter fantasy Source: Sega Possibly the rarest game from the Sega Saturn era. Burning Ranger is a 1998 action game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. You control one of two new recruits of an elite group of firefighters. Your goal is to enter buildings, fight robots, rescue civilians, and extinguish fires. Many critics praised Burning Rangers for having some of the best graphics in the console's entire library. The only problem is that Sega had barely produced any copies of the game. At the time, Sega was putting most of its team to work on the upcoming Sega Dreamcast. Sega's pivot to the Dreamcast put a lot of strain on their development teams, leading to many gamesshipping unpolished or being canceled entirely. Burning Rangers could have been an incredibly popular game if Sega had just paid more attention to it. Burning Rangers Released February 26, 1998 Burning Ranger is a 1998 action game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. You control one of two new recruits of an elite group of firefighters. Your goal is to enter buildings, fight robots, rescue civilians, and extinguish fires. 3 Dragon Force Massive-scale strategy Dragon Force is a real-time strategy game developed by Sega’s own internal team of developers. The game was the first true strategy game on the Saturn and became many gamers' first introduction to the genre. You could control armies and march them across the map to siege castles and parley with knights and lords along the way. The game's graphics were great for the time, and the mechanics were actually pretty good. But as is still the case, strategy games just really struggle to sell on consoles in general. Most strategy games are designed with a keyboard and mouse in mind and a controller as an afterthought. While the game played well on the Saturn, the genre was already dominated by games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Command \u0026 Conquer on the PlayStation, offering Dragon Force little chance of making a real name for itself. Dragon Force Dragon Force is a real-time strategy game developed by Sega’s own internal team of developers. The game was the first true strategy game on the Saturn and became many gamers' first introduction to the genre. 2 Last Bronx Weapons-based 3D fighter The Saturn had a strong reputation for 2D fighters, but it often struggled with 3D games when compared to the PlayStation. 3D games looked much better on the PlayStation, which gave the Sega Saturn a bad image by comparison. But Sega wasn’t ready to give up on its fighting game legacy just yet. Last Bronx seemed to be Sega’s way of proving to everyone that the Saturn could also have great 3D fighting games. Last Bronx was a 3D fighting game designed for Sega arcade cabinets and was later ported over to the Sega Saturn. The game ran really well, and the addition of hand-to-hand weapons with physics-based combat made it an instant cult classic. While the gameplay was solid, many players at the time weren’t convinced Sega could deliver a good 3D fighter, and the game sadly flew under the radar despite its quality. The most vicious of gang warriors are looking for blood in the streets of Tokyo. They're coming armed to the teeth with a body count in mind and if you lose this battle, you leave in a bag. The only rules are no rules, so get pumped and be prepared. 1 Dark Savior Genre-blending ambition Dark Savior was an incredible game that didn't get nearly enough attention when it was released on the Sega Saturn. On the surface, it looks like a simple action platformer game, but it hides a clever mechanic: your actions and speed affect the story’s direction. Finishing sections quickly or discovering hidden routes unlocks entirely new story arcs, with unique enemies and objectives. Due to the sheer number of possibilities, the game had almost unlimited replayability. But despite its creative design and memorable art style, it really didn’t get the attention it deserved at launch. Dark Savior Put on your thinking caps and prepare to battle I fierce enemies! Assume the role of 0l Carian, a sword-wielding warrior in search of his escaped prisoner, Bilan. Discover hidden treasures as you explore 30 amazing environments while navigating through a series of mind-melting puzzles! These games were cult classics The Sega Saturn may not have been able to compete with the PlayStation’s raw popularity, but it still had its fair share of unforgettable exclusives. These games might not have achieved PlayStation levels of fame, but for those who played them, they remain timeless classics.
