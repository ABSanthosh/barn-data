  "text": "If you were looking for an action-filled hack-and-slash platforming game for mobile devices—without insane IAPs and gacha—then you might want to check out Ubisoft’s Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown. Launched back in 2024, the game is now available for mobile devices running on Android and iOS. READ: The Future of Android Gaming: What to Look Forward To A paid app, the game includes a free trail version that will only require you to pay for the full price, which will be on sale for just ten bucks up until May 5. Originally a console game, the title has been reworked for touchscreens, and will also be compatible with physical mobile controllers. More importantly, it can also be played offline. The Lost Crown brings back the franchise to its side-scrolling roots, and adopts a very Metroidvania-inspired approach to gameplay. Players step into the shoes of Sargon, who must battle his way through different bosses and enemies to rescue a royal hostage.",
