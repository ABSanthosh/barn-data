The biggest addition is Material 3 Expressive, an improved version of Material You that brings more customization and personalization options. If you are wondering what else is new in Android 16, we are here to help you out. Google has already released the Android 16 stable update for compatible devices. Check out these new Android 16 features you should be aware of. Live Updates for Notifications Google is introducing live updates for select app notifications. It will offer real-tracking updates in the notification bar and on Always On Display. This will eliminate the need to open the app repeatedly. This is similar to Apple’s Dynamic Island available on modern iPhone models. Google says live updates will be available initially with supported food delivery and ride-sharing apps. App-based Notification Grouping Notification management is also getting better with Android 16. Google will now group notifications from a single app. This will improve notification organization and make it easier to manage them. Advanced Protection Advanced Protection is a new Android 16 security feature meant to protect users against online attacks, harmful apps, unsafe websites, scam calls, etc. When activated, it will ensure all major Android security features are enabled. It can securely keep a device log, which is accessible only to the user. It can also be used for forensic analysis if the device is suspected of being compromised. Desktop Windowing Google has collaborated with Samsung to develop desktop windowing for Android 16. It will allow users to get a desktop-like user experience on large-screen devices like tablets and foldables. The new mode will let users open, resize, and move multiple app windows on a single screen. This is in addition to the existing single app and split-screen modes. Desktop windowing will become available later this year on compatible devices. Clearer Calling for Hearing Devices Google has worked on offering a clearer calling experience in Android 16 to hearing aid users. The new version will allow users to switch to the phone’s microphone for a clearer voice in noisy environments. It is further adding native control for hearing aids, like adjusting volume. Hybrid Auto Exposure Hybrid auto exposure on Android 16 is a feature that caters to advanced photography users. It will give users the flexibility to manually adjust ISO and exposure while the algorithm takes care of the rest. Google is further bringing precise color temperature and tint adjustment, and Ultra HDR image support in HEIC format.
