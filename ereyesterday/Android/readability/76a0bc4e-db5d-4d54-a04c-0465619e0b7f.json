After nearly a decade of working on the game however, it looks like the studio has decided that it’s time to move on, following a massive surprise announcement. READ: Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket brings the collectible card game onto mobile More specifically, Niantic has confirmed that it is selling its videogame business to Scopely, a studio known for games like Monopoly GO! for mobile devices. The Saudi-owned developer will acquire Pokemon Go (and a number of other Niantic titles) for a sum amounting to $3.5 billion, alongside $350 million of cash from Niantic, totaling to $3.85 billion for Niantic equity holders. It’s also reported that other games originally developed by Niantic such as Pikmin Bloom and Monster Hunter Now are likewise part of the deal. Part of a statement from Pokemon GO team lead Ed Wu reads: I believe that Pokémon GO can continue to thrive with Scopely’s exclusive and long-term focus on game-making. Scopely’s status as a private company also means we can prioritize what’s best for you, our Trainers, for the long term. We believe that prioritizing short-term gains at the expense of our long-term mission would be counterproductive and self-defeating. Every interaction I’ve had with Scopely leaders has reinforced that we are in total agreement that the scale, longevity and most of all, real world community, of Pokémon GO make it truly special. We are united in protecting that. Scopely has likewise echoed a similar sentiment, stating that its partnership with the Niantic games team will enable the folks at Niantic to “achieve their exciting long-term goals” designed with players in mind.
