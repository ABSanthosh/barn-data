You don't have to be a materialistic person to encounter things that you want or need, but simply can't afford. I mean, I'd love a Millennium Falcon Lego set, but who has the money for that right now? I think that's the precise reason why services like Klarna exist, allowing you to buy things right now, but pay the full price for them much later. While that seems clear enough, what I do find a little bit confusing is why Klarna, a flexible payments company, has decided that it needs a piece of the mobile market. My confusion doesn't matter, though. The company has decided to launch its first unlimited mobile plan in the US, with expansion to select other countries in due time. Klarna Has Unveiled Its First Mobile Plan in the United States Image: Klarna It seems everybody wants to get their hands on a mobile plan with their name on it. Earlier this week, it was the surprising launch of Trump Mobile. This time around, though, arguably more surprising, is Klarna, the “Buy Now, Pay Later” platform. Yep, Klarna has decided that it is time for it to jump into the carrier space. Klarna is now an MVNO, with a plan that runs on AT\u0026T's network. While the company only has a single plan at the moment, there's no telling how lofty its goals are for itself. You'll be able to get a new number (an eSIM, activated instantly) or transfer your existing number to Klarna's network via its app. Over 25 million people in the US use the Klarna app, so that's not a negligible potential user base. It remains to be seen how many of them will choose to leave more established carriers for Klarna. Image: Klarna The question that you might have is, what exactly do you get from Klarna's plan? After all, there are so many other MVNOs out there that you can choose from, like Google Fi, Mint Mobile, and Total Wireless. Well, here's a quick glance at some of the value Klarna's pioneer plan will offer. Klarna Mobile PlanMonthly Price$40NetworkAT\u0026T (5G)Data AllowanceUnlimited; UncappedUnlimited Talk and TextYesActivation/Cancelation FeesNone Klarna's Mobile Plan Will Make Its Way to Europe Later This Year, Along With Other Plans Image: European Council While Klarna's start might seem relatively modest, with just a single plan in a single market on offer, the newly-birthed carrier has bigger plans than just that. Klarna is already planning to expand its service to the European market, with the UK and Germany before the end of the year. Those won't be the only stops either, as the company's press references “other markets”, though it is hard to guess which those might be. On top of that, we will also see extra plans launch later this year, as the company mentions that premium and international plans are going to roll out later. Generally, it looks like Klarna is here to stay. It plans to leverage the ease of setting up with them, whether you're starting afresh or transferring a line over.
