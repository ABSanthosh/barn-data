I even remember owning a pair of headphones which at the time came with rather basic functions and a simple design, vastly different from the Bose QCs and Sony XM5s that we see today. READ: JLab unveils its new Epic Open Sport and new Pods earbuds lineup It’s this kind of nostalgic feeling that JLab is trying to bring back with the Rewind2, a pair of over-ear headphones that are pretty much dialled-back in terms of design, while managing to integrate some newer features that are found on newer headphones models. Priced to be affordable, are they worth it though? Let’s take a look. Design and Durability In terms of looks, the JLab Rewind2 headphones are as simple as they come—the brand clearly set out to achieve a look and feel that instantly brings you back to decades ago, and it manages to do just that. The Rewind2 doesn’t come with massive earcups as seen on tons of other headphones these days, but instead comes with smaller earpads (which can be swapped out for a different color) and a more “skeletal” appearance with an exposed metallic headband. As a result, they’re lightweight and are easy to carry around. With that being said though, I’m not too keen on the Rewind2’s durability, as the thinner frame does mean that you can’t simply throw these into a backpack full of other items. They probably wouldn’t instantly break, but the exposed cables on the sides and slim headband probably won’t appreciate being tossed and turned around without any sort of additional carry case or protection. One issue I did have however is that the earcups didn’t feel too comfortable on my ears especially when compared to other headphones with full-ear coverings, and the headband felt a bit too short for me even when fully extended. There’s also no option for 3.5mm connectivity, which might be an issue for some users. Usage and Sound Quality As with most other wireless Bluetooth headphones, the Rewind2 is pretty easy to set up. There’s a single button on one side that functions as a power button and Bluetooth pairing key, and you can also double-tap on the button to summon Google Assistant or Siri, or triple-tap to instantly change between a handful of different EQ profiles. A single tap functions as a play and pause button. You can also further customize the sound of the headphones via the JLab app for Android and iOS, and even download OTA updates for the Rewind2. There are some missing features though such as wear detection, although the headphone’s price does mean that there will be compromises. Sound quality is mostly decent, although it could be louder overall. I did appreciate the fairly-impressive bass presence, and given that it lacked the full-cover design of most headphones on the market this was impressive. On the other hand though, you’re missing out on functions like active noise cancelling, and while the Rewind2 manages to drown out a lot of sounds around me, it still lacks audible noise cancellation, and I find that I had to occasionally adjust the earpads for optimal sound. Battery life is one of the main highlights of the Rewind2, with JLab advertising more than 20 hours of playtime on a single charge. This will of course vary depending on your usage, but in general it should be able to last you most commutes or even a transatlantic flight. One issue though is that the charging port is a bit hard to get to, and you’ll have to slightly lift the earpad when charging the headphones. Final Thoughts The JLab Rewind2 manages to shine when it comes to battery life, a fairly eye-catching retro design, as well as a straightforward usage and setup experience. JLab has managed to visually capture an iconic era of audio technology with these headphones, which will most likely appeal to buyers after this particular exact kind of aesthetic. JLab has managed to visually capture an iconic era of audio technology with these headphones, which will most likely appeal to buyers after this particular exact kind of aesthetic. On the other hand, the lack of other features such as active noise cancelling, 3.5mm wired connectivity, and the awkwardly-located charging port might be issues for some users. For a price that’s less than 30 bucks however, these limitations are somewhat understandable.
