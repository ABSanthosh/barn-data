We've since found out, courtesy of Samsung's teasers, that the Edge will also differ on the rear, where it will house just two cameras vs. the S25+'s three. The omission of an extra sensor could be why it's actually thinner than originally anticipated. According to Geekbench, the S25 Edge will be getting the full Snapdragon 8 Elite experience, not the seven-core CPU chipset that recently surfaced. And if that pans out, then expect heavy throttling to account for the lack of internal space for heat dissipation. Samsung Galaxy S25+ These are the best offers from our affiliate partners.
