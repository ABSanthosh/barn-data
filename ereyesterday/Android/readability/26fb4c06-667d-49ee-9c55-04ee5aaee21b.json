Artificial Intelligence features are all the rage these days and vivo has now detailed all of the AI features found in FunTouch OS 15. AI Erase kicks off the photography-related AI features, allowing users to remove unwanted elements from their photos. The feature is implemented in the Edit section of the Albums app. AI Live Cutout is another useful trick that allows users to isolate subjects and items from photos via a long press. AI Photo Enhance enhances blurry or otherwise flawed shots by enhancing clarity, colors and facial details of subjects in the shot. Circle to Search is baked into FunTouch OS 15 and allows users to search for anything on their screen by drawing a circle around it. AI Call Translation is built into the vivo Dialer app. The feature can be activated from the three-dot menu inside the Dialer app, where you select your language and the one for the person on the other line. The next time you receive a call, AI Call Translation will appear on the phone screen and it will automatically inform the person on the other end that the call is being recorded and translated. AI Screen Translation offers real-time translation of on-screen content. It requires an active internet connection and can be accessed via the built-in Screen translation tool. AI Transcript Assist is baked into the Recorder app and will automatically convert audio recordings into text. You’ll also get transcript summaries and keyword searches. AI Live Text offers Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which can extract text from images and screenshots. The extracted text will then be copied to your clipboard and can be shared with other apps and services. AI Note Assist helps organize your unstructured notes in bullet-point form. You also get quick summaries, extraction for to-do items and translations for text. Source",
