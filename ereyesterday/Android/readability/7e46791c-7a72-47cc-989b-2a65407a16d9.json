Galaxy Z Fold6 features Samsung's fourth generation UD selfie cam That shouldn’t come as a surprise given that Samsung is rumored to be the primary display supplier for Apple’s foldable. The main display is said to feature a crease-less design, which was a big priority for Apple. The foldable iPhone will also get a 5.49-inch cover screen with a 2,088 x 1,422 px resolution. The front panel is said to feature a punch hole cutout for its selfie camera. These core specs were also previously confirmed by tipster Digital Chat Station earlier this week.
