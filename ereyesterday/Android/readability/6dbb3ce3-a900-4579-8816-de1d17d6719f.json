  "description": "According to sources close to Bloomberg, Apple is working on an AI-powered battery-saving feature for its upcoming iOS 19. The feature will work based on the user's usage habits and optimize things in the background to extend battery life. The AI will learn from users' behavior on the fly and reduce power consumption by optimizing apps in the background depending on the time of day. Apple is reportedly already training the AI using data collected from people's iPhones, so the system has a general idea of users' usage habits.

The feature will work based on the user's usage habits and optimize things in the background to extend battery life. The AI will learn from users' behavior on the fly and reduce power consumption by optimizing apps in the background depending on the time of day. Apple is reportedly already training the AI using data collected from people's iPhones, so the system has a general idea of users' usage habits. After a while, the AI will adapt to the specific user's patterns. Many Android smartphone OEMs have implemented the feature in the past, but it has never leveraged AI and a large data pool. So, it will be interesting to see how it will work on iOS. Some believe Apple is implementing this feature to maintain adequate battery life on its upcoming iPhone 17 Air, if that's going to be the name, of course. Since the device will be extremely thin, the battery size will probably be pretty small, so Apple thinks it can compensate by introducing software smarts. We might see our first glimpse of the battery life feature during this year's WWDC in June. Source",
