Poco X7 leaked imageThe X7 gets a 50 MP main camera with OIS and 2x in-sensor zoom and a 20 MP selfie snapper. Moving over to the Pro, this will be powered by the just-unveiled MediaTek Dimensity 8400 chipset, with the \"Ultra\" suffix added by Xiaomi to make it sound even better. Poco X7 Pro leaked imageThis phone has the same screen size and refresh rate, but is advertised to go up to 3,200 nits of peak brightness and to have 2,560 Hz touch sampling rate. The Pro's main camera is also 50 MP with OIS, and f/1.5 aperture. It uses Sony's IMX882 sensor and supports 4K video recording at 60fps with dual OIS and EIS stabilization. The Poco X7 Pro has Gorilla Glass 7i on top of its screen and the same IP68 dust and water resistance rating, as well as a 6,000 mAh battery with support for 90W fast wired charging (zero to 100% advertised to take 42 minutes). The Poco X7 Pro runs HyperOS 2, and is likely to be a rebranded Redmi Turbo 4, a device that is launching in China very early next month and will be the world's first smartphone to use MediaTek's Dimensity 8400, which is the first SoC with an all big core CPU in the upper-midrange segment.
