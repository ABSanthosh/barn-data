With that in mind, the OnePlus Nord N30 5G is certainly a tempting offer at the moment, with up to 70 bucks off from its usual retail price. While the N30 is an entry-level device, it does pack a decent set of features for the a relatively low price tag. The phone comes with a large 6.7-inch display with a smooth 120Hz refresh rate which makes it ideal for web browsing, movie streaming and games, a 108-megapixel main camera with additional sensors, a large 5,000 mAh battery with 50W fast-charging support, and Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 695 chipset.
