This resulted in Apple agreeing to open up iPadOS to third-party app stores in the EU in May, emulating what it had initially done with iOS. The EU granted Apple a six-month period to comply with all the DMA regulations for iPadOS, and that has expired on October 28.

The EU antitrust watchdog said: \"The Commission will now carefully assess whether the measures adopted for iPad OS are effective in complying with the DMA obligations. The Commission's assessment will also be based on the input of interested stakeholders.\" Regarding iPadOS, the DMA requires Apple to allow users to set whatever default web browser they want, allow alternative app stores, and allow headphones and smart pens to access iPadOS features. If a company is found to be breaching the DMA, it can be fined as much as 10% of its global annual turnover, which for Apple would mean many, many billions. Hence why it's so far been quick to try and appease the EU on such matters.",
