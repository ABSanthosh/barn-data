READ: OnePlus 13T quietly redefines what a compact flagship can be With that in mind, if you were one of many hoping to get your hands on the 13T, then you might be disappointed—OnePlus has officially confirmed that it will NOT be launching the smartphone in Western regions, including North America and Europe. Speaking to the folks over at The Verge, OnePlus Europe’s Chief Marketing Officer Celina Shi clarified the 13T’s lack of availability outside of China: …currently, we have no plans to launch the OnePlus 13s in Europe. That being said, we have noted the interest in the product from our European users, and we will keep it in mind as we make product launch decisions going forward. This sentiment was echoed by OnePlus’ North American Division, with Head of Marketing Spenser Blank confirming pretty much the same situation for the US and Canada. The 13T’s launch marked a return to smaller smartphones for OnePlus, which has mostly launched handsets with larger displays for the past several years. READ: Wear OS Fans, Rejoice—OnePlus Lowers the Price of the Watch 3 Once Again In any case, we’re keeping our fingers crossed that the company changes its mind about the 13T. Until then, you’ll have to import it via third-party resellers (with tariffs in the mix as well). A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well.
