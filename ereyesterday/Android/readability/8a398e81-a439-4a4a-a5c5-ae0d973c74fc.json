It’s clear that the company is banking mostly on the phone’s looks to entice fans and potential switchers to add it to their collection. READ: Best Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge cases Take a look beyond all the hype however, and there’s something about the Galaxy S25 Edge that feels somewhat… lacking. Samsung wasn’t exactly clear about which features it’s removed in order to get the S25 Edge as slim as possible, but a quick comparison to the rest of the S25-series phones shows that you’re probably better off avoiding the S25 Edge. One Less Camera One notable change that Samsung has made with the Galaxy S25 Edge is its camera setup, which features two sensors instead of the usual triple-camera system on the “standard” Galaxy S25 models. This consists of a high-resolution 200MP main camera, which is accompanied by a 12MP ultrawide lens and 12MP selfie camera. With that being said, it’s clearly a less-versatile setup—if you’re the kind of smartphone user that values top camera performance, you’ll definitely want to stick to a device like the S25 Ultra instead, which comes with a proper telephoto camera, and allows for a bit more variety in terms of mobile photography. A Smaller Battery Another major point of consideration with the Galaxy S25 Edge is its battery capacity. Unlike Chinese smartphone brands which have managed to fit large batteries into newer phones thanks to silicon-carbon technology, Samsung has instead opted for a standard lithium ion cell within the S25 Edge, which comes with a measly 3,900 mAh capacity due to an emphasis on slimming things down. …even the standard Galaxy S25 features a 4,000 mAh cell—heck, the iPhone 16e features a larger battery as well For context, even the standard Galaxy S25 features a 4,000 mAh cell—heck, the iPhone 16e features a larger battery as well—and given the more power-hungry Snapdragon 8 Elite chip within the S25 Edge, we’re not too confident about the device’s endurance, especially if you’re going to use it for intensive apps and tasks. Charging is also slower at 25W, which pales in comparison to what rival brands such as Oppo and OnePlus are doing, for example. Performance Concerns There’s zero doubt about how powerful the 8 Elite chipset is, and it’s only fitting that Samsung has kept it inside the S25 Edge. The company adds that it’s also equipped the phone with a dedicated cooling solution via a built-in vapour chamber, which should help with heat dissipation especially during gaming sessions and such. That in mind however, its slimmer vapour chamber does lead us to question how it will affect the phone’s overall performance, as its slimmed-down design does somewhat force a different approach to how the phone will be able to perform under pressure. It’s Too Expensive For a smartphone that comes with a considerable amount of downsides, Samsung has priced the Galaxy S25 Edge at $1,099, making it more expensive than the Galaxy S25 and S25 Plus. Considering what you’re missing out on, you’d really have to be a fan of slim smartphones to justify this asking price—of course if you don’t really care about some of the stuff that we’ve mentioned here, then by all means go and get this phone. But then again, it’s simply too much compromise for too much cash.",
