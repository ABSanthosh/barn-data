A sale rolls around, and we go shopping through our wishlists of games we have never heard of but are willing to try. However, in the midst of it all, in an age where we have more games than ever before, there's still something comforting about certain studios. You see their name on a trailer and immediately exhale, because chances are you're in for something truly special. A game that feels deliberate and well-crafted, with a studio behind it that truly cares for quality and takes their time, is rare. And when you find studios that have done that consistently for decades, barely slipping up along the way? Those deserve to be celebrated. Related 11 of the greatest AAA single-player games ever created The greatest single-player games ever made — genre-defining, unforgettable stories that will stay with you forever. 5 Sucker Punch Productions have truly never made a bad game I'm still waiting for that InFamous x Prototype crossover, though, Sony Before they became a household name, Sucker Punch Productions made Rocket: Robot on Wheels — a criminally underrated gem on the Nintendo N64 that I only truly appreciated after revisiting it via RetroArch. Admittedly, it does come dangerously close to something like Banjo Kazooie in level design, but it also does that in charm, and its physics-based puzzles feel like they were ahead of their time. Then came Sly Cooper, and the first game alone secured Sucker Punch's legacy. A beautifully animated 3D platforming franchise that went only from strength to strength and improved with each entry, Sly Cooper remains one of the few gaming franchises that really never missed a beat throughout their entire run. The Infamous series then followed, and for many of us, those games defined a generation. The karmic choice system, the superpowers, and Cole's city-spanning arcs felt like living out a comic book fantasy, and I'd still argue that Infamous Second Son is just as enjoyable a superhero game on the PS4 as 2018's Spider-Man. Finally, there came Ghost of Tsushima, which stunned the world through its visuals, emotional narrative, and unforgettable setting. It's the kind of game that will be called timeless a decade from now, and there are only three months before Ghost of Yotei comes out in October 2025, ready to stun the world again and deliver on the promise of a true next-gen experience. I have no doubt that it will only make the Tsushima formula bigger, bolder, and more beautiful than ever. Ghost of Yotei Systems Released October 2, 2025 Developer(s) Sucker Punch Publisher(s) Sony Interactive Entertainment Prequel(s) Ghost of Tsushima Number of Players Single-player PS5 Release Date October 2, 2025 Related These 5 upcoming games needed the GTA VI delay — and they got it With games getting pricier, gamers are prioritizing their purchases, and GTA VI not releasing this year gives these 2025 games a fighting chance. 4 CD Projekt Red has never failed to deliver The studio may have stumbled along the way, but they've risen back There aren't a lot of studios that have pulled off what CD Projekt Red has — technically and tonally, both. The youngest of all studios on this list, CDPR kicked things off with 2007's The Witcher being their first game. Look, I'll admit that The Witcher is a brutally complex RPG that is very tough to play today (I speak from experience). However, it's a foundation worth respecting, jank and all. The Witcher 2 made things significantly more accessible, yes, but it was also a top-quality game, evident from its 50+ awards. It was with The Witcher 3 that CDPR truly became a household name. The Witcher 3 was their most accessible game yet, and it became a global phenomenon. The entire open-world RPG landscape changed, thanks to The Witcher 3, and the Polish studio didn't stop at the base game, either. Both Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone are two of the greatest DLC expansions of all time, setting the bar high for expansions in both scale and soul. Of course, we're now coming to Cyberpunk 2077. Yes, we all know the launch story, about how the game's unfinished launch tarnished the studio's legacy. But set the noise aside, and what remains today, as the finished product, is one of the best open-world games of all time, period. Cyberpunk's writing, atmosphere, and design are all masterclass-level achievements, and Phantom Liberty only continued the studio's habit of creating only the best DLCs. With all the dust settled now, it's clear that the studio has only made one amazing game after the other, and there's not a sliver of doubt in my mind that the fourth Witcher game is only going to follow suit. Related 5 reasons you should start over with Cyberpunk 2077 Cyberpunk 2077 definitely got off to a rough start, but after four years, it is an absolute masterpiece that demands multiple playthroughs. 3 Naughty Dog has been on a generational run since the PS3 era Well before Uncharted, Crash and Jak were tearing up the scene with one n.sane game after another Well before Crash Bandicoot ever spun onto the scene, Naughty Dog made some obscure games for the Apple II, including Keef the Thief in '89, which, frankly, is hilarious to revisit today through DOSbox. Of course, with '96, everything changed, and Naughty Dog became the trendsetter, especially for Sony's Playstation. Crash became their 3D platforming mascot and an era-defining force. With the PS2, the studio only went from strength to strength, making the second PlayStation all about the Jak and Daxter era, where each game that succeeded the last received rave reviews across the board. A friend recently bullied me into playing Jak X: Combat Racing, and it amazed me how underrated that game felt. Naughty Dog clearly knows how to do genres well. Everybody knows, however, that it was the PS3 and PS4 eras that made Naughty Dog the industry-leader that they are today. The first Uncharted game, all the way back in 2007, made the world go gaga about a wet pair of jeans, and its follow-up, Among Thieves (my favorite entry in the franchise), showed the studio blending gameplay with cinematic setpieces like nobody's business. A Thief's End remains one of the best blockbuster games of all time, and a pristine example of what the medium can achieve when it comes to storytelling. The Last of Us came and significantly changed the medium in lasting ways, and say what you will about The Last of Us Part II, but the game, despite its pacing issues, perfected the stealth action-adventure formula. It remains one of the most marvelous feats of writing and identity subversion the medium has to offer. With Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet set to take to the galaxies soon, I believe Naughty Dog deserves all the credit for their stellar games so far, and while I may have my reservations about the game, I'm willing to give it a sincere chance, because so far, in my book, this studio really hasn't stunk up the joint. Related Let it go — We don't need a The Last of Us Part III The Last of Us told a complete, painful, beautiful story. It’s time to let Ellie, Joel, and Abby rest for good. 2 The world has loved every game Remedy Entertainment put out All gas, no brakes for the Max Payne remakes and Control II Remedy came onto the scene in 1997, with Death Rally, a polished top-down racer that felt like Micro Machines with a shiny coat of paint. They also made a remake for mobile in 2011, and as a thirteen-year-old on summer break who'd just learned to root his Android (courtesy XDA forums), I played the remake, not knowing it was from the same guys who made the Max Payne games. Of course, Remedy wasn't going to remain in the kiddie pool for long, and Max Payne was their coming-of-age moment. With Max Payne, they changed the game, delivering state-of-the-art graphics and a bullet-time mechanic that, to this day, puts a wide grin on anyone's face. Max Payne 2, of course, only made things better, and it remains one of the rare AAA romantic tragedies that looks like it belongs on a weathered stage in Elizabethan times, provided you replace swords with Berettas and bodices with bloodstained trenchcoats. With Alan Wake, Remedy entered a new genre, and began to display confidence through their whacky writing and out-of-the-box ideas, and by god it stuck. 2016's Quantum Break, developed by Remedy and published by Microsoft, was a mechanically solid, narratively impressive title that pushed boundaries, and did suffer from it at the hands of critics. However, it remains one of the best third-person shooters out there today, and I'm willing to die on that hill. It may not be a direct part of the timeline due to legal reasons, but with 2019's Control and the wonderful Alan Wake 2, Remedy has been doing the impossible — and succeeding. They've created a massive, interconnected universe that spans the multiverse and is as meta as they come. In all my years of gaming, I've never seen something quite like this attempted, which is really the biggest compliment I can give the folks over at the Finnish studio. With Remedy, we aren't talking about a solid catalog alone — what we have here is a shockingly consistent studio that has never been afraid to be weird and bold, and as a result, has become utterly unforgettable.

Seriously, try naming a truly bad Rockstar game, and you won't be able to. Midnight Club II? That game basically paved the road for what GTA driving feels like today. I remember choosing GTA V with the first-person view over The Crew 2 just because I wanted a cockpit-view driving experience to calm my nerves during finals, and it worked. Manhunt, Oni, The Warriors, Bully, L.A. Noire, and the Red Dead series — these have all become cult classics that are held in reverence because Rockstar made sure that each one of these titles would set a new standard in quality and gameplay. The entire time, from their first-ever game in '99 — Grand Theft Auto — Rockstar Games have been re-writing the industry standards with their open-world crime sim. From revolutionizing 3D open-worlds with GTA III, to creating a gargantuan online adventure in the form of GTA Online that has been going on for well over a decade now, Rockstar's GTA franchise has never failed to thrill audiences and critics alike. With Rockstar, you're not buying into a new game alone — you're buying into decades of barely ever missing a beat, and it's why they will always belong on this list.

These studios have made quality feel dependable That's about as rare in 2025 as a game that ships without a day-one patch. A great game can come from anywhere. But great game after great game? That's a much taller order. These studios earned the trust of hundreds of thousands of players by making their logo alone a reason for gamers to show up. Many play it safe in an industry largely averse to risk, but even then, some of the biggest studios continue to make quality feel dependable. That's about as rare in 2025 as a game that ships without a day-one patch. Gaming",

\n\u003cp\u003eBefore they became a household name, Sucker Punch Productions made \u003cem\u003eRocket: Robot on Wheels \u003c/em\u003e— a criminally underrated gem on \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/this-open-source-n64-cart-allows-you-to-play-games-loaded-off-of-flash-storage/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Nintendo N64\u003c/a\u003e that I only truly appreciated after revisiting it via RetroArch. Admittedly, it does come dangerously close to something like \u003cem\u003eBanjo Kazooie \u003c/em\u003ein level design, but it also does that in charm, and its physics-based puzzles feel like they were ahead of their time. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThen came \u003cem\u003eSly Cooper\u003c/em\u003e, and the first game alone secured Sucker Punch\u0026#39;s legacy. A beautifully animated \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/the-best-3d-platformers-you-can-play/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e3D platforming franchise\u003c/a\u003e that went only from strength to strength and improved with each entry, \u003cem\u003eSly Cooper \u003c/em\u003eremains one of the few gaming franchises that really never missed a beat throughout their entire run.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eThe \u003cem\u003eInfamous\u003c/em\u003e series then followed, and for many of us, those games defined a generation. The karmic choice system, the superpowers, and Cole\u0026#39;s city-spanning arcs felt like living out a comic book fantasy, and I\u0026#39;d still argue that \u003cem\u003eInfamous Second Son \u003c/em\u003eis just as enjoyable a superhero game on the PS4 as 2018\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003eSpider-Man\u003c/em\u003e. Finally, there came \u003cem\u003eGhost of Tsushima\u003c/em\u003e, which stunned the world through its visuals, emotional narrative, and unforgettable setting.

However, it\u0026#39;s a foundation worth respecting, jank and all. \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 2\u003c/em\u003e made things significantly more accessible, yes, but it was also a top-quality game, evident from its 50+ awards.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eIt was with \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 3\u003c/em\u003e that CDPR truly became a household name. \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 3\u003c/em\u003e was their most accessible game yet, and it became a global phenomenon. The entire \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-rpg-games-from-last-decade/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eopen-world RPG landscape changed\u003c/a\u003e, thanks to \u003cem\u003eThe Witcher 3\u003c/em\u003e, and the Polish studio didn\u0026#39;t stop at the base game, either. Both \u003cem\u003eBlood and Wine\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eHearts of Stone\u003c/em\u003e are two of \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/greatest-dlc-expansions-ever/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe greatest DLC expansions\u003c/a\u003e of all time, setting the bar high for expansions in both scale and soul.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOf course, we\u0026#39;re now coming to \u003cem\u003eCyberpunk 2077\u003c/em\u003e. Yes, we all know the launch story, about how \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/cyberpunk-2077-reason-happy-game-delayed/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe game\u0026#39;s unfinished launch\u003c/a\u003e tarnished the studio\u0026#39;s legacy. But set the noise aside, and what remains today, as the finished product, is one of the best open-world games of all time, period. \u003cem\u003eCyberpunk\u003c/em\u003e\u0026#39;s writing, atmosphere, and design are all masterclass-level achievements, and \u003cem\u003ePhantom\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eLiberty \u003c/em\u003eonly continued the studio\u0026#39;s habit of creating only the best DLCs. With all the dust settled now, it\u0026#39;s clear that the studio has only made one amazing game after the other, and there\u0026#39;s not a sliver of doubt in my mind that \u003ca

Crash became their 3D platforming mascot and an era-defining force. With the PS2, the studio only went from strength to strength, making the second PlayStation all about the \u003cem\u003eJak and Daxter\u003c/em\u003e era, where each game that succeeded the last received rave reviews across the board. A friend recently bullied me into playing \u003cem\u003eJak X: Combat Racing\u003c/em\u003e, and it amazed me how underrated that game felt. Naughty Dog clearly knows how to do genres well.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eEverybody knows, however, that it was the PS3 and PS4 eras that made Naughty Dog the industry-leader that they are today. The first \u003cem\u003eUncharted \u003c/em\u003egame, all the way back in 2007, made the world go gaga about a wet pair of jeans, and its follow-up, \u003cem\u003eAmong Thieves\u003c/em\u003e (my favorite entry in the franchise), showed the studio blending gameplay with cinematic setpieces like nobody\u0026#39;s business.\u003cem\u003e A Thief\u0026#39;s End\u003c/em\u003e remains one of the best blockbuster games of all time, and a pristine example of what the medium can achieve when it comes to storytelling. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Last of Us\u003c/em\u003e came and significantly \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/important-games-that-changed-gaming-forever/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echanged the medium\u003c/a\u003e in lasting ways, and say what you will about \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-review/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Last of Us Part II\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, but the game, despite its pacing issues, \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/grounded-difficulty-best-way-play-last-of-us/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eperfected the stealth action-adventure formula\u003c/a\u003e.

With \u003cem\u003eMax Payne\u003c/em\u003e, they changed the game, delivering state-of-the-art graphics and a bullet-time mechanic that, to this day, puts a wide grin on anyone\u0026#39;s face. \u003cem\u003eMax Payne 2\u003c/em\u003e, of course, only made things better, and it remains one of the rare AAA romantic tragedies that looks like it belongs on a weathered stage in Elizabethan times, provided you replace swords with Berettas and bodices with bloodstained trenchcoats. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eWith \u003cem\u003eAlan Wake\u003c/em\u003e, Remedy entered a new genre, and began to display confidence through their whacky writing and out-of-the-box ideas, and by god it stuck. 2016\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003eQuantum Break\u003c/em\u003e, developed by Remedy and published by Microsoft, was a mechanically solid, narratively impressive title that pushed boundaries, and did suffer from it at the hands of critics. However, it remains one of the best third-person shooters out there today, and I\u0026#39;m willing to die on that hill. It may not be a direct part of the timeline due to legal reasons, but with 2019\u0026#39;s \u003cem\u003eControl \u003c/em\u003eand the wonderful \u003cem\u003eAlan Wake 2\u003c/em\u003e, Remedy has been doing the impossible — and succeeding.
