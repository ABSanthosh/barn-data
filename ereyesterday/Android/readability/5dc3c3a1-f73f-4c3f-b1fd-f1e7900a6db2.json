The Glyph Interface has evolved into the Glyph Matrix – a monochrome LED display located at the top right corner of the phone’s back. Comprised of 489 individually lit LEDs, it opens up a new dimension of notifications and utilities. The dot-matrix style screen shows incoming notifications like caller ID, app-specific messages, animations and system status info. As is the norm with Nothing, there's an element of customization with the ability to assign custom icons to contacts and watch faces. Nothing is also bringing Glyph Toys – a set of gimmicks “micro-experiences” that include Glyph Mirror, Solar Clock, Stopwatch, Battery Indicator and games like Spin the Bottle. You can toggle between different modes on the Glyph Matrix via the dedicated Glyph Button. Speaking of the back, it looks even more polarizing than previous Nothing phones thanks to its asymmetrical layout. There’s a trio of 50MP cameras, headlined by the 1/1.3\" main sensor with OIS. Nothing also brought a 70mm equivalent 50MP periscope (1/2.75” sensor) with 3x optical zoom and telemacro capabilities, allowing you to shoot objects from 10cm distance. The third shooter is a 114˚ 50MP ultrawide lens. Phone (3) is built around a 6.67-inch AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution and a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate. The panel maxes out at 4,500 nits peak local brightness, and it’s paired with uniform display bezels and 2160 PWM dimming for a flicker-free experience. You also get a 50MP selfie cam and an embedded fingerprint scanner. Nothing went with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 8s Gen 4 chipset, which is paired with 12/16GB RAM and 256/512GB storage. Elsewhere, Phone (3) packs a 5,150mAh silicon-carbon battery with 65W wired and 15W wireless charging. It also gets IP68 ingress protection – a first for the brand. The software side is covered by Nothing OS 3.5, based on Android 15. Nothing confirmed the OS 4.0 update based on Android 16 is coming later this quarter. Nothing is pledging 5 years of Android updates and 7 years of security patches. Nothing Phone (3) comes in black and white colors. The 12/256 GB version will retail for $799/€799/£799/₹79,999, while the 16/512 GB model is going for $899/€899/£899/₹89,999. Pre-orders start on July 4, while first sales are scheduled for July 15. The device will be available from nothing.tech and partnering retailers.",
