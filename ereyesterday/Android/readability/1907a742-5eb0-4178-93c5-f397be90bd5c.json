With that in mind, it looks like Google has finally taken notice of the complaints with the January 2025 update for Pixel devices. READ: The Pixel 9 Pro XL has a Serious Screen Issue According to Google, the update fixes the flashing line problem for Pixel 9 series devices in addition to several other issues, including themed icon colors with the Pixel launcher, audio delay and stability, and issues when using a connected camera. The update is available for several Pixel devices including the Pixel 6 series, Pixel 7 series, Pixel 8 series, and the Pixel 9 series devices, as well as the Pixel Fold and Pixel tablet. Just recently, Google announced that it would be pushing out an update for the discontinued Pixel 4a, albeit with a possible effect on battery life. With that said though, the company is offering users affected by the update compensation via store credit. Users can check out the new update by heading into Settings \u003e System \u003e Software Updates \u003e System update.
