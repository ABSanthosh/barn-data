Take for example the newly-launched Pixel 9a, which stays at its $499.99 launch price for Verizon customers. READ: Pixel 9a Crushes the iPhone 16e in Every Way That Matters With that in mind, Verizon is offering several deals on the Google Pixel 9a—the phone will be available in Obsidian and Iris colors for $13.88 per month over 36 months with 0% APR, which equates to a retail price of $499.99. For a limited time, new Verizon customers can get the Pixel 9a for free by opening a new line on any myPlan, with no trade-in required. Additionally, customers switching to Verizon can access plans as low as $30 per line per month with four lines on the Unlimited Welcome plan and Auto Pay (plus taxes and fees). Verizon is also providing a 3-year price lock on all myPlan and myHome network plans, as well as free satellite texting, although the price guarantee applies only to the base monthly rate. Meanwhile, Business customers can also take advantage of an offer to get the Pixel 9a at no cost with a select data plan and device payment purchase agreement. Verizon customers can also choose Google One AI Premium as a perk on their myPlan (mobile) or myHome (internet) plan for a discounted rate of $10 per month, which is half the usual price of $19.99. This perk includes access to Gemini Advanced, 2 TB of storage, and other Google benefits. READ: Meet the Google Pixel 9a: Here’s What You need to Know!
