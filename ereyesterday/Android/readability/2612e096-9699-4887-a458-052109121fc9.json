  "text": "Over the years, we’ve seen how developers and publishers have created versions of PC or console games for mobile. More often than not, we get a somewhat “dumbed down” experience. If you’re a fan of Capcom’s Monster Hunter franchise, then there’s an upcoming mobile version of the game that you should definitely keep an eye out for. This upcoming title is called Monster Hunter Outlanders. Note that this isn’t the first time we’ve seen a Monster Hunter title make its way onto mobile. Prior to this, there was the release of Monster Hunter Now. However, that game felt a bit like Pokemon Go, which shouldn’t be surprising as it came from Niantic, the same company behind Pokemon Go. But if you want the full-fledged Monster Hunter experience on your phone, then this is what Capcom seems to be promising with Monster Hunter Outlanders. The game will feature an open-world map and will allow players to play either solo or in hunting parties of up to four players at once. The game doesn’t have a release date yet, but the company is recruiting players to do some play tests ahead of its release. If you’re interested in being part of these play tests, you can register your interest via its website. In the meantime, you can check out the game’s announcement trailer in the video above.",
