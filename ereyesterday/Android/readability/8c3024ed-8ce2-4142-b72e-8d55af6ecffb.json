  "text": "Anker 25W USB-C Charger $9 $13 Save $4 An ultra-compact charger that provides 25W of power â€” perfect for tablets, smartphones, and smaller accessories. Although the discount isn't huge, you can now score this charger for its lowest price, coming in at just $9 for a limited time. With Prime Day coming to a close, we're in the final hours of being able to get some of the best deals on our favorite tech products. With that said, we've managed to find this compact Anker 25W charger on sale for just $9. Not only are you getting something that's easy to pack and carry with you, but it's also got enough power to easily charge most of your devices. What's great about this Anker 25W charger? There are a lot of great chargers to choose from, but most aren't even going to come close when it comes to the size of this one from Anker. Of course, size isn't everything here, with this model featuring a 25W output, which is more than enough for most phones and accessories. As mentioned before, the good news is that, since this does offer 25W of power, you can also charge larger devices as well, like the majority of tablets. You might even be able to get away with charging some laptops too, but we'd recommend going with something with more power output if that's going to be a regular thing. Naturally, this charger will pack Anker's safety features to ensure that your devices are safe when plugged in, and there's also an 18-month warranty, just in case you need support later on down the line. Overall, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck here, so grab this charger while it's still on sale. Or if you need more options to choose from, these are some other chargers we'd recommend.",

from\u003c/a\u003e, but most aren\u0026#39;t even going to come close when it comes to the size of this one from Anker. Of course, size isn\u0026#39;t everything here, with this model featuring a 25W output, which is more than enough for most phones and accessories. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eAs mentioned before, the good news is that, since this does offer 25W of power, you can also charge larger devices as well, like the majority of tablets. You might even be able to get away with charging some laptops too, but we\u0026#39;d recommend going with something with more power output if that\u0026#39;s going to be a regular thing. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eNaturally, this charger will pack Anker\u0026#39;s safety features to ensure that your devices are safe when plugged in, and there\u0026#39;s also an 18-month warranty, just in case you need support later on down the line. Overall, you\u0026#39;re getting a lot of bang for your buck here, so grab this charger while it\u0026#39;s still on sale.
