While it\u0026#39;s normally priced at $499, it can now be had for $100 less, coming in at $399. This is the best price we\u0026#39;ve seen on the iPad mini, so get it while you can before the deal\u0026#39;s gone. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"what-39-s-great-about-the-ipad-mini\"\u003e\n                        What\u0026#39;s great about the iPad Mini?\n               \u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n    \n\n\u003cp\u003eThe iPad Mini is going to be one of the best small tablets that you can buy. And just because it\u0026#39;s small doesn\u0026#39;t mean it\u0026#39;s lacking in features. The tablet has a 8.3-inch screen with beautiful and accurate colors. along with a powerful Apple A17 Pro chip that can handle anything you can throw at it. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThere\u0026#39;s also a 12MP camera on the rear, and a 12MP camera on the front for video calls. The tablet also supports the Apple Pencil and can also be paired with a keyboard to up productivity as well. Those looking to access the latest features from Apple will be happy to know that Apple Intelligence is also available. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003ePerhaps the most important thing is that you\u0026#39;ll have access to plenty of popular apps, with the App Store housing some of the best free and paid software out there for mobile devices. And with Touch ID, all your files and information can stay secure on the tablet, with easy access thanks to just the touch of a button. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAgain, this discount is major as it drops the iPad Mini to its best price.
