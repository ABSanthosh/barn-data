  "description": "Tecno showcased its latest concept development at CES with its Starry Optical Fiber technology. This is a mixture of optical fibers and mini-LED lights placed inside the battery cover of a modified Phantom V Flip 2 for a one-of-a-kind shimmering look. Tecno says the Starry Optical Fiber process involves 30 manufacturing processes and features 150 ultra-thin optical fibers combined with 108 mini-LED lights, which were carefully threaded via UV adhesive to form a fabric-like structure. Starry Optical Fiber technology features four lighting modes, including Tidal Waves, Rosy Sunset,...",
