  "text": "While they’re still a couple of weeks away, it looks like Nothing is looking to build on its existing user with the upcoming launch of the Phone (3) and the first-ever Nothing Headphones—the brand formally announced that both devices will be available in North America following their debut on July 1. The Phone (3) will be available in the United States through nothing.tech and Amazon, and will support major carriers including AT\u0026T and T-Mobile. It should be noted that this release will be the first flagship phone from Nothing to hit the US, with the Phone (2) being the last major flagship release in the region. While other Nothing phones have technically been available, they were often distributed via the brand’s Beta Program and not through retailers. READ: Carl Pei Confirms the Existence of Nothing’s Upcoming Headphones For buyers in Canada, both the Phone (3) and Headphone (1) will be exclusively available through Best Buy Canada. For those unfamiliar, the Nothing Headphone (1) isn’t the company’s first foray into audio territory, as its first-ever product was the Nothing Ear (1), which has since been followed by several other models in its lineup. The Phone (3)’s design is still officially under wraps, but that hasn’t stopped the internet from digging whatever leaks and details that might be available, revealing a rather different look this time around.",
