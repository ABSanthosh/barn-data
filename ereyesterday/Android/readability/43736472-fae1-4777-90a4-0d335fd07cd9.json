And yes, it’s a mini flagship, less than 5% of voters had issues with the size. Many still haven’t made up their minds and are waiting for a review (ours is coming soon). It doesn’t help that vivo hasn’t confirmed the global pricing yet. That said, the majority of voters are showing strong interest towards the FE.

It will compete against the likes of the OnePlus 13s (but the X200 FE wins by default in Europe) and Xiaomi 15 (but that one is certainly the more expensive model). Only around 10% of voters think they can get better value with some other small flagship. That is not to say that the vivo X200 FE didn’t have its critics. The 8MP ultra-wide is a letdown for some (the vivo X200 Pro mini has a 50MP UW sensor) as was the USB 2.0 port. The proper launch of the vivo X200 FE (and X Fold5) is scheduled for July 14 for India, so stay tuned for pricing info.",
