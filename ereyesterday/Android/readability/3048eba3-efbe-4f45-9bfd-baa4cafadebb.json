That said, it is immediately identifiable as a member of Oppo's Flip line, with the cover screen to one side and the cameras arranged next to it. It has three cameras, as you can see, which is still a rarity for this form factor, but which the Find N3 Flip also boasted. They're arranged differently, however, more reminiscent of the Find N2 Flip in position, but as you can see they're not individual circles but part of a larger island - dare we say it, a rather Samsung-esque design. The cover display itself seems larger than that on the Find N3 Flip, which makes sense since growing these has been a trend in the market in the past few years. While these images do look compelling, keep in mind that companies often file for patents they never end up actually using, so this by itself doesn't in any way confirm that a Find N5 Flip is coming, nor that it would look like this. We'll let you know if we find out more. Via",
