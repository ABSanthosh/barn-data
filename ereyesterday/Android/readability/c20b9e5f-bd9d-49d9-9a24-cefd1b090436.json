  "text": "Nov 20, 2024 [[read-time]] min read Whether you're switching from an iPhone or upgrading an existing Android phone, we've made the process of switching devices easier than ever. Over the past two years, we’ve been working behind the scenes to improve the process of setting up your Android phone and transferring your information, so you can bring what’s important to you, with you.Here are the top four updates we’ve made to make the switch even easier:1. Android Switch on phones around the worldTo make the process of switching to a new device as simple and straightforward as possible, we launched Android Switch, our streamlined onboarding experience, with several phone manufacturers.We know it’s important to be able to get your chats, calendars, contacts and more on your new device, including the nitty-gritty information like your Wi-Fi, screen lock and Google account. That’s why our Android Switch experience walks you through clear steps to get set up and to learn about the features on your new device.2. Faster data transfersIf you’re using a cable to switch from iOS to Android, it’s 40% faster to transfer your data compared to 2023. This saves hours for people who have a lot of data to move from phone to phone.Having the information you care about on your new phone is essential to making it feel like your own.3. More flexibility for switchers and upgradersIf you’d rather check out your new phone first and transfer your data later, we’ve got you covered. Available with Pixel 9 and coming to more Android phone makers in 2025, you can quickly complete your initial setup and get your data when you’re ready. When ready, just head to Settings to copy data from your old device or check out the app on Google Play. From there, you’ll be able to connect to your old device and get the information you want, when you want it.For those upgrading an Android device to a new one, we’ve got an express setup option. You can opt to transfer only the information that is stored on the device, and none of the information you already have stored in the cloud. And, if you have a Pixel Watch, that device will prompt you to transfer data to your new phone at the end of setup.4. Easier messaging with the people you loveOf course, the way you connect with friends and family is just as important as the information on your phone. This year, Apple adopted RCS1. Now, whether your loved ones are on Android or iOS devices, you can send high-res images and videos, react to text messages with any emoji you like, and add or remove people from group chats.Check out more on our Android Switch website, or find the next best phone for you.",
