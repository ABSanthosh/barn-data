  "text": "The Google Pixel 9 lowest price just landed: $482 for a fully unlocked, “excellent” refurbished unit on Amazon—down from $599 for new. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to jump on Google’s latest flagship without paying retail, this is it. There’s only 1 left in stock at this price, so if you want a Pixel 9 in your pocket for summer, you might want to move fast. What makes this deal a standout isn’t just the number on the tag—it’s the fact that you’re getting a recent flagship with Gemini AI, 24-hour battery, and Google’s signature camera for hundreds less. Now’s the time to check availability—Pixel 9 deals at this price almost never last, especially with so few units left. Buyers consistently mention how clean these Amazon Renewed units look (no major dings, still feels premium), and with a 90-day replacement guarantee, there’s basically no risk. At $482, you’re getting the full Pixel experience: blazing fast updates, a crisp 6.3” Actua display, advanced facial recognition, and those magic computational photos that have made Pixels famous. Wondering if this really is the best time to buy? Check out our Pixel price tracker to see just how rare this drop is—we’ve tracked every sale and this is the lowest we’ve ever seen for a “like new” Pixel 9. Father’s Day is right around the corner and shipping is fast, so you could have this in hand well before the weekend. Only one left in stock at this price—don’t let it slip. Ready to upgrade?
