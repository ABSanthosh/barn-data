The tablets are part of the Tab E3 family. There is a Pro version with a 13\" IPS LCD that supports up to 90 Hz refresh rate.

The tablets are part of the Tab E3 family. There is a Pro version with a 13\" IPS LCD that supports up to 90 Hz refresh rate. It has a sleek metal body designed for optimal heat dissipation, and Doogee positions it for students, professionals, and creative people. The Tab E3 Pro is powered by a Helio G100 chipset with 8 GB RAM and 256 GB storage. It has a 16 MP camera on the back and runs Android 15. The device is 7.9 mm thin, packing an 11,000 mAh battery inside. The Doogee Tab E3 Max improves on most of these specs. Its bigger display has a higher resolution and 120 Hz refresh rate, while the battery capacity also increased — it is 13,500 mAh and supports 18W wired charging. Interestingly, the chipset is Helio G99, which is what the G100 was before it was renamed—the best Mediatek chip for LTE devices. This means that the Pro and Max have the same SoC despite what the names suggest. The Doogee announcement about its wearables includes four model numbers but talks about three smartwatches. There is a D39B model that is a \"women's fashionable style smartwatch\" with a 250 mAh battery and a 1.32\" AMOLED screen with 466 x 466 px resolution (the same as used on the back of the S200 Plus smartphone). The D45B model has the same screen but a bigger battery – 350 mAh. It is crafted from zinc alloy and polished stainless steel, and Doogee says it is \"the epitome of men's business style.\" The D43/D43B are the third (and fourth?) option in the smartwatch roster, although it's unclear what the difference between the two is. The outstanding feature is an AI Voice Assistant for hands-on navigation. The service provides directions, weather updates, and music controls. All of the watches offer basic functions like step count, heart rate measurement, and Bluetooth connectivity to a smartphone.",
