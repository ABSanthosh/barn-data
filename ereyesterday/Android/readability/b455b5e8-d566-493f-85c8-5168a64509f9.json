There are a lot of streaming devices out there but you've got to pick one and settle on it. If your choice in that regard was Google TV, then I think you made a pretty good choice. There's very little to hate about it, especially if you're already a major Android enthusiast. Now, with the holidays in full gear, your Google TV choice gets even better. If you live in the US, you get access to a whole load of free channels to enjoy, and for the holidays, that portfolio gets even larger, including some Christmas-focused channels. That's just in time for tomorrow. Google TV's Freeplay App Gives You Access To Almost 200 Free Channels Image: Google Whether you have a Google TV streamer, or perhaps a television or Chromecast that comes with Google TV built-in, there's a whole lot for you to enjoy. You get access to a wide slew of apps, including all of your favorite streaming platforms. The only problem with those is that you're going to need to have an active subscription and that costs money—you might have burned all of that on Black Friday and holiday deals. The good thing is that if you have Google TV and you live in the US, you get access to the Freeplay app, which as you might guess, gives you access to content without having to pay a time—perfect for when your subscriptions have expired but you don't want to pay up just yet. The Freeplay app normally has a lot of ad-supported channels, just like classic TV, across several niches. When it first launched, it came with about 80 channels to enjoy, but now, right in time for the holidays, the app brings a massive update, increasing that number to 170 channels. That's very impressive, especially since some of those channels come with holiday-focused content, which is perfect timing. What Channels Are Available In The Freeplay App? Image: Google You might be wondering which channels Google offers in the Freeplay app, and there are quite a lot. Obviously, considering these are free channels, you might not find yourself gripped by every single one of them, but you're likely to find a few that cater to your tastes. Here are some examples: Best of Dr. Phil Filmrise: Classic TV Filmrise: Western Filmrise: Action UFC The Design Network Xumo Free Holiday Movie Channel Xumo Free Holiday Classics Xumo Christian Christmas Xumo Movies Family Feud The Jamie Oliver Channel Sky News Top Gear Documentary+ Various regional NBC News channels That's only a hint of the channels that are available on Freeplay at the moment. However, keep in mind that the holiday channels that have been added are very likely to be expelled once the holidays are over, so don't get too attached. Google TV Has Other Apps That You Can Use To Watch Free Content Image: Google In total, you can get access to over 1,000 free channels if you have a device that runs on Google TV. Sure, some of them are accessed through Freeplay, but you can get a bunch more through popular third-party apps like PlutoTV and Plex. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
