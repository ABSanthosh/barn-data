After launching the Nothing Phone 3a series a while back, the brand more recently expanded its wireless audio product lineup with the new CMF Buds 2, which pack a ton of features for a relatively-low price. READ: Best Nothing Phone 3a Pro cases Available in Light Green, Dark Grey and Orange variants, the CMF Buds 2 come with a suite of features designed for optimum audio (at least on paper), including 11mm custom drivers, support for Spatial Audio and Dirac Opteo, as well as Ultra Bass 2.0. Like the rest of Nothing’s audio offerings, the CMF Buds 2 also come with ChatGPT support for easy access to AI-powered voice assistance. For phone calls, the earbuds also come with 6 microphones built in, as well as up to 7.5 hours of playback on a single charge. This entire setup also features IP55 dust and water resistance, which should work well against accidental splashes and a bit of light rain. They’re priced starting at around 60 bucks, and will ship starting on April 18.",
