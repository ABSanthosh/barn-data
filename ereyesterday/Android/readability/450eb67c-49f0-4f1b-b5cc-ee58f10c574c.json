Everyone has a good time, but splitting the bill or expenses can be not-so-fun. It can also be a bit challenging to calculate the exact share for everyone, especially when it is uneven or multiple people are paying for select items. Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge Review (SAVE $400!) The good thing is that there are plenty of bill-splitting apps that do the job for you. You can easily calculate who should pay what amount. Many of the apps also support numerous currencies, which is helpful during international travel. Check out the best bill-splitting apps on Android. Splitwise Splitwise is probably the most well-known bill splitter app. It offers a wide versatility when it comes to tracking who owes what. You can create groups or private friendships for splitting bills. It supports adding expenses, IOUs, and informal debts in any currency. Entries can be added offline and are backed up online so that everyone can check their balance. The app can be used for sharing expenses evenly or unevenly. The app has a free version, but it is very restricted. You will need to upgrade to the paid plan for complete freedom. Download Splitwise Settle Up Settle Up is another app that makes it easier to split bills and expenses. You can easily share expenses, whether they need to be split equally or in specific portions. Not all members are required to download the app, as it gives a link that can be shared. It supports a large number of currencies and even supports real-time currency exchange rates. The latter is particularly beneficial when travelling internationally. The app has a paid version that unlocks all the features. Download Settle Up Splid Splid is a bill splitter app packed with all the features that you would expect. It can be used for splitting bills for all purposes, but is more suited for group travel. You can use it for splitting expenses where each member’s share is uneven. The app supports more than 150 currencies which helps you split bills regardless of the currency. One of the best Splid features is the ability to download expense summaries in a PDF or Excel file. The app can be used online and offline. Download Splid Venmo Venmo is essentially a mobile payment app that makes it easier to send and receive money from friends. It also lets you split a request among multiple Venmo friends. You can easily customize the amount that you want to request from people. The best part is you can enjoy no-fee transfers with Venmo. Download Venmo Tab Tab is a bill splitter app that works best for restaurants and bars. All you need to do is upload a photo of the bill and tap on the items that you want to/have to pay for. If multiple people are paying for a particular item, they can tap as well. The app automatically calculates the share including tax and tip. It offers Venmo integration for quick and seamless payment. Download Tab Ajit is a freelance tech reporter who loves everything tech but has a soft corner for Android.
