So you may have been wondering what Honor has planned as its response. According to a new rumor out of China, the Honor Magic V4, which is supposedly coming around June, will definitely fight back. It's said to be under 9mm thin when folded, thus at least matching the Find N5 in this area if not besting it.

Honor Magic V3The Magic V4 will also have an insane camera arrangement, with a 50 MP main unit with a 1/1.5\" type sensor and a 200 MP periscope telephoto with 3x optical zoom using a 1/1.4\" type sensor. The folding screen is said to be around 8\", the cover display around 6.45\", both 120 Hz and LTPO. The fingerprint scanner will be embedded in the power button on the side. The phone will support wireless charging as well as satellite connectivity and will apparently be IPX8 rated for water resistance. It will be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Elite SoC, though it might be the one with just seven CPU cores that the Find N5 is also using. Overall, if this leak is accurate, the Magic V4 is shaping up to be a very interesting contender in the book-style foldable space later this year. We'll let you know when we find out more about it.
