  "text": "TL;DR Samsung is releasing an update to its Health app. The update makes it easier to access health records, manage medications, and track daily food intake. Each feature will be available in the US. If you use the Samsung Health app, be on the lookout for a new update. The Android app is getting an upgrade that should make it easier to access health records, manage medications, and track your food intake.Today, Samsung announced it is rolling out an update to the Health app. The update is adding a variety of new features to the software. One of the features mentioned in the blog post is a new health records feature.The tech giant states that it has partnered with b.well Connected Health to make it possible to access medical records from clinics, hospitals, and major health networks in the app. This includes medical history such as vaccinations, hospital visits, prescription records, and more. The feature is also said to provide insights and alerts for preventative care, like recommending medical tests or actions.Next up, the firm has given its medicine tracking feature the ability to scan medicine bottles and add them to your personal medication list. All you have to do is point your phone camera at the pill bottle and let the app do the rest. Users can also now “check adherence levels and easily monitor medication progress.” Additionally, the app can provide warnings for over 960 types of allergies and potential reactions to medications. And it appears the medication tracking feature is expanding to South Korea and India.The final part of the update adds a barcode scanning function for food. Scanning a barcode will log that food item into the tracker and will tell you information on the food’s name, calories, and nutritional facts. This feature is debuting in the US and a few European markets, including France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland. However, Samsung says it plans to bring the feature to more countries in the future.Got a tip? Talk to us! Email our staff at news@androidauthority.com.
