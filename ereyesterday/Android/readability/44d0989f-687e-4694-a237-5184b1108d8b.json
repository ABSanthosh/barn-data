If you just uninstall the beta version, then you will temporarily be running the stable version instead. This won't prevent future beta versions from being installed automatically, though, as you will still be enrolled in the beta channel. You may want to opt out of the beta channel for the WebView component to avoid running into future bugs like this one – especially if you signed up for it accidentally (as we understand some of our users did). Opting out can be done using this link (you should see a screen like the one above). Note: users who were not running the WebView beta were not affected and don’t need to do anything. Also, this is not related to the beta version of the GSMArena app.",
