  "text": "Feral Interactive’s track record for its many console-to-mobile video game ports is impressive. For context, the studio has brought visually-impressive games such as GRID Autosport and GRID Legends, Hitman: Blood Money Reprisal, and XCOM 2 Collection, the studio has teased another upcoming port, which will arrive for mobile devices soon. More specifically, Feral Interactive recently announced that it will be bringing “Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light” to Android and iOS on February 27th. The game was a spin-off of the Tomb Raider series, and was originally launched for consoles back in 2010. The game features run-and-gun action, and the mobile port will undoubtedly come with modified controls for touchscreens. It is a premium title, which means that you’ll have to pay $8.99 for the full game, although this means no pay-to-win elements and no gacha mechanics, making it ideal for players after a more traditional and straightforward gaming experience. It also supports multiplayer and gamepad controls, which will work nicely with bluetooth controllers. You can check it out on the Google Play Store.",
