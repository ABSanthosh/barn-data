Android Authority was able to find external monitor tools in the next OS, currently in beta testing, that point to Google's intentions. Currently, if you connect an Android phone via USB to an external monitor, it defaults into screen mirroring. However, hidden in developer options, is a way to extend the smartphone's display to the external monitor. The solution is barebones at the moment - the mouse is fixed to one screen and can't move between screens, and you need to reconnect to toggle between mirroring and extending. But it seems Google has hidden solutions in place to enable the mouse cursor to move between screens. In the future, users will have access to tools much like those on Windows PCs - you can change the position of the external display, change the scaling (size of text and icons) separately on the external display. It's an indication that Google will aim to turn Android into a fully-fledged desktop OS when needed, and that it may even mold Chrome OS into Android. Source",
