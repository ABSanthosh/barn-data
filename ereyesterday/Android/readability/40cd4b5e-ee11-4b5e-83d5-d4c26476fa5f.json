With that in mind, here are some big Oppo announcements that you might have missed during MWC 2025. READ: Oppo announces a more privacy-focused AI For one, the company announced that it will be working on integrating Google AI experiences with its Android phones, meaning that users will be able to tap into Gemini and access first-party Oppo apps for a smarter and more personalized approach to day-to-day usage. Oppo adds that this will work with current support for Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash on compatible Oppo phones, with Gemini 2.0 on the way at a later date. Oppo will also implement Private Computing Cloud (PCC) with Confidential Computing via Google Cloud for better user security and privacy. Along with AI Recording Summary, AI features such as AI Search, AI Studio, AI Call Summary will be integrated with Oppo Private Computing Cloud throughout 2025. For its AI development plans, Oppo says that it’s focusing on AI Productivity, AI Creativity, and AI Imaging to further integrate AI as an “essential” part of everyday life. This includes an R\u0026D strategy that maps out an AI ecosystem consisting of hardware and software, which will see Oppo working with big names such as MediaTek to develop high-efficiency chips for real-time processing with considerable performance. As AI technology and applications continue to develop, OPPO is evolving its own approach to redefine how AI enhances everyday experiences. After surpassing its goal of reaching 50 million users last year, OPPO now aims to double that, expecting nearly 100 million users by the end of 2025. READ: The Oppo Watch X2 Makes its Debut, and it Looks Really Familiar Doubling-down on its plans for AI, Oppo says that it will provide at least one new AI update for supported hardware products per month. Currently, the company says that it’s working to win over 100 million users with new AI features, after reaching its goal of 50 million users last year. This includes upcoming features like AI Search and integration, as well as AI Call Translator and AI VoiceScribe. A writer and content creator with a love for tech and music, Mike is also an avid gamer as well. He and his wife are big fans of Mario Kart.
