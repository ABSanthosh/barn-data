So with that in mind, it seems entirely plausible that the 15 Ultra would get official, at least for the Chinese market, in the next few weeks. The certification has revealed the phone's support for 90W wired charging, as well as satellite connectivity - do however keep in mind this is the Chinese model, and that feature may not make it to international markets. The 15 Ultra will be Xiaomi's all-out flagship for 2025, and the image above purportedly shows what it will look like. Its battery capacity has been rumored to be between 5,450 mAh and 5,800 mAh, which is less than you may expect given the recent flurry of Chinese smartphone launches with 6,000 mAh and larger batteries, but the 15 Ultra will have a uniquely space-consuming camera setup and that is probably the reason for this. Speaking of cameras, it should feature a 1-inch type main shooter with f/1.63 aperture (the variable aperture may be gone), a 50 MP short-zoom camera (most likely 2x), a 200 MP 4.3x periscope zoom camera, and of course an ultrawide too. Its screen is rumored to be nigh-on identical to the 14 Ultra's 6.73\" panel with 120 Hz refresh rate and 1,440x3,200 resolution. Via | Image source",
