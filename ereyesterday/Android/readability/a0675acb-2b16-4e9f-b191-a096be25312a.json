Of course, in order to get the best deals, you're going to need to be an Amazon Prime member. Luckily, Amazon isn't messing around this year, offering plenty of ways to try Prime, like its new Prime for Young Adults promotion. If you're a student, or are between the ages of 18 and 24, you can now sign up for a free six-month trial of Prime. This is the best time to give Prime a try The best part is that if you decide to stick with Prime after the sale, you'll get a 50% discount on the service, which comes out to just $7.49/month. If that wasn't enough, you'll earn 10% cashback during Prime Day, and 5% back on certain purchases after the event. As you can imagine, this is quite a big deal if you've been looking to try out Amazon Prime to experience all its benefits. Naturally, Prime for Young Adults subscribers will get access to other Prime perks as well, like free shipping, top TV shows and movies through Prime Video, a free GrubHub+ membership, and so much more.
