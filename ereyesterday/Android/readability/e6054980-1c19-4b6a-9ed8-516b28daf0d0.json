  "text": "Netflix Sign in to your Android Police account Summary Netflix is increasing prices for all subscription tiers, including the ad-supported plan. The ad-supported tier now costs $7.99/month, the same price as the full experience a decade ago. Standard tier will jump to $17.99/month and the premium tier will cost $24.99/month. Netflix is doing Netflix things again. There's another round of price hikes incoming across all of its plans, effective with the next billing cycle. This includes the ad-supported tier. Related The changes come as the company reports its largest quarterly subscriber growth to date (via The Verge). The streaming behemoth announced in a letter to shareholders that it had added 19 million new subscribers in Q4 2024, bringing its total to 300 million viewers. It then announced a price increase in the USA, Canada, Portugal, and Argentina. This is the first price hike for Netflix's ad-supported plan, introduced in 2022. It goes up from $6.99 to $7.99 a month, which makes it the same price as the full Netflix experience a decade ago. A monthly subscription cost $7.99 per month in 2013. There were no tiers. Just one flat fee for great ad-free content. The other tiers are also going up in price. Here's how much you will pay: Ad-supported tier: $7.99/month (from $6.99). Standard tier: $17.99/month (from $15.99). Premium tier: $24.99 (from $22.99). Netflix says the price increase will help fund continued investments in original programming, and announced the return of some fan favorites like Stranger Things and Wednesday. \"We occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix,\" the company noted in its investor letter. A little more indeed. New features and live content Just in case the Netflix tier list wasn't confusing enough, the company is adding another one. The Extra Member with Ads plan will let ad-supported subscribers add someone outside their household for an additional $7.99 per month. This coincides with the Netflix's expanding focus on live sports, like NFL games and Mike Tyson fights. High profile special events, like the recent Mariah Carey concert, also drew significant viewership. Netflix is surely facing stiff competition from Disney+, Hulu, Prime, and Paramount+, among others. As one X user posted, we don't have any more money. Alternatives to pricey streaming services are looking better each day.",

It goes up from $6.99 to $7.99 a month, which makes it the same price as the full Netflix experience a decade ago. A monthly subscription cost $7.99 per month in 2013. There were no tiers. Just one flat fee for great ad-free content. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eThe other tiers are also going up in price.

The \u003cstrong\u003eExtra Member with Ads\u003c/strong\u003e plan will let ad-supported subscribers add someone outside their household for an additional $7.99 per month. This coincides with the Netflix\u0026#39;s expanding focus on live sports, like NFL games and Mike Tyson fights. High profile special events, like the recent Mariah Carey concert, also drew significant viewership. \u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\nNetflix is surely facing stiff competition from Disney+, Hulu, Prime, and Paramount+, among others.
