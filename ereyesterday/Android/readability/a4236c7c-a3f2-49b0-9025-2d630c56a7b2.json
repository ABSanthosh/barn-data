  "text": "(Image credit: Amazon) After a lackluster showing during Prime Day a few months ago, Amazon has finally dropped some Black Friday Kindle deals worth celebrating. My daily driver — the lightweight and portable 16GB Amazon Kindle (2024) — just scored a 23% discount during Amazon's early holiday sale, knocking the price down to its lowest point ever. The deal even comes with three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost, a standalone value of $35.97. Grab this 'cheap and cheerful' e-reader for only $84.99 during Amazon's Black Friday saleNow, to be clear: I'm a big advocate of physical books and I strongly recommend that you spend some money at your local independent bookstore this holiday season — but if you travel a lot like me, it's hard to beat the convenience of the Amazon Kindle (2024), especially at this price. Boot up this e-reader and you'll get instant access to a vast library of books on a 6-inch, anti-glare display that you can use in any light, thanks to the adjustable built-in screen light. You also get audiobook support via Bluetooth, some incredible battery life, and a durable construction that's supposed to be waterproof (although I haven't tested that myself). 16GB of onboard storage also means that you can easily carry thousands of titles with you wherever you go.One drawback is that this particular model is ad-supported, which means you'll have to deal with the occasional banner ad on your lock screen. They won't show up when you're reading though, which is good enough for me, but you'll have to consider if it's worth paying a bit more to go completely ad-free.  Receive the hottest deals and product recommendations alongside the biggest tech news from the Android Central team straight to your inbox! After almost a decade of working in the e-commerce space, Patrick Farmer (he/him) began his career at Android Central as a Deals and Commerce Writer before moving into a new role as AC's eCommerce Editor in 2023. When he's not hunting down the best deals and offering shopping advice for our readers, you'll often find him listening to music, camping out at a brewery, or treating his cat like a human child.  Most Popular",
