  "text": "R.E.P.O. is a co-op horror game where up to 6 people must explore an environment, trying to extract expensive cursed objects to make money. The early-access Steam title has gained a massive fan base since its launch, thanks to its chaotic and fun nature. The physics-based game features proximity chat, which is represented in the game by flapping character heads. It's a silly game, designed to be a fun hang with friends, but part of its design is high difficulty and a lack of progression in between rounds, which makes it tough for more casual players to jump in. Luckily, the mod community for R.E.P.O. is quite active, so there are plenty of mods that can improve your experience or provide new content to check out. Related 5 overlooked Steam Early Access titles that already feel polished Steam has thousands of early access games; here are some hidden gems you might not know about. 4 R.E.P.O. Mod Library Mod created by Lillious Source: Lillious R.E.P.O. Mod Library by Lillious is a mod menu collection that puts several powerful cheats into a single menu. You'll have to download the other mods linked in the description, but this will give you a relatively simple menu to interface with within R.E.P.O. once everything is installed. As for the cheats themselves, this gives you access to infinite sprint, infinite money, god mode, and a few other cheats that will let you break the game if you so choose. Some people might find these cheats take the fun out of the game, but if you need to make it simpler to play or easier for your squad, this is a great mod to get started with. After all, it's a co-op game, so it doesn't impact anyone else if you make the experience easier, so if that's how you want to play, you should do it. Mod created by Traktool Source: Traktool Shared Upgrades mod by Traktool is a simple mod that can make the experience of playing R.E.P.O. a bit smoother. Shared Upgrades is a simple mod that applies the highest level upgrade for any particular category to all players in the lobby. It's also a mod that works if only the host has it installed, making it a simple way for you and your crew to share all of your upgrades. Upgrades include things like stamina, health, or sprint speed, and typically, each person will need to be selective about which upgrades they buy. With the mod, each player can max out a specific upgrade and have that applied to the whole team. This allows you to use money on other purchases and to feel a bit more powerful during your runs. Shared Upgrades also don't feel as game-breaking as the cheats menu, making the game easier without making it easy. 2 Roguelike Progression Mod created by Samupo The Roguelike Progression mod by Samupo provides a match-to-match progression system, something that R.E.P.O. doesn't currently have. The way it works is that you gain experience at the end of each match, contributing to an account level. As that account level increases, you earn skill points that can give you permanent upgrades. Some of them are the upgrades in the base game, but there are some new perks like a health regeneration skill. The skill menu appears on the side of the main menu, where you can apply your skill points to the different skills. The skills also have caps, so you're not going to break the game with this mod, instead just making yourself a little better with each run. Progression in games is important to some people, and this mod will allow you to add that to R.E.P.O., allowing more people to enjoy it. 1 Emergency Revive - Customizable Mod created by yakuzadeso The Emergency Revive - Customizable mod by yakuzadeso does exactly what it says in the title. It adds a revive option, which you can use whenever a teammate is killed by interacting with their body. In the base game, you have to grab their head and return to the exit of the level, where you can fully bring them back with 1 HP. That makes reviving teammates a bit of a challenge in R.E.P.O., and nobody enjoys having to spend a ton of time spectating in these kinds of co-op games. With the mod, you can revive them right on the spot of where their body is. You have the option with the mod if you want it to cost health or not. You can set it to cost health. For example, if the setting requires 25 HP, you must give 25 HP, which your teammate will respawn with. You can also set it to cost nothing, and independently set the amount of health they come back with. This makes the mod flexible for how much easier you want the emergency revive to make your game. R.E.P.O. has over 70 mods on Nexus Mods at the time of writing, with tons of changes and cheats you can use for the co-op early access game. While the developer, semiwork, is still adding new content and gameplay features to R.E.P.O., you can modify and enhance your experience with mods instead of waiting for the next update. There are tons of quality-of-life or silly mods to choose from for R.E.P.O. R.E.P.O. Systems Released February 26, 2025",

experience of playing \u003cem\u003eR.E.P.O. \u003c/em\u003ea bit smoother. Shared Upgrades is a simple mod that applies the highest level upgrade for any particular category to all players in the lobby. It\u0026#39;s also a mod that works if only the host has it installed, making it a simple way for you and your crew to share all of your upgrades. Upgrades include things like stamina, health, or sprint speed, and typically, each person will need to be selective about which upgrades they buy. With the mod, each player can max out a specific upgrade and have that applied to the whole team. This allows you to use money on other purchases and to feel a bit more powerful during your runs. Shared Upgrades also don\u0026#39;t feel as game-breaking as the cheats menu, making the game easier without making it easy.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"roguelike-progression\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e2 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Roguelike Progression\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"mod-created-by-samupo\"\u003e\n            Mod created by Samupo\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n    \n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/repo/mods/84?tab=description\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRoguelike Progression mod\u003c/a\u003e by Samupo provides a match-to-match progression system, something that \u003cem\u003eR.E.P.O. \u003c/em\u003edoesn\u0026#39;t currently have. The way it works is that you gain experience at the end of each match, contributing to an account level. As that account level increases, you earn skill points that can give you permanent upgrades. Some of them are the upgrades in the base game, but there are some new perks like a health regeneration skill. The skill menu appears on the side of the main menu, where you can apply your skill points to the different skills. The skills also have caps, so you\u0026#39;re not going to break the game with this mod, instead just making yourself a little better with each run.

It adds a revive option, which you can use whenever a teammate is killed by interacting with their body. In the base game, you have to grab their head and return to the exit of the level, where you can fully bring them back with 1 HP. That makes reviving teammates a bit of a challenge in \u003cem\u003eR.E.P.O., \u003c/em\u003eand nobody enjoys having to spend a ton of time spectating in these kinds of co-op games. With the mod, you can revive them right on the spot of where their body is. You have the option with the mod if you want it to cost health or not. You can set it to cost health. For example, if the setting requires 25 HP, you must give 25 HP, which your teammate will respawn with. You can also set it to cost nothing, and independently set the amount of health they come back with. This makes the mod flexible for how much easier you want the emergency revive to make your game.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eR.E.P.O. \u003c/em\u003ehas over 70 mods on \u003ca href=\"https://www.nexusmods.com/games/repo\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNexus Mods\u003c/a\u003e at the time of writing, with tons of changes and cheats you can use for the co-op \u003ca href=\"https://www.xda-developers.com/early-access-games-steam-still-deserve-your-time/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eearly access\u003c/a\u003e game.
