In the end, the F56 received a very good repairability score of 9 out of 10, where 10 would be most repairable and 0 would be least. It got top marks for parts availability, how easy it is to replace the battery, and how easy it is to replace other parts like the charging port and such. It only received 1.5 out of a total of 2 in two categories: the organization and time needed for repairs, and how easy it is to replace the screen. Had the innards been better organized and the screen easier to replace, the F56 would have gotten a perfect score, which really isn't something we see all that much.",
