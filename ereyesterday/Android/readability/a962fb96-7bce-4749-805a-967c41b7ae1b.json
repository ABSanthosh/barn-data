Following the industry's largest and busiest event a lot has changed with the most popular phones in our database. Newly announced Samsung Galaxy takes off where its predecessor left off and immediately goes top, followed by Xiaomi's new beast of a cameraphone - 15 Ultra. The Galaxy A36 took third, while Nothing Phone (3a) Pro ranks fourth. Xiaomi 15 is the first phone in this week's chart that didn't see its official announcement over the past two weeks. It did begin its global journey during that period, though. The champion from the previous chart, the iPhone 16e, is all the way down in sixth, while the Galaxy S25 Ultra finds itself in seventh position. Nothing Phone (3a) came in eighth, followed by the Galaxy A55 and yet another new name, the Infinix Note 50 Pro. Following that many announcements, we are bound to have more rapid movements next week as the dust settles - stick around for that!",
