Writers, game developers, or those with overactive imaginations stand to gain many benefits from intelligent tools on their personal phones. Exploring playful yet practical ways to put your stories together is among them. Many creatives publish works without cleaning out AI's influence. It can offer a fresh perspective or draft a full scene for you. However, if you let it take over most of the process, the result is robotic. Instead, use it to enhance existing skills, retain ownership of your work, and speed up ideation. Let's explore how that's possible. Related 10 ways I use AI to simplify my daily life Learn new ways to do work, studies, and hobbies Everything in this article is intended for entertainment and educational purposes only. Don't use AI to break the law. Any contrary actions can land you in trouble. You should only use AI tools to brainstorm within ethical and legal boundaries. The role of AI in 'what if' scenarios? What if an alien lands on Earth during movie night? \"What if\" scenarios in world-building help you construct alternate realities, strange new dimensions, or unexpected systems of magic, politics, or technology to make them more expansive and real. They force characters to react to unforeseen circumstances and reveal their true motivations. For example, what happens if my hero's ally betrays them in the middle of a battle? What if my protagonist accidentally unlocks a dangerous artifact that unleashes a curse? It's unlikely that any of these fantastical scenarios will happen. But in your non-existent universe, it helps to balance real-world principles with imaginative flexibility. If your world follows the laws of physics, you could introduce supernatural elements, time manipulation, or flat-out magic that alter those rules, but in ways that make sense to the narrative. A time-altering character or device should be governed by a limit or cost. Maybe the character can only reverse it for short moments, or every manipulation causes irreversible damage to the surrounding things. As much as you want to be creative, there is a fine line between being innovative and introducing overwhelming power that makes your world feel arbitrary. If a character manipulates their existence without limits, it would be easy to undo mistakes, or it would render everything meaningless. How to build fictional projects with mobile AI Bounce ideas off the co-writer on your phone If you ask ChatGPT how to steal a priceless artifact, it will tell you it's illegal. But clarify that it's hypothetical, and the AI engages you in an inventive context. It shows how adaptable any machine is when it understands the intent behind the prompt. When you're past that point, you need a strategic approach for conceptualization. First, break down the process into steps, starting with the basics: establishing the character's personality and skill set. It lays the foundation for understanding who they are and how they think. If your character values loyalty, a betrayal in the middle of tension wouldn't be another casual event. Example prompt: Imagine a [character type] skilled in [key abilities] with [personality trait]. They're in a [situation] with only [limitations]. How do their strengths help them adapt? Does their [trait] create setbacks? Break down their thought process, adaptation, and how this shapes them. You also need to flesh out the environment where the character or event is. The setting needs to influence the challenges. Also, ask ChatGPT to identify potential plot holes. You may have a basic plan, but there must be elements you haven't considered. Example prompt: [An event] takes place in an [insert world here] with [add other elements for imagery]. Given this character's skill set, what obstacles would be the hardest for them to overcome? I'm thinking that [share your idea]. Can that work? Give me the pros and cons of why it wouldn't? Then, ask for suggestions on how an event's aftermath or actor's consequence should play out and how it would change everything. Example prompt: After [successfully or unsuccessfully] doing [the action], how would my character's mindset, relationships, or future decisions be affected? I'm thinking about [share your idea]. But I'm not sure how to justify why [your concerns]. Could it be [path 1] or [path 2]? Feel free to experiment with your questions. The trick is to be as specific and detailed as possible to avoid generic answers. The clearer your request, the better the response. Also, turn on the Reason feature if you use ChatGPT for brainstorming. The AI will take longer to process your prompts and provide more elaborate results. Never share unpublished works with AI chatbots, as they process and store data in ways that may compromise privacy. You can summarize your concepts or ask questions without pasting the full drafts. Use offline AI models when possible. Related AI is your sidekick, not your hero Since AI can only work with patterns it learned from elsewhere, its ideas aren't new. As you wrap up your project, tailor your queries with clear details and experiment with asking for alternative scenarios. More importantly, use AI's output as a crutch and refine it until it fits your vision. There are plenty of tools to help you divide and conquer your project. If ChatGPT doesn't work well, use Gemini or CoPilot prompting alternatives.",
