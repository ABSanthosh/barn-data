When Mark Zuckerberg said AR glasses would one day replace smartphones, I thought he was delusional. Replacing the device we check over 90 times a day with a piece of eyewear just because it's smart is a far stretch. But looking at the progress today, he’s not completely wrong. AR glasses won’t wipe out smartphones in some meteoric or explosive way. They won't kill the smartphone race overnight. But they’re no longer concept technology. Many brands have gone insane with their designs and their glasses are available to buy in many stores. Come to join them is XREAL's talked-about AR glasses in the mainstream consumer space. The company started their journey in 2017 (originally as Nreal), and they’ve built a reputation for delivering real-world AR experiences long before the giants got their footing. On the third day of Prime Day, their best eyewears are now available at ridiculous prices for you to steal. XREAL One AR glasses Image: Talk Android / Amazon The XREAL One delivers a large, private screen experience in a lightweight and portable form. It offers a 147-inch virtual display that moves with you. You could be lying in bed, sitting on a plane, or riding in the back of a car.  You'll always have a full-screen experience with a 50-degree view that doesn’t disturb anyone else. It uses Sony micro-OLED panels, so visuals are great and the low blue light with UV protection makes it easier for you to stare at a phone for hours. The glasses run on Xreal’s custom spatial computing chip (X1), that should keep latency at 3ms. How fast the screen reacts when you move your head is indistinguishable from real-world motion. You’ll barely notice any delay. Original price Prime Day priceDiscountExtra discount$579$49914% offEnter code XREALONE at checkout to get 5% off XREAL Beam Pro AR companion Image: Talk Android / Amazon The Beam Pro has soft matte white finish with rounded corners and dual 50MP 3D cameras arranged vertically. One is near the top corner, while the other is lower down. Internally, the phone supports the full Google Play Store and runs regular Android apps. When paired with your smart glasses, it places them inside a spatialized 3D interface using Nebula OS based on Android 14. Your regular 2D apps become movable and resizable floating windows inside your glasses. You can have a YouTube video playing in one space, Gmail floating beside it, and a browser stretched above within your field of view without switching tabs. You may also use the touchscreen to interact. The device outputs a 1080p resolution at 90Hz, which matches the refresh rate of the XREAL glasses. It also has dual USB-C ports, so you can charge your Beam Pro and use the glasses at the same time. Original price Prime Day priceDiscountExtra discount$579$49914% offEnter code XREALONE at checkout to get 5% off More Prime discounts await you The discount for the XREAL One AR glasses is also available in the UK and EU. The glasses are selling for £399 (≈ $467) instead of £449 (≈ $525) and €479 (≈ $561) instead of €549 (≈ $643) respectively. If you haven’t taken advantage of Prime Day deals yet, now’s the time. The event ends tomorrow, July 11, and these discounts likely won’t stick around after. Irene is an experienced writer with five years' experience in the Tech, E-commerce, and Food niches.
