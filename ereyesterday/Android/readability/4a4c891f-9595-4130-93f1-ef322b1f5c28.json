For several years now, Samsung's famous Galaxy S lineup has had three devices in it: a regular model, a Plus variant, and the top-of-the-line Ultra model. It wasn't always like that, but it seems that the OEM has settled into that arrangement, and for good reason. It just makes sense. However, the model numbers for the Galaxy S26 lineup seem to have surfaced, and if everything is as expected, it seems that Samsung might finally be making good on its threat to rid the world of the S26+. From a consumer standpoint, it's hard to understand why, but I have a few theories as to why Samsung might be doing this. Let's talk about it. There's No Model Number for Where the Galaxy S26 Plus Should Be; Is Samsung Finally Killing It? Image: Samsung I assume you're already aware of this, but in case you're not, devices have model numbers in addition to the familiar model names like S25 and S25 Ultra. For instance, the S25 Ultra is known as the SM-S938, and the regular Galaxy S25 is the SM-S931. The Galaxy S26 series, despite being rather far from release, has had its model numbers leaked. Thanks to SammyPolice, here's what we know so far: Galaxy S25 LineupGalaxy S26 Lineup (Rumored)RegularSM-S931SM-S942PlusSM-S936N/AEdgeSM-S937SM-S947UltraSM-S938SM-S948 As of now, there simply hasn't been a model number spotted for the S26 Plus, which could suggest that the rumor of Samsung getting rid of it will finally pan out in 2026. There are two reasons why I think the company might be making that choice, as unpopular as it might seem on the surface: The sales for the Galaxy S25 Plus and previous models may have been the weakest of the lineup, leading Samsung to focus on the options that drive profit the most. The company may see the Edge model as a cutting-edge replacement for the Plus model. Both phones have a similar footprint, and besides slimness-related constraints, the Edge could potentially fill the Plus model's shoes. The Base Galaxy S26 Could See a Major Jump in Hardware Image: Samsung If you're eagle-eyed, you might have noticed that the model number for the S26 increases by 11 this year, as opposed to the usual 10. In Samsung's system, the final digit tends to represent the comparative position of the device when it comes to specs. A SM-S942, instead of SM-S941, could mean we see a base Galaxy S26 that brings notable changes to the table. The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra Could See a Major Boost to Its 200MP Main Camera In other leaks about the Galaxy S26, we have a rumor regarding the Galaxy S26 Ultra. This one comes from Fixed Focus Digital on Weibo. Image: Samsung According to him, the primary camera in the Galaxy S26 Ultra could see a very substantial upgrade. It'll remain as a 200MP sensor, but could move away from the 1/1.3″ Samsung ISOCELL HP2 over to a bigger 1/1.1″ Sony-made unit. That's a pretty heavy rumor, as Sony doesn't currently have a 200MP sensor, and that would mean we should expect an announcement before the end of the year. A bigger sensor would mean better light gathering, and for a company like Samsung, which has always hesitated in embracing upgrades, it could make things very exciting. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes. Previous Post",
