The publication claims to have spotted some leaked files from the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra and confirms that the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra indeed has seamless update support, which should be the case for the Galaxy S25 and Galaxy S25+ as well. Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra's leaked renders (Source: OnLeaks and Android Headlines) The seamless updates feature was introduced by Google in 2016, but Samsung only adopted it in March this year, with the Galaxy A55 being the first Samsung smartphone to get this feature. For those unaware, the seamless updates feature allows the update to be installed on partition B while you continue to use your phone in partition A and restart it when the installation is complete. This keeps the device usable during the installation, and it is unavailable only when it's restarting, meaning you don't have to wait a few minutes for the entire installation process to complete to use your phone. In addition to confirming seamless update support for the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, the source also said that model SM-S938 of the S25 Ultra will be powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite. Source",
