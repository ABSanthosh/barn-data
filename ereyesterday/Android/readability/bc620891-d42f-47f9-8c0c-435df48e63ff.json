  "text": "While HMD has slowly but steadily moved itself away from the Nokia brand with each new phone launch, it’s now reported that the company is planning to continue the latter’s “XR” range of rugged smartphones, which officially made their debuted under the Nokia brand. An online post claims lists several hardware specifications of an upcoming “HMD XR22” which succeeds the Nokia XR21 (which itself was later rebranded as the HMD XR21). The specs include an OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate and Gorilla Glass 2 Victus protection, and a Snapdragon 6 Gen 3 alongside 8GB of RAM and 256GB of internal storage. READ: The HMD Fusion is the company’s most innovative smartphone to date The XR22 is also predicted to feature a triple-camera setup with a 64MP main camera in addition to 8MP ultra-wide and night cameras, as well as a 50MP selfie shooter. The phone will be powered by a 5,520 mAh battery with 33W charging speeds, as well as IP69K rating and MIL-STD-810H certification for durability. Other details include dual speakers and an infrared sensor onboard. Of course it’s important to remember that nothing is “official” at the moment, but we wouldn’t exactly be surprised if the leak more or less turns out to be accurate. Source: Nokiamob",
