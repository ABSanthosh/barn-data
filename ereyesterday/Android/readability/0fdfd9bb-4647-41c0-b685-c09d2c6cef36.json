This happens randomly and unexpectedly, it seems, but there may be an explanation - two users on Reddit report that their Pixel 6 devices died after enabling the Private Space feature. However, another user claims their device died during regular use, so it might not be a very cut and dry situation.

Obviously, these are just a few isolated reports, at least so far, so the issue doesn't seem to be very widespread.
