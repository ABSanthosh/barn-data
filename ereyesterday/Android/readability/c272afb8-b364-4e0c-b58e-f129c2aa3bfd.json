  "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge launched several hours ago, opening up a chapter of Android history that has long been closed: slim smartphones. The device is the second most expensive in this year's lineup, but for many, it'll be sexy enough to spend the extra money. However, for others who might want it, the price will prove to be prohibitive. Fortunately, the Big Three carriers are offering deals for the phone, fresh out the gate, giving you the chance to get the latest Samsung device without breaking the bank. Get the S25 Edge on AT\u0026T by Trading in an Eligible Phone in Any Condition Image: Peter Holden/Talk Android The Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is available for pre-order starting today, and the device will actually begin to ship out on May 30th. However, for a limited amount of time, with the right phone traded in, AT\u0026T will give you the opportunity to get the new phone completely on them, regardless of the device's condition. If you trade in any Samsung Galaxy S, Z, or Note device, regardless of the year, and regardless of the condition of the phone, as long as the trade-in value would have been at least $35, AT\u0026T will give you $1,100 off, through 36 monthly bill credits. However, keep in mind that you'll need to be on an eligible plan—postpaid, unlimited, voice and data, and with a starting price of at least $75.99 a month. Get the Galaxy S25 Edge for Free from Verizon, With a Trade-In From Apple, Google, or Samsung Image: Samsung AT\u0026T's deal is great for people who have been Samsung loyalists for the longest time, but what if you use one of the other major OEMs of the world, like Apple or Google, and you finally want to give the new slim device a try? Verizon will make that possible, plus, it'll let you get the device entirely on them. First off, you need to make sure that you're on a myPlan subscription, but any myPlan will work, whether you're a new or existing customer. Once you've done that, all you have to do is trade in any Samsung, Apple, or Google device, and it doesn't matter the condition that the device is in. That's just like AT\u0026T's deal, but leveled up. Unsurprisingly, this deal will apply over 36 months, through bill credits made to your account. T-Mobile Will Give You the S25 Edge for Free With a Trade-In, Or For $600 Less When Adding a Line Image: Peter Holden/Talk Android Just like the others, T-Mobile is ready to give you the S25 Edge for free, but the deal is limited to its Experience Beyond plan. If you're on that plan, all you have to do is trade in an eligible device (going as far back as Samsung flagships like the Galaxy S10) and you'll get it paid off over 24 monthly bill credits. However, if you don't have a phone to trade in, if you add a new line on most of T-Mobile's plans, you'll automatically get $600 knocked off its price, which provides a nice alternative for many people. However, if you choose Experience More, Go 5G Plus, or Go5G Next, that turns to $800 off. Through Tecno, Gionee, Vivo, Google, and now Samsung, Ayomide has always been an Android enthusiast. His current partner in crime is a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. You can find him playing Candy Crush or Call of Duty: Mobile, watching movies, and he is a big fan of trivia and quizzes.",
