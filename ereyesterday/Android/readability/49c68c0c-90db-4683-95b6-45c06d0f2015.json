This could be felt in the form of an actual performance difference, or it could mean that some features won't be available to the Pixel 11a and Pixel Tablet 3. The Pixel 9a also has a downgraded modem compared to the other Pixel 9 phones, and that trend could very well continue into the future. All of this said, keep in mind we're in 2024 and talking about 2027 here - these devices aren't even in development yet, so obviously a lot can change between now and then. The Pixel Tablet 3 is also said to come with an extra USB-C port, which will support DisplayPort output with up to two displays when used with daisy-chaining. Source 1 | Source 2",
