For reference, the current slimmest commercially available foldable - Honor's Magic V3 is 4.35mm thick. We can see the device will be available in purple (vegan leather), white and black. The camera island will feature a familiar look with a OnePlus 13-like triple camera setup with Hasselblad branding. Oppo Find N5 in its folded state Oppo Find N5/OnePlus Open 2 is rumored to bring an 8-inch LTPO OLED main display (2K resolution + 120Hz) with minimal screen crease. The main panel will be complemented by a 6.4-inch cover display. The foldable may opt for the seven-core Snapdragon 8 Elite chip alongside up to 16GB RAM and 1TB storage. For the cameras, we should see a trio of wide, telephoto, and ultrawide 50MP shooters. Oppo Find N5 unfolded We’re also expecting IPX6, IPX8, and IPX9 water resistance ratings and a 5,600 mAh battery with 80W wired charging. Source (private X profile)",
