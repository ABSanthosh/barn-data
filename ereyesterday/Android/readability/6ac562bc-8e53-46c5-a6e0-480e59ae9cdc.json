It will also \"gradually\" roll out on mobile and will be available in \"over 45 languages\" in \"the majority of countries around the world\", but not in the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and the UK. If you select this model, Gemini will connect with your Google apps and services, starting with Search, to give you more insightful responses that are tailored to you specifically. For now, all it can access is your search history, but \"in the coming months\" it will also connect with Google Photos and YouTube. If you want to use it now, for anything you ask, it will analyze your prompt and determine if your search history \"can enhance the response\". Google stresses that \"you're in control of your info\" and can disconnect your search history from Gemini at any point. Your search history won't be used for every prompt and query, but only when Google's \"advanced reasoning models\" determine that it's actually helpful. Source",
