There’s a lot of other not-so-fun stuff you need to do to ensure that they are well taken care of. This includes taking them to the vet for regular checkups and jabs, as well as grooming them. If you’re looking for a simple and effective solution, then you might want to check out the oneisall Dog Hair Vacuum \u0026 Dog Grooming Kit. Clips, grinds, and trims Just like humans, the nails of your dog will grow over time. Just like how we should cut our nails often, it is important to trim the nails of your dog. This is because long nails on a dog can create an annoying clicking sound on the floor while they walk. Long nails, over time, can also break in dry climates which can lead to injury for your pet. Just like how our long nails can get caught on things and cause pain, the same can be said for dogs. Long nails can also make it difficult for your dog to gain traction, making it harder for them to walk. With the oneisall dog grooming kit, it offers a way for pet owners to trim the nails of their dog thanks to the built-in nail grinding tool. But that’s not all, though. The grooming kit is basically a 3-in-1 solution where it can not only grind the nails of your dog, but it can act as a clipper for their fur and also a trimmer for their paws. This means that instead of spending money buying separate gadgets or taking them to the groomers, this grooming kit will get all of it done. When it comes to clipping your dog’s fur, there are different clipper sizes for you to choose from. This will ensure that you get the right amount of trim, plus it won’t get stuck in your dog’s coat and cause them distress or pain. The grooming kit is also relatively quiet. The company claims that the vacuum’s noise is only at 60dB at its lowest setting. This is designed on purpose so that your pet won’t feel scared by the noise during the grooming process. This will help them feel more at ease and just make the entire process a lot easier and manageable. Easy to clean up One of the reasons why most people might prefer to send their pets to the groomers is because of the mess it can create when grooming at home. Hair will shed and get everywhere, making it a pain to clean up. That’s actually something oneisall has taken into consideration for its dog grooming kit. One of the features of the kit is a deshedding brush. If you have a dog or cat who tends to shed quite heavily, this deshedding brush will make it a breeze to clean up the mess. The company claims that it can instantly capture 99% of pet hair. There is also a grooming brush attachment that helps to keep your pet’s hair healthy and shiny, while also getting rid of potential tangles and loose hair. Last but not least, and perhaps maybe not it’s primary purpose, the oneisall dog grooming kit can even pull double duty as a mini vacuum cleaner. If your pet has shed on you or if there are loose bits of hair after grooming, there is a clean brush and crevice tool attachment that will help you suck up any excess debris or hair from your clothes or in between your couch cushions. Large capacity The oneisall dog grooming kit has a dust box that can hold up to 1.5L. The company says that this is 25% larger compared to some of its competitors. A larger dust box means that you can use it without having to empty it out quite as often while you are grooming your pet. This will save you time and effort. Removing the dust box is also pretty simple and straightforward and there’s a built-in lid to prevent its contents from falling out. Lastly, the built-in hose can be extended up to 4.9 feet and its power cable measures 8.7 feet. This should be long enough to provide you with flexibility if you need to move around or if you prefer performing the grooming process outdoors and don’t have a power outlet nearby. Pricing \u0026 availability If you’re interested in the oneisall dog grooming kit, you can actually grab it from Amazon right now. The grooming kit is priced at $99.99, which is actually a 9% discount from its original price of $109.99. Overall, it’s a pretty decent price to pay considering all of the features that you’ll be getting, so check it out if you’re looking for a clean and effective way of grooming your pet!
