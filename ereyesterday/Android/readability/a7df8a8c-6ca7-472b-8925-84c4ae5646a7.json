Oppo Reno14 F certifications The phone has the model number CPH2743 and boasts a 6.7-inch screen, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of built-in storage, and support for 45W wired charging. These are all the specs that have been outed through these certifications, and unfortunately they don't tell us much - the Reno13 F also has support for 45W charging, and a 6.67-inch screen, so while its successor has an ever so slightly larger panel, the difference is so small as to be unnoticeable in real life. The F model is the most affordable in the line, and so the Reno14 F should have a lot of downgrades compared to the Reno14. Hopefully more details about it will be outed soon.
