  "text": "Between privacy concerns and a lack of interest in creating accounts for, or giving access to, my Google account to every other service, I’ve been looking for open-source, preferably self-hosted, solutions for most services. Among those, a secure and efficient file-sharing service has been at the top of my list. Sure, WeTransfer exists, but between privacy concerns and the cost of long-term storage, I’ve been seriously considering hosting my own service. So, I did the obvious thing and turned to open-source solutions. After trying out various tools, I opted for YeetFile for its flexibility, ease of use, and extensive feature set. Setting up the app was straightforward, and I followed the Docker instructions provided on the developer's Github. But it was the simplicity in everyday use that sealed the deal for me. Since then, YeetFile has become my go-to everyday file-sharing and storage solution. Here's why. 5 ways to send large files to your friends Sending large files to your friends online can be easy by using cloud storage or file transfer websites. 4 Effortless file sharing with maximum control Secure file sharing made simple As a creative professional and business owner, I share files multiple times a day with clients, vendors, and partners. More often than not, these files contain privileged information. While most file-sharing services include encryption by default, it doesn’t match the peace of mind that comes with rolling out your own solution. Additionally, it helps that YeetFile lets me set up my own parameters. For example, the ability to share files using simple, shareable links without requiring the recipient to create an account is incredibly convenient. This feature not only saves time for both the sender and the recipient but also eliminates unnecessary barriers that often complicate the file-sharing process. But YeetFile goes beyond just sharing files. It offers advanced features to ensure complete control over how those files are shared. You can set an expiration date and time for the link, ranging from minutes to days (up to a maximum of 30 days), which makes it incredibly flexible for a variety of use cases. For example, I often use this feature when sharing temporary documents or sensitive data that doesn’t need to linger for too long. With the expiration date in place, I no longer have to worry about forgetting to delete the file manually. Another essential feature is the ability to limit the number of downloads for a file. YeetFile allows up to 10 downloads per file, which is particularly useful for limiting access to confidential or high-traffic files. Once the download limit is reached, the file is no longer accessible, adding an extra layer of control and reducing the risk of unauthorized access. And of course, YeetFile lets you password-protect any shared file, which is essential when sharing sensitive information. 3 Unlimited file storage and flexible permissions Flexible and secure sharing options tailored to your needs   Another compelling reason I rely on YeetFile is its file storage capabilities, particularly when using YeetFile Vault. Unlike many other file-sharing platforms that impose upload size limits, YeetFile Vault has no such restriction. You can set the maximum size to whatever you prefer using environment variables. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large files—whether they’re high-resolution images, large video files, or oversized PDFs. I don’t have to worry about compressing files or breaking them up into smaller parts; everything can be uploaded and stored in its original format. It goes a step beyond that. Similar to a more conventional cloud storage service, YeetFile Vault has essential file management tools like folders that can be used to categorize files into projects or any other folder structure you prefer. YeetFile also excels in providing granular control over file and folder sharing. The option to set specific read/write permissions per user ensures that I can control who can view, edit, or share my files. This is particularly useful for collaboration. For instance, when working on a team project, I can grant editing rights to colleagues who need to make changes while keeping others in view-only mode. This ensures that no one inadvertently alters something important, maintaining the integrity of my files and their organization. 2 Enhanced privacy and anonymity Prioritizing privacy and anonymity for secure file sharing Of course, privacy and security are at the core of hosting your own file-sharing service. YeetFile’s approach to user anonymity is one of the reasons it stands out for me. For example, it doesn’t require an email to create a user account for sign-ups. You can create an account with just an account ID, something that is increasingly rare with online services. This method of registration eliminates the need for sensitive personal data, reducing the chances of data breaches or spam. Additionally, the open-source software supports creating a payment gateway for premium downloads and subscriptions. I haven’t needed to test this out, but with support for cryptocurrencies via BTCPay, there’s ample room to tweak the service to your needs. 1 Self-hosting is the only way to retain full control over your data Open-source and self-hosted is your only option when security is paramount Of course, the biggest advantage here is that you retain full control over your data. By hosting YeetFile on my own server, I eliminate reliance on third-party servers, reducing the risk of data being compromised or exploited. Self-hosting also means that I can access my files whenever I need them, without worrying about service outages or access restrictions from a third-party provider. I have complete control over backups, security measures, and file accessibility, ensuring that my data is safe and available whenever required. On the flip side, that also means that the onus of maintaining uptime is entirely on me as a user. However, with the right equipment, the small amount of effort required to maintain the service is worth it. Take control over your data with self-hosted file-sharing The idea of running a self-hosted file-sharing service can be daunting, but unmatched control over your data, and privacy that it offers makes it worth the effort. Whether you're a creative professional, a business owner, or just privacy conscious, hosting your own file-sharing service empowers you to share and store files securely without reliance on third-party services.",

file storage capabilities, particularly when using YeetFile Vault. Unlike many other file-sharing platforms that impose upload size limits, YeetFile Vault has no such restriction. You can set the maximum size to whatever you prefer using environment variables. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large files—whether they’re high-resolution images, large video files, or oversized PDFs. I don’t have to worry about compressing files or breaking them up into smaller parts; everything can be uploaded and stored in its original format.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eIt goes a step beyond that. Similar to a more conventional cloud storage service, YeetFile Vault has essential file management tools like folders that can be used to categorize files into projects or any other folder structure you prefer.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eYeetFile also excels in providing granular control over file and folder sharing. The option to set specific read/write permissions per user ensures that I can control who can view, edit, or share my files. This is particularly useful for collaboration. For instance, when working on a team project, I can grant editing rights to colleagues who need to make changes while keeping others in view-only mode. This ensures that no one inadvertently alters something important, maintaining the integrity of my files and their organization.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003ch2 id=\"enhanced-privacy-and-anonymity\"\u003e\n            \u003cspan\u003e2 \u003c/span\u003e\n        \u003cspan\u003e\n                            Enhanced privacy and anonymity\n                    \u003c/span\u003e\n       \u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"prioritizing-privacy-and-anonymity-for-secure-file-sharing\"\u003e\n            Prioritizing privacy and anonymity for secure file sharing\n    \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n                \n    \n    \n    \n                \n    \n                \n        \n                                                            \n                                                                                                                        \n                                                                        \n    \n    \n    \u003cdiv data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png\" data-modal-id=\"single-image-modal\" data-modal-container-id=\"single-image-modal-container\" data-img-caption=\"\u0026#34;\u0026#34;\"\u003e\n\n            \n\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n        \u003cpicture\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 1024px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 768px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=825\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 481px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=800\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n        \n                                        \n                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                            \n            \n                                                            \n            \n            \n                                        \n            \u003csource media=\"(min-width: 0px)\" data-srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\" srcset=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png?q=49\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;w=500\u0026amp;dpr=2\"/\u003e\n                \u003cimg width=\"1848\" height=\"1216\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"yeetfile account id\" data-img-url=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png\" src=\"https://static1.xdaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/yeetfile-account-id.png\"/\u003e\n    \u003c/picture\u003e\n                                    \n    \u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n        \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e Of course, privacy and security are at the core of hosting your own file-sharing service. YeetFile’s approach to user anonymity is one of the reasons it stands out for me. For example, it doesn’t require an email to create a user account for sign-ups. You can create an account with just an account ID, something that is increasingly rare with online services. This method of registration eliminates the need for sensitive personal data, reducing the chances of data breaches or spam.\u003c/p\u003e    \n\u003cp\u003eAdditionally, the open-source software supports creating a payment gateway for premium downloads and subscriptions.
