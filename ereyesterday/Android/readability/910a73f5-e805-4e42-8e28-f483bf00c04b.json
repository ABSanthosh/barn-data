  "text": "Amazon Fire Max 11 $140 $230 Save $90 Brand Amazon Storage 64GB or 128GB CPU Mediatek MT8188J Memory 4GB Operating System Fire OS, based on Android The Amazon Fire Max 11 features a high-resolution LCD, 14 hours of battery life, and 4GB of RAM paired with Amazon's ecosystem and support.  If you've been looking for an affordable tablet with a good screen, lots of power, and great battery life, the Amazon Fire Max 11 is going to be a good choice. This is going to be the best Amazon tablet you can buy, and while we did have some hesitations recommending it at its original retail price of $230, we think this becomes a no-brainer since it's now down to the lowest price we've seen at just $140. What's great about the Amazon Fire Max 11? The real star of the show here is going to be the tablet's beautiful large display that comes in at 11 inches and also features a resolution of 2000 x 1200. In addition, you also get a powerful octa-core processor that's paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Of course, you can always expand the storage using a microSD card. As far as construction goes, you're getting excellent durability here with a tablet that can handle being dumped or dropped. Amazon is quite proud of this, declaring that the Fire Max 11 is three times as durable as the Apple iPad. Of course, your results may vary, and we always recommend grabbing a case if you think it might be in some rough situations. Related Amazon Fire Max 11 review: Dude, where's my app store? Amazon's most expensive tablet yet is held back by a pitiful app experience When it comes to battery life, this tablet performs pretty well, delivering up to 14 hours on a single charge. This tablet is also powered by Fire OS, which is a fork of Android and has its own Appstore. While you'll find plenty of apps and games here, the selection won't be as robust as what you'd find on the Google Play Store. For the most part, this tablet is going to be great for someone that's looking for something that's simple, easy to use, and affordable. It excels with watching videos and surfing the web. It can also handle your productivity tasks too, but we recommend grabbing the keyboard case attachment to make things easier. Overall, the Fire Max 11 is a good product, and you're getting excellent bang for your buck here. While Prime Day is just a couple of weeks away, we don't think that it will be any cheaper. So just be sure to grab it while it's on sale because this discount won't last long.",

tablet performs pretty well, delivering up to 14 hours on a single charge. This tablet is also powered by Fire OS, which is a fork of Android and has its own Appstore. While you\u0026#39;ll find plenty of apps and games here, the selection won\u0026#39;t be as robust as what you\u0026#39;d find on the Google Play Store. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eFor the most part, this tablet is going to be great for someone that\u0026#39;s looking for something that\u0026#39;s simple, easy to use, and affordable. It excels with watching videos and surfing the web. It can also handle your productivity tasks too, but we recommend grabbing the keyboard case attachment to make things easier. \u003c/p\u003e    \u003cp\u003eOverall, the Fire Max 11 is a good product, and you\u0026#39;re getting excellent bang for your buck here. While Prime Day is just a couple of weeks away, we don\u0026#39;t think that it will be any cheaper. So just be sure to grab it while it\u0026#39;s on sale because this discount won\u0026#39;t last long.\u003c/p\u003e    \u003c/div\u003e\n    \n                \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n\n\n\n\n        \n    \u003c/article\u003e\n\n    \n            \n        \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
