  "text": "I‚Äôll be honest: writing this post feels like a chore some years. Rounding up and reflecting on what‚Äôs happened throughout the year is somewhat obligatory for a site like this, especially when it‚Äôs a tradition that goes back as far as 2007. ‚ÄúHey, look at all the cool things we did!‚Äù This year is different. Much different. I‚Äôm more thankful this time around because, last year, I didn‚Äôt even get to write this post. At this time last year, I was a full-time student bent on earning a master‚Äôs degree while doing part-time contract work. But now that I‚Äôm back, writing this feels so, so, so good. There‚Äôs a lot more gusto going into my writing when I say: thank you so very much! It‚Äôs because of you and your support for this site that I‚Äôm back at my regular job. I‚Äôd be remiss if I didn‚Äôt say that, so please accept my sincerest gratitude and appreciation. Thank you! Let‚Äôs tie a bow on this year and round up what happened around here in 2024. Overall traffic Is it worth saying anything about traffic? This site‚Äôs pageviews had been trending down since 2020 as it has for just about any blog about front-end dev, but it absolutely cratered when the site was on pause for over a year. Things began moving again in late May, but it was probably closer to mid-June when the engine fully turned over and we resumed regular publishing. And, yes. With regular publishing came a fresh influx of pageviews. Funny how much difference it makes just turning on the lights. All said and done, we had 26 million unique pageviews in 2024. That‚Äôs exactly what we had in 2023 as traffic went into a tailspin, so I call it a win that we stopped the bleeding and broke even this year. Publishing A little bit of history when it comes to how many articles we publish each year: 2020:¬†1,183 articles 2021:¬†890 articles (site acquired by DigitalOcean) 2022:¬†390 articles 2023: 0 articles (site paused) 2024: 153 articles (site resumed in late June) Going from 0 articles to 153 (including this one) in six months was no small task. I was the only writer on the team until about October. There are only three of us right now; even then, we‚Äôre all extremely part-time workers. Between us and 19 guest authors, I‚Äôd say that we outperformed expectations as far as quantity goes ‚Äî but I‚Äôm even more proud of the effort and quality that goes into each one. It‚Äôs easy to imagine publishing upwards of 400 articles in 2025 if we maintain the momentum. Case in point: we published a whopping three guides in six months: CSS Anchor Positioning CSS Length Units CSS Selectors That might not sound like a lot, so I‚Äôll put it in context. We published just one guide in 2022 and our goal was to write three in all of 2021. We got three this year alone, and they‚Äôre all just plain great. I visit Juan‚Äôs Anchor Positioning guide as much as ‚Äî if not more than ‚Äî I do the ol‚Äô Flexbox and Grid guides. On top of that, we garnered 34 new additions to the CSS-Tricks Almanac! That includes all of the features for Anchor Positioning and View Transitions, as well as other new features like @starting-style. And the reason spent so much time in the Almanac is because we made some significant‚Ä¶ Site updates This is where the bulk of the year was spent, so let‚Äôs break things out into digestible chunks. Almanac We refreshed the entire thing! It used to be just selectors and properties, but now we can write about everything from at-rules and functions to pseudos and everything in between. We still need a lot of help in there, so maybe consider guesting writing with us. üòâ Table of Contents We‚Äôve been embedding anchor links to section headings in articles for several years, but it required using a WordPress block and it was fairly limiting as far as placement and customization. Now we generate those links automatically and include a conditional that allows us to toggle it on and off for specific articles. I‚Äôm working on an article about how it came together that we‚Äôll publish after the holiday break. Notes There‚Äôs a new section where we take notes on what other people are writing about and share our takeaways with you. The motivation was to lower the barrier to writing more freely. Technical writing takes a lot of care and planning that‚Äôs at odds with openly learning and sharing. This way, we have a central spot where you can see what we‚Äôre learning and join us along the way ‚Äî such as this set of notes I took from Bramus‚Äô amazing free course on scroll-driven animations. Links This is another area of the site that got a fresh coat of paint. Well, more than paint. It used to be that links were in the same stream as the rest of the articles, tutorials, and guides we publish. Links are meant to be snappy, sharable bits ‚Äî conversation starters if you will. Breaking them out of the main feed into their own distinguished section helps reduce the noise on this site while giving links a brighter spotlight with a quicker path to get to the original article. Like when there‚Äôs a new resource for learning Anchor Positioning, we can shoot that out a lot more easily. Quick Hits We introduced another new piece of content in the form of brief one-liners that you might typically find us posting on Mastodon or Bluesky. We still post to those platforms but now we can write them here on the site and push them out when needed. There‚Äôs a lot more flexibility there, even if we haven‚Äôt given it a great deal of love just yet. Picks There‚Äôs a new feed of the articles we‚Äôre reading. It might seem a lot like Links, but the idea is that we can simply ‚Äústar‚Äù something from our RSS reader and it‚Äôll show up in the feed. They‚Äôre simply interesting articles that catch our attention that we want to spotlight and share, even if we don‚Äôt have any commentary to contribute. This was Chris‚Äô brainchild a few years ago and it feels so good to bring it to fruition. I‚Äôll write something up about it after the break, but you can already head over there. Baseline Status Ooo, this one‚Äôs fun! I saw that the Chrome team put out a new web component for embedding web platform browser support information on a page so I set out to make it into a WordPress block we can use throughout the Almanac, which we‚Äôre already starting to roll out as content is published or refreshed (such as here in the anchor-name property). I‚Äôm still working on a write-up about it, but it‚Äôs I‚Äôve already made it available in the WordPress Plugin Directory if you want to grab it for your WordPress site. Or, here‚Ä¶ I can simply drop it in and show you. Post Slider This was one of the first things I made when re-joining the team. We wanted to surface a greater number of articles on the homepage so that it‚Äôs easier to find specific types of content, whether it‚Äôs the latest five articles, the 10 most recently updated Almanac items or guides, classic CSS tricks from ages ago‚Ä¶ that sort of thing. So, we got away from merely showing the 10 most recent articles and developed a series of post sliders that pull from different areas of the site. Converting our existing post slider component into a WordPress block made it more portable and a heckuva lot easier to update the homepage ‚Äî and any other page or post where we might need a post slider. In fact, that‚Äôs another one I can demo for you right here‚Ä¶ So, yeah. This year was heavier on development than many past years. But everything was done with the mindset of making content easier to find, publish, and share. I hope that this is like a little punch on the gas pedal that accelerates our ability to get fresh content out to you. 2025 Goals I‚Äôm quite reluctant to articulate new goals when there are so many things still in flux, but the planner in me can‚Äôt help myself. If I can imagine a day at the end of next year when I‚Äôm reflecting on things exactly like this, I‚Äôd be happy, nay stoked, if I was able to say we did these things: Publish 1-2 new guides. We already have two in the works! That said, the bar for quality is set very high on these, so it‚Äôs still a journey to get from planning to publishing two stellar and chunky guides. Fill in the Almanac. My oh my, there is SO much work to do in this little corner of the site. We‚Äôve only got a few pages in the at-rules and functions sections that we recently created and could use all the help we can get. Restart the newsletter. This is something I‚Äôve been itching to do. I know I miss reading the newsletter (especially when Robin was writing it) and this community feels so much smaller and quieter without it. The last issue went out in December 2022 and it‚Äôs high time we get it going again. The nuts and bolts are still in place. All we need is a little extra resourcing and the will to do it, and we‚Äôve got at least half of that covered. More guest authors. I mentioned earlier that we‚Äôve worked with 19 guest authors since June of this year. That‚Äôs great but also not nearly enough given that this site thrives on bringing in outside voices that we can all learn from. We were clearly busy with development and all kinds of other site updates but I‚Äôd like to re-emphasize our writing program this year, with the highest priority going into making it as smooth as possible to submit ideas, receive timely feedback on them, and get paid for what gets published. There‚Äôs a lot of invisible work that goes into that but it‚Äôs worth everyone‚Äôs while because it‚Äôs a win-win-win-win (authors win, readers win, CSS-Tricks wins, and DigitalOcean wins). Here‚Äôs to 2025! Thank you. That‚Äôs the most important thing I want to say. And special thanks to Juan Diego Rodriguez and Ryan Trimble. You may not know it, but they joined the team this Fall and have been so gosh-dang incredibly helpful. I wish every team had a Juan and Ryan just like I do ‚Äî we‚Äôd all be better for it, that‚Äôs for sure. I know I learn a heckuva lot from them and I‚Äôm sure you will (or are!) as well. Juan Diego Rodriguez Ryan Trimble Give them high-fives when you see them because they deserve it. ‚úã",

So, we got away from merely showing the 10 most recent articles and developed a series of post sliders that pull from different areas of the site. Converting our existing post slider component into a WordPress block made it more portable and a heckuva lot easier to update the homepage ‚Äî and any other page or post where we might need a post slider. In fact, that‚Äôs another one I can demo for you right here‚Ä¶\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo, yeah. This year was heavier on development than many past years.

We were clearly busy with development and all kinds of other site updates but I‚Äôd like to re-emphasize our writing program this year, with the highest priority going into making it as smooth as possible to submit ideas, receive timely feedback on them, and get paid for what gets published. There‚Äôs a lot of invisible work that goes into that but it‚Äôs worth everyone‚Äôs while because it‚Äôs a win-win-win-win (authors win, readers win, CSS-Tricks wins, and DigitalOcean wins).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"heres-to-2025\"\u003eHere‚Äôs to 2025!\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you.\u003c/em\u003e That‚Äôs the most important thing I want to say.
