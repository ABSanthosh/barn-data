  "text": "Do you subscribe to Piccalilli? You should. If you’re reading that name for the first time, that would be none other than Andy Bell running the ship and he’s reimagined the site from the ground-up after coming out of hibernation this year. You’re likely familiar with Andy’s great writing here on CSS-Tricks. Andy is more than a great writer — he’s a teacher, too. And you’ll see that in spades next week when his brand-new course Complete CSS is released one week from today on November 26. As someone who also runs a front-end course, I can tell you it takes a non-trivial amount of time and effort to put something like Complete CSS together. I’ve been able to sneak peek at the course and like love how it’s made for many CSS-Tricks readers — you know CSS and use it regularly but need to ratchet it up from good to great. If my course is for those just getting into CSS, Andy will graduate you from hobbyist to practitioner in Complete CSS. It’s the perfect next step for narrowing the ever-growing learning gaps in this industry. Early bird price is £189 (~$240) which is a steep cut from the full £249 (~$325) price tag.",
