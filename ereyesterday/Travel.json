The second is the point in autumn when the summer hues shift overnight and the woods take on a whole new coat. In Japanese there is a wonderful term for both, mikkaminumanosakura, meaning a moment of sudden, dramatic change. As we move deeper into autumn, we’re heading for one of these moments, and I’ll be out in the woods trying to catch it.I have spent much of the past two years travelling the length of the UK and Ireland exploring our relationship with trees and woodlands for a new book.

However, there’s a cheaper and more convivial side to the city’s culinary scene: its communal supper tables.Leading the way is the community centre Absalon, a former church in the smart Vesterbro neighbourhood. On a Sunday evening in September, the air buzzes with conversation and the clatter of cutlery as about 200 people tuck into bowls of steaming tomato lentil soup and piles of fried potatoes in a creamy fennel and chive sauce.

The restored Georgian gem is a perfect base for exploring the historic Castlefield districtFor some, a stately home does it. For others, a converted barn. For me, anything rail-related hits the spot. It’s partly respect for transport and proper jobs. It’s also because I was born and raised 1.2 miles (or a mile and 16 chains in the parlance) south of the world’s first inter-city railway line – the Liverpool and Manchester, which opened on 15 September 1830. Though never a full-blown spotter, I got the transport bug watching 47s and Deltics rumbling along the tracks between St Helens Junction and Newton-le-Willows. Despite the delays and dysfunction that make rail travel so irksome today, I still love trains.It is then a childish buzz as well as a grown-up, heritage-inspired delight to be spending a couple of nights in the Station Agent’s House, the Landmark Trust’s new property in Castlefield, Manchester. The area, at the southern end of main drag Deansgate, is one of the city’s oldest, though its iron bridges and merchants’ warehouses are now overshadowed by high-rise apartment blocks.

No access.” We ignore it and follow a path past a Georgian manor house, its white walls glowing pink in the early evening light. It appears to be empty but as we tiptoe past the large sash windows, I have the uneasy sensation of trespassing. To the far side of the house is a latticed wooden gate, which has been left off the latch.The lawn and flowerbeds in front of the house are neatly manicured, but on the other side of the gate is something altogether wilder. We set off down a narrow path that descends steeply through a lush valley spiked with palm trees and soaring Monterey pines. There’s the sound of trickling water from a waterfall and the leaves of flame-coloured crocosmia tickle our legs as we brush past. At every twist in the path there are new wonders: towering tree ferns, a grove of bamboo 10 metres high, a swathe of rampant hydrangeas with flower heads the size of footballs in every shade of lilac and blue. It’s like a sub-tropical Secret Garden on steroids, and we’ve got it all to ourselves. Continue reading...",

But tourism has had a big impact – from Sunday opening hours to a deep water port for cruise shipsThere was a joke doing the rounds when I was first visiting the Outer Hebrides more than three decades ago. On the flight to Stornoway, halfway across the Minch, the pilot makes an announcement: “We will shortly be arriving on the Isle of Lewis. Don’t forget to turn your watches back two … hundred years.”And there was, indeed, as you arrived on the islands for the first time, a sense of stepping back in time – to a place and a culture that had changed little in perhaps centuries.

Any night of the week, you can wander downtown and find live music playing somewhere – from the set of a live television show to a pop-up concert in a convenience store, not to mention incredible cuisine and nightlife where people never take themselves too seriously. We chatted with Madeline Hollern, editor of Austin Monthly, to get her latest favourite recommendations for visitors.Food and drinkThough Austin was always a great place for food trucks and burger joints, Hollern says she’s seen more options opening up from new restaurants in the city this year. “We’re getting more diversity in terms of types of food and price points, which is very welcome,” she says. One of her favourite new restaurants is Bambino, a pizza restaurant offering hand-tossed pies with a daily changing menu in East Austin. Far East Austin is where you’ll find some of the trendiest bars and restaurants in the city. Start your evening at Sign Bar (you’ll recognise it by the melange of neon), and then when you get hungry, head next door to Lao’d Bar. A newcomer on the Austin bar scene, Lao’d Bar represents a departure from the standard bar fare. “It has some of the best food I’ve had all year – it’s incredibly tasty Lao-inspired food, and it’s getting accolades left and right,” says Hollern.

We used this to revisit south-east Asia – not to relive past travelling glories of my 20s (where my destinations usually revolved around partying). Instead we floated around the more “cultured” parts that were not on my radar in days gone by – South Korea, Japan, Taiwan (a revelation) and more remote areas of the Philippines and Indonesia. I could list a hundred special moments and locations over the year – but the memory I revisit in my head the most is my daily moped drive to a beach on the Karimunjawa islands in Indonesia. It’s not the crystal-clear sea, smiling locals or amazing food that sticks, but the feeling of absolute freedom and euphoric joy that made me smile from ear to ear on that ride, sometimes laughing to myself hysterically for no reason (I must have looked a bit crazy). It’s joy that I felt from simply being alive. It’s a feeling that can be elusive in life and one I cherish so much. Benjamin Continue reading...",

As we glided past vineyards and lavender fields, I could almost taste the crisp rosé waiting for me in Tain-l’Hermitage, where I stopped to savour local wines and cheeses. The medieval villages along the way felt like stepping back in time. Each moment on deck, with the cicadas singing and the sun setting over the water, deepened my connection to the soul of France.
