  "description": "Most of us probably have that item of clothing that we wear whenever we can. When we're wearing it, we feel good, we look good, and most importantly, we are comfortable. As we get older, comfort takes priority, and looking smart is just an added bonus. Of course, if your favorite item of clothing is your Crocs, you're not ever going to look smart, but more power to you because at least you'll look out of place in a nice restaurant in unparalleled comfort.Whether it was picking apples or fancy date-night dinners, the boyfriend's Crocs were always on his feet, raising the question for his girlfriend of whether he was taking their relationship seriously at all, especially once he admitted to dressing nicer for other activities like going to his university classes. She turned to this online community to see whether or not she was in the wrong for insisting that he change his footwear to better suit the occasion that they were attending, which had caused a rift between the couple.It stands to reason here that while we're not wholly responsible for other people's perceptions and the way that they feel, we can still take their feelings into account, and if your partner is feeling disrespected by what they feel is a lack of care, that's really something the two of you need to sort out. Still, at the same time, you can't really go around insisting that someone change their ways to suit your tastes so that factors in too.",
