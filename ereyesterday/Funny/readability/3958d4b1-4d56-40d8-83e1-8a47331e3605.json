  "text": "Everybody in Marvel Rivals is completely busted in some way. Their low-key disregard for dogma in the traditional Triangle of damage and healing has given rise to all manner of moist and wicked chimeras. They'll let a duelist be - in the words of 2 Live Crew - as nasty as they wanna be, just utter demons, but they don't get to have any health not even as a treat. Tank is a deep genre in this game; I think there's a reason we haven't gotten any new ones since launch. Strategists also go extremely hard. There is a strategist whose ult essentially just calls halftime and you have to go do something else for a little while. It's an ult that projects out into the real world. It's pretty meta shit; their commitment to this bit is next level. Even though I said that all I would end up doing is being a videogame blacksmith and making videogame swords to sell to people who live inside a videogame, the phalanx of clips I've seen is starting to wear down my defenses. I think it was when I saw a video detailing the punishments you must suffer from breaking the law inside the game, getting put in the fucking stocks with a time lapse and shit, being fucking executed, that I was like, okay. This isn't my kink. It's somebody's though, for sure. And I think I could learn a lot about them by inhabiting this strange realm, even for a little while. It's double reverse anthropology. It's a new field that requires true perverts to make a game for weirdos that is so successful they get to make a second one, and then I can create a photonegative of their mind I can use to understand them and the twisted patriarch that sired it. If I can make it to Friday without buying it I'll probably be safe. But I don't feel super safe at the moment. (CW)TB out.",
