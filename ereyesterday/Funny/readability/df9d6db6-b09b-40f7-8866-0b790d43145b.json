  "description": "There's always one person in our lives who we can never trust with money and always seems to need it. You go out to dinner with them and cover the bill because they insist on paying you back, but you know that money will never get back to you. Even when they ask to borrow money, promising it's just a loan, you fork over the cash, knowing you'll never see it again. The invention of money-sharing apps has made it a little bit easier to hold these people accountable, but they can still swindle their way out of paying and back into our hearts. Eventually, you just have to accept that this person is never going to change and make you that whenever you go out together, it's for a cheap meal.If your life's leech person gets ahold of someone with a big heart and a leaky wallet, that's when you enter the danger zone. One woman faces this issue when she learns that her husband has been sending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to his sister every month or so. In this case, does family come before everything? Or is there a time and place to cut someone off?",
