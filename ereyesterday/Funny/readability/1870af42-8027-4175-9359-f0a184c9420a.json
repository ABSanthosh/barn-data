  "description": "Sometimes you get fired and nothing feels right in the world and you've reached rock bottom and have nowhere else to go. Other times you reach rock bottom and it's actually just karma clearing the way to read her gorgeous face. Sometimes if you just sit tight after getting fired, you might be able to witness the most magnificent karma ever to play out in your life.  Take, for example, this lowercase karma that happened after this loyal employee was fired. He had worked there for over 10 years and loved his job. However, during those unprecedented times, the company decided he was \"redundant\" and all of the owner's family, with less experience, deserve to get the favorite parts of his job. So when he was fired, it was effective immediately and callous.",
