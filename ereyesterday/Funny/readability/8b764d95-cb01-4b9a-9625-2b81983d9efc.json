  "description": "No one likes that person who hogs things. Whether it's someone who is hogging all the parking spaces or all the desserts at a family gathering or a stranger who is taking up way too much space on public transportation, these types of individuals are everywhere. In fact, there is really only one way to stop people like this: You have to call them out on their nonsense. People with this kind of energy end up this way because no one called them out, even back in pre-K when they didn't learn how to share. Letting the behavior slide once, twice, and thrice naturally leads to a kind of entitlement that these folks will never get over now that they have gotten away with self-involved behavior. It seems too simplistic to say, but that direct line from entitled kid to entitled adult is real. So, if you see some kid hogging space now, kindly give them a lesson they won't forget. Otherwise, they'll end up like this guy's neighbor!",
