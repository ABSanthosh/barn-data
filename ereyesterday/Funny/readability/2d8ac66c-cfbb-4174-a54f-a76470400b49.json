  "description": "Workplace leaders often have a weird talent for caring way too much about tiny things while ignoring big problems. Managers will throw fits over dress codes, monitor your bathroom breaks, or ban personal items at desks, all while turning a blind eye to stolen wages, safety issues, or employees drowning in burnout.It's like watching someone whine about a spilled coffee stain while their house burns down behind them.  These bosses are never ready for the shocking instances when their petty rules blow up in their faces.Take disability accommodations, for example. Ask for a stool because standing hurts? Not without a 10-page doctor's note. Need a quiet workspace for anxiety? You should consider being less sensitive.Our front desk rock star learned this firsthand. They used a simple bell as a disability aid, approved by old management. New bosses decided bells were forbidden, threatening punishment if it rang again. When our hero explained it was helpful, the manager demanded private health details. If this sounds illegal to use, it's probably because it very much is.",
