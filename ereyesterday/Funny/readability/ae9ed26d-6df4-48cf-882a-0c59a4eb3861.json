  "description": "Another weekend is about to come to an end, and we are here to tell you to not be weary. Sure, Monday brings madness with it, but we're not there yet. It's Sunday, better known as Funday, and if there is one thing that you simply have to do on this meowgical day, it's stock up. It's find and keep and cherish every piece of wholesomeness and hilarity that you can get your hands on - to help you get through the week sane and safe. And for that, you have to start your day with a bunch of cat memes. That's why we bring you this collection of the best cat memes and posts directly from X every single week. Because beginning the day with a bunch of ridiculous and hissterical cat shenanigans means starting it on the right paw. It means starting it with pawsitivity. And really, it's much nicer to scroll through these posts here, not through your timeline, where you know you will get the funniest without all the drama in between.",

  "text": "Sigh. This is something that every cat owner learns- sooner or later. It doesn't matter what you buy, the boxes will usually get the most attention. Except… we keep doing it even after we learn. Because we want to spoil our cats, and we think “maybe this one, they'll love” every time. We're just not surprised anymore about the box thing.  Oh, polydactyls. It's like the universe said: “You see that cat? You see how cute its paws are? Not cute enough. Need more toes. It'll be more toes for the hoomans to worship.” And we do. Every single day, we do, and if we were lucky enough to have a polydactyl, we would be doing it even more.",
