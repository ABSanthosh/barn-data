It's rude, but also kind of awesome, like The Sex Pistols. I would also like to thank you preemptively for enduring what may be the dumbest punchline of all time. That is, if you did endure it. If you were annihilated by it, there may be some gift options for your family in the first paragraph. Very, very near the end. (CW)TB out.",
