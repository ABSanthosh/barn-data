  "description": "Hey, hey, let's all just take a deep breath, okay? There's no need to pile on the poor guy who's just wondering why he can't work multiple remote jobs like Elon Musk does multiple companies. Come on, folks, he's just asking a question. It's not an existential crisis; he's just passing through that adorable phase where all they say is \"why?\"—like a toddler trying to make sense of a very messy world.Now, sweetie, let's break it down for you. Elon Musk is the richest man in the world. and billionaires can do whatever they want. Why? because, well, they're billionaires. Why? Because that's just system we all agreed to. Why? Because let's stop right there.But when you, a regular software engineer, want to have a second remote job? Oh dear, that's a different story altogether. You see, in the real world that is not a billionaire utopia, rules apply to people.",
