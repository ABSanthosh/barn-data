  "description": "Coworkers are not friends, no matter how are we want them to be. At the end of the day, making friends in the workplace seems great in theory, but you'll soon realize that \"friendship\" looks like carpooling, and you're the only one actually paying for gas. Or, asking to switch shifts once or twice at first, then every week, then nearly every day. Not everyone is that entitled, sure, but it's better to be safe and set a boundary than be sorry you didn't tell them \"No\" the first time they asked to borrow 50 bucks from you.The employee who posted this next story is struggling to learn how to say \"No\" to their entitled coworker who has clearly realized they can take advantage of them one ride home at a time. Being kind and good is nice and all, but not when it starts to affect your life's quality. The employee is now at risk of losing their health insurance because of lateness they cannot avoid if they help their coworker out, but they don't want to be a bad person. PSA: Looking out for yourself is not you being a bad person, it's you putting yourself first. If you can't help yourself, how will you help anyone else? Scroll below to read the entire story.",
