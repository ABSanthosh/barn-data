  "description": "Rescuing a cat is an amazing thing. It's selfless. It means putting yourself aside and helping an animal who will never be able to return in the favor in quite the same way. And it's just as amazing - if not more so - to return the lost cat that you rescued to its owners if that's the situation you found yourself in. Sure, it's a little heartbreaking to think that the kitty you were chosen by is not yours for good, but giving it back - putting that owner's heart back together after it got broken when the cat escaped - it's an amazing, praiseworthy thing. That's not the case here. Here, after doing the amazing thing of rescuing the lost cat, this person, instead of returning it - instead of doing what was right, demanded money. They demanded a \"reward\" for finding the lost cat. The owner didn't refuse to pay it, they simply couldn't provide the money right then and there, but again, instead of sympathy and doing the right thing, the neighbor who found the cat simply… threw it back outside. It's a miracle that the kitty found its way back to its owner after all.",

Somehow, this person has turned doing something so good and pure into something absolutely evil. Releasing the cat back outside instead of just giving it back… how could doing that even cross this person's mind? We are so thankful for this update. We read through the whole text exchange without being able to rest easy for a second. For a moment, we thought that the kitty was still out there, lost and scared and confused. It's fate that brought her back to you. Because you deserved her. And because that neighbor should not ever get within 100 miles of her again.",
