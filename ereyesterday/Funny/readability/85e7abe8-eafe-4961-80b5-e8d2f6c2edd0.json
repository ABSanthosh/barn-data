  "description": "Difficult people often find themselves dealing with difficult consequences. At the end of the day, they have no one to blame but themselves for being, well, difficult.Here, we have an entitled Karen customer who didn't like the fact that the bank's printing machine smudged two numbers on her new debit card (this did not affect whether or not the card worked). Now, if this happened once and the customer politely requested to have it reprinted, that would have been fine. However, this lady could not be satisfied. She ended up forcing the bank teller to reprint her card eight times. What she did not realize is that there was a fee each time the card needed to be reprinted, and if she looked carefully at the form she signed each time, she would have known that. Let's just say that she was not too happy when she saw that she now owed over $100 in fees because of this inconvenience.For more stories like this, take a look at this post about a teacher who got even with a misbehaving student.",
