  "description": "We exist in an incredibly weird space; we know a lot of people we really shouldn't know, given our irascible natures and rustic beliefs. We simply end up in the path of novel individuals from time to time and even if we start off on the wrong foot with them, which we often do because of the aforementioned irascibility, we typically arrive at some kind of positive relationship. I'm unfailingly polite in real life because my momma raised me right. This is a performance space; getting mad at me is like getting mad at an actor for something their character did.",

Mork said that Everquest 2 was like a Krispy Kreme filled with shit, and then ruler of SOE John Smedley sent us like a thousand Krispy Kremes which we ended up bringing to Seattle Children's Hospital because we knew them from Child's Play. He ended up bringing a table tennis squad to battle us up north; it was a blast. Another: we made a comic about Petroglyph's Rise of the Immortals MOBA, there was a lot of that type of thing going around back then, and they literally added one of our parody characters to the game. I still keep in touch; they're doing these cool voxel RTS games now, building on their expertise in the genre which might actually be the best in the world. These aren't even all the examples I could give. I'm hoping we can maintain the streak! (CW)TB out.",
