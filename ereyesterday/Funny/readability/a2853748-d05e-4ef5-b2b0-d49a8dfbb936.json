  "description": "Do you get nervous when you find yourself having to call your boss and tell them you can't come to work?Even if one has a perfectly good reason for calling out, for some reason, that conversation might make one a bit uneasy, like they're doing something wrong. Maybe this experience only happens to those of us who also had perfect attendance in school, or never missed a day of college. For other people, having to tell their boss they can't come to work is not a big deal whatsoever. They do it, get the okay, and move on with their lives. They don't think anyone hates them, and they definitely do not think they are going to get fired, stuff that constantly crosses the minds of those who dread these sorts of calls.If you have a family emergency, you shouldn't feel bad if you cannot come to work, and any normal boss would agree with this statement. However, if you are a person who constantly misses work, your boss might not believe you when you have an actual reason to not be there, and that can lead to a real threat to your job.",
