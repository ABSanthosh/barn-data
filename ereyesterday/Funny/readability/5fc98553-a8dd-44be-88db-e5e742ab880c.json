  "description": "This wasn't exactly neighborly behavior on both sides of the situation. However, the Redditor ended up doing what he had to in order to make the message to his entitled next-door neighbor clear.That resident allowed their dog to go to the bathroom on the Redditor's lawn every day. The first time, of course, the Redditor excused it. The second time, he thought about bringing it up. By the fifth time, he needed to communicate to the dude next door that this was beyond forgiveness. The best way to get even is to be petty right back. This is not a \"when they go low, we go high\" situation. This is very much a \"when they go low, we meet them at their level and plunge them even further below\" situation. The Redditor decided that the best course of action was to return the remains on top of the neighbor's garbage can without properly packaging the trash so that they would receive a fine from the HOA.Keep scrolling below for the full play-by-play.
