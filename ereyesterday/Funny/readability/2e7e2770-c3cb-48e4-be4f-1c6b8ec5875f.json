For my bit, this kind of thing doesn't get any better than Owlchemy Labs' Job Simulator, but I have a variety of reasons to feel tenderly about it. One of select few VR games that can be said to be necessary or even advisable, when it first came out it had been played and tested exclusively by adults and so if you were very small, let's say a five year old girl, the world of the simulation placed your perspective lower than a lot of the things you needed to interact with. Child labor concerns aside, I would sometimes have to pick her up in the real world so she could reach something in the virtual one. I'm not sure I'll ever stop thinking about that. My eldest has a less heart-wrenching tale, but it was pretty funny. They had found some kind of bug in the convenience store level that let you increase the size of things arbitrarily, which allowed them to make a hot dog roughly the size of Venus. Gabriel told me that he sold a kid an expensive model car in his shop. You can race these collectible cars on some tracks in the back of his shop, and when the kid left the register they went back to test it out. You can race your customers also, and if you win, you take their car. It's some real Warlock type shit but as a business model it does bear a certain Machiavellian charm. (CW)TB out",
