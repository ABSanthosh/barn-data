  "description": "You can only push an employee so far before they just completely break down. Some workplaces know this, and handle their employee's emotions gently. Others are less gentle, but they still defend their employees from their worst clients or customers. And then there are workplaces who are simply do not care about how their workers feel. And if that worker crashes out and storms out of the building, well, that's totally fine, because there's another worker who can take their place in a minute. At retail stores and restaurants, an employee meltdown is just par for the course. Customers can be so impolite, and they do not care about making that staffer feel bad. If a diner's meal came out cold, they'll have no trouble berating the waitstaff until they're brought to tears! At least some of the workers who told their stories below quit their jobs on the spot, which is a feel-good moment for us all. Next, read the polarizing story of the dude who bought a $50k guitar for $4k, but the circumstances led to everyone in his social circle getting mad at him: \"[I'm] refusing to sell it back.\"",
