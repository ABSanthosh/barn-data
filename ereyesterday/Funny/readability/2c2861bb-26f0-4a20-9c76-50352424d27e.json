  "description": "Office work is tedious, but when you're juggling thousands of pages of printed paperwork, it feels like sifting through an avalanche of unfilled documents. This company's executives were reminded of this feeling after ignoring the warnings of their most hardworking (and literal) department. There's something satisfying about watching a C-level boss's plans implode. Typically, they look down on the workforce, feeling empowered by their golden offices and ivory floors, but way up in their corner offices, they truly have no idea what goes on in offices that actually get the work done every day. To flex their power and prowess over their lowly employees, however, executive bosses will often make unilateral decisions that—if you're lucky—will backfire, proving the point of the 60-hour week managers downstairs. Always heed the warnings of an experienced employee, no matter how small they seem. Because if you don't, you might find yourself buried in thousands of pages of printed documents... Per your own silly request, of course.",
