  "description": "Ah the holiday season, a time for love, a time to celebrate life, a time to fight with your family and cause a scene so dramatic that no one talks to each other for the next ten months until it is forgotten and it is time to start planning the next holiday season. And seeing as yesterday was Thanksgiving we would not be at all surprised if you have had a little more than a little taste of what that maelstrom is like. So we figured you might need some help cooling off, which is why we made this list of hilarious cat child memes to help you calm down after a tumultuous Thanksgiving with your own family.From the simple-minded house cat who cannot help but hoover dry crunchies and puke them back up, to the freeloading feline who has a warning attached to its collar for all those who might try to feed him, to the surprising fur baby who not only loves a visit to the vet, but also particularly enjoys the sink at the vet's.",
