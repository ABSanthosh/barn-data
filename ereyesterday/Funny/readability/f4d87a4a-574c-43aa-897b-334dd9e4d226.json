  "text": "Published: January 30, 2025 WASHINGTON—Saying it was only by divine intervention that he was still standing, President Donald Trump stated during a press briefing Thursday that God had spared his life during last night’s midair collision of an Army helicopter and a passenger jet over the Potomac River. “Without the beautiful hand of God guiding that airplane away from the White House, I would have died in that terrible crash,” said Trump, who when informed by a reporter that the jetliner was on its approach to a runway at Reagan National Airport and not heading toward the Executive Residence interrupted to point out that the investigation was ongoing. “It’s very sad, what happened. Very sad. But it also could have been Air Force One in that crash, you know? God must have kept me alive for a reason, because it could easily have been me.” The president concluded his remarks by pumping his fist and chanting the word “Fight!” to himself as aides ushered him away from the podium.
