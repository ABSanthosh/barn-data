  "text": "Skip to content A few decades ago I met my husband in a bookstore where he picked me up by convincing me to go to his dorm room to lend me the books I was looking at so I didn’t have to buy them. Over a decade ago I started writing strange books about our lives that somehow became bestsellers. 5 years ago we opened a sweet indie bookstore called Nowhere Bookshop. Victor and I considered adding our footprints in front of the witchy section because that’s where our story started, but we didn’t because we move the shelves too much. But they are there in spirit. 5 years ago Vicky became one of our very first Nowhere team members, and is now our amazing events coordinator. And then later Emily joined Nowhere and eventually became our fantastic bar manager. And sometime after meeting at Nowhere, they fell in love. This week we closed the store a little early so that Vicky and Emily could get married right here at Nowhere, in front of friends and family (and a gorgeous backdrop they made out of wooden pallets, books and fairy lights). These are the stories I hold close to my heart as we move into a new year. Sending love to the happy couple and to everyone reading this. The story never ends. Post navigation",
