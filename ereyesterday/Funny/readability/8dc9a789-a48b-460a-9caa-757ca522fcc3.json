  "description": "Do you remember it, feline fam? The beginning of the internet? If you're our age (born in the late Jurassic period) or older, you certainly do. During this time, your computer made a crazy sound to connect to the internet, and cats ruled the World Wide Web. Whole sites were built around them. They ruled Tumblr, recipe blogs, and literally everything else. Thus, I Can Has Cheezburger was born. We've been trying to keep cats on top of the internet since our founding, but with each new generation, the appreciation for our feline overlords gets weaker and weaker.But, we will never stop. Even if we have to call all the cat memes we used to laugh about in our childhood as \"ancient\" or \"nostalgic,\" we will keep sharing them with the internet. The children of today have to learn about what made their memes today funny. Cat memes walked so the future could run. Maybe these memes are 100% new to you, and if so, we hope you enjoy them. If you recognize some of them, welcome back, and we hope you enjoy this blast from the past.",
