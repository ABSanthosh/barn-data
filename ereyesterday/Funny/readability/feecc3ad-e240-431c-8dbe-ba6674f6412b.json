  "description": "If there is one thing we wish for this meowliday season, it's for every adoptable cat to find their furrever home and a hooman to love them. Doesn't that sound like the purrfect Christmas miracle, feline fam? Imagine every kitty around the world roasting their cute little toe beans next to the fireplace, all warm and fuzzy, sleeping like babies for the rest of their days. It's bringing a tear to our eyes just thinking about it, and the tears will continue to flow with this tear-jerking story from a warm, loving cat mom who shared a series of uplifting pictures documenting her and her rescue kitten's journey together.They didn't have the smoothest start. She rescued the scared, shy kitten, and it took them some time to warm up to each other. But, with patience and a lot of love, they were able to get through some difficult times together. Now, they share a pillow every night, and it makes us smile from ear to ear simply scrolling through it. So, if you need a wholesome meowliday story to tell your kids, tell them this one (and maybe find a way to put Santa in there somewhow…he's magical, he can do anything!).",
