It's like finding money in the street except the street is your paycheck, and there are security cameras everywhere.You know how they say good things come to those who wait? Well, sometimes they also come to those who accidentally receive payroll errors, leaving them trapped in a moral maze of their own sweaty-palmed making.Let's talk about someone who recently stumbled into the workplace equivalent of finding an extra $20 in their jeans - except it's every single paycheck. Our honest worker asked for a raise and was offered the somewhat insulting sum of 50 cents. But through what can only be described as divine intervention (or more likely, Karen from payroll having a particularly distracted Monday), they received a $4 raise instead.Now, while some might view this as karmic justice for all those unpaid overtime hours and missed lunch breaks, our conflicted friend is wrestling with their conscience. There's no paper trail, no signed documents, just an unexpected windfall that could disappear as quickly as it arrived.",
