  "text": "Spoiler alert: The grave didn’t talk back It sounds like a scene out of Jimmy Fallon’s Tonightmares, but it was actually part of something much scarier — Fallon’s tepid romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore, Fever Pitch. While filming the 2005 movie with the Farrelly Brothers, the Saturday Night Live veteran had an odd request: He wanted to spend some quality time talking to the grave of John Belushi.“I loved Belushi’s energy,” Fallon gushed to Howard Stern this week. “I love that he could sing. You guys would have been friends.”Sure, lots of people loved Belushi. But why did Fallon want to visit the dead? Mainly because he was nearby. “I go to Martha’s Vineyard, I’m at Peter Farrelly’s,” he remembered. “I go, Belushi’s grave is out here somewhere, like in the middle of a field.” Don't Miss Farrelly confirmed Fallon’s intel. “Do you want to go to it right now?” Visit the grave of an SNL legend? Fallon didn’t need to be asked twice. “This is the middle of the night, probably 10 o’clock at night,” remembered Fallon. “(Farrelly) goes, ‘Great, get a six-pack of beer out of the fridge and let’s just go right now.’”Fallon, Barrymore and Farrelly piled into the car and headed off into the night. “He dropped me off at Belushi’s grave, which is just a rock,” Fallon said. “And then he left, him and Drew took off. I was there for an hour.” A younger Stern would have goofed on Fallon for haunting a gravesite with a six-pack of Sam Adams, but the current-day version was impressed. “Did you sit down and have a conversation with Belushi and drink a beer?” Stern wondered. “I could see you doing that.” Of course, confirmed Fallon. But when Stern asked about the conversation, the Tonight Show host played coy at first. “I mean, it’s between me and John,” said Fallon about a story he clearly pitched to Stern’s producers during his pre-show interview. Like Carly Simon, who never revealed the subject of “You’re So Vain,” Fallon said, “I’ll never tell.” Then Fallon immediately told. “I just said thanks and I love him and I wish he was around,” he said. “I would love to talk to him. I’d love to hang out with him. I wanted to tell him that, you know, Saturday Night Live is doing well and people are still having fun and it’s the best show.”Stern interrupted with several “wows” but Fallon pressed on. “I was just talking to him. I don’t know if he could hear me or what,” he said. “I might go back. It was great — one-sided, but you know.”Fallon also revealed one more reason he stuck around that night and kept the conversation going with his idol: “There was no way home.”  Tags: News Scroll down for the next article SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
