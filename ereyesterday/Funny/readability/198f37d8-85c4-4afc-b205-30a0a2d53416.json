  "description": "Everyone likes to think that they're the exception to a rule, usually because they're so certain that they're so much better and smarter than everybody. The reality of the situation couldn't be further from the truth, and the truth is this: If you think you're the exception, the rule exists for you.This couldn't be truer than when it comes to parents who think that their kids should be an exception to \"child-free\" events, either bringing them anyway without saying anything or making some dramatic last stand that causes a rift throughout the entire family or friend group.This online discussion was one of the rarer ones in which the original poster and their narrative are picked apart by other members of the community who suspect that the poster isn't telling the whole truth. The mother posted, sharing how she felt hurt and excluded by the new \"no kids\" rule that her sister was enforcing for family events. She felt as if the rule was directed solely at her and her children—truth be told, it probably is. The sister had made comments about how her house wasn't \"kid-proof\" and that events weren't \"relaxed,\" which is basically a nice way of saying, \"Your kids are out of control and not respectful of my things or my home and so I'd prefer if you didn't bring them here.\" So, in a sense, the mother has every right to feel targeted here, but instead of causing a stink about it, she should probably take it on board and work on parenting her children to be invited back in the future.",
