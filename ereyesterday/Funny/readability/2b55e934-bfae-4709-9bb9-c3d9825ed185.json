  "text": "The Griefer’s got nothing on Kenny’s ‘90s digs While “Make Love, Not Warcraft” has long been heralded as one of South Park’s best episodes — one so good that series’ overlords Trey Parker and Matt Stone famously count it among their top three favorite installments — a few eagle-eyed fans spotted another detail that makes it truly one for the ages: Kenny’s terrible gaming setup.Last week, South Park fan Capital_Comedian_474 headed to the show’s subreddit with a new observation about the iconic episode: How Kenny’s massive 1990s computer yet again proves he’s much poorer than his pals.  Don't Miss “Anyone else notice Kenny has an old run-down computer?” they asked alongside a screengrab from the show, depicting the gang deep in their acne-ridden gaming K-hole, Kenny perched in front of his distinctly manila monitor.  The answer, as Capital_Comedian_474 quickly discovered, was a resounding “yes.” Shortly after hitting the subreddit, several fellow fans flocked to the comments, noting how they, too, noticed that Kenny’s retro World of Warcraft digs spoke to his family’s financial woes — ones explored several times throughout the long-running series.  “I’m surprised it even runs WoW,” observed TollyVonTheDruth, while neonokor noted how details like this have become a common thread throughout the series’ 26-year run. “Kenny always (has) either old or broken stuff,” they added. But beyond further proving his poverty, Kenny’s gaming station made sense for yet another reason: It likely gave him another way to die over and over and over and over again. “If you pay even closer attention during the leveling scene, you can see his frame lag as he’s jumping around whereas the other boys are running near-perfect,” added DarkMcChicken. Though Kenny’s retro computer seemingly made no difference when it came to putting Jenkins the griefer in his place, we’d be shocked if his ‘90s-ass setup didn’t lead to a few “Oh my God, they killed Kenny!”-s along the way.
