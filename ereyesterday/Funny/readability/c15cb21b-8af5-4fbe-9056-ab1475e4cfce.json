  "description": "So many time throughout our years of writing for ICHC, we have come across stories similar to this one. And while it is true that cats are truly aggressive and really do not want to hang with us humans, it seems that most aggressive cats just need some love. Some love and time and respect of their boundaries. Even the most aloof cat will show affection eventually. Even the most aggressive cat will make a turnaround if only given the chance. Oftentimes, the aggression is just a defense mechanism. It's a reaction based in fear. Cats need to feel comfortable with their people and in their environments, and for cats like the one in this video, who has been possibly abandoned and stuck in a shelter for so long, aggression is not something unexpected. But just like that - with a little bit of genuine love and care from the right people, this cat showed her true, sweet purrsonality.",
