  "description": "Trying to keep up with technology is turning out to be a little more difficult than we anticipated. We're young! We thought that this would be easy! And then AI happened, and it's continuing to happen, and we find ourselves having a little bit of a hard time keeping up. Or maybe we don't want to keep up. Maybe cat memes generated by AI are not the same as the hissterical cat memes that we are used to. Maybe the silly cat pictures that people keep generating using AI do not inspire us to laugh the same way that the old ones did. Maybe we don't always want to keep up, at least not with certain things. Not with cats. Cats and cat content are sacred and should not be messed with. And so, because we really feel like we all need this right now, we have put together some of the most classic and iconic cats of all time. To make you feel that meowgic again. And to give you a break from all the robot-generated content out there.",
