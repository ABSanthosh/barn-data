  "description": "Before we started writing for I Can Has Cheezburger, one of our biggest fears was our cats getting out and never coming back. However, one thing we've learned from all of these reunion stories is that you should never give up hope. Your lost cat may be closer than you think, and no matter how long you've been separated, they will still remember you. Whether it's four months, or they've been missing for over six years, there is always the pawssibility that your pet will find their way back to you.In the story below, the nanny accidentally let the cat out while retrieving a package. The pawrent searched frantically for four months. They tore apart their house to search every nook and cranny, they posted flyers, cried into the arms of strangers, and almost let their hope go. But then, they heard a meow in the middle of the night. They ran out, screaming his name, and there he was! There's a lot more to this beautiful reunion, so read the full story below!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
