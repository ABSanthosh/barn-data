  "description": "When you go to adopt an animal you're basically going to do a huge deed of love and care in the world. Adopting a new fluffy member to your family is, first of all, a wholesome thing to do, but most impawrtantly - a rescue. From either life in the shelter, or worse - in the streets. So setting your mind on this big responsibility is actually a noble deed, at least in our books. Most people will go for a puppy - they're cute, adorable little floofs, and it seems like everybody is adopting a puppy anyway, so why won't you?That was the exact thought of one couple who went to the local shelter - they wanted a puppy. Young, cute, and energetic. Now, it'd be a rather happy story if it ended there, with a couple adopting a precious pupper. But as we said - everybody adopts a puppy anyway… And they fell in love with someone else, who captured their hearts even though her adoption chances were far less great than those of a puppy. It happened because this one cat lady had actually chosen the couple, as many cats do. It's their inner Cat Distribution System memo.Instead of exiting the shelter with a puppy, they adopted an adult cat lady - Lily. They describe her as a \"cuddlebug lapcat\" - which was backed by picture evidence. The online feline family loved to hear about this heartwarming story, which also prompted other people to share some sweet stories about their own cats. Especially those with doggo siblings, which could've been the case with the sweet Lily of this post. Scroll below to read about this wholesome adoption story, and bask in the beauty of Lily, the cuddlebug.",
