  "description": "Time off is time OFF. This man's coworker didn't realize the importance of separation of church and state when it comes to the workplace and vacation time. Although they were happily enjoying their time away from the store, this retail worker just couldn't function without them…One of my first jobs was in retail, tagging T-shirts, folding jeans, and watching the clock tick down until my shift was over. Anyone who's ever worked in retail can attest that it's the sort of environment that takes the soul right out of you, one that begs to be left behind for greener pastures. So when this retail worker decided to take a well-deserved vacation to clear his mind of work follies and workplace drama, he expected to feel free of the shackles of the timecards, the repetitive Pandora station, and his coworker's neediness. However, with his personal cell number distributed around the sales floor, it was going to be hard to catch a break. Read on for the snarky fallout when this worker draws the line, protecting their work/life balance with a dash of salt and a whole lot of sass.",
