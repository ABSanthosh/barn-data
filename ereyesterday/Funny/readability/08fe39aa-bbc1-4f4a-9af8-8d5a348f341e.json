  "description": "We all have haters. Even if you try to live your life as a saint, spreading nothing but kindness wherever you go, there is always going to be someone who will have a problem with your existence. Yes, it's difficult to go through life without attaining a single hater, and so when that hater reveals themselves to you, it's best to think of it as a lifetime achievement. You must be doing something that's significant enough if someone else took the time to have an opinion on it. Be proud that you're doing something, at least!When we get a hater and they decide to make their problems a problem for you, that's where it gets tricky. One of the worst kinds of haters is a jealous one because a jealous person will do some outlandish things to see if they can get what they do not have. One girl faced that issue when her mom told the family that she would be changing her name to the same name that her daughter has. Sharing a name with your mom is one thing if it's a family legacy, but if your mom is taking your name to satisfy some itch inside of her? Now, that's a problem. See how this girl deals with it.",
