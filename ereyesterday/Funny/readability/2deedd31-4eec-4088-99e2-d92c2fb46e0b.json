  "description": "Workers will endure low pay, constant schedule changes, and even irritating coworkers, but if the boss doesn't have their back, they'll be heading for the door ASAP. Some workplaces are revolving doors of employees coming and going. No matter how diligent you are, or how much you value the work you're doing, you can count on that type of company culture to bring you down. When your workplace doesn't value you, you often try even harder to get some praise from your managers. But the longer you go without reaping any benefits from your work, the more you start to daydream about quitting. These people quit on the spot, because sometimes you just can't wait that two weeks. Plus, if your employer has stopped respecting you, there's no need to show them any respect in return, right? Up next, read about some people who are certainly having a worse day than you, like one person who shared that sadly, \"I brought muffins to work because of my birthday, 5 minutes later they told me I am fired.\"",
