  "description": "Some neighbors wave from across the street. Others lean into the \"it takes a village\" model with the subtlety of a SWAT team raid. But in this quiet cul-de-sac, the homeowner's association is run by a thirty-two-year-old mother with a toddler and zero grasp of boundaries.What started with an impromptu appearance at the backyard wedding (because who doesn't love wedding crashers?) soon escalated to unsolicited therapy sessions on the porch, tales of marital unhappiness, and the kind of trauma-dumping that makes the family dog want to call animal control.For the past year and a half, this neighborly performance art has reached new heights: two unannounced drop-ins a week, a talent for holiday crashing, and a sixth sense for popping by mid-Zoom call. There's no invitation, she's just \"catching you,\" because texting is for the weak.",
