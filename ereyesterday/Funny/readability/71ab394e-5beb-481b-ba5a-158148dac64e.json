  "description": "We have said it before, and we will say it again, cats choose their humans, not the other way around. And we have proof. In fact, we have endless proof. Stories come out every single day about cats showing up at random people's houses and simply… claiming these houses (and these people) as their own. And that is where it ends. There is no argument, there is no conversation about it. If you are chosen by the cat distribution system, then you will not have any option but to like it. That is you cat now, whether you wanted it or not, whether you like cats or not. That is what this person has learned when, out of nowhere, the CDS decided that it was time for them to be adopted. A cat showed up at their house, and that is where the story ended. They had no choice but to adopt, and they knew it. The knew of the CDS, so they simply decided to accept their fate, as they should, and enjoy their new feline companion.",

  "text": "It is as if the cat distribution system has a special kind of love for people who claim to not like cats. It keeps bestowing felines upon them. We think it does this just to prove them wrong. Cats enjoy that - they enjoy being right. It only makes sense that the system will follow this logic as well.  Totally normal, and maybe parts of it. The fact that you are looking up all of these things does not, in fact, point at your lack of knowledge or make us think that you shouldn't have a cat. It does the opposite. You care. And the CDS knew that would be the case.",
