  "text": "May 12, 2025 Mid-Air Concession My mind can do a couple neat tricks; this site is a kind of display case for the one or two novel maneuvers I got up top. One thing it definitely cannot do is know whether I'm going to be hungry or not hungry for a specific food at a particular time in the future. I can turn a blank sheet of paper into a place you can journey to but if a feat of imagination involves theoretical fruit and cheese it's simply beyond my ability to calculate. The Alaska Airlines app has a little indicator that tells me when it's time to start projecting myself into the future and I'm stymied by this interrogation immediately. A kaleidoscope of events and scenarios begins to whirl and flash, pinning me to the floor like one of the Great Cats. The next thing I know, the very next perceivable moment, I'm in the air and I'm thinking I could do with a bit of fruit and optimally, in a perfect universe? A little bit of cheese wouldn't do me no harm neither. A better, more useful way to assess it is probably: is there ever a time where I won't want fruit and cheese? That answer materializes in an instant, and it is a sharp \"no.\" I know exactly how to eat it, too - that ain't gonna be a problem. I have a hole in my face where I put things like this and it's always worked a treat. (CW)TB out.",
