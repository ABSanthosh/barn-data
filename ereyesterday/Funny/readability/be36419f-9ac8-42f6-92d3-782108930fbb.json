  "description": "We all want and need an advocate in the workplace, someone to have our backs in case other coworkers or authority figures start taking us for granted. Of course, in an ideal world, that's what human resources should be, but let's be realistic for a second. Human resources is all about protecting the company at the end of the day. Sure, they might project an image of solidarity with employees but always be careful not to be fooled by this facade.Now, this manager was against their boss's request to have their assistant come in and work on their requested day off, especially considering that this was all happening during Thanksgiving week! Just because employees can check their emails and Slack team chats on their phones, that does not mean they need to answer those missed calls and messages on their days off or even after their designated work hours. If you're someone who tends to feel guilted into being that responsive at all times, you might want to reconsider your work ethic so as to not give the impression that your employers can walk all over you. Time to find an advocate who will have your back!Keep scrolling below for the full story. For more, check out this post about a Karen coworker's temper tantrum.",
