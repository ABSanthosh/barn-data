Still, there are a lot of workers out there who just don't seem to care. One of the best stories here is about one creative employee who found a way to avoid working all day every day. Apparently he kept clocking in, disappearing all day, and then leaving at the end of the day. No one could figure out where he was, although he was definitely inside the building still. After a little sleuthing, the higher-ups finally realized that this dude had found an elevator shaft with a crawl space in it. He was spending 8 hours a day napping there! That's one of the most dangerous and most ingenious ways to get out of work ever… until the elevator needs maintenance, that is! At least that worker got discovered before he got hurt, and good for him for taking naps on company time (he's living the dream!). Scroll down to check out a bunch of great stories from HR professionals and employees who witnessed their coworkers getting fired. Then, this couple was dealing with a nosy neighbor, so they gave her exactly what she wanted so they'd fit into the neighborhood: \"We decorated.\"",
