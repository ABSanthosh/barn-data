  "description": "The cat distribution system works in mysterious ways. We think that every cat person who has heard of it knows this fact. It can catch you anytime and at any place. You can be someone who loves cats or someone who claims to hate cats. You can be going to a shelter and get adopted by the senior cat instead of the kitten you were looking for, or you could go on a hike and get adopted by a screaming kitten. And the CDS is not only limited to humans either. Sometimes, cats adopt dogs or other animals, and their connection is just as amazing as the one that you have with your cat.And that is pretty much what happened here. Sure, the kitten may have initially underestimated the dog's size and gotten a little spooked by it when he got closer, but what was meant to be happened. The CDS knew that this kitten belonged in this family before even the kitten himself knew it. And just like that, within a few days, the kitten and the doggo that he chose became best friends.",
