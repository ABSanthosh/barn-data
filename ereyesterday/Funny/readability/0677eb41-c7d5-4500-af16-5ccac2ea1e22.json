  "description": "What kind of stepmother holds a grudge against someone because of a choice they made when they were 11? Well, the short answer to that question is this Redditor's stepmom, but the longer answer is someone so self-absorbed and out-of-touch that they have no ability to step outside of their own experience,This Redditor was dealing with the sudden loss of her biological mother right before her father's second wedding. Obviously, that is a lot of emotional turbulence for a pre-teen to endure, but apparently, none of the adults involved were able to comprehend that, especially the kid's dad and future stepmom. What makes this story even more frustrating is that the stepmom never forgave the Redditor and never let her live it down. In fact, she seemed to make up all sorts of lost opportunities that were \"supposed to happen\" at the wedding if she were present, like a stepsister dance. Essentially, this grown adult was turning her daughter on her stepkid and completely ignoring the state of grief the Redditor was in at the time.Keep scrolling below to see how the Redditor finally confronted her dad and stepmom over all this nonsense. For more stories like this, take a look at this post about a family disagreement on a plane.",
