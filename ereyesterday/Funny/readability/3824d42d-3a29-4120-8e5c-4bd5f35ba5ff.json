  "description": "One of the things that we love the most about itty bitty kittens is that no one can resist their cuteness. Absolutely no one. You can be the meanest, buffest, scariest looking human, and once you see a kitten, you will just melt. We all turn into fluffy marshmallows when a kitten shows us even the smallest bit of attention. It's the only thing that explains why so many buff men fall in love with kittens. Because they can't help it. And kittens seem to love those buff dudes just as much as the dudes love them. And you know what? We love all of it. The kittens, the buffness, the combination of the two. We can't resist it either. So when we saw this video coming across our timeline, it just- hit. A tiny fur-ball kitten asks huge, kind dude to become his mom, and what do you know? It happens. Just like that. Irresistible. And to top it all off, the two of them do everything together- all the way up to and including going to the gym.",
