  "description": "What is the point of coming to a pizza restaurant if you cannot eat any of the classic pizza ingredients? We're not talking about disliking olives, pepperoni, or other kinds of toppings. We're talking about someone who can't eat tomatoes or cheese. To make matters worse, this entitled customer had the audacity to type up an overly dramatic letter to give to the server and kitchen staff of said pizza establishment detailing everything that might happen if he were given cheese, tomatoes, or other ingredients that he cannot eat. Let's just say that the letter was not sparse in the details of this customer's dietary restrictions and the consequences of not following them. Still, the only way to make this simpler for all involved would be if this person sought out a cuisine or restaurant that had items on the menu that he could actually eat. These were not simple modifications, and if anyone should be making any adjustments here, it should be the customer!",
