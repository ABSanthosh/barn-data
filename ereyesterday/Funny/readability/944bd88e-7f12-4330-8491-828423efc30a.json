  "description": "Hello, cat pawrents. Do you enjoy your weekend so far? And what about your cat - does your cat enjoy having you all for themselves on the weekend? Because if we know cats, which we do, we think they'd want you to sass up your Sunday and have an extremely silly and cat-filled weekend. To sass up your Sunday and fill it with cats, you need to surround yourself with as many cats as pspspssible. The more cats you have around you - the more sass your Sunday will catch, creating a sassy weekend vibe for you. Just as your cat intends.Now, we know you might not be a crazy cat lady with 20 cats to meet the Sunday sass demand - and that's okay. Not everyone can be a successful crazy cat lady. But you can do another thing that's also a solution for meeting your cat's demands for sass - and that is with sassy Sunday cat memes. They're best for cat pawrents sassing out their Sunday for their cats.",
