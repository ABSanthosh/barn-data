  "text": "I remember seeing the first corporate entreaties about AI that had jumped containment and been posted online. They were not gentle, but they weren't overtly hostile: how have you used AI this week to accomplish your tasks? If you squint a little, you can see kind of a weird visage in the negative space. The newer ones I've seen are a little more like placing a loaded gun on the table before you speak. Why haven't you? I think the third evolution of this dialogue is just you getting locked out of Slack, with a mysterious meeting placed on your calendar for later that day. I wouldn't say my ordinary mode of consciousness is particularly calibrated, but these things make me think I'm cuckoo for fucking Cocoa Puffs. I have to describe events in florid terms sometimes because I have a mental condition, but I feel like the substrate is eminently practical. The whole shit is literally just ordinary, five cents a word, big idea sci-fi from the sixties. If the tributaries human beings travel to mastery are foreclosed - or automated, as here - the food source these models require to progress dries up. In the meantime, the damage this myopic replacement has inflicted is incalculable. It's just incredibly dangerous, to say nothing of boring, to dismiss this stuff. And not just because it would hurt my feelings very badly! There are those who wear the Luddite badge with pride now, and I'm aware that the history of that movement is perhaps more sophisticated than the History Written By The Victor would suggest. That's where we're at, now. I don't know how many more people need to lose their jobs before we start thinking about the first, most obvious ramifications of the Managed Age. (CW)TB out.",
