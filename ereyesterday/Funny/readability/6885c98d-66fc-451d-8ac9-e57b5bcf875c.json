Sure, some of them might dissociate and make a mess. But we can ultimately clean up the bodily fluids and ecstasy the next day. The important thing is we know where they are. Otherwise, I’m just going to stay up all night worrying.” Peck added that she thought hosting a freak-off could also be a powerful learning experience for her kids about how to responsibly contain legal fallout from such a night through NDAs.
