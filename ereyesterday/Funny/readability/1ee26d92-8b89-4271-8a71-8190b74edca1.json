  "text": "Some MAGA supporters are turning on President Trump after he walked back campaign promises to declassify information about deceased financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Here is everything you need to know about the Epstein files. Q: Why are people so interested in the Epstein case? A: It’s the only example of money and power influencing an otherwise just legal system. Q: What’s the difference between Epstein’s client list and his alleged black book? A: The black book includes alternate cover art, gilded page edges, and a foreword by actor Kevin Spacey. Q: Is Donald Trump named in the Epstein files? A: There is no record of Epstein’s best friend hanging out with him. Q: Does a cabal of super-rich pedophiles really exist? A: It’s more of a loose friend group. Q: Who was president when Epstein mysteriously died in prison? A: The alleged suicide took place in between the end of Obama’s second term and the beginning of the Biden administration. Q: How does the Department of Justice plan to release the files? A: They will pin the list onto the White House bulletin board like a high school theater cast announcement.",
