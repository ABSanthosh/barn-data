  "text": "Lego submissions are showing two front-runners to represent the sketch show For those not familiar with the world of Legos, you may not be aware that there’s an entire platform dedicated to submissions for new Lego sets the company should sell. Called Lego Ideas, the site is home to fan-made creations awaiting the opportunity for mass production. Some of the top submissions at the moment include a scene from One Direction’s “That’s What Makes You Beautiful” music video, and the Cullen house from Twilight, which is actually now available to purchase as a Lego set. Right now, there’s also a heated race between two different concepts for Saturday Night Live’s Studio 8H. First reported on by Late Nighter, each set presents 8H in a slightly different interpretation. The first, “50 Years of Saturday Night Live,” was submitted by YouTuber Jon Sosis and former SNL cast member Bobby Moynihan back in January. It includes recreations of the Weekend Update desk, the studio and a few other iconic scenes from iconic sketches like “Wayne’s World” and “Target Lady.” The second submission, “Live From New York, It’s Saturday Night!” is from a creator named IAssembleMastiffs, which focuses on the main stage at Studio 8H, the one where every host stands as they deliver their monologue. Standing on the stage are seven Lego figures that represent the original cast members from 1975: Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd, John Belushi, Jane Curtain, Garrett Morris, Laraine Newman and Gilda Radner.  Don't Miss This set was submitted just a month after the first, in February. “Why is this set special to me?” IAssembleMastiffs wrote in their description of their submission. “Aside from the 50th anniversary being a wonderful time to design and build this Saturday Night Live set. Yes, I am a child of the 70s. I have fond memories of staying up late, watching SNL with my brother. We sat on the floor, in front of the Zenith and laughed along with everyone else.”  Both are well-timed; with SNL celebrating its 50th anniversary, nostalgia is at an all-time high. But, even though both sets have been submitted, there’s no guarantee that either will ever make it to mass production. In order to be considered, they’d need to receive 10,000 supporters from the Lego Ideas community. At that point, it would be reviewed by the company before getting a finalized design and going into production. That’s a long way off right now. IAmMastiffs has 357 votes, and Moynihan and Sosis have 614 votes, and they need to reach 1,000 supporters in less than 235 days in order to maintain eligibility to be mass produced. If either goes into production, the creator or creators will get a 1 percent royalty on sales of the supported Lego set. You too can vote for “Live From New York, It’s Saturday Night!” and “50 Years of Saturday Night Live” on the Lego Ideas website. You just have to make an account first. Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
