  "description": "This homeowner got fired up after lamenting about his HOA fee-paying app online, only to find out that his exorbitant fees were amounting to nothing, instigating an all-out rebellion against his HOA board. Some HOAs can be helpful–managing landscaping maintenance, communal pools, and barbecue areas–but more often than not, they're a power vacuum and a money dump for homeowners who don't actually get a say in how their money is spent. I live in a complex with an HOA fee and until recently, we only paid a couple hundred dollars a month, which seemed entirely fair as they paid for all of the plant care, the pool, and other facilities (like the gym and BBQs). So I understand the rage this guy felt when the homeowner in our next story, who was strapped to a $600/month payment to his HOA, discovered that his fees went to absolutely nothing. Naturally, he snapped and went full-anarchist. Keep scrolling for the rage-inducing tale that'll leave you questioning your own HOAs ethics.",
