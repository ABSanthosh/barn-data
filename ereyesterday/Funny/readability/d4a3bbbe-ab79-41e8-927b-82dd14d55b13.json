  "description": "After spending weeks, months, or even years trying to get on a paperless documentation trail, somehow I still keep getting spam advertising in my mailbox. Despite my efforts to unsubscribe and remove myself from ad lists, the pamphlets just keep coming! Because of this, spamvertising has a bad effect on me. Although companies want to be renowned in the neighborhood, hoping for increased traffic based on notoriety, if I'm ever receiving 50 pages per month of ads from your company, be sure that I will NEVER set foot in your establishment—Just on principle. The guy in the next story had his fill of spamvertising and couldn't take it anymore. But fortunately he found a way to make all of those incessant cold calls, billboards, bench ads, and mailbox flyers worth it—by reaping their rewards.",
