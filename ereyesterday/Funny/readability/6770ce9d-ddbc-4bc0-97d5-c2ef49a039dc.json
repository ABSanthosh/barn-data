They found a way to charm the \"smartest species on the planet\" into taking care of them, paying for their every need, and basically doing whatever they want them to do. They are the real financial gurus you should be following on Instagram. They pay for their rent with snuggles, get their food delivered to them every day with pawsitively impeccable service, and have people make digital feline funnies in their honor literally every day.So, if you're looking to improve your financial status, look no further than these hilarious cat memes that could purrfectly double as financial advice. Well, sort of. Come to think of it, we actually pay for all of those things for them. Basically, the moral of these memes is that if you need something, you need to convince another hooman to do it for you. They just pay for it with snuggles and occasional affection. Maybe they're not so helpful after all. Oh well, at least they're hissterical!",
