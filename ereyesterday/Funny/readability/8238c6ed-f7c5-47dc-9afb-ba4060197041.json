  "description": "When you've suffered through job hunting and interview processes to finally make it to the point of an offer, it's disheartening to realize that the wool has been pulled over your eyes… That there's actually been no chance at a job at all: they're just fishing to find someone desperate enough for a job that they can be properly exploited. Still, it's better than actually starting the job before the red flags start to pop up—at least marginally. This candidate reached the point of actually laughing in the interviewer's face when they were presented with an offer that they found to be—well, laughable. Everything seemed all well and good during the process; the gig was full-time as advertised despite not guaranteeing those hours. The point of issue came when the interviewer began describing the company's travel policy, as, you see, travel would be necessary for the role. As it turns out, the company expected their staff to share hotel rooms with complete strangers while traveling for work, which prompted the candidate's uncontrollable outburst. This, of course, put a quick end to the interview as the candidate then hurried to share what had just happened online.",
