  "text": "Seyfried says she’s ‘a little resentful’ that she doesn’t get paid for T-shirts with her picture on them You can’t just ask someone why they’re white, and you can’t just ask Paramount why Amanda Seyfried hasn’t seen a check for all those t-shirts with her face on them.In 2004, a movie premiered that would change the way Americans talked about high school forever while catapulting some of its stars straight to the A-list. To an entire generation of Millennial moviegoers, Mean Girls is the defining film of the high school experience, and its legacy continues to impact today's teenagers, who are still trying to make fetch happen. For Seyfried, who played the air-headed, weather-watching Karen Smith, Mean Girls was her feature-film debut, and it introduced her to audiences who would continue filling theaters for her over the next decade as she starred in giant blockbusters such as Mamma Mia! and Les Misérables.But while many of Seyfried’s biggest films became massive, marketable successes, her first big break didn’t break the bank for her when it came to merchandising. Today, you can find Seyfried’s image and likeness as Karen on t-shirts, posters and Funko Pops, but as she revealed in a recent talk with fellow Jennifer’s Body star Adam Brody for Variety, she doesn't know where the proceeds of all that lucrative Mean Girls merchandizing goes.  Don't Miss I guess her fifth sense still hasn't told her when she's going to get her cut. As Seyfried shockingly revealed during the talk, she has never rewatched Mean Girls despite how it changed her life and career forever. “It’s on often enough though,” Seyfried said of the classic comedy, \"I love it.\" “I really love seeing my face on people’s T-shirts,” Seyfried insisted, although, “I’m a little resentful because Paramount still owes me some money for the likeness.” As Seyfried explained, “Every store sells Mean Girls T-shirts with our faces. Don’t I (get something from that)? Even the girl at TSA tells me it’s her favorite movie.”While Seyfried understandably didn't dive into the details of her Mean Girls contract, it's certainly surprising that one of the stars of a massively successful, massively merchandised blockbuster never received compensation for all the ill-fitting shirts and plastic chachkies that bear her image. It's like if Karen wore that mouse costume but didn't give a single cent to a cat. Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
