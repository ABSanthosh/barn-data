  "description": "This employee turned into a vigilante within the ranks of his company after squirreling a bit of knowledge about the company's ACTUAL profits after a dismal company meeting. Turns out, they were trying to hoodwink the whole company into thinking they were taking a catastrophic loss when they were actually hitting record profits. The shareholders aren't going to like this…Every time an employee tries to negotiate a raise, the company is going through a 'downturn in profits' or a 'shift in salary budgeting' that allows them to shuffle off the lowly hard workers at the bottom. We're just looking for a 5% pay increase to cover inflation so we can buy groceries without taking a proverbial pay cut, but okay, if the company is drowning, I suppose saying no to a raise is better than getting fired, right? Well, the dude in this next story was fed up with the lies from his company and decided to get even with the higher-ups by revealing actual profit margins with his coworkers, giving everybody the leverage they needed to negotiate a respectable raise, akin to what the shareholders might be pocketing.",
