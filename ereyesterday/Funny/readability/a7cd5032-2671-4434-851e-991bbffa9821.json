  "description": "Job interviews are stressful as it is. You wonder if employers can smell desperation, if you're even qualified enough for the role you're interviewing for, and what the heck \"business casual\" even is. That's a serious question. What is it?…The worst part of a job interview is usually the nervousness you feel before the interview, and once the questions start rolling, a wave of relief washes over you like a welcoming ripple in a heated wave pool. All of your preparation and efforts amounted to this moment, and you have yourself to thank for your great answers. Unfortunately for the job seeker in this story, they didn't even get that far before hitting the road.If you're asked about unpaid overtime the moment the interview begins, run for the hills. This is not a drill. Though a paycheck seems golden at first, you'll end up on some other Reddit thread talking about how toxic your workplace is and how to get the heck out. Save yourself some time and scroll below to read the conversation commenters are having about salaries, hourly pay, and overtime.",
