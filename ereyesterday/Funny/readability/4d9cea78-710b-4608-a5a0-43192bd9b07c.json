  "description": "We don't know how many times we have said it, but we will keep saying it until it sinks in for everyone - it's the cats that choose the humans, not the other way around. You only think that you are the one making the choice when you walk into an adoption center, looking around and trying to decide which cat is the one that would fit into your home the best. But in reality, behind your back, the Cat Distribution System is working its meowgic, and while you are browsing cats, the cats are browsing you back. There is no such a thing as adopting the \"wrong\" cat. Because if the cat chose you, then that was no mistake. And that's what this person learned the hard way in this thread. There was no \"wrong\" cat in this story. Everything happened the way that it was meant to, and everyone ended up happy.",
