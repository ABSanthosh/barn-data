  "description": "Hello, geeky cat pawrents! How was your weekly D\u0026D session? Did your cat run over the miniatures on the map to become the new BBEG of the campaign? And how about that board game night you have been planning for months? Did your cat eat the dice again…? Besides a recommendation to have a vet check-up at this point, for us it sounds about right - every geeky cat pawrent deals with these situations. But what can we do? We love our cat dearly, but also Balthazor, our level 14 orc warlock that we play with our group of D\u0026D friends. He also has a cat familiar.But, you know? There are plenty of wholesome moments that involve a geeky lifestyle with cat pawrenting. You probably experienced cozying up in a favorite spot with a favorite book, and your cat comes up to snuggle on your lap. Or you make a geeky movie night with friends, and your cat comes to you all to make biscuits on the couch. These are some of our favorite feline moments, truly.",

They were mainly wizards up until now, specializing in cham magic with a minor specialization in transmutation magic - to fit and sit anywhere they want. When you roll a 1 on your illusion magic and your shadow betrays your performance. Careful there, plan ahead better for your next turn, you meowgical creature. Maybe try to roll for diplomacy next round to see how you get out of this situation…",
