Using JQuery, they check which browser is reported- I suspect JQuery is grabbing this from the user-agent string- and then its version. And if the version has a 1 in its first digit, we apply a \"fix\" for \"compatibility\". I guess it's a good thing there will never be more than 9 versions of Firefox. I mean, what version are they on now? Surely the version number doesn't start with a \"1\", nor has it started with a \"1\" for some time, right?
