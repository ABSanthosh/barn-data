  "text": "Published: February 12, 2025 WASHINGTON—Stressing that he was open to going far higher to close the deal, Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced Wednesday that he had made an unsolicited $97.4 billion offer to acquire respect. “This is a very important opportunity for me, and as such I’m willing to put forward considerable capital towards procuring just a modicum of respect,” said the billionaire in a social media post, which went on to explain that he saw acquiring respect as just “one small step” toward the broader goal of being seen as a serious person. “As you’re aware, I was actually in a position of high esteem just a few years ago. That’s why I’m a perfect candidate to acquire respect now. Of course, this is just my opening offer.
