  "description": "There's a lot to be scared of in today's world. Monsters under your bed, the dark, probably a spider lurking under your couch, or whatever else floats your fear boat. With all this anxiety swirling around, is it any wonder that one employee is spiraling over a seemingly innocent lunch invitation from his boss?  Let's set the scene: the boss is traveling 300 kilometers just for lunch, and then heading right back, no small talk, no sightseeing—just a single meal with one terrified employee wondering which bombshell will be dropped with the appetizer. Is it a promotion? A demotion? Is the couch spider stealing his job? These thoughts are understandable when you're invited to the managerial version of a surprise party—except instead of balloons, there's an ominous \"we need to talk\" vibe hanging in the air.",
