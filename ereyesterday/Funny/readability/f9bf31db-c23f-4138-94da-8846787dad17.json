That random client who spent 5 minutes Googling the issue, and who now wants to berate you for not solving the problem in a timely manner. This seems to be especially true for those who work in the IT field. Even though a lot of people aren't especially good at navigating their computer issues, they'll still snap at the very people who are trying to help them. Apparently, a lot of people will refuse to check if their computer is plugged in, which is one of the first questions an IT person will ask if a computer won't start up. To work around this, the IT guy will ask them to check something on the prong of the computer cord, which allows the customer or client to save face if their device wasn't plugged in. For other issues, they tend to easily solve things that an average Joe could never figure out. That didn't make this client act nicely towards his IT person, and he ended up paying a huge price for that decision. Next, read about one person who was so inspired by their HOA's rules that they got petty about their parking situation: \"My HOA will learn that I absolutely live by the letter of the law.\"",
