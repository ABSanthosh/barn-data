  "description": "If you get to the point in a relationship where you're forced to give your partner an ultimatum, you might as well throw in the towel right then and there. It shouldn't have to be a completely life-changing decision to get what you need, and if you aren't getting what you need, you should probably just get up and go! Sure, the pressure of an ultimatum could help you achieve happiness faster, but couldn't you flip a coin, too? Makes a pros and cons list? Maybe this is an unpopular opinion to have, but ultimatums feel like the option for people who haven't made a single decision for themselves in their lives.There are situations, too, that are too delicate for people to be throwing ultimatums around. Take this man, for example, whose wife made him the ultimatum of either adopting his daughter so his ex-wife and mother of his child stay out of their lives for good or getting a divorce. Honey, if you were that pressed about an ex being involved, you should've thought about that before you married a man with a kid! But I digress… why don't you read their story and make your opinion on ultimatums, et. al.",
