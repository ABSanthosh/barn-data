I’m not what I used to be, after all. Some days I don’t even have the energy to swat shots into the bleachers or get up in a ref’s face and argue about a trivial call. Time is of the essence here. I just don’t want my grandchildren to see me as a helpless old man barely able to dunk from the free-throw line.” At press time, James was urging Bronny’s girlfriend to put a basketball under her shirt so he could imagine how being a grandfather felt for a moment.
