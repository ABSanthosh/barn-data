  "description": "Some kids are too smart for their own good. This teen is also too entrepreneurial for her own good!Even from a young age, some children just crave money. It's hard not to, since money buys basically everything good in this world. However, kids don't always know that there are ethical ways to make some cash, and ways to make some money that are a bit shady. That kid is so desperate to buy the newest game or some snacks that they might start pilfering from their classmates or stealing pocket money from their siblings. This person is infuriated at their 17-year-old niece, who may be old enough to know that what she's doing is completely unacceptable. It's a truly incredible story, as u/Kind-Yesterday-3237 told the people of the r/AmItheA****** subreddit. They shared that they're a long-time perfume collector, with some costing hundreds of dollars. Their niece not only broke in and stole some of the perfumes, decanting them into other containers for herself, but she turned it into a full side hustle that should make her mom worry about her future. Even though she stole hundreds of dollars worth of perfumes, her mother is taking a very laissez-faire approach to it all. Check it all out below, and see if you think the original poster is doing the right thing with her sister and niece.Next up, this cosmetics store employee realized that a nurse she was interviewing for a part-time job wanted the unbelievable salary of… $55 per hour!",
