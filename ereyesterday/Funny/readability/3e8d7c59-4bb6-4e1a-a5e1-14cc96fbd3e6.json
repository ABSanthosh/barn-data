They’ve got pompadours, bouffants, bangs: hairstyles as far as the eye can see. Why, they’ve probably never even heard of a comb-over. And oh, look, even the dogs have perfectly shampooed and volumized fur.” According to reports, a mournful Richmond then tore his eyes away from the scene as the family began giving each other blowouts and loudly reminiscing about their favorite trips to the barbershop.
