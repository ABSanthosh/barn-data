  "description": "\"I'm not a cat person but…\" We don't know how many times we have heard this phrase already. There is always a \"but\" coming after those words. Because cats don't care whether you're a cat person or not, if the choose you, they you will have no choice but to accept them. Dads can say they \"hate cats\" all they want, but it takes just that one kitten to change their minds. Moms can say they want nothing to do with cats all day every day, but before long, you will catch them cuddling with the felines. It's the cat's plans that matter. And that was true in this story as well. This kitten has chosen to get adopted not only by someone who is \"not a cat person\" but also by that person's two dogs, and guess what? They are all getting along purrfectly right meow - the kitten, the dogs, and the person who can no longer claim to not like cats. Yup, this happens every single time.",
