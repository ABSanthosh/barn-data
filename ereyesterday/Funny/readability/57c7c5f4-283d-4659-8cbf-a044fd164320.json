  "description": "Many parents have to beg their children to pick up a book, but some have the exact opposite issue: They can't get their kids to stop reading! When you get really into reading as a child, you want to read all the time. Whether you're reading under the table at dinner time, or sneaking a flashlight into your room to read under the covers, you'll find any scrap of time to read. It's addicting to be engrossed in a fascinating mystery or a horror book. It's also a lot better than playing endless video games or spending an entire day on an iPad. The kids are enriching their own knowledge and growing their vocabulary. In contrast, some parents cannot get their kids to read at all. Their kids will just throw the books down in frustration, or give up before they get a chapter in. It's like pulling teeth! So having a kid who loves to bury their head in a book is usually seen as a good thing. But one grandma is butting heads with her daughter-in-law over her daughter's reading habits. Grandma thinks she's reading too much during a beach vacation! Luckily for this little girl, her family had her back. Up next, read about the neighbors who kept disagreeing over their shared fence, with one frustrated dude saying, \"[My] neighbor was petty... I'm going to make him replace his whole fence.\"",
