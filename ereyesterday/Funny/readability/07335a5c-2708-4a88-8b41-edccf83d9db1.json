Obviously, we’re not saying to gobble up every sticky bun you find nestled ominously in the branches of a sycamore tree, but in moderation, trails of sweets can absolutely be part of an overall healthy diet.” The nutritionists also noted that bog crones with high cholesterol levels are known to fatten up their victims two belt sizes before eating them.
