  "description": "Merry Christmas, everyone! Yes, you have finally made it here. We know. We cannot believe it either. It feels like we have been waiting for an entire year for this merry day to come again, like every hurdle we have passed led us a little closer to this beautiful, meowgical, purrfect day. And now, we're here. Finally. The morning after, and the first thing that we want to do - no, the first thing that we need to do… is start our morning with some purrfectly cheerful cat memes. Because hey, even Christmas morning has to start on the right paw, and some funny cat memes first thing are the best way to do it. In this sense, Christmas morning is no different. Silly cat memes like these kept us going while we waited for this day to come, and they will keep helping us thrive in the new year as well. So, enjoy these memes, friends, and happy holidays!",
