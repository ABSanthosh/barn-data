  "description": "Being a second-semester senior in high school can feel pretty pointless. After all, you have worked tirelessly for three-and-a-half years only to find yourself having to take more classes and assessments. On top of that, you probably have already figured out your future at this point, so you are truly \"one step in and one step out.\" Maybe you're making your college plans or you have a job lined up. Regardless, it can feel useless to take more classes where the grades don't really lead to anything.Now, you may be asking yourself: \"what about the magic of learning?\" If we want to fulfill our students in that way, we should reconsider our entire approach to that final semester. Perhaps we should allow all students to pursue independent studies so that they are still in school but they are also pursuing intellectual engagement and fulfillment in subject they are actually interested in… just a thought!Keep scrolling below for this student's second-semester senior drama!",
