  "description": "Hey there friends and feline enthusiasts. Losing a beloved pet is one of the most heartbreaking experiences a family can go through. It creates a space in your home and your heart that feels impossible to fill. So when a tiny, scrappy kitten appeared in the yard just days after this family lost their sweet dog, it felt like more than a coincidence. It felt like something bigger.For two weeks, they fed him every night, unsure if he had a home or if he would let them get close. Eventually, they were able to bring him inside, where a vet confirmed he was just 12 weeks old and born the very same week their dog had passed. Covered in dirt and severely underweight, he clearly needed a family just as much as they needed him.They named him Franklin, and over the past five months, he has settled into their lives like he was meant to be there all along. From play-fighting with their other dog to sleeping on his human's chest every night, Franklin has become a source of joy and healing. His soft purrs and tiny coos are daily reminders that sometimes the universe delivers exactly what you need right when you need it most. And now our hearts have been officially warmed.",

He has been a light in our lives we really needed and we consider him to be a special delivery. We’ve had him five months now and he and our other dog have become such good buddies. They play together (mostly just batting their paws at each other or Frank knighting my dog haha) and we’ve even caught them snuggling a few times!We’re so happy the CDS chose us right when we needed it! He sleeps on my chest or between my legs every night, and I love his purrs and coos. Fwank is such a good kitty and we love him so much!\"Pupper: \"I miss my roomate and buddy.\"Kitteh: \"I need a home, and love.\"Pupper: \"Welcome aboard, kiddo.\"",
