  "description": "When invited to a wedding, you usually have at least an idea of what to expect, and the things you are unsure about are usually stated on the invite or simple questions for the bride or groom. Now, imagine you have a rich uncle who has spared no expense for all of his sons weddings. He has three kids, and the first two weddings were extravagant ceremonies with lots of food, fun, and memories to be made. And now the third son is getting married! You must be excited for the wedding—since the last two were so exciting.  And yet… You walk into a sterile-looking office building with unclothed tables, no decorations, and no meals. Just a cookie or ice cream. Like, wait, what? What happened?! You'd think if the kid was trying to make a point, it would be more clear. Right now it just appears like the uncle hates his youngest, even though nobody would ever think that of the kind man. So what's happening?  Well, ask this guy, because that's exactly what went down in their family.",
