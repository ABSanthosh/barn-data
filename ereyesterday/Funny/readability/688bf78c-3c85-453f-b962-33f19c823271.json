  "description": "Hey, new manager—haven't you heard? The workforce always knows best.Managers always come in thinking they have to prove themselves to the suits upstairs. Hungry for power and wanting to wield their new workplace capabilities, managers tend to step on the toes of the workforce, stomping down old traditions that were steadfast for a reason. Perhaps if the nitpicky manager in this next story had heeded the warnings of the senior paramedics he was attempting to control, he might have saved the company $1000s in overtime wages. These paramedics were no strangers to working hard. Regularly clocking 12-hour shifts, they'd come back from the field exhausted and ready to tap in their relieving EMTs. However, this manager seemed to think that the 30-minute \"gentleman's agreement\" that the teams had forged over the years was an entirely superfluous practice. But after abolishing it, the manager ate his words and found himself hemorrhaging cash every pay period in the form of absurd overtime hours.",
