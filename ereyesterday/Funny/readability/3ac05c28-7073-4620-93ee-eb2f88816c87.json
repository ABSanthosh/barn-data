  "description": "This person is in a delicious dilemma with an unappreciative classmate. Growing up, I knew someone who worked at a donut chain. This is an awesome perk for so many reasons: they snagged us free drinks and free donuts constantly. It's hard to overstate just how many free donuts we all got! This person could routinely bring 2 or 3 dozen donuts home just because they felt like it. Sadly, at the end of the day at many bakeries, all the leftover donuts go straight into the garbage bin. We're not just talking like 10 donuts: some places routinely waste dozens of donuts. Instead of donating them, they go straight into a dumpster. So employees can take as many pastries home with them as they want, letting everyone in their life have a few delicious donuts. This high schooler was trying to share that wealth with their classmates, but it wasn't really working out, thanks to one classmate who felt it was her job to schedule out the snack days. Who even cares about that? Just enjoy the treats!Next, read about this overworked IT employee who had to stand up to their boss after they were given \"an impossible task.\"",
