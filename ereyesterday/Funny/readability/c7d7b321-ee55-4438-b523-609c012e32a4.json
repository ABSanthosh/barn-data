  "description": "There's a pretty simple rule when it comes to parking in a neighborhood: don't block driveways. Heck, it's polite to even make sure that you leave an adequate amount of room (at least a couple of feet) next to the driveway so that the people who live there can get in and out of their homes unencumbered. While there are grey areas for this kind of thing, it's definitely right out and crossing a line to just up and park in front of someone's driveway. It sort of boggles the mind why someone would think that was ok, but well... here we are. Even if you're just sitting in your car like the person in this story, it's definitely not an ok thing to be doing. Especially when you're then politely asked to move by a resident and then go back to texting on your phone, you should probably reconsider what the heck it is you're doing with your life.",
