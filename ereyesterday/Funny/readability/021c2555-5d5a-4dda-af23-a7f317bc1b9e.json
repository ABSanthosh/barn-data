  "description": "This bride took to social media to address something that happened at her wedding, but she then quickly deleted the post. That's because she never addressed her family members about the issue in person! Awkward… What did she think was going to happen? Did she think they'd read the post, scoff at it, and then go on their way? Hardly, as you can read about in u/throwrathefinances's story below. As this woman shares, she and her daughter were a big part of her cousin Dana's wedding ceremony. Her daughter, at the young age of 16, was asked to perform a dance at the ceremony. While wearing all white is typically frowned upon at weddings, the bride dressed the dancer up in all white and approved her dance. But when the big day came, things didn't quite go as the bride expected. She seems to think that her family member took away the spotlight from her. But who was shining the spotlight? If the bride really wanted all eyes on her for 100% of the night, she probably shouldn't have arranged a dance performance in the first place. She then handled it poorly by posting about it online… Check out the full story, plus updates, below to see if you side with the bride or the dancer. Next, read about the way this traveler outsmarted an airport security worker to get their luggage onto the plane.",
