  "description": "This couple is facing some major side-eyes after realizing they wouldn't have enough money to tip on their bill. No one can agree who's right and who's wrong here. If you only have $30 in the budget for food, and you spend about that much on your meal, well, now you're stuck. There's no room left to tip your server. Should someone in this situation be obligated to tip? Maybe someone with a very limited budget still deserves a nice night out… but there are also plenty of fast-casual restaurants that don't have servers, or a nice buffet where you serve yourself, or even just getting some fast food and taking your food to a nice park. You can always spruce up a meal, and you don't need to stiff your servers on tips in order to do so. Read this person's story below, and then read the numerous different responses from people who think they were wrong to people who think they actually did nothing wrong. Next up, read about this delivery courier who waited patiently for 100 minutes in order to maliciously comply: \"The time stamp was 3:03 so I was definitely not late.\"",
