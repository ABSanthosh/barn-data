  "description": "The interview process is a long and arduous one for both sides, really, and the last thing anyone wants is for their time to be wasted after such a long process. The relief that comes after simultaneously finally securing a role or finally having someone to fill an empty position on the team is understated, turning energies next towards developing and furthering the burgeoning relationship. While you can expect a lot of anxiety on the first day on the part of the candidate, the last thing you expect is to actually be fired on or before your first day—let alone three mere hours after being hired and shown around the office.Yet, that's what happened to this candidate when they received an email from their would-be new employer hours after signing on with the company and being toured around their offices, informing them that there had been changes to the \"circumstances\" of their position and the person they were supposed to be replacing had decided to stay on, meaning that there was no longer a role available for them. Frustrated and disheartened, they shared their experience with this online community, sharing screenshots of the email itself and their story.",
