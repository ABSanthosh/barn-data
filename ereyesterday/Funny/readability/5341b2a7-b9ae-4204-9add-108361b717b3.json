  "description": "We don't always see when our coworkers get fired: instead, rumors quickly spread around the workplace. When your coworker gets fired, you might find out when you arrive in the office to find their area has been cleared out. Instead of their personal items decorating their desk, there's just a blank desk and a laptop sitting there. Then, someone will usually clue you in that your coworker has gotten the boot. It's often surprising, and you find out later that the person you thought you knew so well was actually up to some shady business! Next up, read about some absolutely hilarious answers that some job candidates gave their job interviewers, like one person who said, \"Is this going to take long? I'm parked in a 15 minute spot.\"",
