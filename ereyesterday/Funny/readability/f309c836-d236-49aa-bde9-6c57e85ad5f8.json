  "description": "The only way to really understand how the modern influencer superstructure functions is to understand how information used to work. There was \"a media\" and it was rigorously policed. There's simply too much information to be contiguous at this point; it must divide, partition, like a cell. People live in radically different worlds now, and the same information has a different valence in each of them. Engagement, devoid of context or meaning, is the coin of the realm where data has proliferated beyond our ability to meaningfully process it. This is how it came to be that two objectively abhorrent demons and a greasy, grinning mannequin have entered the business of feeding children.",

I think the idea of discrete generations is, in some ways, a tool of control. But I'm also too Gen X to endure this shit. I don't understand… Well, I do understand. It's money, that's why. But the substrate underneath it is unfathomable. I once listened to a podcast where two people younger than me tried to understand what selling out even meant, and ultimately they determined that it didn't actually mean anything. This may be the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled. You can't tell what it is because you're up to your fucking ass in it. I guess one of the flavors of Lunchly has mold in it. Or, maybe the flavor is mold. That might just be what flavor it is. It's called \"The Pizza,\" and for some reason I can't imagine they've nestled it between a pair of quotes that seem to cast aspersions on its fundamental nature. Is it fucking pizza?! These worms churn and revel in this ambiguity. Constantly being presented with the seams of the world, the grotesqueries, the parts they refuse to paint, and the triumphs of evil men is difficult, and if you tell them that they're feeding your children mold they'll just laugh and monetize it on their podcast, but at least… No, I guess that all sounds pretty bad.
