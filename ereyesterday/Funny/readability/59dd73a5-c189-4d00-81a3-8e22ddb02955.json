Perhaps that may change one day but for now I’ll continue to be here…a small blue dot. And Nowhere Bookshop will be here too. When we first started five years ago I wrote that bookstores and libraries were my sanctuary and that hasn’t changed. In fact, Nowhere has grown to be a place in the community that people come for solace and inspiration and joy and even a little rebellion. I suspect most progressive bookshops (especially those in red states) are having the same fears that we have, so if you have one near you, drop in and say hi. It can be nice to see in real time how not alone we are. Remember that books have the power to bring unbridled joy and escape, and also the power to change minds and people. Ask a bookseller what banned book they’d recommend. Ask which books they’ve seen challenged that they love. Ask them what they read when they need to be reminded of the goodness of people or what they read to reset their brains. And if you can’t afford a book at the moment, keep in mind that libraries are magic and you can get physical books, ebooks and even audiobooks from libraries now. And now…back to normal programming…new November releases I loved: If you’re in the Fantastic Strangelings Book Club we’re sending you a historical fiction story about a woman struggling to pursue her dreams and help those around her, in spite of great obstacles…which feels somewhat timely even though it takes place 700 years ago. It’s Eleanore of Avignon by Elizabeth DeLozier.  It’s the story of a woman who is unwilling to bend to the limitations her society places upon her when she becomes the unlikely apprentice to the pope’s physician during the Black Plague, at the most challenging and dangerous moment in medieval European history. Fascinating and captivating. If you’re a member of the Nightmares from Nowhere Horror Club you’ll be getting Deadly Animals by Marie Tierney. Finding a dead body is not normal. But Ava is not a normal teenager. In this chillingly beautiful mystery, only the obsessive spirit of youth can save a desperate town from the savagery within. Engrossing. I didn’t have a chance to read as many books this month as usual but here are a few more new releases that I loved: Encounters with James Baldwin: Celebrating 100 years~ A wonderful collection of poems, interviews, cultural commentary which celebrate the incredible work and legacy of James Baldwin. The Memory Palace: True Short Stories of the Past by Nate Dimeo –  A collection of surprising true stories that brings to life long-forgotten icons, heroes who never got their due, and ordinary people who never made it to the history books.  Fascinating. Shy Creatures by Clare Chambers –  A mute, unkempt man with a long beard and hair is discovered in the home of his sick, elderly aunt. Both the aunt and William are admitted to Westbury Park for psychiatric evaluations, but the aunt dies shortly afterwards leaving the staff to piece together William’s history.  The Queen by Nick Cutter –  A young woman searching for her missing friend uncovers a shocking truth.  If you have a phobia of flying insects this one is not for you. Cabinet of Curiosities by Aaron Mahnke – A historical tour of the unbelievable, the unsettling, and the bizarre. Happy reading, friends.   Post navigation",
