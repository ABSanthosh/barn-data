  "description": "You know what one of our biggest dreams is as cat people? Cuddling with a big cat. Ugh. We know that we shouldn't, we know that it's \"dangerous\" or whatever, but we want to. And we have seen it happen! We have, for real. We have seen people cuddle with lions, we have seen people sleeping next to cheetahs, we have seen brave Russian women smooch huge Siberian lynxes! And yes, while it's true that most of these people are the caretakers of these animals and have grown up with them, that doesn't mean that we can't! Look at that woman. She's just a brave Russian. We can be brave too.But alas, for now, this will simply have to remain a dream for us. And we will have to live vicariously through other people - watch them cuddle with our favorite animals. We thought that we have seen all of these stories, but it seems like we haven't, because this one was completely new to us. A man rescuing a lioness cub who was abandoned by her mother an, hand-raising her himself, and forming the kind of bond with her that we are not sure we have ever seen before.",
