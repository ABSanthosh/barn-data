  "description": "We all make silly mistakes now and again—especially when we're under pressure. Have you ever spent 10 embarrassing seconds trying to \"push\" your way into a building with a \"pull\" door? Or maybe as you're scoping out a store and searching for the changing room, you just can't find it, so you ask an employee and, lo and behold, there's a giant sign above your head pointing you to it. And if you're a modern person using this new-fangled technology called an iPhone, you might pay for a lot of your stuff via tap-to-pay. I'm obsessed with the feature, which never fails to make me feel like I'm in a futuristic sci-fi movie. Of course, not everywhere takes tap-to-pay, and you have to pull out your wallet and use your good old-fashioned credit card. Do you swipe? Probably not, this is current year, after all. Do you tap? Maybe. Do you insert the chip? Also maybe. There may be signs to guide you, but we've all felt the pressure of trying to get the card to work while the bored cashier glares at us. It can get so awkward… please, just let us tap that phone and avoid our old ways. Next, read about the bride-to-be who kicked out a bachelorette party guest who spent $2,000+ on the trip: 'I snapped, and the room went silent.'",
