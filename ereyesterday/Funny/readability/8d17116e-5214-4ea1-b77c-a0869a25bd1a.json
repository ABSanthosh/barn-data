  "description": "There's a lot of focus on the brains and the flesh and whatnot - long, ragged strips of manflesh, juicy like a papaya. But what do zombies want in the long term? Has anybody even asked? Or are they too busy running away from zombies in the corrugated metal maze of a favela? Look. We're always being told to let people cook, with questionable results. Wastrels, \"writers\" and the like. They've been extended a blank check; an unlimited opportunity to cook the void. Thankfully, the 28 Days X franchise is bold enough to get down to brass fucking tacks.",

Thankfully, the 28 Days X franchise is bold enough to get down to brass fucking tacks. Morakk talked about all his books, I guess we've been doing this shit for a quarter century or whatever but the idea that he reads at least a book a week is probably not fully distributed. His taste in books is immaculate - the shit that he finds on his trawls of the medium routinely gets movies made of them years hence. It's not part of the Gabe persona as it's rendered broadly here, but it's sort of funny that he's probably the most well-read person I know. Omnivorous. Starving for the word. Wait. Is that why we get along?! He put me onto The Mysterious Case of Rudolph Diesel and I think about that shit at least once a day and I read it over a year ago. But I always have to make sure that people have read There Is No Antimemetics Division, which I think is the most fun I've ever had reading a book - and there's lots of ways to do that. I've read it five times if I recall correctly, and there are always parts that I don't remember having read before. It's the platonic ideal of a summer book, if your perfect summer involves horrors which cognition literally cannot digest. (CW)TB out.",
