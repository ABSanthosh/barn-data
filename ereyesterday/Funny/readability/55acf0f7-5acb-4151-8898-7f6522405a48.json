  "description": "Every crease and fold of the Concord saga is so confusing to me. After the response to the trailer, you'd think there might be a pause to reflect. After the performance of that beta, you'd think that would have pulled a comically large lever of some kind to take a breath. To hear Sony tell it, their process didn't involve \"Gates\" early enough, rounds of user testing or evaluation. The whole thing seems like it was greenlit by Vibes.",

When I saw that it was still receiving patches even after having been exiled, I held out some kind of hope.

The story of this game's development involves people throwing around various budgets - anywhere from two to four hundred million dollars.

My friends who make games have to contort themselves mightily to get a hundredth of this budget, but I'm weirdly pro-Firewalk at this point. They didn't really have a partner on the publishing side. These relationships are often contentious, for obvious reasons. But you can't provide funding without structure. What happens in a situation like that is… well, this. (CW)TB out.",
