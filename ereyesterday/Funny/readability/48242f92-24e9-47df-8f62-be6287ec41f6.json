  "description": "When working in an office, everyone has their specific roles to keep everything flowing smoothly. One person is in charge or making sure all of the snacks and toilet paper is well stocked, another is in charge of making sure the WiFi and any tech issues are taken care of, and others sit and create content, etc. Depending on the company, the list goes on. They don't tend to heavily overlap, and if they do, then I hope your company is paying you for that extra work…  In the case of this \"office mom,\" her role quickly become something she'd never imagine. She claims she is not tech-savvy in the slightest, however, one day the WiFi was out and everyone was panicking. The IT guy was on vacation, so nobody knew what to do! The office mom came to the rescue!",

She went to her lunchbox, grabbed the bag of frozen peas she was using to keep her lunch cool, went to the router, unplugged it and throw that ice cold bag of peas on top. After a little bit, it had cooled down, she plugged it back in and BAM like magic it worked again. Now everyone is coming to her for IT related issues and she is just as confused as them.",
