  "description": "Good meowrning, feline friends and fam. We woke up this morning with our cats littered around us like someone sprinkled sprinkles on a cupcake, and if you love cats as much as we do, that's the best way to wake up. It was so meowrvelous, in fact, that we had a lot of difficulty prying ourselves out of bed to go to work today. Well, we have a lot of trouble getting to work every day, but that's a story for a different day.The only thing that we knew would pawsitively bring us some happiness today would be the joy of scrolling through some fluffy feline funnies. If we must leave our cute cats at home for 8+ hours, we need to fill our kitty comedy quota with the help of cat memes filled with catnip comedy. Be warned, though - these memes are purrfectly addictive. You might not want to stop, but that's the whole point. There are enough silly kitties in the form of memes to keep you occupied until you get back to your purrfectly precious felines at home. Enjoy!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.
