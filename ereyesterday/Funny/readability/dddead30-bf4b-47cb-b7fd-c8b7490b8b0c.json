Q: What is a Labubu? A: A Labubu is designer Kasing Lung’s best attempt at what a British person looks like. Q: Why do they come in blind boxes? A: To guarantee that you buy your kid the wrong one. Q: Is Labubu part of a larger universe or a story? A: It’s slide 52 of the 600-page “Pop Mart Shareholder Q3 Report.” Q: Why are they wearing those weird little outfits? A: Why are you wearing yours? Q: Where can I get a Labubu? A: Pop Mart, or the backpack of any teen girl small enough to knock down. Q: Why is my kid obsessed with these? A: Because acting out clearly didn’t get your attention. Your own child is like a stranger to you. Also, they come in different colors. Q: How much do they cost? A: Thirty dollars and what remains of American cultural hegemony.",
