  "description": "You know that feeling when you do your boss a solid, even though you don't have to, and then you're somehow the one who is in the wrong? If you're familiar with this, that's because you broke the number one rule in the workplace: Never do more than what you're told to do. Others might disagree, but you're getting paid to do concrete tasks. You are replaceable to every company, no matter how much you believe you're an asset, so act your wage!Yes, that includes coming into the office on days you have remote privileges. Some employees think going above and beyond will land them a ticket straight to six-figure territory, but that's only the case sometimes, and even that word is pushing it.In this next story, an employee switches up their remote work days because of construction that's being done on their residence. Their boss has an issue with this, but fails to remember all of the times this same employee went out of their way to be in the office when it was not necessary. So, as payback, the employee vows to never work from home on non-designated days ever again—but forget about coming in on remote days. Scroll to read.",
