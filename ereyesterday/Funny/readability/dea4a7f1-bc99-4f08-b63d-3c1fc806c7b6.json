I don't think so. I don't think this is a narrative; I think this is a cul-de-sac. I don't think we're entering a hard arc where he just does a bunch of weird things with his hands. The one thing I will actively encourage is if he gets into Goblin King style contact juggling. Like, on some David Bowie shit. His talent with balls generally would come in clutch, here - a new venue for a skill he's trained to the elite level. Oh! And this: I'm not one hundred percent sure what you're supposed to do against this. They made everybody look super cool and then they put a bunch of new heroes that are also free? That's rough stuff. Also, I like that the big bad in this season is fucking Dracula. Inany other context, Dracula might be a big deal. Here, it's like… You turn into some bats? Is that all you got? (CW)TB out.",
