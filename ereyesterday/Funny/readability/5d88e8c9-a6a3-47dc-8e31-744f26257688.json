  "description": "The way from a Monday to the weekend might be long, but it's never as long as a cat who has to wait 3 hours between meals. It is known that the time it takes a cat to wait between their feeding times is the longest waiting time in existence. Just as the laws of physics do not apply to cats (hence cats are liquid, actually), so does the concept of time. The time it takes any of us, humble hoomans, to wait between meals, is nothing like the passage of time for the same thing to a cat. That's why cats think they're famished 5 minutes after their meal is done - time doesn't act for them the same way it does for us. Yes, that must be the reason for itâ€¦Since this is why cats have this huge hunger, the concepts of cats and food are inseparable when it comes to cat memes. There are so many foodie feline memes out there, we just had to gather some to demonstrate it all.",
