  "description": "I’m opening up four more commission slots today. These will be my November commissions and anyone who grabs a spot today can expect their finished piece by the end of the month. I’ve been doing these for a few months now and I love it. Working directly with PA readers to craft something special for them has been incredibly cool. When you sign up for a commission I need you to send me all the information you can about the character you’re looking for as well as whether you want a background or not since I offer both options. I’m happy to draw characters from comics,games,movies, RPG’s or even original designs. I even drew someone’s family dog a couple months ago!  I use the site Artistree which allows us to communicate through the entire process and you’ll have multiple opportunities to give feedback and make adjustments as we work through sketches, inks and finally colors. Once we’re done I’ll send over the high res files that are suitable for printing.",

Obviously these all belong to their owners but here’s a little peek at what they looked like. I did a couple D\u0026D characters, A Pokemon and an original character.  If you’d like to work with me on a custom piece, please head over to my Atristree page for all the details and to submit your request. Like I said, give me all the details you can and be sure to specify background or no background. There are four spots available for November so go grab one and we can get started right away! Thank you to everyone who has been supporting me through these commissions, it really means a lot to me! -Gabe Out",
