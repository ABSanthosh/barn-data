  "description": "Adopting a cat is one of the most amazing experiences that anyone can have. We believe that, and we stand by that every day. Returning a lost cat to their previous owners, even after you think you have been chosen by a cat, is also an amazing experience. It's heartbreaking on one hand, of course, because so many of us wait so long to be chosen by our feline companions, but it's the right thing to do - it's putting a family back together. But what happens if you find out that the cat you have had and loved for years is actually microchipped and used to belong to someone else? What is the right thing to do then? That is exactly the dilemma that the person in today's story has to face. Now, credit where credit is due… they seem to be truly trying to find the previous owners, even though we don't know if they would be able to actually give the cat back. They're trying to do what they think is right. But they can't find the owner, and now, the fear that remains is that one day… that owner might come back, and they might have some words to say.",

  "text": "What a dilemma. Seriously. We don't know what we would have done at this point. If we had lost our cat after microchipping it and still weren't able to find it, and then we discovered that someone has been keeping our cat from us? We would have bee devastated. But if we found out that our cat used to belong to someone else - who might be missing it and waiting for it to come back… also devastated.  To be entirely fair to you, it seems like you did everything that you could have done and more. You have really gone out of your way to try to find this cat's owners. After all of that… it doesn't sound like they are looking for their cat as much as you are for them. It's time to quit. This is your kitty now.",
