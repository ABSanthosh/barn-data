  "description": "I'm in the part of Monster Hunter Wilds that you get to in a Pokemon game, the After Story, where you dealt with the main campaign but then some flavor has been retained for an extended finale. They never asked me to trap a monster once in the entire campaign, and then when I'm here on the off-ramp they're like \"go trap me one.\" I had to look it up online! Real tourist shit, but I just never really played that way before. Kiko was trying to talk to Gabe about it later, saying that it was simply faster to catch them and thus a more efficient use of the hunting time. It was as though Kiko was speaking in muted honks and fwonks like a jazz trumpet; like an adult in Charlie Brown. For Gabriel, \"mercy\" is a foreign tongue.",

Then again, I don't really know how merciful it is because you get most of the same shit for trapping as you do for killing. I feel like a lot of these items are inside the monster. So… I don't know. It seems like something might be happening off camera; maybe this is like when your dad says that your collie is living on a farm upstate, a farm where they can just run and run, and then before you can really process any of that he brings home a new dog. Maybe it's like that. Plus, the optimal route is to dismember them and then\u003c/\u003e trap them, which frankly just seems weirder than the other thing. Right? This makes it seem like it's about something else. It's #Fridabe, so you can feel confident that streaming delights will commence as soon as Gabe and I get done writing, but Dabe will be there holding it down between ten and ten fifteen on the strim warming it up. Rivals, and then (historically!) some Indiana Jones around noon. See you there. (CW)TB out.",
