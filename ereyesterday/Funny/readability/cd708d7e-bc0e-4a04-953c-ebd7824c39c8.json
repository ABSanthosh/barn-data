  "description": "Hello cat lovers and nap-time snoozers, did you just wake up from a deep nap? Well, get your cup of coffee, or tea, or whatever that wakes you up - because, oh boy, do we have a story for you. And you want to be wide awake for this one, we pawmise. You know how you love cats like nothing else in the world? And you know how you love taking a refreshing nap, preferably while you're cuddled up with a cute cat? Well, the combination of these two things is the everyday reality of one sweet senior man, who has found his purrpose after volunteering in a local cat shelter by napping with the cats.Honestly, if we could, we would make it our life mission - to nap and cuddle with shelter cats, giving them the love, affection, and cuddle time they deserve. This is a two-way pawsitive exchange, because if this is what we could do on a daily basis - we'd be the happiest hoomans to have ever hooman. It seems this empathic elderly man is so happy to visit the cats and nap with them, and the cats are so happy with him as well. What an adorable connection they have, our hearts have completely melted.",
