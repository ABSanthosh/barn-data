  "text": "Burr thinks Musk is almost as annoying as his wife’s Tesla The new Steve Jobs is “that laminated-faced hair plug cunt on Twitter,” or so says the iconic rant comedian who can’t be bothered to learn his name.There might not be a genre of celebrity whom Bill Burr hates more than “tech billionaire who pretends to be a genius because he takes credit for other people’s inventions.” Long before the late Apple CEO Steve Jobs saw a post-mortem shift in public opinion as people slowly realized that he “invented” the iPhone about as much as Elon Musk “founded” Tesla, Burr appeared on a 2012 episode of Conan less than a year after Jobs’ death and trashed the late tech mogul for making himself the face of others’ innovations in a legendary rant that still ranks among the irate comic’s all-time best.Now that Burr’s stance on the deceased Apple don who was once widely considered to be a cross between Thomas Edison and Jesus Christ is more commonplace and a new, more annoying and less charismatic technocrat is parading himself around as the world’s greatest inventor, Burr’s iconoclastic fury now points toward the Tesla CEO and Twitter founder. Don't Miss A clip from a live episode of Burr’s Monday Morning Podcast recently went viral on TikTok, probably because the “guy who fucking bought” Twitter rewrote the algorithm again to keep it down: @billburrbitsBurr’s startlingly accurate impression of his wife Nia's “skincancermobile” backing up comes from a live recording of his podcast at The Troubadour in Los Angeles from April 23, 2023, but with Musk’s ongoing campaign to make the presidential election all about himself while peddling embarrassing, iRobot-rip-off bartender androids at Tesla events, the clip is once again making the rounds on all the social media sites that Musk doesn’t own.  In the full episode, Burr continues his tirade about Musk past the point where the viral clip cuts off, saying, “I don’t know why everybody thinks that guy is amazing. Let me tell you right now, somebody who has fucking Botox face and a hair system, you’re gonna look at him and go, ‘Yeah man, this guy has the answers’?” Burr joked of Musk’s appearance. “To me, he looks like Space Christopher Walken. You know when you go in a wax museum, and they’re like, ‘It’s Christopher Walken!’ and you’re like, ‘Sort of!’”At the time of recording, Musk had just made the hilarious decision to eliminate free verification for public figures and implement the infamous paid blue check policy, prompting Burr to say of the disaster, “Dude, I’m not paying for your fucking Botox, alright? You can take that blue check and stick it right in your hair system.”If Burr is this brutal toward Musk now, I can’t wait to hear the savage rant that he’ll inevitably unleash after the “hair plug cunt on Twitter” dies.
