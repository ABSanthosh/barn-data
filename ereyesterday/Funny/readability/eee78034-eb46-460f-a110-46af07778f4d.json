With any luck, he should start putting together full sentences soon. Really, though, I’m just happy Grandma is still around to witness this.” At press time, sources reported that Peterbaum had spoken his second word after accidentally knocking over a bottle of wine and shouting “Fuck!” Related Coverage",
