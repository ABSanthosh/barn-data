  "description": "As a part of our professional lives, we're almost obligated to be amiable to our coworkers, clients, and associates, even if we can stand them… with every fiber of our being. The reality of life is you're not going to get along and vibe with everyone, nor should you, without distilling your personality and trying to people-please so as not to offend anyone ever. While getting along with coworkers and working well with them is an obligation… where does that obligation end? Once you're out of the office in a casual setting, having some laid-back drinks—even if it's with other members of the office—are you obligated to go out of your way for that coworker that you just don't get along with?That was the issue at hand in this thread, where this woman was upset that her coworker had \"excluded\" by refusing to drive her to their workgroups after dinner drinks. Her coworker turned to this online community to see whether or not he was wrong for his refusal. See the original thread and some key responses, below.",
