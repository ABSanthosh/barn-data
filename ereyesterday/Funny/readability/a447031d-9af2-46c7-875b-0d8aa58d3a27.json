Like Jerry said in his post it would be hard to explain what these books are about if you are not already neck deep in 40K lore. Just know that Magnus was a good boy who was just trying to warn his Dad about something very bad that was going to happen but instead he ended up making his Dad super mad. Like…SUPER mad. There is a saying in the community that “Magnus did nothing wrong” and while I am not sure that’s entirely true (he did after all destroy the magical wards that protected holy Terra from the Warp), I do think he had good intentions.",

Like Jerry said in his post it would be hard to explain what these books are about if you are not already neck deep in 40K lore. Just know that Magnus was a good boy who was just trying to warn his Dad about something very bad that was going to happen but instead he ended up making his Dad super mad. Like…SUPER mad. There is a saying in the community that “Magnus did nothing wrong” and while I am not sure that’s entirely true (he did after all destroy the magical wards that protected holy Terra from the Warp), I do think he had good intentions.  In addition to my original Black Templar army I have decided to build and play some Thousand sons. I love the look of the models and I’ve had a lot of fun painting them. Here’s one of my Exalted Sorcerers: I will say I’ve had less fun actually playing them on the table. My Black Tmeplars are a pretty straight forward army to play. I rush in and hit you very hard with lots of melee attacks. They are essentially a huge chipper shredder that I just need to get into close range to do their bloody work. Thousand sons are an army of sorcerers with lots of intricate spells and an entirely custom power source called Cabal Points that you need to manage and spend correctly. It’s a lot to learn and remember and both games I’ve played with the army I left the table realizing that I forgot like half their shit.   I deleted my Twitter account months ago because I think it’s a trash fire ruled by a psychopath but I do post occasionally over on Bluesky. If you’d like to see pictures of my pets and the little men I paint feel free to follow me over there.  Also a reminder that the Child’s Play charity dinner/auction is coming up on November 22nd. Come hang out with me and lots of other nerds as we raise money for a great cause. You can get more details right here. I'd also like to thank Logitech for sending over seven boxes of goodies for the auction!  Finally, I don’t go to each and every PAX these days but I will be at PAX Unplugged in December. I’m excited to see everyone in Philly! -Gabe Out",
