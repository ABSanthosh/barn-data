  "description": "Ah, don't you just love the meowlidays, feline fam? The extra days off from work, the family feasts you get to enjoy, and the best part: all of the post-meowliday leftovers. From turkey sandwiches to cold mac \u0026 cheese (don't come for us, you probably also have some weird thing that you like that no one else understands), we love basking in the fullness of the refrigerator without having to get out a single pot or pan. But, there is one ingredient missing from these tasty turkey leftovers that we feel it is our duty to supply you with: cat memes.These post-thanksgiving memes pair purrfectly with your food coma after enjoying all the leftovers your fridge has to offer. They are best enjoyed horizontally, in stretchy pants, and with a Christmas movie on in the background. You don't have to have these things to enjoy these feast-filled feline funnies, just like you don't have to eat your mac \u0026 cheese cold, but it's just a purrsonal preference. Anyway, we hope you're relishing in your post-meowliday mewd and have a great week!",
