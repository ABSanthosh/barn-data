  "text": "Far be it from me to shame and goad you for how you invest your time, even if I do that explicitly, over and over, in today's incomparable strip. You only have so much time crawling the rough skin of the Earth - if you want to invest that time contemplating the human bottom, you do you. Broadly speaking, it has been a site of continued and devoted interest. G'on get it. And who doesn't want to chow down on a brick of salient data? A weird AI tried to tell me about my Spotify listening habits, but I got scared and threw the devil machine in the furnace. My shit is all the crap you'd expect, I'm where everybody's favorite song ends up in a big pile because I catch music like a disease. Jasmine Sandlas, Glorb, Eluveitie, just… everybody else's leavings. The thing I am most proud of is that my daughter Ronia's number one song this year was \"My Dog Is An Astronaut, Though\" by Pond, which came out twelve years before she was born. It's completely rad and you should listen to it. It ties into one of my fascinations, which is Laika - it comes up all the time in my stuff, the first episode of Tales From The Loop I ran has some in there if I recall. I thought for sure the tale of the cosmonaut dog was what inspired Krypto, for sure - but no. Krypto debuted two years earlier. Gah, I hope it wasn't the reverse. (CW)TB out.",
