  "text": "After your first shift working in any sort of entertainment production, it's pretty obvious that any theater show is occupied by its fair share of divas. Childish, brooding, and volatile stars of the show have captivated audiences with their drama and their gusto, but those same enchanting traits on stage don't necessarily translate into good coworker values. This passionate lighting technician had spent several seasons working at with a resort's traveling theater show but finally met his match when he was placed under a diva-extraordinaire-type manager.She rampaged, she tiraded, she complained, and she harassed every worker on the set, but the lighting tech wouldn't stand for it. Instead of rolling over like the rest of his team, he stood up to the manager, getting himself wrongfully fired. Lucky for him, he was the only employee within a hundred miles who knew how to operate the special effects of their season-ending show, so instead of training his replacement, he concocted the most diabolical and hilarious revenge. Keep reading for the entire story that'll follow this dragonesque diva for the rest of her life as she questions every spotlight, every cue call, and every lighting tech for the rest of her career.",
