  "description": "Let's face it: we hoomans are all simply pawns in our felines' games. No matter how hard we try to convince ourselves that we are in charge, a sassy cat will strut into your life and flip all of your beliefs upside down. Oh, you like leather couches? They'll scratch it until it's unrecognizable. Do you enjoy showering with the curtain closed? They'll rip it down so you can't get any purrivacy. Once you become a cat pawrent, you also have to trash any beliefs you had about owning a furry feline friend and start from scratch (see what I did there?)Some cats act out sparingly while others have had sassy purrsonalities since birth. Who are we to judge? They might seem impawssible to deal with sometimes, but that's the price of having an ancient animal roaming through our homes. We must honor them as such—even if they only have one brain cell. Maybe they view us the same way. If you're in search of a mid-week mood boost because your cat is having a major cattitude, scroll below to get your feline fix.Pawsitive Vibes: Subscribe to our weekly newsletter for the purrfect Caturday treat!",
