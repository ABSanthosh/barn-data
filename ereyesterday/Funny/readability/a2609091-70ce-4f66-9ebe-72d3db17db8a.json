  "description": "In the retail world, getting to say \"But I AM the manager\" feels so righteous. There are few phrases that can throw a crabby customer off their game faster than realizing that they aren't berating a minimum wage worker. Instead, they're berating the boss, the head person in charge, and now they're not going to get anything they originally wanted. Though it's not how I'd spend my time, there's a certain type of customer who wakes up in the morning ready to make the lives of retail workers miserable. This person loves to go out to eat, order a steak, and then wants the steak remade 5 times because it's not to their liking. This type of person will show up at a clothing store with something they bought 10 years ago, and will try to return it for a full refund. They're not even really trying to accomplish their goal. They just want to feel powerful as they berate some 16-year-old worker who's making minimum wage and trying his or her very best. Up next, read about an attention-seeking \"entitled rich kid\" who tried to blare loud music in the school parking lot, only to ruin his car's paint job: \"Kevin hopped in his car [and] turned it on with the sound cranked up.\"",
