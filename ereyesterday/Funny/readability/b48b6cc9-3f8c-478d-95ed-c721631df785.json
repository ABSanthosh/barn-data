It's not the most fun job in the world, but someone's got to do it! For most people, shovelling snow is one of those reasons they dread the sight of any snowfall. While kids get to frolic around in the snow and build snow forts, the adults are stuck sweeping the snow from pathways and using those ice scrapers to de-ice the windshields. This person had not only one car to save from the 8 inches of snow, but two! They report that it took them roughly 45 minutes in freezing cold temperatures to get the two cars shoveled out. That explains their reaction when they realized their neighbor did them wrong! This neighbor had the audacity to steal that freshly-shoveled spot with their own car.
