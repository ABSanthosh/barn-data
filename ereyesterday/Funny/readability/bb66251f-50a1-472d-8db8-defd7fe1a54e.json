  "description": "Offering employees a bonus if they manage to meet a monthly or quarterly goal is a great concept, if you ask me. It gives the employees motivation to succeed, and it actually drives the company to perform better, which surely makes the higher-ups happy. As long as it helps move the company forward, it is absolutely worth it, even if it does mean the company has to spend more money on its hardworking employees.That being said, it is crucial that the given bonus is something the employees are genuinely excited about getting. It can't be an office pizza party, it has to be something that makes their hard work worthwhile. Basically, it has to be a respectable sum of money. If an employer is unwilling to commit to providing their employees with an actual bonus, they might as well give up on the whole concept. Otherwise, not only would their employees lose all their motivation, but this could genuinely drive them away, which is what is happening to the employees in the story below.",
