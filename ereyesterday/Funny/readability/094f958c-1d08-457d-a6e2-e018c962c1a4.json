  "description": "Job hunting today is no joke. It's an endless cycle of sifting through job boards, tailoring your resume for each position, and pouring your heart and soul into cover letters—all for the privilege of hearing nothing back 90% of the time. When I was looking for my last job, it took eight agonizing months. I probably applied to over 100 jobs, each one feeling like a shot in the dark (which they were).And then comes the interview process, which is way worse. It's an unnecessarily drawn-out game of endurance, usually with multiple rounds of interviews, tests, and follow-ups for the slim chance you'll land the role. Congratulations—you got the job! Now you get to work 9-5 for the rest of your life and probably still be underpaid.But the good news is, if you find yourself up against a job applicant like the one in this story, you've got nothing to worry about. Let's just say he's not exactly setting the bar high.",
