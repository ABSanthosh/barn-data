  "description": "Getting out of bed when it's so cold outside is hard. So hard. We love autumn and winter, but we have to admit that even to people who like cold as much as we do, it's tough to get out of bed in the mornings when the blankets are so nice and warm. Five more minutes in bed. That's all that we want in the morning - every morning, but especially when it's cold like this. But the clock doesn't stop ticking, and we do have to get to work on time, so we supposed that we just have to satisfy ourselves with the next best thing, which is a whole bunch of silly cat memes. Don't doubt us. Believe us when we say that funny cat memes feel like staying in bed for five more minutes, because sleepily scrolling and giggling at cat memes is what we would be doing anyway if we did have those extra five minutes in bed. So, look around, make sure that your boss is not behind you, and enjoy these hissterical memes.",
