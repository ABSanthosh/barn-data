  "description": "Life is a series of calculated risks—of varying levels of calculation. Some things you'll deliberate over for months, carefully coming to the answer and risk level that is best for you. Others will be hair-brained spur of the moment without any thought at all, sometimes to grave consequence. Owning a business is a bit like that, and that's not to say that owning a business is necessarily like life itself. (Though talking to some business owners would have you believing so.)No one wants to take any risks they don't have to, especially when money is directly involved and promising your employees more compensation feels like a risk to a lot of employers, who naturally can't help but wonder why pay more for something that you're already paying for?However, they fail to account for the risk that they'll lose that worker altogether—or they do account for it, but in their hubris, they can never imagine it actually happening. Still, they'd much rather see that their \"investment\" is going to pay off and that promoting staff or simply giving them a raise will somehow result in a greater return for them.",
