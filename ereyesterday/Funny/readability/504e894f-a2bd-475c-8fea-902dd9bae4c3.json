  "description": "Parking wars occur way more often than you think—and you're probably already assuming that they happen a lot. Both parties on either side of the argument usually think they're in the right for whatever reason, but of course, that can't really be true. Some understand that they're acting out of turn in an entitled manner, but that doesn't matter to them; they only want to get what they want, and if being a bad person is what will bring them to it, you bet they're going to take that route!Some entitled individuals, like the one in this next story, gaslight themselves so hard that they'll start to believe the lies they're telling themselves and others. The parking debacle that takes place is not only annoying to read about, but it is also surreal. In what world would a landlord tell a tenant to steal another tenant's parking spot? Not only is that insane to think about, but it's also unbelievable. The parking spot stealer believes they are the ones being harassed so hard that they try to ostracize the person who posted this story. Not going to happen. Scroll to see how the whole story unfolds.",
