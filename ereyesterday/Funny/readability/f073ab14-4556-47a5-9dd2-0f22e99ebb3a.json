  "description": "This husband wasn't prepared for the response he got from his wife! After 21 years of marriage and raising 6 children together, this couple's relationship is crumbling. After spending nearly half of their lives together, this relationship is coming to a close, and it's getting messy! This husband sounds like a complete tool, treating his wife badly throughout their marriage (including while his wife gave birth to those 6 kids). His wife found out that he's still been pining for his ex. They broke up when they were in their 20s, but this 50-year-old man is still wishing he was with his ex instead of his long-term wife. It's pretty pathetic, and his wife has let him know in no uncertain terms that he isn't exactly desirable… Especially since he not only has no job, but keeps rejecting his wife's helpful attempts to earn some cash. The husband is definitely one of those people who can dish out insults, but can't take the slightest bit of criticism. For her sake, let's hope this woman dumps this guy to the curb. After all, if he wants his ex so badly, he should attempt to do it, and see how that works out. Next, have a giggle at some of the most cringe-worthy college admissions essays that kids have ever written, like one person who ended every single sentence with multiple exclamation points.",
