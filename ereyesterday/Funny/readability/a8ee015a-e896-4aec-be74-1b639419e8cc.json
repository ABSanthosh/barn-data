  "description": "Don't you sometimes wish you could say whatever you want to your boss, without thinking of the repercussions? Perhaps we could come up with a workplace 'purge day', in which everyone could do and say whatever they wanted at work, and then all will be forgotten the next day. Some employees don't need a day like that, as they are not afraid to put people in their place, even their bosses. Take the employee in this Reddit story for example. If I were told by my boss that I have to accept a $1 raise, while being forced to take on twice the workload, I would probably agree without a fight. However, this employee did not let their boss bully them into accepting these terrible terms and even threatened to contact their lawyer when their boss wouldn't let it go.Keep scrolling to read about the boss' reaction to being put in his place by his employee. After you are done reading this story, click here for another tale of students who rioted against their school trying to steal their money.",
