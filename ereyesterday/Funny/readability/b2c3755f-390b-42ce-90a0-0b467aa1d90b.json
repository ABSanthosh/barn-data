  "description": "Who else is tired of dealing with the consequences of a supervisor's mistake? This employee, who rarely ever takes time off work, put in a PTO request months ago that was fully approved. It wasn't even a long vacation, but rather a three-day weekend to decompress as he was experiencing burnout. His supervisor approved it, and everything was set for a nice day off for the employee.Unfortunately, however, when the day finally came, the employee's temporary vacation was interrupted by frustration from his supervisor for not showing up to work. Clearly, she had forgotten that this was the day she approved months ago. One would think that after explaining this to her, she would have backed down and apologized… but nope! He was still written up. Keep scrolling below for the full story along with reactions from several members of the online community and a subsequent update from the employee!",
