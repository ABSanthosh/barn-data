  "description": "This uncle is wondering if he taught his child and nephew the right lessons. After all, teaching your child right from wrong is an ongoing lesson throughout their life. The ways that most kids learn what to do and not to do is by watching how the adults in their lives act. That's why u/Some_Addition_9752 headed to r/AITAH to ask a larger audience if they were right for the way they encouraged their child to act. As a parent, it's frustrating to buy your kids expensive toys knowing they could quickly be stolen or broken. It's even more frustrating when you know exactly who pilfered the toys! This person revealed that their nephew took a bunch of Legos and other toys from their home after a visit. Why? Because he \"really liked them.\" It's good to share, but it seems like this 8-year-old just took the toys and ran with them, instead of asking permission. Then, to make matters worse, the original poster's brother barely did anything about his child's theft. He casually mentioned he'd return the items… but he clearly wasn't too concerned about it. Although commenters told the original poster that they weren't wrong, it seems like maybe they and their brother and nephew just shouldn't hang out so much. If they have communication problems that are escalating like this, it's probably a bigger issue than just some stolen Legos. After that, these people had some strong motivations to quit their jobs, like one person who was bitter that they were \"given a 1 cent raise.\"",
