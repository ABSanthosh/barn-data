  "text": "ATHENS, GREECE—Longing for the day they might cross the threshold from work friends to real friends, director Yorgos Lanthimos reportedly calculated Tuesday that he was only three films away from getting to hang out with Emma Stone outside of work. “I can feel it, I’m just one twisted period dramedy and two surrealist nightmares away from her agreeing to drinks on my patio,” said Lanthimos, who admitted that he had hoped casting Stone in Bugonia, the pair’s fourth and latest feature-film collaboration, would have given the two artists more conversational fodder beyond common shop talk. “When I first asked her to get coffee with me when we were working on The Favourite, she blew me off, but on the set of Poor Things, she waved at me in the parking lot. Then, when we were making Kinds Of Kindness, we had a solid interaction about the best kind of nuts at the craft service table. So things are headed in the right direction, but we’re not there yet. Once I find the right project, we’ll be gabbing over sushi in no time. Maybe something set at a 19th-century diving academy.” Lanthimos added that it would just be nice to hang out with someone other than Mark Ruffalo for once. Like A Vitamin You Ingest With Your Eyes.
