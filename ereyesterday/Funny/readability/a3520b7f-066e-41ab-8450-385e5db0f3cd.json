  "description": "For some people, the number of unread emails in their inbox is directly proportional to the level of control they have over their own lives. Of course, some folks have no problem letting that number increase exponentially. These unicorn individuals are able to tune out the stress and let their inboxes become unmanageable without a care in the world.Â Unless you identify as one of those chosen few who have no issue with a disorganized inbox, you probably would not like it if someone redirected hundreds of emails to your inbox daily on top of whatever your current email inflow is. For the anxious managers out there, watch out because your employees may already know that the secret to making your stress levels skyrocket is via email sabotage. Keep scrolling below for this former employee's tale of how he got back to his technologically incompetent manager after he got unjustly let go.",

  "text": "Before we get into the email revenge at the heart of this story, let's take a moment to acknowledge those with technologically incompetent managers. It's the only thing worse than visiting your parents over the holidays and having to fix their computers, login/password information, and media setup. When your manager barely understands how to use Outlook, it's as if they need a helping hand at al times, regardless of how much is already on your plate. Kudos to this employee for using his manager's incompetence to his advantage after he heard the bad news that he had been fired.",
