  "description": "The grass isn't always greener, you know… Though it's nice to be able to afford to buy yourself the best belongings money can buy, it's not always the best long-term decision. Saving money is super hard, in my opinion, because it's boring, and all the fun things one can do with money are happening now. You can save that money and have a larger retirement fund someday, or you could go to a concert with your friends now, plan a lofty vacation now, or buy yourself a shiny new car… now. Saving money for the future is so boring: what if your future self wants current you to have fun with that chunk of change? The fiscally responsible thing to do with your extra cash is to sock it away for the future, but it's not the most satisfying option in the short term. You can show off a new car to your friends, but no one's going to be impressed by your savings for a rainy day. This guy is trying to talk their wife out of buying a new car. They already have three vehicles! Still, this perosn thinks that since they can afford a new SUV, that it's time to take out a new car payment. This dude turned to the internet for advice, and people had some good ideas for them. Up next, read about the big announcement that one couple dropped during their brother's wedding ceremony, revealing that \"I was...taking attention away from my brother.\"",
