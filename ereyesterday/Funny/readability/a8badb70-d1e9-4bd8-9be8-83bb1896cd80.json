  "description": "All the other generations like to be mean to us, but we've had the worst, haven't we, millennials? All we have to get us through our whiskery weary workdays are our coffee orders every meowrning, our cats to come home to, and our furvorite shows that we watch over and over again because nothing will ever be better than them. That's why, even though fresh cat memes are made daily on the ever-evolving internet, we still prefer the classics. Those timeless cat memes that, no matter how many times you view them, still make you giggle.Since their creation, cat memes have been one of the joys in our lives. We knew immediately that the cat can haz cheezburger, and that we never saw a \"woman yelling at cat\" meme that we didn't burst out into laughter with. It's like watching Avatar: The Last Airbender every year, it just makes us happy. The world may be always changing around us, but memes are furrever on the internet for us to enjoy whenever we want. And when we're having a tough workday, they never fail to help the time zoomie by!",
