  "text": "Reacher is big, dumb fun about a big smart man who fucks people up. I can't even imagine the patience - the forbearance - to wait until the third season to put him against someone larger than he is. And I guess I say patience and forbearance, but there's also the possibility that it simply took a long time to find someone that large who wasn't the grim fruit of some blacksite military experiment. The last time I wrote about Reacher, I said that it was like a cocktail weiner you would toothpick out of a crockpot at your elderly aunt's house. I suppose it's possible you never had one of these, though I suspect that there may be a regional aspect to these meaty treaties. I feel strongly that elderly aunts all have something that cooks maybe a little too long but it's still good, and it's like that - whatever the specific conflation is. Ryan makes a Buffalo Dip that is so good I feel that an elderly aunt was involved at some point in this recipe's chain of provenance; maybe that's your Reacher. When I was trying to figure out what fucking day new episodes even come out, I found an article talking about the reasons it appeals to both the right AND the left, like we were flensing the odd proclivities of two irradiated wasteland tribes. It does not require and will not benefit from this lens. I was already getting into this when I wrote about it before, and lo, it will suffice yet. We did \"The Boys.\" \"The Boys\" is currently devouring itself, and it is almost done doing so, because that's all that level of analysis is capable of in the end. Autosarcophagy as an organizing principle has a sell-by date.  You can't operate a deconstruction machine indefinitely; ultimately, the machine is all you have left to take apart. We need to make aspirational shit again so we have something to deconstruct later. It's not a mysterious process, it's just the opposite of what we were doing before. (CW)TB out.",
