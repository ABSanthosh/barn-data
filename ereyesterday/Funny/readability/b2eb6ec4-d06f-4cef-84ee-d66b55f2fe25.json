  "description": "Most people, when they hear a screaming kitten outside, don't do much. We're busy, we have our problems to deal with, someone will help the cat, right? Just not us. We think that's what they must be thinking. It has to be that. But other people - kind, pure, wholesome people can't just walk by. And those people deserve our gratitude, because they're doing what most people won't. They are going out of their way to rescue a cat in need and give it a new start. Those are the kind of people that we have in today's story - people who had other plans, were going other places, but stopped everything to help a cat that was calling for help. And now, a couple years down the line, you can see exactly why they did what they did. The kitty they saved is now spoiled as heck - as she should be, is best friends with another cat, and is clearly endlessly happy with the knowledge that she will never, ever be hungry again.",

  "text": "This adoption was so meant to be. Adopting a black cat on Halloween, rescuing it from the scary woods, and now… having that cat be spoiled as heck and bonded with another - we're obsessed. And so thankful. More people should be as amazing as the people who rescued this void.  She looks like the happiest kitty in the world now, and once again, we have to say thank you. Black cats are still one of the least adopted kinds of cats in shelters. So many people don't give them a chance even though they make such great pets. Sure, you might talk to a crumpled black T-shirt on accident at night sometimes, but that's not the cat's fault.",
