I didn't understand how they did the first one, and I'm even less able to get this one dialed in. I can barely understand how we got from the first GTA games to III - there's almost nothing to indicate that it had this grand shape somewhere inside it. That's before we get to something like the fact that I knew a couple people for whom being someone inside GTA V was their full-time job. But it's a wild thing to look at in a maturing industry, where earlier eras return to us in the form of aesthetics. I'm not even sure I've gotten to the end of a GTA. Not because I don't play them, I play the fuck out of them. But if Ryo Hazuki was having a hard time in Shenmue - and he was, if this now twenty-five year old comic is anything to go by - it's even more compounded in GTA. You can barely tell what the Golden Path is supposed to be, it all looks main stage. Good luck exacting your righteous vengeance or whatever, we gotta listen to the radio and look at this sunset Everything looks like you were supposed to be there, that second. Oh, and if you would like to check out the best apparel collection PAX has ever had, just click below. Holy shit! (CW)TB out.",
