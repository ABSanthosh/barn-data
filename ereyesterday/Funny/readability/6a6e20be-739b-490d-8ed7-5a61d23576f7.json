  "description": "After saving up for a trip for ages, this family suddenly realized that had a few unwanted guests trying to tag along. No one ever said it'd be easy to plan a family trip! There are so many details that go into bringing a trip to fruition. Step one, though, is usually knowing who is going on your trip. This person, u/Altruistic_North1050, thought they were planning an 8-day trip with their husband and two kids, but then her sister-in-law got involved. It would seem that the husband's side of the family love spending all of their time together. They can't understand why someone would want to take a vacation with just their immediate family! This person was really craving that alone time with their kids and husband, but the husband's family has been unrelenting with the pressure to go. In fact, this person revealed that their husband \"says I've hurt his family's feelings.\" It was pretty tacky for them to assume they were invited alone, and even tackier for them to begin planning a trip in the same exact destination. What a hot mess! You can read all about it below, as well as the reactions from commenters, who gave them some sage advice. Up next, this employee was horrified to discover they'd sent an unpleasant email to their boss by accident.",
