  "description": "There's a special kind of bond between a cat and their hooman… and it gets especially intense around 3 or 4 AM. If you're reading this while heavy-eyed and running on zero sleep because your feline friend decided this was the time to knock things off shelves, sprint around the house like a fuzzy lightning bolt, or demand snacks with a symphony of \"MEOW!\" - you are not alone.Sleep-deprived cat pawrents everywhere know this struggle. The moment your head hits the pillow, your cat suddenly remembers they're a mighty nocturnal hunter with a full to-do list: yell at invisible ghosts, rearrange the furniture, practice opera in the hallway, or just stare at you until you wake up. Why? Because they can.So, what's a tired hooman to do while their cat is mid-zoomies and their dreams are on pause? Scroll through some weirdly relatable and delightfully unhinged cat memes, of course. These feline funnies were practically made for 4 AM scrolling sessions. They're the purrfect companion for your late-night wake-up calls… right alongside the fluffy chaos gremlin currently sitting on your chest.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.
