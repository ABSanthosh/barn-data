  "description": "We think that every cat owner has been through this moment. Sure, we know that our cats love us deeply. We know it, we have seen it, we believe it, but… as new cat owners, way back in the day, we did wonder, for a mere few seconds, if cats really love their humans that much. Yup, we fell for the propaganda too. We didn't know better. When our cat bit us for the first time, we thought that was it, the cat hated us. Now, things are different, of course, but we still understand that deep, deep fear. We're not going to lie though. As much as we understand the fear, it was still funny as heck for us to come across this thread. Someone tell this man that cats appreciate us and love us and care for us very, very much. Their ways of showing it might simply be a little funny sometimes, and that is okay, we promise. There is no need for mental breakdowns over the subject. But if you do have any more of them, please post them too.",
