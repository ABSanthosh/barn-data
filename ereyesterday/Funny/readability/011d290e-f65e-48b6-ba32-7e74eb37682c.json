  "description": "What do you do when you find out you're living next to someone who thinks you're out to get them? Do you let them be, hoping that they'll come to their senses and realize they're living next to a completely normal person? Or, do you fight fire with fire, figuring out the best way to scare them off? Both approaches have their pros and cons, but I'd be lying if I said there weren't any complications with trying to level with someone who is clearly running on some rather illogical fumes.Some folks have bad days; that's a given. There are weeks when I'll avoid eye contact with all of my neighbors because I'd rather stick to myself. There's nothing wrong with wanting to avoid social interactions. However, when you seek not only interaction but negative interactions, you might want to check in with a therapist or a different kind of doctor. Picking fights for the sake of picking a fight is inherently problematic and causes issues for everyone who lives within a block radius of you; You don't need this lecture, though. The neighbor in this next story does.This neighbor, who opens a homeowner's mail containing their new debit card, accuses them of trying to steal her identity.
