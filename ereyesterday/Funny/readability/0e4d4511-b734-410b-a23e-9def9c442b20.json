  "description": "These days, it feels like there are more red flags than green ones when you're on a first date. Perhaps you have a mental checklist in your mind. Are they human? Are they single? Do they have a 401k? Each singleton has their own personalized criteria. However, one thing that feels pretty universally unacceptable in this day and age is a non-stop texter. After all, you have both presumably gone through the trouble of incessant swiping on dating apps, putting up with surface-level initial messages, and clearing both of your schedules to set up a time to actually meet face-to-face. The last thing anyone should want in this situation is to have a one-sided conversation with someone who won't listen or take notice of you.That's what happened to this Redditor, who tried numerous times to suggest to his date across the table that she was behaving poorly, to no avail. Eventually, he decided to go to the bathroom and he told himself that if he saw that she was still texting when he got out, he would walk out of the side door of the restaurant and leave her to pay the bill. Not exactly the most chivalrous move, but we're inclined to believe that this was earned.For more stories like this, take a look at this post about embarrassing moments people had in public.",
