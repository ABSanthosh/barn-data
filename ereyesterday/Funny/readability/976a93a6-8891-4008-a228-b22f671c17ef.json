  "description": "My life is just sort of nonsense, generally. For the last twenty six years or so there's always something bizarre happening that you might be able to project, but a few of them just don't make any sense at all. We started putting comics online because it seemed clear to us that nobody in their right mind would publish them physically, and it ended up being a whole thing. In 2003 we started a donation drive called Child's Play in the most aggressive way a charity has ever been started I think, and its modern incarnation is an entity that is at the forefront of using VR and AR as therapeutic tools - one that is about to release a certification process for technicians who merge technology and child life. It seemed like more people should be able to go to E3, but they couldn't, and so we made another thing and that one is still going - we're coming up on PAX Unplugged, and the three-day badges just sold out. We made a D\u0026D Podcast before podcasts were super a thing, and it's entirely possible we started Actual Play accidentally. In fact, that's how I came to know the Secretary of State, Steve Hobbs: He's a fan of Acquisitions Incorporated, somehow…?",

He's a huge dork; he's the one that made sure all state libraries had D\u0026D stuff. He is a co-founder of OrcaCon, and his Tabaxi bard is named \"Happy Tracker Meow Meow.\" He's incredibly proud to be from Washington, and when we talk about what we do best here he puts the state's gaming legacy up there with Apples and Wheat and Hops. He thinks of them as one of our most profound exports and he wants to do whatever he can to make it happen for companies here. We know a weird amount about that industry, and how it can communicate itself. We can help. We're both from much smaller places than we ended up, and we didn't forget those places or the people in them. I'm glad he won last night, because I don't wanna be hauling this sad sack around from one karaoke bar to another, different karaoke bar. (CW)TB out.",
