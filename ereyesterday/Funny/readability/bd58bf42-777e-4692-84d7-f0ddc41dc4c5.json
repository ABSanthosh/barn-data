  "description": "Just because your boyfriend makes a 6-figure salary, doesn't mean your FRIENDS get a free dinner...This birthday girl thought that celebrating the day she was born entitled her and her friends to a free meal–at the expense of her money-bag boyfriend. Without warning, she expected him to pay for everybody just because he made a lot more money than they did. Sounds pretty presumptuous, doesn't it?Every friendly gathering at a restaurant starts off with the best intentions before falling into disrepair. Nobody can agree on a time to meet, someone's going to be 30 minutes late, and by the time the meal is over and the bill comes, each friend is far too stressed out about the proper check etiquette to think straight. Why can't old friends meet up without the drama of a restaurant?Well, the dinner in this next story turned out to be a major disaster after a man took his girlfriend out for her birthday dinner. Since the birthday girl wanted some friends to come along, he obliged. They all had fun until the check came and everyone packed up their things without a word and made a mad dash for the door, leaving the guy strapped with a $550 bill for the whole table. Keep scrolling to read all of the details of this frustratingly presumptuous dinner situation that'll make you cringe with disbelief at the audacity of some people.",
