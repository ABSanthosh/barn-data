Once I was old enough to live on my own, my goal was to have my own cat, but I always felt the time wasn't right. Finally, at 44 years old, I went to a local shelter to inquire about a black kitten I saw on the shelter's website. The little black kitten was snuggled in his cage with his little tabby sister and I couldn't imagine separating them. I took them both home that day and am so so glad I did.\" 15\"My partner and I adopted Evie...\" \"My partner and I adopted Evie about 3 months ago! At first she wasn't comfortable and looked grumpy all the time, but you can see her slow progression to opening up and being more playful with us. Really cute to look back at now\" 16\"I made a post about 2 weeks ago about a kitten I was adopting. Well everyone, please meet Ash.\" 17\"Adopted this perfect little thing from the humane society almost 4 months ago after we lost our dog. She’s awesome!!\" 18\"I adopted a cat today!\" \"My dad passed away on the 10th and my dog had to cross the rainbow bridge on the 21st, so I was feeling lonely and in need of companionship. While I was at the shelter donating the food I had bought for my beloved dog, I moseyed into the cat room and this little goofball picked me. I couldn't say no and ended up going home with Ms Cinder!\" 19\"I adopted this cat\" \"This is my lovely boy Benny. 2 months after adopting him I am totally in love \u0026 enjoying his presence in my life. One of the best choices ever. So smart, funny, effectionate \u0026 a tonne of attitude.\" 20\"Adopted a Rescued kitten and sleeping.
