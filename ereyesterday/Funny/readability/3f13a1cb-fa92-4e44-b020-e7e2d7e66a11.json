  "description": "Jeff really should have resigned in the New Year. That way, none of these shenanigans would have gone down at the office Christmas party.Here, we have a former manager who recently resigned the week before the office Christmas party and asked if he could attend the event with his wife anyway. Presumably, he viewed this party as a final goodbye. Naturally, the coworker (who also happened to be hosting the event at his house) felt too cornered in the moment to say no.Thankfully, the coworker followed up after the event to report that things, in fact, were as awkward as he had anticipated. Let's just say that Jeff's wife unexpectedly was the culprit of the most egregious and climactic moment of the evening. Keep scrolling below for the original post and for the coworker's update after the Christmas party. For more stories like this, check out this post about a Karen's HOA conundrum.",
