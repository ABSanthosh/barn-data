  "description": "Okay friends, we're gathered here today to talk about the one subject we cat-lovers despise talking about - the rainbow bridge. Everyone has to cross it at some point, and although we try not to think about it, we know that a day will come when we will have to guide our sweet felines to the entrance. We are tearing up a little bit just thinking about it. However, this is our job as pawrents. We work every day to give our cats the best lives pawssible, up until this day comes. However, we also must remember that life is cyclical and when one kitty leaves us, that leaves space for another one to enter.After losing her soul cat of 21 years, one feline pawrent was going through it. We all know what it's like. But, one day, she went on an errand trip with her mother and came across a stray cat that was nearly identical to her recently passed kitty. Call it fate, call it luck, but whatever you call it, we think it was meant to be. Scroll down to read the wholesome story below (and maybe get some tissues ready, just in case).",

Everything we do is in their best interest. Even if it's unpleasant. We remember the first time one of our cats passed over the rainbow bridge…we were devastated. But, time heals all things, and kittens heal them even faster. A few months after they passed, we went to a shelter and adopted a momma cat and one of her kittens. They filled our hearts with joy and allowed the memories of our older cat to live on peacefully.",
