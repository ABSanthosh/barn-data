  "description": "Favors need reciprocation, never in complete equity, as no two exchanges or circumstances are going to be the same. But in spirit. It's not even about the act of the reciprocation either, it's more about the fact that you are capable of thinking of others outside of yourself, recognizing the things they have done for you, experiencing the gratitude and mirroring it back. It sounds complicated but it's actually really simple if you remain open and aware of the things other people are going out of their way to do for you.But don't expect everyone to understand this, there are many out there who will take the favor without ever thinking, and this extends to all forms of giving and reciprocation in relationships. If you've ever been locked into a relationship with someone who is completely incapable of reciprocating you'll know exactly what this is like.",

And just when you think you've been getting friendly with someone, you know, because you've been driving them to and from work for two years, they go and say something like this.Personally, I'd never drive this guy anywhere ever again.
