  "description": "Parenthood is not easy. That's just a fact. It's a lot of pressure—you don't want to raise a kid to be an entitled adult. So how do you do that? Well, there are many different ways. You can find countless articles, books, and videos about it, even courses! But one thing that is constantly repeated is making sure your child knows there are consequences to their actions. Now, the techniques in showing your child that fact is highly debated, but it's a fact that if you don't teach them this, they will think everything they do, whether it's right or wrong, is fine. That's means they can grow up, borrow a friends car, then completely wreck it and think they don't owe the owner anything. You know what happens then? Straight to court. You're not a kid anymore, you will face consequences no matter how hard your family tries to shield you from them.  In this case, it includes two teenagers. One is 13 and the other 16. The 16-year-old is a bookworm and uses her allowance to buy limited editions and first copies to the books she likes to read. She lent some books out to her 13-year-old cousin once, and got them returned destroyed.",
