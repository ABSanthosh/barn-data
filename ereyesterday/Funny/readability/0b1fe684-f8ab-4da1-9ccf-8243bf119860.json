  "description": "Relationships are a two-way street. Any healthy relationship involves being able to rely on one another when things get hard. Over time, you learn how to work through things like emotional hardships, communication differences, or financial stressors. Love is a give and take, but some people just take and take. If you've had the misfortune of dealing with a freeloading partner, you might relate to this next Reddit story. Here, we have a young couple who live together. When money gets tight, the boyfriend sells his scooter to his girlfriend for $200 and agrees to buy it back from her when his finances are more secure. Well, that time comes, and he starts using the scooter again to get to work but refuses to pay his girlfriend back for it. This leaves her scrambling to figure out her transportation for her college courses and wondering why her boyfriend isn't acting like much of a boyfriend.",
