  "text": "Three years after it first premiered, Squid Game is returning to Netflix. Here is what you need to know about the second season of the hit dystopian drama. Q: When is it coming out? A: At the exact moment when you get kicked off your ex’s Netflix account. Q: Will this season also require audiences to read subtitles? A: No. Execs estimated that enough Americans became fluent in Korean from watching season 1 that subtitles will no longer be available.  Q: Who is joining the cast? A: Ray Romano has been cast as the voice of the giant doll with laser eyes. Q: Is this worth pausing my Friends rewatch? A: Observing a clump of dust blow gently across your kitchen floor is reason enough to pause your Friends rewatch. Q: Why did Gi-hun dye his hair red? A: He’s just expressing himself, god!  Q: What themes does season two explore? A: Greed, sacrifice, and the sick way blood sprays from a human body when crushed. Q: Who wins this time? A: Netflix. Q: Will there be a season three? A: Yes, my little piggies.",
