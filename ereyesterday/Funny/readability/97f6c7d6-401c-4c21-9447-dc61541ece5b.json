  "description": "I haven't played a Kojima game all the way through since Metal Gear Solid 2, and that was before he started getting truly wild with the cutscenes. I love to watch them though, which is fully in-line with the profound, unique spectacle they offer. 2 Live Crew's third album was entitled \"As Nasty As They Wanna Be,\" and there is a version of this principle in place for Hideo Kojima - very, very few people are allowed by the universe to be this true to their instincts, to \"shock the world\" as Silkk The Shocker put it. I'm trying to figure out another old school hip hop reference but I think this paragraph is essentially spent. Everything that we say in the strip is true, though.",
