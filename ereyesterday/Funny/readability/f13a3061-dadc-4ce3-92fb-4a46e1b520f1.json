  "description": "When you're a girl growing up, there's no day more special than a mother-daughter Girl's Day Out. Maybe you go get mani-pedis, maybe you go on a shopping spree, or maybe you just spend a chill day running errands. No matter what, this mother-daughter bonding experience is second to none, and I, for one, wouldn't miss it for the world. One mother had a very special tradition with her daughter for their Girl's Day Out: twice a year, they go to London's West End to see a musical. A perfect way to spend the day, both mother and daughter are lucky to have each other for it. There's one problem this year, though: Mom has a new boyfriend, and he is feeling left out of their plans. He wants to be able to tag along, but Mom stands her ground. Dear reader, I must ask: isn't the point of mother-daughter days to get away from the boys for a minute? If they really wanted to be included, that's why we come home and give them the fashion show after the shopping sprees. Read what this woman has to say to see if she's right to leave her boyfriend out of her Girl's Day Out.",
