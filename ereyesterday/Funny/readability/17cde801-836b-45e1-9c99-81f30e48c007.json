  "text": "Harmon announced a two-season extension with Adult Swim that will carry ‘Rick and Morty’ through Season 12 Only 88 more years’ worth of contract renewals to go.When Adult Swim aired the 22-minute pilot of Rick and Morty on December 2, 2013, the first episode from the series adaptation of some unnamed asshole’s crass, chaotic Back to the Future parody came with a promise – “A hundred years Rick and Morty!” At the time, the star power of Community creator and Rick and Morty co-head Dan Harmon was hardly enough to ensure a century’s worth of episodes from a series that had just premiered on a random Monday night at the beginning of winter, but, within the first few seasons of Rick and Morty’s evolution into Adult Swim’s flagship series and the internet’s most talked-about sci-fi comedy phenomenon, Adult Swim made the wise decision to book Harmon and his forgettable partner through a full ten seasons and 100 episodes. Don't Miss Rick and Morty Season 8 is on the horizon with the show already under contract through Season 10, but, at the ongoing New York Comic Con earlier today, Harmon revealed that he and his team have inked a contract for the series through Season 12, though they’ll presumably announce the news again on rickandmortyonehundredyearsrickandmorty.com. During the Rick and Morty panel at NYCC, which also featured showrunner/Executive producer Scott Marder and voice actors Harry Belden, Ian Cardoni, Sarah Chalke, Spencer Grammer, and Chris Parnell, Marder revealed that the Rick and Morty writing staff has almost finished the “first pass” of Season 10, though adjustments will obviously be made as Seasons 8 and 9 continue down the pipe. Marder also teased the continuing evolution of the Rick and Morty relationship in Season Eight saying, “Morty will always be Rick’s skittish grandson,” but their relationship is becoming “more like Cheech and Chong, in that they’re more silly buddies on a more even playing field” than they used to be.Equally as importantly, Rick voice actor Cardoni revealed that he’s been working on his Rick burps, which has become something of a sticking point in the online discourse for fans. “I’ve been working on my burps and there’s going to be a lot more of them,” Cardoni promised.Thankfully, Adult Swim is in alignment with Harmon's philosophy that Rick and Morty needs to be able to plan many years in advance to weave all the subtle side-plots and easter eggs into the grand tapestry of the show. As such, Rick and Morty should keep a close eye on the smaller details in the upcoming eighth season – after all, if we guess the twists early, we can piss off Harmon and force him to change the show's entire trajectory.
