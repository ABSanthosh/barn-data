This ancient mystery can be neatly explained by a few simple machines and the intense physical labor of tens of thousands of invading alien troops.” Going on to acknowledge the genuine achievements of ancient Egyptians, Egerton noted that these Bronze Age humans had succeeded in using gravity cannons and proton rays to build the Great Sphinx in a single afternoon.
