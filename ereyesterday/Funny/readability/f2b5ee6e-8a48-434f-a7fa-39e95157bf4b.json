  "description": "A world with no HOAs would look quite different than the world we have today. Instead of those cookie-cutter cul de sacs where every lawn is pristine and all the cars are hidden inside garages, people might be more carefree with their decorating. Homeowners Associations operate as if all homeowners are slobs who only want to trash their neighborhood. They'll see someone put their trashcan outside too early and think that they're a delinquent, instead of the reality, which is probably that they just have a long list of chores to get through and are trying to be proactive. HOAs are known for handing out utterly ridiculous fines, but that's not all. Some of them also take matters further. Just ask the person who discovered that their HOA had cut down two of their trees! That's just so unacceptable, and I hope their HOA had to answer to someone for their actions. Next, read about the hardware store \"employee\" who weighed down a customer's car with no less than 30 bags of concrete: 'I started moving the bags, 2 at a time.'",

This program is run by [redacted] for P**  Prints and works by creating a unique DNA profile for each dog in the community.

When a waste sample is found, it is collected by our management company and sent to the lab. The DNA in the dog's f*ces is matched to a dog in the system and the violator is fined and charged for the cost of the analysis. New and existing dogs and visiting dogs of existing owners are required to be registered within 2 weeks of program implementation or occupancy or visit. The cost for the DNA program registration is $86.14 per dog. This cost covers the DNA swabbing, DNA collection kit, and database registration. Payment can be made with your regular monthly assessment. Pet Registration is [redacted] scheduled times at the community clubhouse or by appointment at [redacted].
