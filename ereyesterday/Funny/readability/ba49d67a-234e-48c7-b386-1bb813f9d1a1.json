  "description": "Unfortunately, the number of people who regret becoming parents grows every single year, or at least that is how it seems like, with how much those parents are talking about it.I have seen my fair share of mothers on social media talking about how, even though they love their kids, they often wish they didn't jump into parenthood as quickly as they did, and how much they miss the freedom they had before they decided to raise another human being. While I think it's brave to share these feelings online, I also often wonder why they feel the need to share those dark thoughts with the world. Then I imagine it is mostly a cautionary tale, to \"warn\" other women to think twice before they make such a commitment, because it is not something they can ever take back. Or at least, that is the case for most parents.Some parents not only regret their choice, but they actually end up backing out of the whole parenting thing altogether.",
