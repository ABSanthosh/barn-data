  "description": "Just because someone throws a fit does not mean you have to give in to their demands. On the flip side, just because you threw a fit does not mean you have earned what you want. You would think that these sentiments would be common knowledge to any decent, empathetic human being. But alas, you'd be surprised. Here, we have a Redditor who specifically booked a window seat for her upcoming flight because the one thing she genuinely enjoys about flying is looking at the clouds. Of course, this experience was ruined when a family of three approached her seat and the entitled six-year-old son started having a full-blown meltdown because he wanted the window seat his parents had not purchased. Thankfully, the Redditor refused to back down despite the fact that everyone else on the plane had turned their heads to watch this fiasco unfold. While the kid's parents proved to be unhelpful and aggressive to the passenger, hopefully the kid learned a valuable lesson that day: you can't scream and cry your way into everything you want.For more stories like this, take a look at this one about a husband who confronted his wife over her Taylor Swift-themed Holiday decorations around the house.",
