  "description": "We've all crossed paths with this workplace archetype: the non-boss who acts like they're running the whole operation, the part-time oracle of unsolicited advice, who somehow makes every meeting, task, or lunchtime interaction about them. At first, you think their nagging is helpful, maybe even a gesture of goodwill to help you learn the ropes. And then the reality hits—they're less mentor and more menace.  This is the coworker who demands endless help while simultaneously critiquing your work, like they're chairing your performance review on their lunch break. They'll ask you to do their job, then circle back 20 minutes later to let you know you're doing yours wrong. \"We're a team, right?\"",
