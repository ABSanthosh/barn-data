  "description": "One wrong letter or word can make a whole phrase mean something entirely different! You might accidentally be implying the opposite of what you intended, or you might just have made yourself look like a total ignoramus. Regardless, nine times out of ten, a decently intelligent person will catch themselves and rebound nicely, whereas an unintelligent person might not even notice their colossal mistake. The worst is when they're called out on said error and they double down, insisting that they're right. That means they're daft and stubborn, a lethal combination.I'll never forget that time in high school when someone fully wrote a paper about Leonardo Da Vinci, only he referred to the renowned painter as the Oscar-winning actor instead. You will see that someone else made the same mistake below. This also reminds me of a close friend of mine who spelled Mick Jagger like McDonald's (McJagger) throughout a college paper. We can laugh about it now, but it was a total face-palm moment back in school.",
