  "description": "Sometimes you make a mistake, but it still gets you the correct answer. Like when you do all the work in a math question, but every number along the way is wrong and you're not even doing the right thing, and yet you still got the right answer. Was it luck or are you secretly a genius and just discovered a new way to math? Most likely the luck one, because math is hard…  In the case of this itty bitty kitten, she might have gone to the wrong doctor's office, but she still ended up finding the exact kind of doctor she needed! This sick little baby waltz on into the waiting room of a human hospital clinic. She was meowing her little head off and everybody was ignoring her—except one person. A lady who was waiting patiently for her appointment. This lady, however, wasn't just any 'ole body, she was a veterinarian! She immediately recognized the cries for help and didn't hesitate to come to the rescue.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
