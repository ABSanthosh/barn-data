  "description": "How do you react when your spouse tells you to \"quit being so dramatic\"? For many people, being told that phrase immediately sets them off. But this person actually is being rather dramatic, for rather confusing reasons, over an office Valentine's Day party. Some offices celebrate every holiday with snacks or games, while other workplaces choose not to focus on holidays. It can be a nice break for the employees to snack on cupcakes or win a little prize. Everyone knows it's just a little break to have fun for like 15 minutes before heading back to your laptop to write emails. This person is pushing back against their office's planned Valentine's Day festivities, and her reasoning is that the holiday is meant for couples only. That's basically her only reason for not wanting to celebrate: she thinks that \"Valentine's Day is for couples… not coworkers to express their affection.\" But she also mentions that all of her colleagues are married, so… what's even the problem? It's not like some pink cupcakes are going to spark a torrid office romance, it's just good innocent fun. Commenters told her as much, but she didn't want to hear it. In her mind, they don't \"comprehend the concept of Valentine's Day.\" Okay, whatever you say! After that, some experienced travelers shared their biggest red flags while they're at hotels, like one person who wrote that 'When it's advertised as \"family friendly,\" that means noise.'",
