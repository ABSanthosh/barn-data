Management wants to make sure that any code is well tested, so they've set a requirement that all deployed code needs 75% code coverage. Unfortunately, properly configuring a code coverage tool is too hard, so someone came up with a delightful solution: just count how many lines are in your tests and how many lines are in your code, and make sure that your tests make up 75% of the total codebase. Given those metrics, someone added this test: public void testThis() { int i = 0; i++; i++; i++; i++; i++; // snip 35,990 lines i++; i++; i++; i++; } Keep adding lines, and you could easily get close to 100% code coverage, this way. Heck, if you get close enough to round up, it'll look like 100% code coverage. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
