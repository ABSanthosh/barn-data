  "description": "Losing a friend is something that is hard for everyone - humans and animals alike. And although we know that some people still find it hard to believe that some cats and dogs can be best friends… they really can. And this doggo proves it. Because when this dog's best cat friend crossed the rainbow bridge, he was heartbroken. We don't know if we have ever seen an animal actually mourn a friend, but we saw it today, in this video. It's undeniable that this doggo loved that cat, so it's hard to be mad at it for being a little wary when his family adopted a new kitty for him. But eventually, after enough time and nagging from the cute black kitty, the doggo caved. Because he had all that space in his heart left by his best friend to fill. He didn't replace his old friend, he just made a new one, and yes… yeah, get the tissues before you watch this one.",
