  "description": "Young women today don't have to choose, as their foremothers did. They don't have to be pigeonholed into the staid and static roles they've always had to select from, either candle maker or Hive Matriarch. They can be both. I think. I don't really know, I guess. Isn't a hive basically just a big candle you never light? That seems reasonable to me.",
