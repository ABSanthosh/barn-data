  "description": "When I was growing up, presents from my parents each said \"From: Mom and Dad.\" Now, from a young age, there was no doubt in my mind or secret kept that my mother was the one who had actually gone out and purchased each gift (with some exceptions, of course), but that didn't mean that my father had any less to do with it. No one's relationship is perfect—as no two people themselves are perfect—but their relationship had an equal contribution that they both worked hard at… and, so, both their names went on the gift. I don't have kids of my own—yet—so parents feel free to stop me here, but I couldn't imagine doing it any differently.Don't get me wrong here, and I know that the gifts weren't specifically for children, but the issue seems to be larger than the presents themselves and seems to be speaking more to the space of equal contribution and following through on doing the things that you say you're going to do. But, taking a petty stance and putting only your name on the gifts you bought when going to a family is just airing your dirty laundry out for everyone to see and—well, if you've been around family ever in your life, that's a can of worms you're better not opening.",
