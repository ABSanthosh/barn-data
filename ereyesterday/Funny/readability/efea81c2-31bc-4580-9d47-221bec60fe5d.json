  "description": "You can go to a restaurant with the best food in the world, but if the service is bad, the entire experience is ruined. On the flip side, great service can (sort of) make up for less-than-stellar food. A server's attitude and effort usually depend on management and how they're treated as employees. Whether you're a server or not, you know that if you're not being treated fairly by your boss, you're not about to go above and beyond when on the clock.That's exactly what happened when this restaurant got a new manager. The changes started small but quickly spiraled—added workloads, stricter rules, and management's complete disregard for employee well-being. One longtime server had been there for years, but after watching the restaurant go downhill, they gave their notice. But before leaving, they warned management: \"You're going to lose all your best people.\" Andddd, they were right. Keep reading to find out what happened next.",
