  "description": "You know what is one of the best things about cats? Sure, cats bring us peace, and that's awesome. And cats are so funny, and they make us laugh all the times with the silliest things, and that's awesome. And no one could argue about how cute cats are and about how them just existing in our homes, as their cute little selves, makes us happier. But it's not all of that. What truly makes cats purrfect… is the chaos they cause and the funny cat memes that we can make about them. You would think that an animal that is so lazy would not bring about that much chaos, but the sheer amount of ridiculous cat memes that there is out there should clue you in on the fact that you are wrong. They may sleep 12-16 hours a day, but during the few hours that they are awake, between the cleaning and eating, cats make sure that your life is never boring. And we love them for it.",
