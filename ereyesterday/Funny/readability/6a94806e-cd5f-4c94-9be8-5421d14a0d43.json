  "text": "Kelly ‘Coelasquid’ Turnbull tried to keep their contribution to the show under wraps King of the Hill has a new home on Hulu, but the show may regret giving the fans its new address.We’re barely a month away from the release of the first season of the King of the Hill streaming revival, which will feature Hank and Peggy returning from an extended work stay in Saudi Arabia to find Arlen, Texas in 2025 to be a very different town from the one they left. King of the Hill creators Greg Daniels and Mike Judge are taking the series into the modern day to deal with modern problems; meanwhile, one member of their animation staff is concerned about one of the oldest toxic fandom tricks in the book if the show’s passionate online following doesn’t like what they see on August 4th.Kelly Turnbull is an animator, director and online comic artist under their moniker Coelasquid who worked on the new season of King of the Hill. When the Hulu released the show’s new opening credits, Turnbull took to Bluesky to reveal that they did the storyboard for the new intro sequence, but they worried about going public with the professional opportunity for fear of hacking and harassment from “weird assholes.” Don't Miss Now that’s not a nice way to talk about Bill — and he definitely doesn’t know how to hack anyone. “I didn’t talk about it much because I didn’t want weird assholes doxxing my emails and trying to break into my portfolio (that doesn’t even have KotH boards on it for exactly that reason), but I directed the premiere episode of the revival series,” Turnbull wrote under a post about the above video, telling their followers of the new King of the Hill storylines. “I might be biased because I’m so close to it but I really like the new episodes and I hope other people do too. I read the first script and I was like, ‘Feels like coming home.’” While the King of the Hill fandom doesn’t have a documented history of hacking into directors’ websites or posting their email addresses in public forums, there’s always a first for everything, and you can never be too careful when dealing with a decades-old online community with fiercely held opinions on anything and everything related to the reboot, especially in the animation department. Hopefully, the King of the Hill revival meets and exceeds expectations, and the inevitably furious subsection of the fandom who has already decided to hate the new season sticks to the subreddit and other message boards with their toxicity. But, if the weird assholes do come for Turnbull, they’ll know what to do as a King of the Hill fan themselves. Repeat after me: “That’s my purse, I don’t know you!” Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
