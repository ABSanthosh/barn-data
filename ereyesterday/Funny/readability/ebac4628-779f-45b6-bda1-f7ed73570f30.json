  "description": "What could be better for workplace morale than dumping your least favorite customer? It really brings people together to bond over a customer who just cannot be satisfied, as this car dealer could tell you all about. There are plenty of jobs that require employees to deal with impolite customers, but working at a car dealership takes the customer service aspect to a whole new level. These people are often paid handsomely for their work, and they have plenty of leeway to decide who will purchase their vehicles and how much they'll pay for them. Car dealers use tons of tricks to get their customers to buy more expensive vehicles or opt into pricey add-ons. Unfortunately for this car salesperson, one of their customers had a crazy approach to buying their vehicle. First of all, they forged a document in order to snag a $3,000 discount, which seems ethically dubious if not straight-up illegal. This employee did the right thing by flagging this and contacting their manager. The manager then got a bright idea and had his employee send an email, which you can read all about in the satisfying tale below. After that, read the eye-opening tale of a newlywed couple who were \"devastated\" to learn that they were only going to make $3,000 off of their $60,000 wedding, leading commenters to wonder, \"Did they think they were gonna make money from their wedding?\"",
