  "description": "There are pros and cons to hourly work. While you're only getting paid while on the clock on the job, you can cash in on overtime, pickup extra shifts for more dough, and count your skrilla at the end of each pay period. And, unlike a salary position, if you get loads of new work dumped on your plate, you'll likely get paid for it. However, the employer in this next story thought he could get away with a little daylight robbery against his employees, hoping for some free, at-home labor from his workforce. Well, Buddy, this ain't a salary position! You've messed with the hourly crew this time.",

  "text": "An hourly job may feel tedious at times—clocking in and out of work to keep your micromanagers happy—but at least it's easily quantifiable. Your time is worth $X/per hour, and that's irrefutable! So if you had a boss who was instructing your team of hourly workers to start picking up tasks at home, you'd likely tell them where to shove it. But instead of refusing the extra overtime hours, the physical therapy assistant in this next story decided to get paid for his extra effort—double-overtime at that! Because when you have to do laundry at home that isn't even yours, you might as well clock in and reap the benefits on your next paycheck. Keep scrolling for the entire story of malicious compliance that taught this freeloading boss a lesson about hourly wage workers.",
