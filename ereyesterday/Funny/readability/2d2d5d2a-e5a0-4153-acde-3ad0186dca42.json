  "description": "Typically around the holiday season, corporate employers bosses go out of their way to make it seem like their employees are treated well.

These are the same folks who make at least five times what their employees make, as this Redditor pointed out. Shouldn't they be pitching in some of their own money for gifts to their employees?Keep scrolling below for the full story and for some commentary from yours truly.
