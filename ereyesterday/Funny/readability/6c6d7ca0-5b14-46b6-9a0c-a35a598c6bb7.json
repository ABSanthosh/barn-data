  "description": "I finally got to what Gabe has been dying to talk to me about in Clair Obscur, and now I know why he wanted to talk to me about it so bad. That it still has serious things to reveal coming up on fifty hours is cool, but the things it goes into are gobsmacking. No part of the gob has remained unsmacked - it's barely recognizable as a gob at all.",

There's things I could compare it to, but not without the danger of exposing something that… Man, I don't even want to say this much. I just wrote another sentence and erased it. I should probably just talk about the music. This game is fucking insane, on every level. The music gets a ton of praise, and one thing that sets it apart is that it makes really broad use of vocal melodies. It stands out a lot, and it drops such a surprising, human texture into scenes and battles. Not just tones, actual lyrics. I could see that being distracting if it were in a language I spoke well, maybe even exhausting with repetition, but in this context a person is just a really cool sort of instrument. There's also a lot of tracks and it's a feast of variety. We gotta keep an eye on this dude, holy shit. Check this shit out: Hearing this track was like when the bar comes down on the rollercoaster and now you're locked in for whatever is gonna happen. They have a bunch of these orchestra session videos and they ball out of control. Also, Clair Obscur means \"chiaroscuro.\" Imagine my delight!  Just imagine it. (CW)TB out.",
