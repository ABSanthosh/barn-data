  "description": "Allergies should be taken seriously, obviously. I'm allergic to bees; Truthfully, a big ol' carpenter bee was in my house this morning. I had a cup, a giant blanket, sunglasses, and a dream… Needless to say, crisis averted. I'm the first person to say that allergies can make or break someone, literally, and it's important to abide by the allergic person's requests sometimes. This is especially true when someone has an allergy to food, and the good ol' peanut allergy knows how to ruin someone's day.Why are peanuts in almost every factory? What's up with that? Even still, it's up to the employees working the register to let their inquiring customers know if their allergen is in the food products. Some entitled folks, though, ask the questions but don't believe the answers. You'd think that if the employee triple-checked a container to make sure no allergens were in a tub of ice cream, the customer would feel at peace. At that point, it might be safe to say that they shouldn't eat out if they require a call to the Ben \u0026 Jerry's factory…Scroll below to see the fallout between a young, seasonal ice cream shop employee and a customer who refuses to believe them.",
