  "description": "Is it just me, or dinners with bosses are something we used to see quite a lot in old TV shows and movies? It's not a strange concept for a boss and their spouse to invite a new hire over to their house for a get-to-know-each-other dinner. It sounds completely reasonable to me. That being said, if my boss were to ever invite me over to dinner at his house, I would probably look at him as if he had just grown three heads. Not only would the offer sound bizarre coming from him, but I legitimately do not want to spend three hours in a strange house, awkwardly making small talk with my boss and his spouse, whom I have never met. We do enough bonding in the office; there is no need to involve our personal lives as well. But what can you do if the boss invites you over? It's not like you can actually tell them no… Getting an offer like this from the boss is not something anyone can ignore, which leads employees like the one in the story below into a spiral.",
