  "description": "Ah, the story of the cat hater. We have heard many of those. People keep telling us that they hate cats, but we know the truth… We, real cat people, know that they simply have not met the right cat yet. Yes, it is that simple. Cats can win anyone over. We have seen it time and time again. We've seen dads who've hated cats their whole lives suddenly get adopted by a cat and fall in love with them. We have seen moms who hated cats fall in love with a single-braincelled orange kitten who stopped at absolutely nothing to make that happen. We've seen a boyfriend who hated cats go out of his way to save their girlfriend's cat when it got stuck in a cupboard, therefore forever losing his cat hater card. And today, another story. A girlfriend who hated cats - truly and honestly hated them - was won over. And all it took was the cat showing her a little real affection at a time when she needed it. Yes, it really is that easy.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
