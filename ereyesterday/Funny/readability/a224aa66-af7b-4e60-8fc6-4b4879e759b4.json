  "description": "Whatever happened to respecting people's dietary restrictions in the workplace? Typically, we're accustomed to situations in which bosses unfairly pressure employees, but in this instance, we have an employee who tried to guilt his new boss into purchasing and eating Girl Scout cookies that she couldn't consume because of a serious gluten-free allergy.First of all, if someone does not want to eat something and politely declines, there should be no obligation on their part to explain themselves or justify their choices. Questioning someone's diet, especially in the workplace, is also a no-no. Again, these are all concepts that should be second nature, and yet, clearly, not all folks think twice in the office these days.Keep scrolling below for this manager's story and for the reactions from folks who took her side in the matter!",

  "text": "Let's start by putting ourselves in this new manager's shoes. She was just finding her footing within the company and did not quite have that many allies just yet. When a coworker tried to get her to purchase his daughter's Girl Scout cookies, she tried to explain to him that she wasn't going to eat them because of a gluten-free allergy. The coworker did not seem to take her reasoning seriously and interpreted her refusal to purchase said cookies as an offense. After all, in his eyes, their last manager always purchased boxes upon boxes of his daughter's Girl Scout cookies every year. This is when the back-and-forth escalated into a problem, and surprisingly, the other coworkers in the office did not take the gluten-free manager's side. Although the manager may have felt alone on this matter at work, several folks in this online community came to her defense and voiced that despite the hierarchy within the company, she should not have been pressured to purchase something she could not even consume just because she was the boss. Here's what these folks had to say!",
