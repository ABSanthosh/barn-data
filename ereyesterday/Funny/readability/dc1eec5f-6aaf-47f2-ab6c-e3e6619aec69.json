  "text": "The couple has disagreed about venting disguised as comedy Chris Convy, the TV producer who’s been in a romantic relationship with Nikki Glaser — on and off, anyway — for the past 10 years, has a pretty simple rule for being ridiculed in her comedy routines. He’s all good as long as the audience is laughing. @hbo“My boyfriend's so cool,” Glaser told People last week at the American Music Awards. “He's given me permission. He said, ‘You can talk about anything on stage about me as long as it’s funny. The second it isn’t, if it bombs, then we have an issue. If you’re just venting up there just to get it off your chest and embarrass me, not good, but if you’re up there and you’re making a solid joke, you can do whatever you want.’” Using jokes as a way to vent about their relationship isn’t strictly a hypothetical. Glaser told Howard Stern last year that she and Convy have broken up in the past after she aired the couple’s dirty laundry on funny podcasts rather than directly talking to him about things that were bothering her. “I would air those complaints on podcasts, not because I thought he won’t hear them,” she explained. “They would just come out naturally under the guise of ‘It’s comedy!’” Don't Miss Glaser says that things she should have said privately instead came out over a microphone. “The hardest part is talking about your relationship on stage or injecting jokes where you’re upset about something, and you bring it to the stage before you bring it to him,” she continued. “So maybe that’s where tension arises, but not really anymore.” Dating a comedian is tough, even when relationship problems aren’t discussed on stage. “It is very hard to date me. I am an open book. I am pornographic in what I say. I’m not someone that (is easy) bringing around to your family, based on the things I’ve described doing, sex acts, like I’m basically a porn star,” she told Graham Bensinger in 2023. “I am pornographic in many ways, and that can be not the easiest thing to bring home to mom.” Convy is unlikely to be blindsided by most of Glaser’s current material, working as her executive producer on her HBO specials and Golden Globes appearances. In fact, she gives Convy a lot of the credit for her recent rise in popularity.  “He’s a creative genius, and he’s a TV producer for years and years. My glow up within the industry, a big percentage of that is due to him being like, let’s focus and let’s make these things look better than they could ever look,” she said. “We have a really good working relationship.” Tags: News Scroll down for the next article Must Read SIGN UP FORA WEEKLYNEWSLETTER OF JOKES + TRIVIA",
