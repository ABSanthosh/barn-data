  "description": "Kittens are tiny little menaces. We love them more than life itself, but they are seriously smol engines of chaos that are simultaneously the cutest things on Earth and also your worst nightmare. They climb all over everything, run around at all hours of the night for a good 6 to 9 months… but even with all of that, you choose to keep them in your house because they are like little fluff balls with big eyes and even bigger purrsonalities. They aren't the easiest thing to live with, but they certainly do not warrant an elderly neighbor getting a restraining order against you because your kitten makes noise.Yes, you read that correctly. After this San Diego resident adopted a 3-month-old kitten, his downstairs neighbor started calling the police on him for his cat making too much noise, and even had him summoned to court (twice)! Everyone understood how absurd this was, except for the neighbor. Read through the whole kitten cat-astrophe below!Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",
