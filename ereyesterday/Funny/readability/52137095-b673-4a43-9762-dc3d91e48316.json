  "description": "Neighborly parking disputes are no new thing, but they almost constitute \"friendly fire\" when they take shape between members of the same household. There's nothing worse than living with someone who just thinks they're completely immune to the rules and social obligations that everyone else has to follow. This type of behavior speaks volumes to the propensity for people to be petty and selfish, trying to shape the world around them into a form that best suits them independent of any moral or even logical reason. At this point, you probably already have someone in mind who fits this description, probably even a specific former roommate, as it's simply the luck of the draw that you'll have some such roommate at least some point in your life.This young woman got her own roommate's car towed when her roommate repeatedly insisted on blocking both of their allocated spots, taking up both spots so that it was easier to get her own car in and out at the expense of the ability of her roommates to park in the second spot. After the confrontation that was sparked by her roommate's behavior and her own drastic measures, she turned to this online community to see if she was in the wrong for her actions.",
