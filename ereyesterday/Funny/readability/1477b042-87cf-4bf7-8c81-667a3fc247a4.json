  "description": "There's nothing more infuriating than trying to sleep while someone else in the house is making enough noise to keep you awake. As someone who lives in the downstairs of a duplex, I know this feeling all too well. It's like trying to ignore an elephant tap-dancing above you. It's impossible. But for the guy in this story, his stress levels were already through the roof as he was prepping for finals week just around the corner. Already on edge, things took a turn for the worse when his cousin asked to crash with him for a while after landing an internship near his place. At first, he thought it was no big deal. Family's family, after all. But he instantly regretted this little arrangement when the midnight gaming marathons began. If you game yourself, you know there's no amount of earplugs or patience that can drown out loud video games, banter, and TV noise for anyone else in the household. But little did this guy know, his \"easy\" decision to host his cousin would lead to a battle over Wi-Fi, sleep, and sanity. So, he had to take matters into his own hands.",
