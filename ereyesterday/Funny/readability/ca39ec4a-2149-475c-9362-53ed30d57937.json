  "description": "Happy almost new year, feline fam! 2024 has been a very silly year, and part of that is thanks to you all! We've spent years building up our I Can Has Cheezburger family, slowly connecting all of the meme lovers from the cat community from across the interwebz to make a wholesome, hissterical, and purrfeclty pawesome group that is full of pawsitivity and LOLs. We've shared your homemade cat memes every week this year, and now it's time for us to round up the best of the best and take one last laugh at 2024 before we get into 2025.Grumpy Cat has nothing on you guys - some of these memes are the most fluffing funny we've ever seen (and trust us, we've seen a lot of cat memes). Move over Smudge, there are some new meme wizards in town and they're ready to pounce all over the competition with a claw full of comedy. It was nearly impawssible to pick the best out of a year's worth of memes, so we settled on a very reasonable number…50! Thank you so much from us at the I Can Has Cheezburger office. We LOLed a lot this year thanks to you, and here's to another year of LOLs and love!",
