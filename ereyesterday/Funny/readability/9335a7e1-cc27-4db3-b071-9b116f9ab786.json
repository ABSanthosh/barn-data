  "description": "Here, at ICHC, we celebrate when people help kittens in need. If someone hears a kitten crying for help or helps a kitten who approached them, we see that as one of the kindest things that you can pawssibly do. And that is exactly what the couple in this story did. When they saw a kitten climbing up their window, trying to find shelter during a storm, they did the only thing that they thought was right - they brought the kitten in, even started making plans to adopt the kitten. It's not their fault that the kitten turned out to be a bobcat. We suppose that in the darkness, when you're saving a kitten, you might not notice that it's a tiny bit bigger than it should be and that's its shape and its fur pattern are a little unusual. We still believe that they did the right thing when bringing the kitten in, because we're not sure how well it would have done out there in the storm if its momma was not nearby at the time, but the best thing that they did, of course, was to help the kitten reunite with its momma in the morning. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

They thought that they were chosen by the cat distribution system… except they realized very quickly that what they adopted was not a normal kitten.  05 “It went from thinking we were saving a baby kitten, maybe being able to have a new kitten, to then this is a bobcat, what are we supposed to do?” Lilly explained. “I mean, it was just a regular Tuesday night for us. We were just playing, and we were going to do bedtime. And then it just took a detour, but it was just shocking.” 06 07 The couple kept the baby warm and safe overnight and called animal control to figure out what to do next. In the meantime, their Ring camera captured footage of the worried bobcat momma circling their home multiple times, looking for her baby.  08 The next morning, animal control took the bobcat kitten and placed it where the couple first found it, and within minutes, the momma bobcat came to get her baby. “Incredible to see, especially in your own backyard when you recognize all the trees and everything, and then you see these interesting creatures, so it was really, really cool.” 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Tags Scroll Down For The Next Article",
