  "description": "Money-grubbing customers are the worst, but this street-smart kid knew exactly how to handle their entitlement: Shame. There are clout-chasers in every city, but they all play the same game. Pretending to know people out of their social structure somehow deems them more worthy of the attention of others, so in a desperate attempt to climb the social ladder or receive some other popularity benefit, these types of people schmooze and sip their way into socialite status. But if you're clever and a bit salty, you can pull away the veil of their little plans, foiling their clout-farming attempts in an instant. This restaurant owner's kid in this next story had seen their fair share of 'fine dining' enthusiasts attempting to impress their friends, but they'd had enough of the BS by the time the entitled customers in this next story rolled into the shop. Perhaps it was the smell of truffle oil turning sour in her nose or the sound of another over-priced champagne bottle being popped, but this dinner turned into an expensive ordeal when these customers realized they wouldn't be getting the 'friends and family' discount.",
