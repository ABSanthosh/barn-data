  "description": "This situation sounds like every kid's dream and every neighbor's worst nightmare. If you spent ages begging your parents for a pool or a trampoline as a kid, you're not alone. It's a common experience for kids who want to get their energy out and spend countless hours swimming or bouncing with their friends. Of course, as a kid you probably aren't aware of what the neighbors think about you bouncing on a trampoline for hours every day, or splashing around loudly in a pool doing cannonballs with your friends. This person didn't want to be a bother, but their neighbor's kids were getting really out of hand with the noise. They tried to be \"patient and accommodating\" of the kids' playtime. But when the children start playing on their water slide bouncy castle at 5 in the morning, the castle blocks a beautiful mountain view, and the water is pouring out of the neighbor's yard, what's a person to do?Well, for u/imthekarn, calling in the HOA was the perfect solution. They aren't always the most helpful bunch, but in a situation like this, sometimes it's the best way to get an impolite neighbor to knock it off with the bad behavior. Next, read about the hilarious suggestions anonymous people submitted for changes in a hospital, like one person who suggested that we should \"allow patients to vote each other off the ward.\"",
