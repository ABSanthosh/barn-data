  "description": "Did you know cats sleep for about 300 hours a day? They're like the napping champions of the world. People might wrongly assume the napping champions would be sloths, but they're wrong. While sloths earned their full respect for their sleeping abilities - cats do it all while living with us, haughty hoomans, who would, in theory, disrupt every attempt for cats to sleep - but somehow, they succeed. Despite hoomans making all this noise around the house, despite hoomans deciding to pet the cats while they take their afternoon nap - cats can sleep for like a bajillion amount of time.Since cats are the kings and queens of memes, and also the running champions of wild wide napping - it's no wonder there are so many memes with these combined concepts in them. We gathered a bunch of sleepy cat memes for you to show your cat, only once they wake up, of course… We wouldn't want to interrupt their cutie patootie sleep… Would we?",
