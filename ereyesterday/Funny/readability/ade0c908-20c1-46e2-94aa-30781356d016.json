  "description": "Job interviews are one of the most nerve-wracking first-world experiences anyone can be a part of. As humans, we must work for a living, and working for a living means needing a job, and needing a job means needing to interview for that job. In the current job market, it's difficult to land an interview in the first place, let alone do well enough in the interview to be asked back by the prospective employer. In a perfect world, job seekers would have the upperhand when it comes to landing a job… but this isn't a perfect world—it's a world that belongs to corporate companies and their entitled ways.In this next story, a job seeker is humiliated for having a PhD by their military veteran interviewer, after having two prior interview rounds for the role. Not only did the interviewer call their PhD \"worthless\", but they also claimed a high schooler could get the open job done. Maybe they should do that instead of berating innocent job seekers…",
