  "description": "We remember, from the time that we were kids, seeing videos on the TV of big cats doing all kinds of cool tricks in circuses. We remember the audiences cheering. We remember thinking that it was amazing. And then, we grew up, and we realized what it took for cats to do stuff like that. Nowadays, it's hard for us to look at things like this, despite the fact that we know it's still going on in some places in the world. We want to look away, but we don't think that we should. It's good to remember, and more than that, it's good to celebrate the times that big cats like that get rescued. Whether it's a lion cub getting rescued and being given a chance at a new life, if it's mountain lions getting rescued and learning to enjoy life again, or if it's a tiger getting rescued, like the one that you will be meeting today, and being given a chance, for the first time in her life, to taste freedom. And like the comments under the video say: \"Such a beautiful animal. And seeing her playing like a kitten is heartwarming. I hope she lives the rest of her life in comfort and peace.\"Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
