  "description": "I am thrilled to present to you the reality deniers: a fascinating breed of managers who've created their own alternate dimension where basic human needs like time off and not being on-call 24/7 are just elaborate hoaxes perpetrated by lazy employees. These truth-resistant supervisors have developed complex theories about how approved vacation time is actually a myth, and documentation is just an elaborate illusion created by the deep-workforce to undermine their authority.Their most impressive talent is their ability to completely reject observable reality. Present them with written proof of approved time off, and they'll explain how it's clearly doctored evidence. Show them timestamped documentation, and they'll launch into elaborate theories about how the scheduling system has been compromised by forces working against them. They've mastered the art of transforming irrefutable facts into debatable opinions through sheer force of denial.These managers operate in a fascinating bubble where employees exist in a quantum state of perpetual availability, and the very concept of being genuinely unreachable is dismissed as anti-corporate propaganda. They've constructed entire belief systems around the idea that workers are actually always accessible, and any evidence to the contrary is part of a vast conspiracy to disrupt their perfectly crafted schedules.",
