  "description": "Purrsonally, we understand the desire to help every cat you meet. It's something instinctual in us. We see a cat on the street and we are swept up by the urge to take them home, feed them some tuna, and teach them to snuggle. However, not every cat needs saving, despite how they may look on the outside. Some cats have a pawsitively enjoyable neighborhood life, with one main family and several side-families that feed them, love them, and house them. You might be surprised how common it is for a cat to have multiple families.So, when the cat lover in this post wrote about how she wanted to save this cat from a life outside, we get it. However, she goes on to say that the cat is clean and well-cared for, so at what point does she need to convince herself that she's not actually saving the cat, but stealing it? We'll leave it to you to find out what happens in the end, but let's just say that everyone gets a purrfectly happy ending!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly.
