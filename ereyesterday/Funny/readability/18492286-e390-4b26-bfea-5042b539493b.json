From the look of panic on his face, it was clear that this was a full hair-on-fire emergency. \"Did we change anything this weekend?\" \"No,\" Branon said. \"We never deploy on a weekend.\" \"Well, something must have changed?!\" After a few rounds of this, Steve's panic wore off and he explained a bit more clearly. Every night, their application was supposed to generate a set of nightly reports and emailed them out. These reports went to a number of people in the company, up to and including the CEO.

Can you investigate why the emails aren't going out?\" Branon put aside his concerns, and agreed to dig through and debug the problem. Given that it involved sending emails, Branon was ready to spend a long time trying to debug whatever was going wrong in the chain.
