  "description": "We don't know why it is that cats seem to cause so much drama between roommates. You know, when you're moving in somewhere or when you're getting a new roommate, whether they have a cat or not. If you don't want it in your house, don't take the roommate. If you don't want roommate that will cause drama around your feline, ask about it, find out if and what they might have issues with. Seriously, we have seen so much drama that could have been avoided if only a few questions were asked. We have seen roommates lock cats in their rooms without permission. We have seen roommates get mad because they're allergic to cats even though they agreed to getting a roommate with a cat in the first place. We've seen roommates unexpectedly bring cats home even though the other roommates didn't know and didn't agree to it. Today's story… we don't know if this one could have been avoided. It seems like the roommates in question were either dumb or liars. Thankfully, the cat is okay. But really, ask some questions. Don't risk your cat.",

Thank goodness that you found your cat. And that third roommate… sounds like that one might be a keeper.  It would have been so easy to avoid all of this, we agree with all of the commenters about that. There is no reason the kitty should have run out. But that would have required the roommates to give a heck, and it sounds like they didn't.",
