  "description": "What is the purpose of homeowner's associations if not to stir up unnecessary trouble?We have seen countless stories where HOAs enforce ridiculous rules and regulations just for the sake of flexing their muscles, yet we have rarely seen a group of neighbors band together in support of one of their own, who successfully got rid of a ridiculous new policy. In this scenario, the HOA in question randomly decided to require that several members of the neighborhood replenish their decks and landscaping areas. However, according to the rules and regulations expressly written in the HOA handbook, these areas were under the direct jurisdiction of the HOA and were actually not at all owned by the residents. This meant that they should not have to foot the bill and pay the costs for these renovations. Let's just say that when one resident gained the support of other neighbors and called out these specifications to the head of the HOA, the HOA was not happy.
