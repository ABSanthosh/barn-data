  "description": "All big cats are amazing and meowgestic, but unfortunately, not every one of them gets the same start at life. Some are a little less lucky than others, but that doesn't mean that they cannot find their joy in life. And when things like that happen - when a big cat, for whatever reason, cannot be released back into the wild, it is up to us humans to make its life as good as it can be. For some big cats, it's just about making a friend - like this shy rescued cheetah cub who got paired up with a puppy or this rescued black panther who grew up with a Rottweiler. For others, it's about finding a new purpose - like this injured bobcat who became the best foster momma to other orphaned cubs. And for T'Challa, the bobcat we're going to be talking about today, who fell on its head as a kitten after a hawk grabbed it, finding joy in life just meant discovering that fennel is the best toy ever.",
