  "text": "‘I have never been more sympathetic to Billy Joel’ It’s really easy to dislike Bill Maher. The Real Time host’s anti-vaxxer beliefs and BFF status with Kid Rock is already enough to make your eyes roll, but Maher has found yet another way to be weird — and this time, he’s victimizing legendary musician Billy Joel with it.During Joel’s recent appearance on Club Random, the “Piano Man” singer got an unprompted earful about the political commentator’s attempt at songwriting: a track called “The World Makes Us Lie.” Though Joel was initially impressed with the concept of Maher’s song, saying, “Okay, that’s a good premise,” Joel seemingly soured on the idea after learning what, exactly, the world allegedly made Maher lie about. Don't Miss “It was about someone in a relationship with someone who the world deemed age inappropriate,” the 69-year-old explained, adding in a suspicious “I don’t know where I got the idea” for good measure. Maher attempted to frame the track as “more universal” than just age-gap relationships by rationalizing, “The world does make us lie about things,” but viewers were quick to pick up on Joel’s apparent discomfort. “The face Joel makes when he realizes this is about ‘age inappropriate’ relationships reminds me of Jeff Daniels in Speed right before the bomb went off,” joked one Twitter user, while another empathized with the “Uptown Girl” singer-songwriter. “Billy Joel had to cancel his tour because of illness, this feels like torturing a sick man,” they tweeted.  This obviously isn’t the first time Maher has discussed his penchant for younger women. Back in 2023, the star headed to Twitter to post a diatribe about Barbie, using his scathing take on the “preachy, man-hating” film to not-so-subtly flex going on a date with a woman decades younger than him. “I saw Barbie with a woman in her 30s who said, ‘I don’t know a single woman of any age who would act like that today,’” he recalled of his experience watching the film. Last fall, he got candid about his taste in younger women yet again while appearing on The Skinny Confidential Him \u0026 Her Show, telling podcast co-hosts Lauryn Evarts Bosstick and Michael Bosstick that he still likes ‘em relatively young. “I’ll say this just generally — my dating is not age-appropriate,” explained Maher, who was recently romantically linked to 31-year-old film producer/Al Pacino’s ex-girlfriend, Noor Alfallah, before preemptively telling off his critics.  “The people who are pissed off at that, f--- you,” he continued. “You do you, I do me. You do what works for you.”That’s whatever, I guess. Let’s just hope he never sets that sentiment to song.
