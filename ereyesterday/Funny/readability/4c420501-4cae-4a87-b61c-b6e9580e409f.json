  "description": "Every family has its feuds. And when you throw in-laws in the mix, tensions often rise even higher. Famously, people either love their in-laws or avoid them like the plague. Some people seamlessly fit in with their partner's family and have few issues, while others experience personality clashes and conflict, especially when boundaries are crossed. For the family in this story, we have an instance where a woman craves a close relationship with her mother-in-law but does so in an uncomfortable, somewhat invasive way. When the mother-in-law has had enough and lays down the law, she's met with backlash from the family. She realizes that this conflict is also straining her relationship with her son. The story sparked quite a debate in the Reddit comments about family boundaries and who was in the wrong. It's normal to want a good relationship with your in-laws, but sometimes people just don't mix well together.",
