  "text": "After we did the last one, we couldn't stop. Anything as serious as Silent Hill is has seeds of silliness in it! That's just how it works. I really liked the second Silent Hill game. I'm not part of the \"fandom\" or anything, I'm not on the Boards, I just like the series. I think the second one is probably the best and I'd be surprised if that wasn't the consensus view; I was a young husband at the time I played it, and there are a lot of pretty sophisticated ideas in there that I hadn't considered, did not want to consider, and would love to avoid utterly but since they're a fundamental part of the human condition I don't get to choose. It's a nice counterpart to Resident Evil, or it used to be, but those are starting to get scarier and scarier so who knows. I don't really go in for remasters, a position I have had more and more opportunities to remark on lately, so I don't need a new version of Silent Hill 2 even though apparently it kicks ass. What I do want is this Silent Hill: Townfall shit from No Code. They did two games I really like - Stories Untold I liked more than Observation, but they're both games that made me think \"I need to keep a close eye on this studio.\" Stories Untold fucks around with some very Analog Horror type concepts, and in the tiny sliver of Townfall that's been shown it looks like they're back to their old tricks.
