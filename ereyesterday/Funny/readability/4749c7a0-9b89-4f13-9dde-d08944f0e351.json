  "description": "Goof off in the workplace too much and you might find yourself having a serious chat with HR and your boss. It's all fun and games until you get caught, and the people who shared their firing stories below can tell you some stories.  Some jobs take employee surveillance really seriously, and they'll use cameras and nosy managers to make sure the employees are working constantly. Even so, a lot of employees manage to sneak away from their desks for long breaks, take long stretches of time off work using flimsy excuses, and some will even manage to take naps in their cars. At other workplaces, employees aren't supervised as closely, so they can get away with even more mischief. There's also the type of worker who can't help but brag in front of their coworkers, leading to trouble. The dude who decided to lift up his own car with his forklift could tell you all about that. Keep scrolling to read some of the most hilarious responses to u/GravyxNips' question: \"What's the craziest reason you had to fire someone?\"Next, read about this petty gift-giver who canceled a family member's vacation after giving them the ticket!",
