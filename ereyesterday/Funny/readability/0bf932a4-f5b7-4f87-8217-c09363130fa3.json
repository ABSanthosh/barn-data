  "description": "As a non-confrontational person, it's hard to resolve problems with other people. Accustomed to rolling over and accepting your fate, many non-confrontational people are tempted by the concept of tattling, or ratting on a person who's causing them grief—especially if that person is breaking a whole myriad of HOA rules. While the urge to become an HOA-tattling Karen is strong, we must fight it! This woman in our next tale successfully de-escalated a particularly perturbing neighborhood nightmare just by being frank with the people next door. It all started when the 50-something-year-old couple next door decided to build a ramshackle, DIY chicken coop on their shared property line, damaging the fence and wafting the scent of uncleaned chicken droppings into her yard. At first, she turned a blind eye, accepting cartons of eggs as penance for losing the use of half of her yard—due to the stink, of course.But when the pests started creeping into her property and into her home, she drew the line in the sand, taking a stand for non-confrontational people everywhere.",
