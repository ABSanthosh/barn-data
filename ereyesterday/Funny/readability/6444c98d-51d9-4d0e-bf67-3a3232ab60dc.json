  "description": "Happy New Year nerds! After taking a break for December I will be getting back to doing monthly commissions. I plan on opening up four slots on my Atristree page for January this coming Friday morning. Between PAX Unplugged and the holidays I just didn’t feel like I had time for commissions in December.  I really enjoy doing them though and I’m excited to get back to it this month. If you grab one of the four slots on Friday I’ll work with you to draw whatever character you like be it from comics,games, movies or something from D\u0026D or any other RPG. I’ve drawn family pets, original characters, Marvel heroes and even redrew a classic Penny Arcade strip at someone's request. You’ll get the final piece around the end of the month including high res files suitable for printing. So if you’d like to get a custom piece from me, keep an eye on the site Friday morning or just watch my Atristree page for the slots to open up on the 3rd. Thanks! -Gabe Out",
