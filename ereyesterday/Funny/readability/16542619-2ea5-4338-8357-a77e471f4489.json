  "description": "This job market is tough—there's no arguing that. We hope that the people we know (who are employed) will find it in their hearts to refer us to people they know who might be hiring, or just help us network for when the next role might be available. Applications upon applications, and you hear nothing; the real way to get your foot in the door after having been unemployed for a while is through friends. Keep in mind, however, that only friends who know your work ethic and can actually vouch for you should be sought out… If you think that you're better than certain jobs and find them beneath you, then reconsider the reason you don't have a job in the first place…The entitled friend in this next story managed to mess up the only shot they had at landing a job, which their friend so graciously helped them get an interview for.
