  "description": "Not everyone deserves to get fired, but some people make it impossible for their bosses to keep them around. Firing an employee is often the worst-case scenario for an employer. They'd rather have that person quit if possible, so sometimes employees receive numerous warnings or get put on a performance improvement plan.

But for some employees, getting fired is the only way to make them realize just how badly they're really doing at their job. Up next, read about this 16-year-old who quit his job after his parents spent years giving away his money to his younger siblings: \"My parents are bad with money and they spoil my younger siblings.\"",
