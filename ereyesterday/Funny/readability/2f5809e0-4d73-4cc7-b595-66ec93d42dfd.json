  "description": "You should never be forced into buying someone a present--- it's an act that's supposed to come from the heart. That's why they say it's the thought that counts. Even if you're gifted a sweater you'd never wear, or a clunky coffee mug you can't stand the sight of, the gift-giver thought of you and bought something they thought you'd enjoy. It's less about the value of the gift, and more about the bond that brings you and that person together, whether that's through a long-standing friendship, family ties, or a workplace BFF. This guy is frustrated after giving his little stepbrother a gift that was, admittedly, much cheaper than he gave to his actual brother. They just aren't as close, so this guy figured it'd be fine to give a $25 gift card to the dude he barely sees or interacts with. His stepmom and stepbrother should've just thanked him for the gift (even if they talked about him behind his back after the fact). But instead, a simple gift turned into a whole family debate that isn't going to bring any of them closer together any time soon. Check out the full story below, and see if you think this guy's gifting needs work, or if his dad and stepmom are being unreasonable. Next, read about this mom who banned her 16-year-old daughter from going on spring break… with good reason!",
