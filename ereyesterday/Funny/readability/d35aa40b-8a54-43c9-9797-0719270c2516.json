  "description": "It's hard enough being a stray cat, let alone one during inclement weather. And then having a litter of kittens to feed, protect, and keep warm… it just sounds purrfectly impawssible to us. We can barely handle our indoor cats when it rains (one of them is very scared of thunder), so we can't imagine trying to keep them safe if we lived outside. But thankfully, there are good-hearted hoomans out there who are willing to help such kitties in need. One of them is in the video below - a sweet man who helped a momma cat save her eight teeny tiny kittens from a flash flood.After stumbling upon this momma cat hiding in a sewer drain, he could sense her distress as the water levels kept rising. She knew she had no other choice but to trust him, so she started bringing him her kittens. One after the other, until he finally had 8 kittens wrapped up safely to take home. He took momma as well, and now all the kitties are safe, dry, and purrfectly satisfied. Watch the heartwarming video below!",
