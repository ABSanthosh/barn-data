  "description": "When you're existing in a shared space with others, common courtesy is to keep the environment clean. That's like, a universal understanding. Or at least it should be. Make sure to wipe down the spills you cause, sweep up the crumbs from your Taco Tuesday, and ensure that everyone else is doing the same thing. Easier said than done, though. Especially when other people expect you to clean up after them instead of doing it themselves. That's when petty revenge comes in handy!The employee who posted this story had enough of their entitled, messy coworker and the ways in which they wouldn't clean up after themselves in their shared office kitchen. After several attempts to tame the messy bull, the employee decides to take matters into their own hands. Instead of continuously nagging their colleague, they unplug the microwave and put a makeshift \"out of service\" sign on the appliance. Now, this employee will never use the microwave again. It is unclear if others in the office were onto the employee's petty shenanigans, but at least the microwave was kept clean for all to use except for their entitled coworker with a cleaning aversion.",
