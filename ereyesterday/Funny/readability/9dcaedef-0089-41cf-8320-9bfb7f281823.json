  "description": "If you had a $90 cake sitting in your fridge at home, I imagine you'd eat every last bite of it. You can get a fantastic cake for a fraction of the price. This woman just decided to shell out 70€, or roughly $90, for an expensive cake. Along with having the money to buy such a pricey dessert, this woman also has a really inexpensive babysitter. Babysitting is one of those jobs that parents want to pay well for: their kid is the most valuable thing in the world for them, and they're buying the peace of mind. They feel comfortable going out to a workout class or a date night because they trust their babysitter. It can be even more beneficial if the babysitter is a family member who the kids have always known, which is the case with this 17-year-old niece. For a while, the arrangement was a win-win: the niece got some spending money to buy coffee, and the aunt got a cheap sitter. Now that this expensive cake is causing a rift in the family, this person is being urged not to let their teen babysit for the family any more… or at least she'll have to raise her rates to pay off that slice or two of cake. As people also mentioned, a two-week-old cake is basically garbage, and the teen should be thankful if she doesn't contract any kind of food poisoning from it! Up next, this 22-year-old was thrown a surprise party that they adamantly did not want, and when they fled the shindig, they \"woke up to over 50 texts\" from surprised family members.",
