  "description": "Look, as cat people, the thing that we want more than anything in the world - more than even adopting a cat ourselves, is to be able to live like a cat. Like a grumpy cat specifically. Just imagine, there is a human feeding you all day long, and you can be as mean to them as you want to be, and they will still love you. You can knock their stuff over, you can scratch them and bite them, you can complain about your breakfast being five minutes late, and they will fall on their knees to receive even a smidge of love from you. That's what we want to be, and that's what these funny cat memes encompass. Hey, if we can't live like a cat, then we may as well make memes about cats, and make them as funny and relatable as pawssible. Silly cat memes like these are the only thing that gives us comfort during those moments that we realize - the hard way - that smacking someone in the face for doing something we don't like is not the right thing to do.",

The same way that it would work with… a whole lot of us probably.  Life… life is tough like that for cats sometimes. They are dependent on us, and we have spoiled them a million times over, so now, if we don't do things purrfectly the way that they want them done, they think that it's the end of the world. And whose fault is it if not ours for spoiling them in the first place?",
