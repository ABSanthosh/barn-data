  "description": "Most of us would be thrilled to relinquish the burden of hosting, but after 10 years of making family parties her entire personality, this older sister wouldn't let go. Competitive sisterly relationships are hard to avoid. Constantly at odds and growing up pitted against one another, it's tough not to get stuck in the endless loop of the comparison game. Oftentimes, sisters will find that one thing that becomes 'their thing' in an attempt to set themselves apart from their sibling, but this 45-year-old woman, and the eldest of 2 daughters, would realize that she'd taken things too far for over a decade. Family holidays always get a little bit dicey for one reason or another. As adults, we've all gone our separate ways and lived our own lives according to our prerogative, but when we're back with family, it feels like we're 8 years old again. Perhaps that's why the grown woman in this next tale started acting like a childish baby when her sister suggested the unthinkable: Sharing holiday hosting responsibility.",
