  "description": "I absolutely love the Arcane series on Netflix. It’s one of the most beautiful animated productions I’ve ever seen but they don’t just nail the art. It also has incredible music, great writing and killer voice performances. It’s the complete package and it’s so good at making me love the League of Legends universe that I get the twinge to reinstall after each episode. So far I have managed to avoid getting back into LOL. I’ve been down that road enough times that I know how it ends. Spoiler warning, it ends with me uninstalling the game in a fit of rage.",

It also has incredible music, great writing and killer voice performances. It’s the complete package and it’s so good at making me love the League of Legends universe that I get the twinge to reinstall after each episode. So far I have managed to avoid getting back into LOL. I’ve been down that road enough times that I know how it ends. Spoiler warning, it ends with me uninstalling the game in a fit of rage.  I think LOL is a great game and there have been times over the years when I have taken it very seriously. It’s a difficult game to get good at and the community can be brutal to new players or anyone who happens to mess up. It’s not that dissimilar from Rainbow Six Siege in that regard which is the game I’m currently putting most of my time into. I’ve received my share of abuse in R6 but the overwhelming vast majority of it seems to come from little kids. It’s hard for me to take slurs and angry cursing seriously when it sounds like it’s coming from a nine year old. My own children tell me that a couple of prominent R6 streamers have introduced the game to a younger generation and I think they're right because 99% of the time when I hear a voice in game it’s a little kid. They also all seem to mimic the streamers they watch as they all tend to repeat the same bizarre barks. I’ve been told I have “BAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRAIM” (Bad aim?) so much that I feel like I should be able to sue whatever streamer started it.  For my part I have not picked up any of this slang except for one line that I actually really like. Instead of saying that an enemy player is hacking, I have heard people say “that kid has walls” and Jerry and I both love it. I don’t think everyone who kills me can see through walls but Goddamn it’s fun to say! Honestly though, I do think some of these kids have walls.  Don’t forget about the Child’s Play Auction/dinner coming up on November 22nd! I’ll be there with my youngest son Noah as well as my folks. It’s just an amazing night and I’m excited to share it with some of my fam. I hope you’ll join us in downtown Seattle to celebrate the work Child’s Play does and help us raise some money. It’s the one time a year I get dressed up and I’ll actually be taking my suit to the dry cleaner today. It’s always fun to see us nerds looking sharp. You can get more details right here! -Gabe Out",
