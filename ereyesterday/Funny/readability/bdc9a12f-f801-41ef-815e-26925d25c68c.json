  "description": "You know how everything feels kind of crazy right now? Every day something new, every hour another piece of news to keep up with. We miss the old days. We miss that time when we could just log off for a couple of hours, laugh at funny cat memes, and know that the world would not blow up in the background. We miss when things felt simpler, when taking a break actually felt resting. We miss it, and although we know that we cannot change the world around us, we can still enjoy some silly cat memes first thing in the morning. So, that is what we have for you here - a bunch of classic, nostalgic, hissterical cat memes for you to start the morning with. Social media will wait, the news will wait. What matters right meow is your mental health and wellbeing, and you are about to do something about it to improve it. Have a purrfect day, y'all, and remember - even when things feel a little too crazy, cat memes will always be there for you.",

They know - they must - with a cat like Asher, that they are living in his home rather than the other way around. We wonder if they were even worried at all.  We think that this is a matter of principle for cats to choose the spot that is the least comfortable possible for their naps. Maybe they just do it to confuse us. Because we certainly are confused. There is nothing comfortable about this towel. There are so many better options. And yet.",
