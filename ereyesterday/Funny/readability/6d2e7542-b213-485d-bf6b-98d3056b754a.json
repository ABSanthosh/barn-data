  "description": "The audacity! When a couple separates, it is normal for friends to pick sides. Even though it can feel hurtful at times, it is not always personal. Some loyalties are just bigger than others. However, what is not 'normal' is having your ex-friends blatantly pretend your existence was merely a myth and then come running back years later, asking you for major favors, as if nothing ever happened…The worst part is, they never actually apologized for their behaviour. So, no Tom, time doesn't heal all. Especially when your exes 'bestie', who you haven't spoken to in 3 years, decides to hit you up on LinkedIn asking if you could write them a job referral for your company. The answer is simple: absolutely not. However, this is not just something you want to leave at 'ghost', would it be too far to talk to HR to ensure that they don't even reach the interview stage, or would that be taking it one step too far?",

She owes no one any favors, especially those who left their friendship in order to keep her ex-husband happy. So when one of those so-called ‘old friends’ comes begging at her feet for favors, she has to decide the most appropriate way to deal with it, and some would say she hit the nail on the head.",
