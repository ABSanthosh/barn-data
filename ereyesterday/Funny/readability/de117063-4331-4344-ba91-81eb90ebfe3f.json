  "description": "Good meowrning, fellow hoomans and cat pawrents. We can't imagine ever mixing up our cats. To us, they're all purrfectly unique. We could identify them if you blindfolded us, spun us around ten times, and then put us in a room filled with 100 other cats. We like to think we could, anyway. But in reality, if you put one of our cats next to one of their siblings, we might not be able to tell them apart if it were a real expurriment.In the thread below, you'll meet a feline pawrent and the cute cat they adopted. They went in knowing exactly which cat they wanted, and left with what they thought was their cat. Fast forward 1.5 meowgnificent years of love and care, and after looking through some old photos, they realized that their cat looked different than the pictures at the rescue shelter! What a cat-astrophe! Scroll down to read the full story below and figure out what caused this meowrvelous mixup.",
