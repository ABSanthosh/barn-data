  "text": "LOS ANGELES—Revealing new details about the highly anticipated film, actor and producer Jared Leto teased Wednesday that the villain in Tron: Ares would be a teenage girl who lies for attention. “If you thought Clu was scary in the last film, just wait until you meet Kaylee,” said Leto, who shared that the antagonist would stop at nothing to destroy his character’s career with her false allegations, no matter the repercussions they might have for multimillion-dollar projects. “I play Ares, an AI being in a race against time to save his reputation from a malevolent and vindictive teenager. Many of the characters in the film assume that Ares is the evil one, but it’s only because they’ve fallen for Kaylee’s twisted lies. Ares is innocent! Plus, pretty much everyone can agree she looked at least 17 at the time.” Leto added that even though the movie took place in a sci-fi world, he thought its story would be relatable to many powerful men his age.
