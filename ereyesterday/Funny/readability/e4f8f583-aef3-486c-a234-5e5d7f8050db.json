  "description": "All they wanted was a proper Halloween costume… but these people got the silliest versions of their costumes instead. Ordering your Halloween costume online is a g amble each time. There are a few factors: are you ordering this the week before Halloween? Because if so, good luck getting that costume on time, because everyone else had exactly the same idea! Secondly, when you do receive that costume in the first week of November, it might not be what you expected. Just because the product photo showed off an incredible costume, doesn't mean you won't get a hastily-sewn costume made from the cheapest fabric ever. Some costumes rip the first time you put them on, while others are just so goofy you couldn't wear them outside without people giggling at you. Below are a bunch of people who had some costume issues, and decided to share their experiences with the internet. Let's hope they were able to get replacement costumes before Halloween! At least a few of the people had a good sense of humor about it, and mentioned that they and their friends were laughing hard about the whole debacle. There are also a few fuzzy friends who got tricked by false promises from their costumes, like one dog whose ghost costume looks more like a paper towel costume. Up next, read about this grandfather who spent two decades fooling restaurant staffers in order to get about 10% more food.",
