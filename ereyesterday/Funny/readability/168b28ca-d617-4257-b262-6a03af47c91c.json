  "description": "You need to learn some lessons by experiencing it yourself, even if everyone around you is telling you it's a bad idea, sometimes that message isn't going to sink in without experiencing it through your own folly. Still, as parents, you need to make sensible decisions around when to protect your kids from their own wants and whims and when to let things proceed as-is and let them figure it out. Being overprotective is going to keep them from being able to properly figure out how to navigate difficult and unknown situations on their own, probably instilling in them that same anxiety that is driving their own controlling fears. Being too laissez-faire, on the other hand, might land them in some dangerous situations with irrevocable consequences.  This couple had a disagreement over whether or not to gift their daughter the snow globe that she wanted for Christmas. The girl's mother put an end to the idea, arguing that her daughter couldn't handle such a delicate and breakable item. Her husband, the girl's father, however, went ahead and got his daughter the gift anyway, arguing that his wife was being overprotective. Upon receiving the gift, the girl broke it almost immediately, but the husband argues that his wife startled the girl while she was holding her present, turning to this online community to try and settle the affair once and for all.",
