  "description": "There are certain accommodations that societies provide for their citizens with disabilities. Things like ramps, brail signage, and, of course, handicap parking spots. However, there are always those few individuals who try to take advantage of things that do not belong to them. Not so much the ramps or brail, but definitely the handicap parking spots. These spots are important for people with disabilities because it gives them enough space to do what they gotta do to get out of the car and gets them close to the establishment they're trying to reach. It's usually a large fine for parking in one of these spots when you do not carry the proper credentials for it.  However, sometimes people who really do need the spot and have the credentials still get scruff because they aren't the poster child for \"disabilities.\" Take, for instance, young people with a non-physical disabilities. Young people with disabilities are always getting flak because they don't \"look like\" they have anything \"wrong\" with them.",

Finally, when he was ready to return home, his partner came to pick him up and the staff told her to park in the handicap spot as they go to bring him out. She has the handicap credentials for her partner, so she puts them on the car. And yet, a 50-something-year-old Karen still pulled up and started yelling at her for parking there… Luckily, everyone was on the side of the young woman and quickly put and end to this tantrum.",
