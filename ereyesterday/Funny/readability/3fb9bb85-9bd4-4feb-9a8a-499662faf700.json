  "description": "Cats find themselves in dubious places all the time - every cat pawrent can attest to that. But some cats find themselves in very unusual places not by choice. Unfortunately, some cats are abandoned. That's not the best thing to think about, especially for all of us cat lovers. It's not easy to think about a cat, or a kitten even, being abandoned in a remote place, for any reason (because none makes sense). But even during such a situation, the Cat Distribution System™ works its mysterious meowgic.Such a tiny kitten, only a 5-day-old one, was caught in the benevolent plan of the Cat Distribution System. Despite wandering around, alone and afraid, in the middle of a construction site - he was found by a hearty hooman who works in that exact site. The man didn't want a cat, but was definitely going to help the little floof who wandered to his construction site find a furrever home. This hearty hooman called his daughter to pick up the little goober, and so she did.After taking care of the little kitten, it didn't take long for the construction worker father to cave and keep the kitten as a new addition to the family. The daughter who scooped this teeny tiny creature told the story to the online feline family, and added a series of splendid transformation progress pictures - from a smol abandoned floof, to a meowgnificent tuxedo cat who enjoys his comfortable furrever home. The online feline family also shared other heartwarming adoption stories of several cats, who were once abandoned - but now found their furrever homes.",
