  "description": "Kids will be kids, right? Growing up in the neighborhood, there was always that sense of adventure, whether it be running through backyards, playing hide-and-seek, or pretending to be superheroes. For a lot of us, those games were part of what made childhood so fun. We were constantly crafting made-up worlds in our imaginations, but one thing we weren't doing was actively digging up our neighbors' yards. At least not on purpose. Sure, there may have been the occasional tire track from taking a turn a little too hard on a bike, but we were never really out to destroy the grass or cause any lasting damage.It seems like this kid, however, has a different approach to \"imagination.\" In a suburban neighborhood, where everyone is just minding their own business, one 10-year-old has decided to take his pirate fantasy a bit too far. His treasure hunts are becoming a real headache for one neighbor, as wholesome as his pirate act may be. When he politely tried to confront his mom about the multiple holes on his property, he wasn't met with the response he was expecting.",
