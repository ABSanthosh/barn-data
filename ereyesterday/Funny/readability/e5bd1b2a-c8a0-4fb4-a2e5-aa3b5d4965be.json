  "description": "It's often we get to say this, but fur once, justice was served! Sorry feline fam, we just had to get that out of the way before we could say anything else. We see so many stories (so many) of cats being left behind by owners. Luckily, most of them have a happy ending thanks to the compassion of the cat community, but we wish that there would be some sort purrfect punishment for the people who did the deed in the first place. Well, it took us years of searching, but we finally found a wholesome rescue story where the culprits were caught, the cat was given a good home, and all was right in the world.This heroic woman witnessed a cat being abandoned (who ended up being pregnant), and was quick on her feet to get pictures of not only the cat, but also of the license plate of the people who dumped her. She called the police, and they actually found the people! She has the court records to pawsitively prove it. Scroll down to read this incredibly satisfying adoption story. Just say it with us one more time: justice was served.",
