Something in the nature of doing it yourself has this haphazard feeling to it, as though each and every one of us is that unhinged that simple physics and logistics are completely lost on us and no matter what we do we will end up making the problem worse before it has a chance of getting better (also known as calling a professional repair person to fix the original damage and what we added to it).And if this list is anything to go by, then yes, we humans are truly terrible at building stuff without experience. Some of the ideas and executions that people had in this list truly boggle the mind and will likely cause heart attacks amongst anyone in the construction industry. So take this as your fair warning, because some of these fails are so bad, you have to wonder how they stayed upright for more than two seconds.",
