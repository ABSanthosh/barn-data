  "description": "Custodians get no love from their coworkers. However, in the world of hospitality, what goes around comes around. So after this janitor went to the resort bar after a particularly long shift and found that the bartender wasn't exactly hospitable to his efforts around the workplace, he decided to remind her—on a daily basis—how much her job was really worth. And apparently that's only about 10 cents…",

However, if you've ever worked in the hospitality industry, particularly on a resort, you know that you've got a long way to go even to get back to your car in the parking lot. So when you've gotta get a little treat ASAP, and you're clocking out of your shift, odds are, you'll be cruising one of the local resort watering holes. This janitor was swamped after a hard day and ordered a $9 pre-mixed drink from the bar. Knowing their prices were overinflated, he hardly thought he should tip—especially considering the bartender just poured his drink into a glass of ice. But after she noticed he “failed to tip,” she called him out, passive-aggressively pointing out that the tips go around to the rest of the workforce. Well, little lady, they're not being tipped out in the custodian department, are they? Perhaps she should have thought twice before making an enemy in janitorials…",
