  "description": "Hey there, friends and fellow feline enthusiasts. We, the editorial team of ICanHasCheezburger, have come here today to join paws and declare our overwhelming infatuation with all things feline. We lowly humans are hardly worthy of all the wholesome goodness and entertainment they bring into our lives, but we can always try to express our appreciation through pats and lots of treats. Cats remind us of the simplicity of humor. Our four-legged feline friends are experts in comedy, and their goofy antics know no bounds.  Let's face it, life is better with a cat by your side, reminding you to embrace the silly, find joy in the small things, and always keep your sense of humor intact. Cheers to cats! We're not much for alcoholic beverages, but we'll be toasting with our fanciest espressos in tow. Now, take a breath of fresh feline air with these 20 comedic cat memes.",
