  "description": "Anyone willing to steal from children deserves whatever bad karma is coming their way, and this thieving grocery store manager is no different. Nobody loves every single one of their coworkers, and usually, most of us have at least one insufferable colleague that we're forced to deal with on a daily basis. Regularly fueling our disdain for them, gross coworkers reveal their truest selves while they're on the clock, only bolstering their unlikability with each shift. And when you're an overworked assistant manager who already hates your boss's guts, perhaps you'd also lunge at the opportunity to be rid of them forever—especially if they deserve it.",

  "text": "This grocery store assistant manager was exhausted. After months of working 50+ hours a week with no overtime, he'd reached his limit on workplace patience. However, when he discovered that his two store managers were dirty-rotten thieves, blatantly taking home mislabeled product and reaching into the corporate cookie jar, this guy decided to change up his focus at work. Suddenly, stocking shelves didn't matter as much as his vigilante work to get back at his disgusting managers. And we're all happy to see a bad guy get taken down by regional management, especially after they stole from the kids-with-cancer fund.",
