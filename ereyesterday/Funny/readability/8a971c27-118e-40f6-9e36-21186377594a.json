  "description": "Hello, all you furbulous felines on the internet today. We have some special cat memes for you today. They are purrfectly silly, hilariously hissterical and meowrvelously… moist? Yes. They are moist. Usually, cats don't like getting wet (they do, however, make the purrfect lifeguards), but this one cat in purrticular loves taking baths. They love the oily look on their smooth skin (no, we're not talking about hairless sphynx cats that look like raw chickens), living their lives in the shape of a football, and disappointing feline fanatics around the world. That's because these cat memes are actually purrfect pygmy hippos.For some reason, someone on the internet made a bunch of memes of this awwdorable pygmy hippo (who we presume to be the infamous Moo Deng) and claimed that they are the worst cat pawssible. We'll leave that up to you to decide, but because they are technically cat memes, we couldn't pass up the awwportunity to share them with you. Without further ado, we hope you have a purrfectly moist day…. or something like that. Enjoy! Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",
