  "description": "Cats are fickle creatures. One second, they love you, and the next second, they wouldn't touch you with a 30-foot feather toy. Some cats love everyone, some only love their owners, and apparently, some love everyone except their owners. No one knows why (unless one of you out there is fluent in cat and not telling us), but we do know that once a cat makes up their mind, it's pawsitively challenging to change it. Especially Maine Coons, who are not only meowgically majestic, but also known for being purrfectly opinionated.That's why we feeline for the pawrent in the post below. She claims that even after raising her Maine Coon for 13 years, the cat still doesn't like her. In fact, the cat always chooses another roommate or friend to bond with and purractically ignores her hooman mom. We've had aloof cats before, but never to this level before. Scroll down to read the full thread below and give your cats a big hug for us today (if they'll even let you).",
