Redirect immigration applicants to a travel blog called “50 Things To Do In Equatorial Guinea.” Trigger the trapdoor under Arizona. Check millions of migrants’ calendars to find a good time for everyone to get deported together. Disguise ICE agents as shrubs, trash cans, and traffic cones so they can sneak around more easily. Tell neighborhood watch groups to really just go nuts.  Decrease America’s dependence on fruits and vegetables. Get “calling ICE on my neighbor” trending on TikTok.  Use military force to round up anyone who can identify Mexico on a map. Probably something horrific involving tents in the desert.  Ask Biden how he did it.",
