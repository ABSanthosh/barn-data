  "description": "This grandparent is tired of spending time with their grandkids, but they may have a good reason for why that would be. As much as there's a prevailing stereotype of grandparents being thrilled to spend time with their grandkids, it's just not true for every family. In the beginning, when the kids are little, many grandparents dote on them and want to spend endless amounts of time with them. Some grandparents lavish the kiddos with gifts, while others love taking them to playgrounds or fun community events. Parents tend to love this, too. They can catch a break from the kids knowing that they're safe with their grandparents. This grandparent isn't feeling the love with their own family lately, as they shared to r/AmItheA******. It's one of those stories that no one on the internet can seem to agree upon. Some commenters think that the original poster is hiding something, since they briefly mention an accident that led to them being banned from driving the kids around. Others felt for this grandparent, and told them they weren't in the wrong for wanting to move away from family members who were acting just lukewarm about seeing them. Check the full story out below and decide for yourself! Up next, read about these newlyweds who were dismayed to receive just $3,000 from their wedding guests, because they spent a stunning $60,000 on their wedding, and were hoping to make that money back!",
