  "description": "When using something that doesn't belong to you, the correct thing to do is to always respect it, whatever it may be. However, do these rules still apply when it belongs to your sister?Many sisters like to claim the 'what's mine is yours' mindset, but only when it benefits themselves. And many times, sharing is a common act of sisterly love, but the minute that is taken for granted, that is when things may turn a bit sour.  Picture this: You got your first car about a year ago. You're a bit of a clean freak and take pride in keeping it in pristine condition. Then enters your younger sister, filthy cowboy boots and all. She goes out to feed the farm animals every day, never bothers to clean her boots, and expects you to drive her around while refusing to take them off. At this point, you'd think they're attached to her feet by the level of her selfish refusal. So what's a girl to do? Easy. Tell your sister either she's taking those mud-stained shoes off before entering your car, or she can learn how to take the bus, just as you used to…the choice is hers.",
