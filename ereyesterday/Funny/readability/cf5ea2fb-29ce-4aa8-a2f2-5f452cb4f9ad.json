  "description": "This worker has been dealing with a stage-5 clinger who's now escalating things even further. Workplace friendships can be hard to navigate at times. When you're spending 40+ hours each week with the same people, you tend to get to know them on a personal level as well as just talking about job stuff. You might get the insider scoop on one coworker's marriage drama, or maybe you'll learn about another person's ongoing feud with their neighbor next door. You probably know a ton of information about your work bestie's spouse, even if you've literally never met that spouse. You can easily get enmeshed in people's lives, and it makes the work week go by faster. However, a good percentage of people only come to the workplace to do their work and then head home. For whatever reason, they're focused on their job. With this type of coworker, no matter how badly you want to be friends, you'll get strongly rejected. And, as this person explained in their own story about a coworker being too friendly, sometimes HR needs to get involved to settle things in a way that works for both colleagues. Next, read about the reasons these CEOs ran their companies into the ground, like one boss who realized that \"Almost 3/4 of the employees had quit by this point because paychecks kept bouncing.\"",
