  "description": "When you work in the service industry, you meet hundreds if not thousands of people that just blow your mind with how helpless they are. People really come to you for the easiest, most quickly solvable situations simply because they don't feel like doing it. It's ridiculous. If you don't understand, you have never worked at a restaurant or bar and it's showing… Guests will come up to servers, whose job is to take your order and give you your order, or hostess, whose jobs is to seat everyone as timely and organized as possible, and STILL ask questions that have nothing to do with their job description. Of course, most people who work in the service industry will just answer the question and go roll their eyes in the walk-in afterwards. But wouldn't it be nice if we DIDN'T have to do that? Perhaps provide these types of customer with a little gentle parenting on how to figure out simple question on their own? Well, one hostess has perfected a technique that does just that!",

  "text": "It seemed to have started with customers calling to ask the most Googleable questions. Customers who most likely already Googled the restaurant to get its phone number to ask the “stupid” question. Basically, this hostess uses a technique of patience and requests: She hangs up on the “stupid” question, then when the customer calls back she is apologetic for the disconnection she was “unaware” of and then gently guides them to actually Googling the question themselves. Each time she is met with praise and thanks for her help, when really, she just trained them to figure it out on their own. Bravo, hostess! Sure, there are circumstances for when asking an easily Googleable question is okay to ask. For instance, say you are driving to the restaurant and are lost. Then, it is perfectly fine to call and say I am lost and can't pull over, can you give me directions or Google how to get there, etc. But for the most part, do it your dang self, service industry folks are NOT your butlers…",
