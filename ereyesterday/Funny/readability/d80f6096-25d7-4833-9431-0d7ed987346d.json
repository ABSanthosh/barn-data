  "description": "Carpooling is cool because it saves money and the environment. What's not to love? You get a buddy to chat with to and from your destination, can rest those precious legs of yours instead of taking public transit, and leave less of a carbon footprint. Many employees opt to carpool with their colleagues for many reasons, but one of the most common is that it's simply convenient, sometimes, way more convenient for one person than the other. You'd think that if you're the guest in someone else's car, you'd offer to split gas, perhaps do them a favor or two, and most definitely make their life a tad bit easier at work.The colleague in this next story fails to do any of the above. The employee took it upon themselves to have their mother, and then in the future, themselves, drive their colleague to work because the taxis in their neighborhood stop at a certain hour. This left their colleague transportation-less, so they did what any good coworker would do: give her rides home. This proves to be a major mistake after the employee realizes they've created an entitled monster. Scroll below to read the entire story.",
