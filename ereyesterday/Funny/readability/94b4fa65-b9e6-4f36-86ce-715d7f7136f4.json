At root is a claim that DeepSeek \"distilled\" their model, which is against the Terms of Service, a breed of document which I'm sure we all agree is frequently read and internalized. In any case: the fucking pluck, man. They skimmed the cream of humanity itself, said if I can see it it's mine actually, and even if you think we're doing something fucked up here it doesn't matter because we stole so much shit that it would be very hard to find your skull in this very large pile of bodies we invented. When they are in a position to describe the material distinction between what they've done to the globe and what this wily upstart model has done to them it will be very still in the courtroom. They should see if their new reasoning model can design a more efficient petard - there might be some savings to be had, especially once they start getting super hoisted by that mofo. Historically, it's been a rate - roughly - of one petard per hoist. I think we can get those numbers up. (CW)TB out.",
