The suit looked uncomfortable; imagine that Channing Tatum were a squeezable product. This is what the tube would look like. Morak already went over his rich feelings on the matter, but approaching three decades of anything - let alone an artistic endeavor - must be considered an aberration. I was thinking about these things already because PAX turned twenty, but on November 18th this bizarre horseshit will be twenty-six years old. We were at a restaurant called China Dragon with Kara when we wrote this strip, and she and Brenna have been very kind to endure us all these years. We have very cleverly avoided some forms of labor and invented several new ones, the contours of which might be worth cataloging someday, if I hadn't already been doing just that for twenty years and change.
