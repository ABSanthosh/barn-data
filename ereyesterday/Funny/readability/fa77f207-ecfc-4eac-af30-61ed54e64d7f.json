  "description": "Hello cat pawrents, do you work from home? Because if you do, we'd very much like to know how your cat feels about this. Is your cat happy you're home, trying to sit on your lap constantly despite your working schedule? Or is your cat feeling that you're bothering them too much, only by breathing near them for too much time? Or maybe your cat is ecstatic you're home, so excited they want to play with you all the time? There are many kinds of cats, and they'll all react differently to a cat pawrent who works from home.But we, hoomans, also react differently to that situation. But there is something we all react to with joy, laughter, and happiness - meowing cat memes. Cat memes are the delight of any cat pawrent. Whether you're working from home this Monday or not, we're sure you're going to enjoy these funny cat memes. We're also sure your cat will enjoy them as well, so show them to your cat if you're at home.",
