I sort of want the game to succeed because I have a feeling that, like the inspirations embroidered on its sleeve, this is only the lure that tricks you into deeper mystery and richer mechanics. I want to see the rest of the ideas and if they're gonna put this much heart into it, I want to see it and they deserve to make it. Okay, a couple big things. One, this! — Penny Arcade (@PA_Megacorp) April 28, 2025 Last year's PAX/Marvel Snap collab delivered a super fun, heroic pose for Cap and what is inarguably the best cardback in the game. Well, second best, because this year's Metro theme at the show was a perfect fit for Miles Morales and we're back with a great new Miles and a fucking out of control cardback. Attendees to the show can secure it with ease, but if you aren't heading out our way next week, we have a several hours long stream starting at 12:30pm PST where we're gonna give away a ton of codes if you want to see it in action. We'll be hanging out with Kent-Erik and Glenn from Second Dinner, and our pal KM Best is gonna roll through for the color commentary and dirtbag scam plays. See you then! Oh, and we also made a new episode of Acquisitions Incorporated: The \"C\" Team for some reason!!! (CW)TB out.",
