  "description": "Cats are so silly. Even when they're the supreme rulers of your house, even when they prance like they own the place, even when they have the most sleek and smooth fur that looks meowjestic - they are still silly little creatures. All you have to do to break this emperor / empress facade is either open a tuna can, click the laser pointer, or simply listen to the silly little sounds they produce. Cats are so silly and funny, but they don't even know it. Cats sure do like to think of themselves as the kings and queens of their house (which they are, but not as they think) - but in reality, they are as silly as they can get.To enjoy this silliness to its full potential, we recommend some seriously silly cat memes. But don't worry. You don't have to search far and wide, because we gathered some funny feline memes full of silly cat comedy. These memes are here to remind us of cats' silliness, and having that in our consciousness is much better than not having it.",
