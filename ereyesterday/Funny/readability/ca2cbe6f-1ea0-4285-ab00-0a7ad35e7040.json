  "description": "Childcare is so expensive that it causes many couples to carefully consider whether or not it's worth one spouse quitting their whole career and staying at home in order to take care of the kids and save on the expense. It's a big decision, and considering the cost to that spouse's career and long-term earning potential and the fact that the vast majority of families actually need both those incomes to make ends meet, it's a big sacrifice to make. Of course, if, thanks to family or for some other reason, you're able to get free childcare, then you can circumvent that whole issue. But since the service of watching your children is worth a whole salary, this isn't something to take lightly, even if it's your parents offering to watch their grandchildren.There's a reason why we see so many stories like this online where someone tries to weasel their way into getting someone to watch their kids for free, gaslighting a sibling, or some other tenuous acquaintance into watching their kids. When this homeowner moved into a new neighborhood, she thought a good way to meet people and gain a sense of community would be to join a local \"mommy\" social media group. The problem is her status as a SAHM attracted the attention of an eager neighbor who was eager to take the chance at free childcare.",
