  "description": "This story, we think, is a real Christmas miracle. A boy saved a kitten that was being harmed by a bunch of other kids by trading his skateboard for it. That's amazing. That is something that does not happen every day, and both he and the parents who raised him deserve all the praise in the world. But that's not the miracle. It's not the kitten getting rescued, not really. Of course, that's a miracle in and of itself, but the real miracle here is the kid and all the hope that he had given us for the world right in time for Christmas.It's not every day that we see someone being so kind to an animal - selflessly putting the animal first, rescuing the kitten and not caring about his toy being taken from him. In fact, we see the opposite much more often. So, on Christmas morning, it's only right to focus on the good things, and this… this might be one of the best, most uplifting things to happen all year long.",
