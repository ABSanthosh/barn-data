  "description": "There are some things about having a cat that simply cannot be explained to non-cat owners. When your cat comes to cuddle you - on their own, making their own decision, taking the long track from their spot in the living room to go be with you in the office. Or when you gently pet your cat after said cat has spent an hour in the sun, warming up, and they turn onto their back for you to pet them there. Or when the little cat goes chaos mode and runs straight across your face in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. And of course there's purring. If you have never had a cat sit on your lap and purr their little hearts out… if you have not felt those vibrations and heard that sound that cannot be replicated by anything else ever… you're missing out on one of the best feelings in life. So, when you guys told us all of these amazing stories of you getting hearing implants and hearing your cats purr and meow for the first time… believe us when we say that we shed a tear.",

And when we put it up on our page, wanting to share some of the feels with you guys, we truly did not expect so many of you to tell us their own similar stories. We're thankful. We really are. We needed this nice, pawsitive cry today.  And this one specifically, we have to say, rivals the original with how many emotions it made us feel, and it is 10 times shorter. The love seeping from this story is really amazing, and we are so happy that this person got to hear the incredible thing that is a cat purring, because there is nothing else quite like it.",
