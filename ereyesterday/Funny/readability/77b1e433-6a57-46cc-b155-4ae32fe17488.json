  "description": "Ted's company hired a contract team to build an application. The budget eventually ran out without a finished application, so the code the contract team had produced was handed off to Ted's team to finish. This is an example of the Ruby code Ted inherited: def self.is_uniqueness(mr_number) out = false mrn = PatientMrn.find_by_mr_number(mr_number) if mrn out = true return mrn end return nil end The function is called is_uniqueness which is definitely some language barrier naming (is_unique is a more English way of wording it). But if we trace through the logic, this is just a wrapper around PatientMrn.find_by_mr_number- it returns an \"mrn\". So, the first obvious problem: this isn't checking uniqueness in any way, shape or form. Then there's the whole check for a valid record- either we find a record or we return nil. But since find_by_mr_number is clearly returning something falsy, that doesn't seem necessary. And that is the default behavior for the Rails generated find_by methods- they just return nil if there are no records. So none of the checks are needed here. This whole method isn't needed here. Finally, there's out. I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish here, but it smells like they wanted a global variable that they could check after the call for error statuses. If that was their goal, they failed in a few ways- first, returning nil conveys the same information. Second, global variables in Ruby get a $ sigil in front of them. What the out variable truly represents is \"do I want out of this codebase?\" True. That is definitely true.
