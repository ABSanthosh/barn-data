  "description": "If the world isn't in a confusing enough state currently, we now have such entitled people that they are stealing from you and then complaining about what they stole… Yep, you read that right. Can you believe we've gotten to this point? Sometimes people act in such perplexing ways that it truly makes you wonder who the heck is raising these psychos?  In the case of this insane entitlement, it was a person taking advantage of a good host. A woman hosted a small little dinner party with her close friends. They were obviously allowed to bring a +1 and she still treated them just as well as her friends. She said the usual, \"Make yourself at home!\" Which, we all know, just means feel comfortable, maybe help yourself to food, that sort of thing. It does NOT mean you can take anything you fancy… That's theft.",
