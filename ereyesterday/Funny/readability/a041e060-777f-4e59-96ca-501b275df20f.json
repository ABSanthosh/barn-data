  "text": "I don't know if Ambien is sleep, exactly, but it's definitely not lying in bed looking at the ceiling, or pressure-sealed into a Sky Coffin, and that can be a nice change of pace. Gabe had tried it once to great success on the Australian Flight, but the second time he tried it he entered a Devil Dream that lasted almost sixteen hours - one from which he could not wake. As per usual, we tried to shape and mould these horrors into something silly, an attempt at inoculation in the form of a feathered sky serpent called J.D. that at least I found enjoyable. We made a joke about me taking it, mostly just so we could see J.D. again, but until a couple weeks ago I'd never tried it at all. I only had a couple, I mostly ran out, and I'm glad. That's the kind of shit a witch would give you in a fairy tale. I have a little left, like a few crumbs of lembas wrapped in mallorn leaves, and I'll be using it to board one of the motherfucking White Ships to the motherfucking West. I apologize in advance - it would appear Dreaded Continuity has reared its wicked and serpentine head once again. This PAX Aus is gonna be a really great show, content is stacked, and we've stocked the shop with baller stuff in their traditional colorway. This will also be a chance for you to get hands on our new D\u0026D Collab, a cute set from Kris Straub called Friend Folio! I'm so glad they let me keep the name; I always like to rep the old ways. Anyhow: 3-Days are sold out, Saturday's already sold out, and Friday might sell out too so you might wanna get your mitts on a pass. It's such a cool show and it was a cool show even when we held it in a barn. I'm especially excited this show to help introduce people to the Arkham Horror RPG on Friday Night! Acquisitions Incorporated down under has specialized in horror the last few years, and this new system - by the creators of the Star Wars RPG, Edge Studio - has some neat angles I think people will love. (CW)TB out.",
