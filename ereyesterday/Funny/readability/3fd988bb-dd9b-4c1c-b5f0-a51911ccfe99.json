  "description": "It remains a fact that if you actually cared for the person you were dating and held in your hand the chance to do something that would make them immeasurably happyâ€”and you'd be a certain kind of evil for not doing it at the chance to pursue an unethical profit, especially when the way you're choosing to make that profit is derided by the masses. Ticket scalping is just one of those things that offer no value, allowing the entitled and uncaring a way to turn a profit and personal gain off a terrible system.Back in 2023, this now 18-year-old saw a chance and took it. He could see how popular and hotly contested tickets for Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" were becoming and decided to take a stab and see if he could win the ticket lottery and secure some tickets of his own to sell for profit at a later date. Now, in 2024, he had been dating his girlfriend for 5 months when, back in July, she learned about the tickets. Having tried and failed to get tickets herself, she was desperate to get them from him, offering to pay face value to take the tickets off his hands.",

  "text": "You might be thinking that asking her to pay for both of them would even be a stretch and that it might be nicer for the young couple to go together, maybe asking her to pay for half of the costs, including the price of her own ticket. But, not only was he not interested in accepting face value for the tickets, but he had his sites set on selling them for double what he paid for them, applying frat-bro Econ 101 logic to an ethical issue and seeing nothing but dollar signs where he could have perhaps been considering his partner.It's been a while since I've seen an opinion on one of these posts that was so resoundingly one-sided, and we'll be surprised if he's in a relationship for much longer after this.",
