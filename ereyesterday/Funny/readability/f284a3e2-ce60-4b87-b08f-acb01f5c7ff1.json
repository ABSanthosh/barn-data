  "description": "Public transportation can be very hit-or-miss. On normal days, trains and buses arrive on time. You get on, ride to your destination, and barely register that you've been on board. But other days will make you regret ever setting foot on public transportation. From irritating people to delays to messy seats and floors, there are plenty of ways that a regular commute can become mildly infuriating. Recently, I was on the train in the early morning hour of 9:30 AM, heading to my job here, when I entered a nearly empty train car. A three-man band entered with me, bringing guitars and an accordion along with them. I thought, \"They wouldn't play to just like four people in a subway car, right?\" Wrong! Very wrong! Instead, the band began to play at top volume, echoing in the empty car. It was so loud and startling, and extremely unpleasant, since most of us on the train car looked half-asleep still! I know they're just busking, hoping for a few extra dollars, but I really don't think the two train riders who were jolted out of their sleep by the accordion appreciated their musical talents enough to tip them. That's just one thing that might befall you when you step foot onto public transportation, and the people below have their own mildly infuriating moments to share with us. After that, read about this poor 16-year-old who's already burnt out from working too hard, saying, \"I quit my job and I told my parents I won't work again until I'm out of their house.\"",

Do they just stand?  16Not very mindful of them 18Why do people brush their hair over the seats like this? 19Have you ever listened to someone play the viral \"Oh no\" audio clip over and over again? Because I have, and it melted my brain after about two minutes of it! You can watch a video on repeat without the sound on. You already know what's going to happen; the \"Oh no\" sound just isn't necessary anymore.  20 22 23Let's end this on a good note This person reports that they didn't have much to do, so they waited until the next train came along and gave the food back to it's rightful owner. As one commenter wrote, \"That's like a decades worth of good karma there.\" So true, a very thoughtful thing to do!  Stay up to date by following us on Facebook!
