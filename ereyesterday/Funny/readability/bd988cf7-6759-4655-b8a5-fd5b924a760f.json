  "description": "You know, silly as it may sound, we often hear about cats breaking up relationships. Over weird reasons sometimes. Like people unable to handle being \"second\" to the cat in relationships, or people telling their partners that it's either them or the cat, or - and this one is really weird - people calling their partners unhygienic because of their cats, because apparently, kissing your cat on the forehead is gross or something equally as silly. We've seen cats break up relationships. We have yet to see a cat actively participate in someone taking revenge over a breakup. Until today. Today, we saw it for the first time. A woman who got cheated on decided to get back at her now-ex by stealing his X-box… and letting her cat have her way with it. And although the cat did not actively choose to participate in this situation, she sure as heck looked very happy about the new scratcher that she got. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

  "text": "Really, when you think about it, this was the best outcome that could be. Because this way, at least one of them is happy. Not the now-ex boyfriend, not the cheated-on ex-girlfriend, but the cat. The cat came out on top in this situation, because she got a new scratcher to enjoy, and we think that we can all agree that this is a good outcome.  And we absolutely love how the internet agrees with us. Might as well have the cat enjoy the fallout of this relationship. Let the cat help you get revenge. We like this. More breakups should have the cats winning in the end.",
