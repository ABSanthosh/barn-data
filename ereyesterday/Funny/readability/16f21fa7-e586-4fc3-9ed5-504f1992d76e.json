  "description": "Sharing: one of those core lessons that is so important to learn at a young age, necessary to learn so that you'll one day grow up to be a well-adjusted person. An all-important lesson that everyone should learn, but some people just… don't. However, sharing is just as much about knowing when something isn't yours to have or take as it is about when you should be sharing your own things. You can't just simply demand that someone share something with you and have it be so. Kids, of course, get this wrong all the time. This is why adults are around to steer them in the right direction and teach them when they slip up. But, adults who never learned this lesson properly make for poor captains on a ship they've never been on before.",

Subjects are models. That's why, when this uncle noticed another little boy scurrying off with his 5-year-old nephew's new toy, he was surprised to find that the boy's father was allowing it to happen and facilitating the \"sharing\" of the toy against the birthday boy's, his nephew's, wishes. He set things straight, but offended the boy's parents in the process.
