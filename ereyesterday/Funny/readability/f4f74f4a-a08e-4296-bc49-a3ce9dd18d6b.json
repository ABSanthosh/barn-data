  "description": "Training your replacement can be a stressful process. If you're leaving the company on poor terms, the last thing you want to do is give your soon-to-be former boss more of your time and hard work. However, if you're leaving on good terms, you likely will go through with the training anyway so as not to burn any bridges. It's the so-called \"professional\" thing to do after all. But what happens when the person you're training turns out to be woefully incompetent? Do you tell your ex-boss that they are making a huge mistake in hiring this person, or do you keep your mouth shut, do your best to explain what you can, and let the new hire fail as they inevitably will?This was the conundrum that the author of this tale of workplace drama found himself in. Two months after he left his previous company, he was still answering calls and texts from his replacement with incessant questions, many of which he had explained before and some of which he thought was general knowledge (such as attaching documents to emails in Outlook). Clearly, this guy's ex-boss did not do his due diligence when he hired this lady. Now, there was nothing the author could do to salvage the situation!",
