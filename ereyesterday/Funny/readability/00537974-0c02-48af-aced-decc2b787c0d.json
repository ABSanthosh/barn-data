  "description": "All of us have big dreams to make it big in the world and come out of the other end with a heaping pile of cash. That's the American dream, baby! We're told all of our hard work will amount to something grand, and a lot of times, it does. If you're thinking about opening up your own business, make sure you know what you're doing. Success touches those who don't give up (so I'm told), you just have to make sure that you keep a small circle of people around you who support you in your endeavors. If you truly know what you're doing, at least one person will have your back.The guy who posted this story had exactly one person who believed in him and his marketing business—his wife. They had a lengthy discussion about the fact that their income might take a bit of a hit while he's kickstarting the endeavor and she wholeheartedly agreed to the financial compromise. His wife's family, though, is a different story. They would constantly berate him and ridicule his ideas, all the while very forwardly calling him a d*adbeat. So, when his business took off, he made sure they wouldn't see a single cent of his profits. They weren't happy about that, to say the least. Scroll below to get the juice.",
