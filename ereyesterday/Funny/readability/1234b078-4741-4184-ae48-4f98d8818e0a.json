  "description": "There is a downside to revealing too much about your personal life to your coworkers. Obviously, keeping everything about your life outside of work private is unrealistic. After all, these are the people with whom you spend a considerable amount of time every week. The truth is going to come out regarding basic life details like what neighborhood you live in, where you're originally from, and notably, your dating status.I always worry when I hear about how much some of my friends reveal to their coworkers about their relationships, from details about breakups to every little argument. While it's weird to be too secretive, it's definitely more unhealthy to be too open. Plus, telling your coworkers everything can backfire fairly quickly.Â For this server, he made the mistake of revealing his newfound single status to his older coworker. Now, she started assuming that whenever she needed a shift covered, he would be free because it's not like he has anyone to come home to at the end of the day. This, of course, says a lot more about the coworker's warped worldview than anything else. Why should being single matter, and why should his free time be less valuable as a single person? Thankfully, the author behind this tale was not willing to let his coworker walk all over him.",

  "text": "Clearly, the older coworker somehow thinks that their relationship status has given them extra points on the food chain of life, proving once again that people love to assert a false sense of authority over others. Even though the author is 26, he knew that this lady's mentality was outdated and harmful. We're of the opinion that this guy has two options if he wants to stay at his current place of work. He can either confront his coworker and give her a piece of his mind, or he can avoid conflict and just tell her he's seeing someone. Who knows? Maybe she'll leave him alone now!",
