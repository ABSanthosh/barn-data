  "description": "Imagine leaving a company on great terms and being encouraged to come back should the situation arise… until it does and they reject you.If this has happened to you, surely you had a similar reaction to this author. The initial impression might be that there must have been some kind of mistake. After all, your former manager always told you that there would be a position waiting for you at the company upon your return. Maybe the hiring manager just wasn't informed, and there was an innocent mixup, right? That explanation would still be slightly embarrassing, but everyone makes mistakes. Well, for this author, it turns out that the promise of always being able to return to their former company was a bit of an over-exaggeration. Keep scrolling below to find out what happened when the author confronted their former employer, and the clueless comment their employer made next!",
