  "description": "You know, as cat people, we use cat memes to express all kinds of emotions in all kinds of situations. In any appropriate (and sometimes inappropriate) situation, we send funny cat memes to our friends. The best reaction meme is a cat meme, we think that just about every cat person would agree with us on that. What we cannot say is that we have used a cat meme to break bad news. Somehow, it feels particularly inappropriate to use a cat meme in a sad situation. Cat memes should remain the happy and pawsitive thing that they are. Or so we thought. We thought that cat memes in sad situations would feel inappropriate and disrespectful and wrong, but alas, we were mistaken. It seems that cat memes make sad situations funny. Still sad, but also funny. At least that is the feeling that we (and a lot of other people on the internet) got from this ridiculous viral thread on twitter. Are we biased when it comes to cat memes? Maybe. What do you think?",
