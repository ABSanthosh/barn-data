  "description": "When we say we want to raise an outdoor cat, this is what we mean. A fearless cat that enjoys walking, loves exploring their surroundings, and going on adventures. A cat that is friendly and sweet, and does not take no for an answer. That is precisely the type of outdoor cat that loves adventures and the great outdoors that we would love to have one day.A cat like Askhim is the ultimate dream—a fearless explorer with a heart full of adventure. He doesn't just tolerate the outdoors; he thrives in it, embracing the salty sea breeze and the ever-changing landscapes of the ocean. While most cats are content to curl up in sunbeams indoors, Askhim prefers the open sea, basking in the sun on the deck of his human's boat as they journey from one breathtaking destination to the next.With his boat captain human by his side, Askhim experiences the world in a way few felines ever do. He's not just a passenger—he's a co-captain, a watchful companion who keeps an eye on the horizon and enjoys the gentle sway of the waves. Whether he's lounging under the sky, inspecting the ropes and sails with intense curiosity, or watching fish dance beneath the surface, every day is a new adventure.",

Together, they’ve formed an unbreakable friendship, proving that the best adventures are the ones taken with a loyal companion. Askhim truly lives the dream—whiskers in the wind, paws on deck, and a heart full of wonder. Is Askhim a Bengal cat? 'Yes, I originally wanted a rescue, but my cousin, who’s a diver, wanted an exotic cat because he was making good money. We settled on a bengal, he paid 2/3 of the price. The kitten chose me. He got upset, left, and then the kitten became mine.\"",
