  "description": "If you happened to see the Snow White remake this past weekend, you probably had a better time than this entitled mother did. Here's the deal: the movie is not exactly being embraced by critics or audiences, but some folks are at least enjoying the film as an unintentional piece of camp. This lady, however, did not exactly have a humorous bone in her body and was therefore unable to crack a smile, especially because she had been forced to go to the movie theater by her own kids.This is what happens when your unkind behavior is projected onto others because, believe it or not, the reason this woman found herself stuck in a movie theater watching a highly miscast Gal Gadot belt her heart out was due to an act of petty revenge.",
