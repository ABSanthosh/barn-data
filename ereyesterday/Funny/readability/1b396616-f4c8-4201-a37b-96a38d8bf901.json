  "description": "Ugh, landlords… They often uphold a maddening double standard with their tenants. If you, the tenant, have a leaking roof or a broken heater, the landlord will probably take their sweet time fixing it. It could take days, weeks, or even months in some cases, just to get your apartment up to it's usual standards. But if your landlord needs something from you, like your monthly rent payment, they'd better have it on time or they'll throw a fit! This person's landlady is not respecting their time at all. While this person is trying to go about their day, the landlady keeps knocking on the door to show off the apartment to potential renters. Naturally, it's quite disruptive to have someone coming over to your apartment constantly. And the apartment also needs to be squeaky clean each time someone comes to view it, which adds additional pressure onto the tenant. Keep scrolling down below to read this person's full story of how they set some boundaries with their landlady. She wanted to learn the hard way, well, so be it! At least the tenant is almost done with their lease, and onto a better living situation. Up next, read about the managers who got to tell off their most entitled customers.",
