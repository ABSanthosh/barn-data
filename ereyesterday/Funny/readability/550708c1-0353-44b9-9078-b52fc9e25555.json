  "description": "For whatever reason, Gabe simply has never been subject to TikTok. Whatever it's doing, however it's trying to do it, it simply doesn't plug into his dealio. I never got into Reddit really, whatever its charms, and that's the bifurcation. They could ban TikTok, or not ban it, or only make it available between the hours of Midnight and One O'Clock, and he literally wouldn't know. I have sent him three to four hundred TikToks over the last six years or so and he just says he doesn't have it and will never have it. I suspect it's like when your cat gives you an inside-out mouse, and you're supposed to appreciate it, but you want nothing to do with it in any way, shape, or form. For a variety of reasons. You won't suddenly be inspired to investigate mouse recipes. You know?",
