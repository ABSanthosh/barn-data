  "text": "Ask your doctor about prescription-strength Lizzo today If you’re struggling to take a joke in stride, try Lizzo!In the most recent South Park special, South Park: The End of Obesity, Trey Parker and Matt Stone dissected the obesity epidemic by satirizing the rapid rise of semaglutide injections, the most popular of which is the oft-discussed diabetes medication Ozempic. Parker and Stone’s biggest targets were the ineffectual and imbalanced American healthcare system and the processed food megacompanies pushing sugar in their mass-produced products, but they had jokes to spare for upper-class moms with inappropriately exposed midriffs, the entire country of Pakistan and America’s favorite body-positive pop singer Melissa Viviane Jefferson, better known by her brand name Lizzo. Don't Miss In South Park: The End of Obesity, Parker and Stone draw attention to the fact that insurance companies refuse to cover semaglutide injections as a weight-loss method for patients struggling with obesity, meaning that only the wealthy can shed extra pounds using Ozempic while the rest of the country has to wait until their weight problem develops into a diabetes diagnosis to access the “miracle” drug. For all the plus-sized poors, the only prescription is… In the South Park special, Lizzo’s music is advertised using the same peppy, jingly commercials that typifies the average marketing campaign for weight-loss medication. Instead of making patients slimmer, once-daily Lizzo helps them learn to accept and embrace their bigger bodies, but it doesn’t come without its side effects — just as Ozempic gives the many movie stars and A-list musicians who can afford it unseemly and underdiscussed bouts of explosive diarrhea, Lizzo makes you shit from your ears. Back when South Park: The End of Obesity hit streaming back in May, Lizzo posted a video of herself watching the parody for the first time, staring mouth-agape at the hilarious fake commercial and losing her mind when she noticed the South Park animators’ exceptional attention to detail as they used the real album cover from her most recent record in the bit. “I just feel like, damn, I’m really that bitch! I really showed the world how to love yourself and not give a fuck to the point where these men in Colorado know who the fuck I am and put it in their cartoon that’s been around for 25 years!” Lizzo exclaimed after finishing the clip.By flaunting the bit at her various celebrity Halloween parties this past weekend, Lizzo cemented herself as a high-ranking member of the exclusive “South Park Targets Who Are Cool Enough to Embrace Their Parodies Club” alongside Cesar Milan, Snooki and Brian Boitano — J Lo need not apply.
