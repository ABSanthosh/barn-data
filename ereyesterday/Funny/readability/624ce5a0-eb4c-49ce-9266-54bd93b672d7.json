  "description": "It's Meownday, feline fam, and we're already confused. Our questionable query is this: why does helping someone cost so much money? Shouldn't there be some sort of charity discount? We think that should be a thing. Anyway, we digress. It's just a shame that so many people go out of their way, spend thousands of their own dollars on saving animals in need, and get nothing back except for the good, fuzzy feelings in their hearts. Don't get us wrong, that's great, but maybe it should cost less to save a life in need.When the young mom in this post rescued two stray kittens, she posted about needing help to get them fixed. She specifically stated that she couldn't afford it, so when a local rescue came forward and offered to help, she assumed it would be for free. Well, fast forward a bit, and she gets a bill for her \"free\" help. Hence, why we think the charity discount should be a thing. Anyway, scroll down to read the full story below!",
