  "description": "Neighbors often ask one another for favors. There does not necessarily have to be any reciprocation, but there is a general understanding that residents who can help one another out should. However, when one of those neighbors assumes that you will go out of your way to help them as if you work for them, that's a different story. In these instances, doing something out of the goodness of your heart feels far too generous. After all, generosity is a two-way street. Sure, not every act of neighborly kindness needs to be reciprocated, but if you feel like your neighbor would never return the favor if the roles were reversed, you're probably right. Most folks who find themselves in these situations, as this author did, are easily taken advantage of because of their good deeds, but that cycle needs to be broken eventually. Keep scrolling below to see what happened when this entitled neighbor demanded that the author make them a complicated contraption for free!",
