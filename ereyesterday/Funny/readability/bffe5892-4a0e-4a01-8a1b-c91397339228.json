  "description": "This bride caused a butterfly effect in her parent's lives after they missed their only daughter's wedding day. Sibling favoritism is usually a little more subtle than it is in this woman's family. In some families, it means that the parent will spend hours on the phone with one kid, while forgetting to even text another back. Or some daughters are the apple of their father's eye, but they just can't get along with their mom. There are a lot of complex family dynamics that contribute to this. And that's why for u/sh****-mom-throwaway, after years of tension, her wedding led to the entire family finally coming face to face with their blatant favoritism. Can you imagine missing your own child's wedding just because you didn't really feel like going? It's unimaginable to many parents: it's one of those sweet events that people really look forward to celebrating as the newlyweds usher in a new period of their lives. Not these parents, though: they treated their daughter's wedding as if she just invited them out for a casual coffee date, denying to show up at all! The story is quite long but well worth the read, as well as the update where things really started to change drastically for the original poster. Next, read about some other dramatic wedding moments, like one person who admitted that \"The tornado at the outdoor reception was kinda bad.\"",
