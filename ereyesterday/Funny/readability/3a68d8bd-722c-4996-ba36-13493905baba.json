  "description": "Let's start with the good news. We're all in the same boat here, navigating the same narrative, living in the same timeline. Solidarity, right? The bad news is that the boat is the Titanic, the setting is Groundhog Day, and nobody's getting off. Not exactly the inspirational pep talk you were hoping for, but hey, at least we're sinking together. Over and over again.Unfortunately for us, we've landed in a time of limbo. We're all stuck. If you want to feel a little better about it, just think of yourself as a Greek myth—you're Sisyphus. Hooray! Us modern mythical beings seem to exist in two states: either desperately looking (or let's be honest, begging) for a job or hating the one we already have. Yay! It's like a rollercoaster ride with one single loop that just repeats forever. Thrilling.",
