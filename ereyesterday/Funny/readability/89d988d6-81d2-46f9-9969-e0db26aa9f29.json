  "description": "There are some rules in workplaces that are okay to bend. For instance, so you accidentally take home a pack of pens that were meant for the office. Whatever. It happens. You take a longer a little bit of a longer lunch than you're supposed. That's okay, sometimes you just need that. However, some rules are there for a reason and should not be broken. These rules usually have to do with health and safety. For example, when you are working at a plant that deals with very toxic and deadly chemicals, you are very much not going to want to break the rules that are put in place to keep you healthy and safe there.  So why is it that many companies will try and take the cheapest route they can when it comes to keeping things up to code? They want to hire a top-notch health and safety manager, but then once they get called out for all the unsafe and unhealthy things happening in the company that needs to be changed, they all of a sudden regret getting such a professional health and safety manager. That is exactly what happened to this Redditor. And after he took the necessary break he was entitled to after suffering a heart attack, he came back to a bleak surprise.",

However, the company pushed back hard. He had to work so much to get everything even barely up to code, that he suffered a friggin' heart attack. So when he came back and found that his temporary replacement had now become his boss and he had lost his authority, he was more than upset, he was hellbent on revenge. So the second he got his chance, he took it. It took a year, but finally, the government audit came and as the new guy tried to take credit for all of the Redditor's original work and steer them clear of the crappy work he did and/or avoided to do, this Redditor came through. He handed the government officials a binder full of infractions from the company and handed his boss his letter of resignation. The company tried to sue but it turns out that is even MORE illegal than all of the things not being up to code. So joke's on you, soulless company.",
