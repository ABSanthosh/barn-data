  "description": "Is it really even petty revenge when you revoke your recently ex-employers' access to your personal software that you paid for and were only using for your work out of goodwill? At that point, you're just reclaiming what was rightfully yours, to begin with, and since the company had been effectively leasing your software license, you might as well go ahead and send them a bill for however long they had been using it, too. It's not your fault if they can't properly invest in the resources needed to complete the work of their business. Whereas the poster of this story acts like they were doing some sort of nefarious deed, this really reads as the most professional and fair thing they could have done in the situation. After six years of service, you would think that they could have treated their departing employee with a little more tact and compassion.",
