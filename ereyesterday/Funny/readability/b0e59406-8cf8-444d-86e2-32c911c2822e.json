  "description": "Christmas is the most meowgical time of the year, and everyone knows that. The trees, the lights, the music… you can just sense that meowgic in the air. With that meowgic come Christmas miracles. For each person, it's something different, and every year, it's something different. And a few years back, for the person in this story in particular, a little cat-shaped Christmas miracle happened which they finally decided to share. This person rescued a kitten on Christmas eve, which is a miracle and a story in and of itself. But the kitten they rescued was one that truly needed their help. If this woman hadn't rescued her, this night would have turned from a Christmas miracle into a Christmas disaster for this kitten, because chances are that in her condition, she wouldn't have made it through the night. But things turned out the way they were supposed to, and it was Merry Christmas for all.",
