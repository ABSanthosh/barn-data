  "text": "Ms. Schemmenti wanted to share the screen with Sweet Dee as soon as she learned that the collab was for real At least one person in Philadelphia wants to hear what Sweet Dee has to say.When the Paddy’s Pub gang of It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia ventures from their usual haunt on the south side of the city all the way to West Philadelphia, Mac, Charlie, Dennis, Dee and Frank will all presumably get to walk the halls of Willard R. Abbott Elementary School and demonstrate their own profound lack of education and intelligence to the cast of Abbott Elementary. Nearly eight months after a viral tweet about the Willy’s Chocolate Experience in Glasgow got Abbott Elementary creator Quinta Brunson talking with It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia head and bodyguard Rob McElhenney, the crossover between the two sitcoms that best represent the City of Brotherly Love is coming in the ninth episode of Abbott Elementary Season 4, which will air later this year.Abbott Elementary star Lisa Ann Walter is at least as excited about the collaboration as are any of the It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia fans who have been binging her Emmy-winning show in preparation for the crossover event, specifically because Walter wanted to work with the most Emmy-snubbed comedian currently on TV.  While attending Warner Bros. Television Group’s Fall TV Season Celebration, Walter revealed that she specifically asked her co-star and Abbott Elementary creator Brunson to put her in a scene with Kaitlin Olson, though Walter didn't explicitly mention whether or not Brunson obliged the request. Don't Miss Hopefully, Brunson didn't refuse the offer – I'm sure Ms. Schemmenti has a horse head guy. “I’ve been a long time fan of that show,” Walter said of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, reflecting on the shooting of the highly anticipated crossover episode, “The work that they’ve done on our Abbott set has been hilarious.”When Walter heard that the It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia cast was finally coming to Abbott Elementary, she says she already knew exactly how she wanted her character's involvement in the plot to shake out. “I really was excited about acting with Dee, with Kaitlin Olson,” Walter said, adding of her admiration for the Always Sunny and High Potential star, “I met her at some of the events that we have to go do…I just really liked her a lot. I said to Quinta, ‘Can I do my scenes with her? Write me scenes with her.’” Hopefully, Brunson understood the importance of pairing up Abbott Elementary's resident black market badass with Always Sunny's chaotic punching bag. And, if Melissa Schemmenti and Dee Reynolds do end up in a scene together during the crossover, hopefully Sweet Dee knows better than to test her Italian accent.
