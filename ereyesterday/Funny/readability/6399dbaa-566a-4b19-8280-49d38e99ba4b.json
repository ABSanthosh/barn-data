  "description": "Just a few more weeks of forced holiday cheer at the office, and we'll be back to the grind of Q1, where fresh goals and new spreadsheets await. Honestly, as much as the holiday season is supposed to be joyful, it's mostly just exhausting. We're in the final stretch of the tax year, and we're barely running on fumes. Between holiday-themed potlucks, secret Santa gift swaps, and painfully awkward holiday parties, it's a miracle any actual work gets done in December.On the bright side, management usually does something nice for the staff during the holidays. Sure, we dream of a Christmas bonus, but we'd happily settle for a thoughtful gift or even a little extra PTO to use up before the ball drops. Not in this office. Nope, here the staff gets peer pressured—thanks to one very persistent coworker—to chip in for a collective gift for their bosses. But that's not even the worst part. The Original Poster (OP) in this story discovered that the coworker organizing the gift was also taking all the credit. Talk about a lack of holiday spirit. Luckily, OP wasn't about to let that slide. With one cleverly worded mass email, this greedy coworker got exactly what they deserved.",
