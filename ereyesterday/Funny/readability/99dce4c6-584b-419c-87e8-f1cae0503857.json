  "description": "These construction workers got to do the funniest thing possible, all while doing exactly as they were directed! There are some jobs where you have to do as you're directed, no matter how dimwitted those orders may seem. You can push back, you can complain to your boss, and you can team up with your coworkers to try and get things fixed. But at the end of the day, someone above you has the final say, and their word goes.Construction is one of those industries. You might be surprised to learn that even in a really expensive building — 10 stories tall and filled with marble — big mistakes can happen. These construction workers noticed a pretty glaring mistake, but since their general contractor was known for his impoliteness, they just did as they were told. They got paid either way, and the general contractor was left fuming. That's malicious compliance for you! Check out the full story below. This construction worker also left a few interesting answers to questions in the comments, adding more information about the full project. Next up, read another construction story: this brother-in-law has been avoiding his family for over a decade after they \"borrowed\" his expensive equipment without permission: '[He's] putting money in the way of a family relationship'.",
