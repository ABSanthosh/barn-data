  "description": "There's a big difference for cat pawrents between the first day of the weekend, where it's all a cute and cuddly Caturday, and the second day of the weekend, where it's a sassy and silly Sunday. On a Caturday, your cat greets you after a whole workweek where you've been away, and all they want is to receive all the pets from you and snuggle endlessly. But on a Sunday, your cat has had enough of this silly nonsense of a silly hooman being in their silly little space for far too long, so they enter the zoomies overdrive.To try and relax yourself and your cat, we prepared a bunch of fuzzy feline memes that you can watch together. And who knows, instead of your cat returning to their Caturday vibes, you might actually catch on to the Sunday sassy vibe and join your cat in the current zoomies session.",
