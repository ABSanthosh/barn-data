  "description": "Life can be a tough pill to swallow sometimes (especially if you're a cat, in which case every pill is a hard pill to swallow). We wouldn't know, we're definitely not a cat typing this listicle right now, we're 100% hooman. We pay taxes, go to work, and only eat tuna once per day. Anyway, as we were saying, life can be a real hairball sometimes. If we need something to help us get through a purrticularly pawful day, we turn to wholesome funny feline memes. They're like our medicine, but this medicine is a catnip-coated spoonful of sugar. Us hoomans love catnip too, right? Can't get enough of it!Erm, we mean, we like catnip just as much as the next hooman. But back to these silly cats that make our days better, they're just the cat's meow. And we're not saying that because we're a cat, remember, it's just a normal hooman expression. We feel like we're not really getting our paw across here. Point! We meant to say point. Just scroll down already and enjoy this listicle, catnip or not (but it's better with catnip…right?).",
