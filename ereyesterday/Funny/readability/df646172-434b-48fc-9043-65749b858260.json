  "description": "Hello there, feline fanatic fans and sassy hoomans, do you enjoy this Sunday? It's a sassy Sunday, and who better to lead the charge against the Monday mellows than our furbulous feline overlords? Cats are the undisputed champions of side-eye, masters of judgmental looks, and pawfessional throwers of shade. Honestly, their sass levels are off the charts, and we're just lucky they let us witness their meowgnificence.As Monday lurks around the corner, our cats are already rolling their eyes at the audacity of Monday to even exist. We gathered these sassy cat memes here to remind you to embrace your inner cattitude. Strut into the week as if you own it (just like a cat entering any room), toss a little sass over your shoulder, and let the world know you're not here to be messed with. With just half the amount of sass a cat possesses - Meownday doesn't stand a chance. Look at your sassy cat, look at these sassy cat memes, and you might learn a thing or two.",
