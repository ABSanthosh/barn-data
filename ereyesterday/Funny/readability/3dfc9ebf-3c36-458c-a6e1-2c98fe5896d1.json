  "description": "This guy taught a stranger a lesson in thorough date-planning after they refused to heed warnings about a wrong number mixup. Securing a dinner reservation on Valentine's Day wasn't this dude's top priority, but petty revenge certainly was. Valentine's Day can be a restaurant's most profitable day of the year. Desperate singles pour in, begging for tables and heavily tipping servers to impress their date. While many employees rue the day, restaurant owners count stacks of cash after a high-traffic, full house evening. That's why it's always so hard to secure a reservation on Valentine's Day—everyone wants to go out. And if you do, by some miracle, get a table at a restaurant, you better do everything in your power to keep it. To increase their chances of landing a mate, serial daters, married couples, and every long-term couple will plan ahead of time to avoid being left out in the rain, dinnerless, and romance-free. So when the guy in our next story realized a stranger was using his phone number to secure a reservation for his date on Valentine's Day, he decided to take matters into his own hands.",
