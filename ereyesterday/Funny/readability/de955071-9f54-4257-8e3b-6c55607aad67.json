For a while I was playing it exclusively with other people, it was a Hang Out Game, but Quick Matches just don't take very long and they can fit in anywhere. It's also an opportunity for others, our erstwhile allies, to learn remedial hero shooter skills at our expense! I have paid for one thing in my thirty-three hour Marvel Rivals career, and that's a little nameplate with Squirrel Girl on it. Grib got himself a Cloak and Dagger skin for Christmas, and he grabbed the five dollar Season Passy thing they have going, but unless I see somebody dripped out in the match or they get the marquee, I don't really engage with those systems. The fear for me anytime I get locked in to a game like this is that Free is going to become Very Not Free very quickly. I guess I'm lucky I don't like the Squirrel Girl skin, and I'm lucky they don't allow gifting. I don't feel manipulated if somebody else buys skins that make my game look cooler. All I really want to do in there is… Play Rivals. There is a sort of odd review of the game at Eurogamer, a site I think generally has reviews that are near the top of the heap in terms of quality. I don't think this is a poorly written review necessarily, I just don't know what game he's talking about. There's like thirty-some-odd heroes and I am never confused about what is happening, I know what the sounds and call-outs mean, I've made great stops with my team and I've been stopped hard. I'm not even playing the competitive mode Gabe has dipped a toe into, these miracles are all happening in the Axe Body Spray-fueled Party Pit of Quick Match. I don't think this is just contrarian engagement farming or something, I literally think he clicked the wrong executable. (CW)TB out.",
