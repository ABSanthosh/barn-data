  "description": "Monday morning is a tough time, a difficult period, a turbulent situation. Unfortunately for us, Monday morning is happening as we speak. It's here, and it's not very nice. And for you and us? It's an even more difficult burden to bear. Why? Because we're all cat pawrents. Having a cat as your lovely fluffy companion at home, means you need to experience every Monday morning after you've spent a whole wholesome weekend with your cat. Two days full of feline fluff - what a blissful existence. And then comes Monday and it's all gone. Just like that, with no warning.But imagine this: It's a Monday morning, and you're all prepped and ready to leave the house to start another workweek, but your cat sits on your lap. That's it, it's over, you cannot move. It's illegal to move once a cat has sat on your lap. If you move an inch we'd have to call the pawlice on you. So, you know what you have to do now, right? You need to call your workplace and tell them you cannot come in. Your Monday morning problem is no more. Now pet the cat.",
