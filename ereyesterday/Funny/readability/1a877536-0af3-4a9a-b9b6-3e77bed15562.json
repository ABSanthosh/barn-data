Many years ago, Americans used to fear Joann’s ‘handmade happiness.’ And soon, these violent criminals and thugs will know why!” Trump added that inmates housed at Joann Fabrics would be forced, just like notorious criminals such as Al Capone once were, to teach macramé classes to shoppers on Saturday mornings.
