  "description": "Happy Tuesday, feline fam! We have to admit something to you: we love giving our cats weird names. One time we had a foster cat and we named her Bottle Cap. We called her \"Lil Cappie\" for short. But we're saying this so you won't be alarmed by the cute kitty in the post below, named \"Toast\". Honestly, we love that name, but we understand that some people think it's weird. We think it's beautiful, just like his story.Some EMTs turned into cat rescuers recently when they found him during a call. He turned out to be quite friendly and hitched a ride back with them in the ambulance. We're not sure who adopted whom, but now Toast is loving his indoor life and has even been employed by his new family. He received an official ID card and everything! And now, for the cherry on top, Toast has been adopted by one of the EMTs and taken to his furrever home. Don't think that that excludes him from showing up for work every day!",
