  "description": "We don't know about you, but we are so curious about cats and their family dynamics. Seeing things like dad cats meeting their kittens for the first time, laughing at cat moms being overwhelmed by the realities of parenthood, seeing momma cats raise babies from different litters together as if they are their own, or seeing kitty siblings be just like human siblings and drive each other up the wall… we love it. It humanizes cats for us, and for others as well, we think, and with all the people out there who don't see cats as something to care for, we think that stories like these are important. And yet, even with all of the stories that we have seen about cat families, we don't think that we have ever seen three generations of cats in the same place. Kittens, a mom, and the most grandma-looking grandma cat that you have ever seen in your lives. And this Maine Coon grandma is about to meet her grand-kittens for the first time.",
