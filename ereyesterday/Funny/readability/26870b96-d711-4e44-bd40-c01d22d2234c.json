  "description": "Manufacturing engineers occupy that unique corporate position where they understand both theory and reality, making them dangerous witnesses when management decides to ignore physics in favor of wishful thinking and interdepartmental finger-pointing becomes more important than actual problem-solving.This particular battle started when design engineers decided that a 20% failure rate must obviously trace back to the testing station, because blaming the new guy requires less paperwork than admitting design flaws. Their solution involved the corporate equivalent of closing your eyes during a horror movie: if you can't see the problem happening, it must not be happening.",

  "text": "Never mind that the testing station mimicked real-world conditions, that the relay couldn't physically fail under those circumstances, or that other products used identical components without issue. Logic bows to hierarchy, and junior engineers learn quickly that datasheets and evidence carry less weight than senior assumptions and departmental politics. And so, his compliance unfolded beautifully: disable powered testing, watch failure rates triple across the entire product line, observe the original problem persist unchanged, then sit back while design engineers spent months chasing their own tails. The real masterpiece emerged when a different product required firmware flashing during the now-forbidden powered testing phase, creating a 100% failure rate that sent the entire department into firefighting mode. Months of investigation, dozens of theories, and zero solutions later, someone finally asked the right person the right question. The reveal delivered that rare corporate moment when documentation trumps authority and physics defeats politics. Sometimes the best malicious compliance involves simply following orders exactly as written, then watching reality reassert itself with compound interest on every ignored warning.",
