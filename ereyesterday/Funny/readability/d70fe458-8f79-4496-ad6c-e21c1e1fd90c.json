  "description": "When you come from a family with a lot of grief and strife, there's often a ton of finger-pointing and random blaming. Some people can't own up to their own misgivings, so they try to make up a story to explain their actions without them being at fault. Other times, people are ready to come clean about their actions, but the hurt is too far embedded that no apology could revoke the damage done. There are also a lot of complicated feelings caught up in family drama. You love them all in a way you can't explain because they're family and they're yours, but also, you know them better than anyone and have no fear telling them that they're wrong. Or at least that you think they're wrong.Whatever the case, every family has drama and trauma that is unique to them and would be hard to explain to anyone who can't understand your family dynamics. Still, it helps to ask an outside opinion to explain the actions of the ones we love. One woman posted to Reddit searching for advice for her family troubles. Her brother wants to come back into the lives of his two daughters, whom he abandoned at a young age, and they don't want him back in their lives. This woman takes her niece's side, but she's wondering if she's being too harsh on her brother. What do you think?",
