  "description": "Welcome back, feline fam. We're here today with another heartwarming story from the hands of hoomans correcting the errors of bad people. We don't know how anyone could ever abandon a cat - it seems purrfeclty inhoomane to us, but then again, we have no idea what is going on in people's lives. But this cat isn't just any cat, it's a maine coon - one of the most regal and beautiful cats in the whole wide world. Well, if they don't want him, that's one more maine coon that we can take into our fluffy family, right?This floofball below is called Desmond and he was abandoned at the emergency vet for people to find him. The vets got him checked and cleaned up, but the abandonment left an emotional mark on him. However, things all started to turn around when he and one of the workers at the emergency vet made a meowrvelous connection with this maine coon. Long story short, they're going to adopt him, and now he's going to be treated like the purrfect prince he is for the rest of his days!",
