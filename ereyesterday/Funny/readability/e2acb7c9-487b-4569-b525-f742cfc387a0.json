  "description": "Solidarity with our coworkers is a crucial part of a healthy workplace. If we can bond over an absurd project or the boss' annoying behavior, we're more likely to work better together. It's also important to gain trust and understanding with our coworkers so we can all get the work done and go home on time. If the boss isn't looking, it can even be fun to bend the rules a little bit with the few opportunities we have.This makes it all the more crushing when a coworker is on the boss' side more than yours. And when that one coworker is consistently hypocritical about the things they snitch on you about, then it might be time to take it up with the dreaded HR. One man had that issue with a coworker who was consistently late and took extra long lunch breaks, yet told him off if he was even minutes late. It's simple, if you're going to be late, I have no problem with it! Just don't get mad at me when I'm doing what you're doing. Read on to see if you agree with how this guy handled this situation.",
