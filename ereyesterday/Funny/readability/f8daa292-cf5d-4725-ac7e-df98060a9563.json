  "description": "What goes around comes around. Sibling rivalries can be difficult for families to navigate. When siblings are children and they're facing off with one another, their parents can intervene and try to mediate things between the kiddos before feelings get too hurt. But when those kids grow up, it's a whole different story. And especially when the parents have a favorite child, it can make a rivalry even more tricky to work out a peaceful compromise. This person, writing in under the name u/No_Kiwi_2, opens their story with a startling line: \"My brother said he was going to propose at my wedding.\" Yes, you read that right: their brother told this person that he was going to propose on his sibling's special day!",

  "text": "Asking to propose to someone at another person's wedding is already rather tacky. After all, that couple spent months or years planning out a day personalized to celebrate their love story. So not everyone is comfortable with letting another couple temporarily take over their celebration of love. Some are… but even so, the couple who wants to get engaged should ask, not demand, to have this special treatment. Check out the full story below. Then, read about the fast-food manager who scolded an employee for “lazing around.”",
