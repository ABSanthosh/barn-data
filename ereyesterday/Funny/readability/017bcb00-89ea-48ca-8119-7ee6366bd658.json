  "description": "Not everyone is great at public speaking. Most people have messed up at least once during a speech, presentation, or interview. Common mistakes include getting facts wrong, mispronouncing someone's name, or losing one's train of thought. However, you do not necessarily see a college student accidentally referring to their much older professor as \"daddy\" as a common mistake.This college student was mortified when she realized that she had just addressed her professor as her father when she was answering a question from him during an important project presentation. Let's just say that this is not something that her classmates let slide. Group chats exploded, one student renamed his profile \"Daddy\" in the class, and even the professor couldn't hold it together. The whole thing is about as cringeworthy as it sounds, but as many people in the comments section suggested, the only way to get through is to own one's mistake. Keep scrolling below for the Redditor's full account of the classroom debacle.
