  "description": "The worst part about traveling during the holiday season is having to deal with other travelers. Whether it's a bus, train, or plane, having to share a confined space with strangers just so you can endure passive-aggressive meals with family members you love to avoid year-round often feels like a lot of effort for very little reward. However, that's what happens to countless folks every December, which means that nearly every traveler is at least slightly annoyed already. Here, we have one of those passengers who boarded his flight home, only to discover an entitled Karen sitting in his seat. Of course, she was assigned the middle seat on a 100% full, 3+ hour flight, and she genuinely thought this guy would be willing to switch with her.
