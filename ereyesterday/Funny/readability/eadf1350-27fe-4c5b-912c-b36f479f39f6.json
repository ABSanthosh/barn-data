  "description": "RV life can present itself with a unique set of challenges. There is a reason why people are fascinated by the idea of a more nomadic lifestyle, even if it's something that they could never endure themselves.Personally speaking, I need the stability of an unmovable home, a place where I can come back to at the end of the day that is just a bit less dependent on the elements. In other words, I would never end up like either person in this relationship because I would never seriously consider RV life for even a long weekend if I could help it. That being said, I can relate to having to adjust to the different preferred temperatures of your significant other once both parties are sharing space.",

  "text": "Here, we have a couple who had been living in their RV for several years now, but recently, they had been arguing over the internal temperature of their mobile home. The girlfriend always cranked up the space heater to at least 80˚F, even if it was already extremely warm outside. It got to the point where the boyfriend had enough of this drama and gave up trying to search for a compromise. Instead, in a move that was impulsive and arguably foolish, the boyfriend unplugged their space heater and hid it in storage. Let's just say that if it has to get to this degree of pettiness over what degree the temperature should be (see what I did there?), then this couple's days are numbered.",
