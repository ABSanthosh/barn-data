  "description": "Uh-oh, it's been a few hours after lunch and now your body is wondering why you are still using that noggin of yours. We should be lounging clothesless by a creek eating fresh fruit and befriending woodland creatures. Why are you still looking at numbers and emails? Or prehistoric ancestors don't know what an Excel spreadsheet is, why do you have to?? Was this really the point of evolution? All of these thoughts while working are making you eepy. You might not get employee of the month, but you just might get eepiest.  But whose fault is that anyway? How dare someone email you something important to do ASAP at 3:30pm. Who do they think they are?? The rest of the work day is dedicated to thinking about how you need to honk-shoo-mee-mee-mee for a full 8 hours tonight or you will definitely not make that morning meeting. So really, managers should be encouraging midday siestas in all offices!",

It definitely doesn't help that things are a little boring right now and your eyelids are starting to feel heavy. How do you keep your brain wheels turning? You can't take a physical break, you already did that multiple times today. So what else can you do? Take a quick mental break with some relatable work memes. Just a quick one. A scroll until you hear that Slack message alert that says someone has mentioned your name.",
