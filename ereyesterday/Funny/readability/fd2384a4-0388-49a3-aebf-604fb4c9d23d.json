  "description": "When anyone first starts a new job at a new company, they hope they'll get along with not only their boss and their boss's boss but also their fellow colleagues. Work settings, however, do not rid their employees' of the childish mindset and behaviors they've been building since elementary school. When you think about it, workplaces are just adult daycare (for a paycheck), and someone is bound to step out of line and expose themselves for the whiny adult baby they are… If you've experienced an unprofessional, vengeful coworker, you know what I'm talking about.The story you're about to read is a tale about a coworker's vendetta against their colleague, the individual who posted the story. This coworker has been deleting and taking credit for work the colleague has completed, and their higher-ups are doing nothing about it but saying they'll \"keep an eye\" on it. If you're interested in this story, you can scroll below and see how it unfolds. Additionally, you'll find some comments from users who are offering advice on what their next steps should be.",

  "text": "This is where the supervisor went wrong. Deleting an employee's work is already grounds for termination because it is considered bad conduct, and it also compromises the workflow of the office. The fact that the higher-ups are, intentionally or not, protecting an employee who clearly can't complete their role's tasks without sabotaging another colleague, makes this story seem a bit fishy.
