  "description": "Imagine you finally score a reservation at that one Michelin-rated restaurant for a romantic dinner and after waiting 45 minutes for your pre-booked table, you've already excitedly chosen appetizers from the menu. Once seated, you sit across from your date and the candlelight flickers in their eyes; you're both thrilled to be sharing this beautiful restaurant experience. However, disaster strikes when you realize who your dining room neighbor is… An entitled yapper is seated next to you, chatting away with someone over the phone, speakerphone blasting at full volume. At first you thought you could ignore the shrill, high-pitched tone of the phone's external speaker, but with the cacophony of restaurant noise, the clamor of forks, and the full-volume screaming of the inconsiderate person next to you, you can go ahead and kiss your quiet, romantic evening goodbye. In my eyes, there's nothing worse than getting stuck next to a speaker-phone person in public, which is why the karmic justice of this next story brings me so much satisfaction.",
