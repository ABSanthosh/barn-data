  "description": "Happy Wednesday, friends and felines. Cats have always been our furst love, and anything else comes in second, including boyfriends and girlfriends. That's just the way it is. Hoomans come and go, but our relationship with our cats is one that has saved us, brought us joy, and made our lives better time and time again. We wouldn't trade them for the world, so if a potential partner doesn't get along with our cats, we can say with purrfect certainty that it is a huge red flag.They don't have to love our sweet kitties as much as we do (as if anyone ever could), but they at least have to enjoy their purresence and give them the respect they deserve. If they don't, it's time to kick them to the curb and start something new. We know that may sound pawsitively harsh, but believe us, if they don't like pets, they'll never fully merge with your lifestyle. That's why when this younger boyfriend moved in with his feline-fanatic girlfriend, they ran into a situation messier than our cat's litter box. Scroll through the full thread below!",
