    "description": "This birthday party went downhill so quickly! It's a shame that this person volunteered to plan a double birthday party for their 64-year-old FIL and their 60-year-old MIL. It was supposed to be a lovely time, as u/Diylion explains. They invited 10 people to a local venue…but things just went wrong from the start. Sometimes, despite your best efforts, things will go wrong in life. And as they say, the show (or party!) must go on! It's not like you can just tell your entire party of 10 people that there's not going to be an event, actually, and that they should just pack it up and head home. This person did arrive early with a big group, which can't be accommodated by all restaurants. But even after they patiently waited outside the otherwise empty venue, they were still turned down. It might be one of those times that the person writing a 1-star review isn't overreacting. They got very petty with their revenge, and hopefully, it's a good learning experience for the manager of the place. Although he begged this person to take down their numerous reviews, he was denied. The truth is now out there, and maybe the manager will think twice about being unaccommodating towards guests. Up next, this person explains why they're \"reporting my TikTok famous sister\" who can't stop spilling family secrets online.",

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/38145541/update-we-had-7-days-to-leave-the-premises-landlord-tries-to-evict-business-and-claim-their",
    "description": "Let this story serve as yet another friendly reminder to never trust your landlord. This does not merely apply to private residents, as this time, we're dealing with the property of a leisure business. During a difficult economic period for the business, the landlord proved ruthless and issued a 7-day eviction notice with the expectation that the employees would be unable to clear out all their equipment on such short notice. It gets worse. After a little probing, the business owners discovered that their landlord was advertising their soon-to-be former property with all of their technological equipment included in the hopes of making a profit. The assumption here was that the business owners would be unable to get all of their company property cleared from the building in time. Well, as we all know, there is nothing like doubt and suspicion from others to motivate folks to prove the haters wrong. In this case, that hater would be the landlord, who would come to regret issuing the eviction notice in the first place. Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section. For more, check out this post about a toxic manager who unjustly fired a dedicated employee.",

Our cat has decided that she wishes to sleep on the counters and only there today. Normally, she doesn't get up there, but today, she's really pushing our buttons about it. Hey, we see you over there. Don't you even think about it.Normally our cat is a sweet, precious baby angel, but today, she is choosing to test our patience every second of the day, and to calm down, we need a pleasant and silly scroll through some hissterical cat memes to remind us how much we love our cat and why we should keep her even though she's being a bad girl. Don't worry, we still love her, but boy, does she love to-hey, HEY, get away from there-make our lives chaotic sometimes. Anyway, we hope you enjoy these fluffy feline funnies of sweet baby angel-no, no, NO! We said not on the counters!!!!",

Only this time they have forgotten their long-time clients on legacy packages.\"   Then he found a few more effs. \"This e-shop required to create an account to download an invoice for order already delivered. Which is kind of WTF on its own. But when I pasted a generated 62 mixed character (alphanumeric+special) password, their form still insisted on entering 8+ characters. not correct. Well, because their programmers didn't expect somebody to paste a password.

Rather than an error reported as success, we appear to have here a success reported as an error. \"We're all familiar with apps that throw up an eror dialog with the error message as success but it's particularly irritating when trying to submit a payment. This is what happened when I tried to pay for an Indian visa with Paypal. To add insult to injury, when you try to pay again, it says that due to errors and network problems, you must check back in 2 hours before attempting a repeat payment.\"   Finally Robert H. is all charged up about Chevy shenanigans. \"I thought one of the advantages of EV vehicles was they don't need oil changes?\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
