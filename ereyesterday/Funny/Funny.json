    "description": "Parents want a better life for their kids—it's simple science. After a life well-lived, a lot of parents have a plethora of wisdom waiting at their fingertips, but it might not be as simple as they'd hoped to explain. Imparting a lifetime of values, morals, tips, and advice on another human can sometimes feel trite and insane, but to your kid, your parental wisdom could mean the world to them. Many kids have memories of their parents, specifically their fathers, bearing down nuggets of amazing advice, and a lot of it includes tried-and-true methods to a good, wholesome, and decent life. And isn't that what we all want at the end of the day? Keep scrolling to read some real tidbits of sage advice that dads have passed along to their offspring, lovingly guiding them throughout their lives—even well beyond their years. After this, here's another wholesome collection of therapeutic knowledge that'll give your day the sunshine it needed.",

    "description": "When you grow comfortable in your role at work, you understandably start taking more workplace initiative. You know the ropes, you know your boss, and you hope all of your efforts to do more without being asked to will count toward a generous raise. Many bosses appreciate employee independence and initiative, while others see their subordinates as a threat to their position. Sometimes, subordinates are after their boss's job, but others are simply trying to get a bigger paycheck for doing menial tasks… and there's nothing wrong with that!In this story, an employee and their coworker take on some interviews at an MD's private medical practice. They were asked to do so by their boss, and these interviews were scheduled in a way that aligned with their schedules.Their boss was having a bad day and blamed both of them for things that were not in their control, then proceeded to scold them for changing interview times (despite them doing so because of lateness on the boss's part). As a result, they were asked to stop doing interviews. Well, that's her problem now!",

From working our paws off all week to meeting with friends, chores, errands, family, and more on the weekends, we want nothing more than to curl up on the couch and be a potato all day. However, we only have two days of free time, so we don't want to waste it by doing nothing all day. Pawrt of the day is fine, though.So, while we relax in bed while gathering our will to get up, we might as well scroll through something that we know will make us smile and put us in a pawsitive mewd! That thing is cat memes, and not just any cat memes…all-pawerful cat memes! These feline funnies are sure to recharge your Sunday with the energy of 1,000 tiny forehead kisses. It works for our cute kitties, so it will probably work for us as well. We wish you a very relaxing, yet prrroductive rest of your weekend. Enjoy!",

    "description": "Greetings and salutations, friends and feline enthusiasts! How often do you catch your cat sleeping on the job? Considering that cats can sleep upwards of 14 hours a day, we'd say it's a pretty common occurrence! There's a reason they coined the term cat nap, after all. These fluffy little snooze machines take their beauty rest seriously—and honestly, we respect that.As a fellow lover of sleep, I totally understand the temptation to doze off while on the job. But at the end of the day, my family counts on me to bring home the tuna cans and pay the bills, so I proceed with caution. The fluffy feline we're featuring today, on the other hand, has zero worries and was perfectly content letting his fellow shelter vet tech pick up the slack while he enjoyed a top-tier snooze fest. What an adorable interaction! We'd say this hardworking vet tech should just let this baby continue his nap—after all, he clearly needs the rest more than the original poster. Sweet dreams, little one!",
