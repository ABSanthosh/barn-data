    "description": "It's a sad reality, but everyone knows that it's always harder for senior cats to get adopted. Everyone wants a kitten, right? Everyone wants that energy of youth. And it's hard for stray kittens to get adopted. Because everyone wants a kitten with a fresh start. No life on the street means no trauma, it means less fear. So, you can imagine that it's even harder for a stray senior cat to get adopted. The older they are, the longer they are on the street… Not many people would give a cat like that a chance. So is it even a wonder that this kitty has been stuck on the streets for more than ten years? He was just there, existing, getting older and sicker over time, and no one gave him a chance. Until someone did. And although it was a little hard in the beginning, the transformation that George had after getting adopted and finally having all the love that he deserves is absolutely breathtaking.",

    "description": "Almost certainly, at some point, those working shift work, or in other jobs where timesheets need to be kept, have been told by some manager not to \"bother\" reporting time that they worked over their shift because it's \"inconvenient\" for them to report it. Sometimes, this comes in the form of being told that it needs to be at least 15 minutes to be reported and counted for anything, but that's not really true—at all. If anything, if their system can't handle menial minutes overtime, then they should just be rounding up to some increment that it can handle… But you can't really go around suggesting this to your boss and the company's HR department without putting a target squarely on your back.This former restaurant worker shared how their manager had once asked them to show up 30 minutes before their shift was to start and get their things organized so that they could \"begin working\" as soon as their shift was set to start, insisting that this would make them look like a \"dedicated\" employee. The worker shares that they outright refused, calling out their manager on the spot for their proposal that they work for free when they were already only making $12 an hour. Even though this experience happened some time ago, they shared it with this online employment community, sparking discussion on the topic with other members of the community and readers.

    "description": "All they wanted was a proper Halloween costume… but these people got the silliest versions of their costumes instead. Ordering your Halloween costume online is a g amble each time. There are a few factors: are you ordering this the week before Halloween? Because if so, good luck getting that costume on time, because everyone else had exactly the same idea! Secondly, when you do receive that costume in the first week of November, it might not be what you expected. Just because the product photo showed off an incredible costume, doesn't mean you won't get a hastily-sewn costume made from the cheapest fabric ever. Some costumes rip the first time you put them on, while others are just so goofy you couldn't wear them outside without people giggling at you. Below are a bunch of people who had some costume issues, and decided to share their experiences with the internet. Let's hope they were able to get replacement costumes before Halloween! At least a few of the people had a good sense of humor about it, and mentioned that they and their friends were laughing hard about the whole debacle. There are also a few fuzzy friends who got tricked by false promises from their costumes, like one dog whose ghost costume looks more like a paper towel costume. Up next, read about this grandfather who spent two decades fooling restaurant staffers in order to get about 10% more food.",

    "description": "Quality control is an important business function for any company. When your company is shipping devices with safety concerns, it's even more important. In some industries, a quality control failure is bound to be national headlines. When the quality control software tool stopped working, everyone panicked. At which point, GRH stepped in. Now, we've discussed this software and GRH before, but as a quick recap, it was: written by someone who is no longer employed with the company, as part of a project managed by someone who is no longer at the company, requested by an executive who is also no longer at the company. There are no documented requirements, very few tests, and a lot of \"don't touch this, it works\". And this was a quality control tool. So we're already in bad shape. It also had been unmaintained for years- a few of the QC engineers had tried to take it over, but weren't programmers, and it had essentially languished. Specifically, it was a quality control tool used to oversee the process by about 50 QC engineers. It automates a series of checks by wrapping around third party software tools, in a complex network of \"this device gets tested by generating output in program A, feeding it to program B, then combining the streams and sending them to the device, but this device gets tested using programs D, E, and F.\" The automated process using the tool has a shockingly low error rate. Without the tool, doing things manually, the error rate climbs to 1-2%. So unless everyone wanted to see terrifying headlines in the Boston Globe about their devices failing, GRH needed to fix the problem. GRH was given the code, in this case a a zip file on a shared drive. It did not, at the start, even build. After fighting with the project configuration to resolve that, GRH was free to start digging in deeper. Public Sub connect2PCdb() Dim cPath As String = Path.Combine(strConverterPath, \"c.pfx\") Dim strCN As String ' JES 12/6/2016: Modify the following line if MySQL server is changed to a different server. A dump file will be needed to re-create teh database in the new server. strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;sslmode=Required;certificatepassword=REDACTED;certificatefile=REDACTED\\c.pfx;password=REDACTED'\" strCN = Regex.Replace(strCN, \"certificatefile=.*?pfx\", \"certificatefile=\" \u0026 cPath) pcContext = New Entities(strCN) strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;persistsecurityinfo=True;database=REDACTED;password=REDACTED'\" strCN = Regex.Match(strCN, \".*'(.*)'\").Groups(1).Value Try strCN = pcContext.Database.Connection.ConnectionString cnPC.ConnectionString = \"server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;password=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;\" cnPC.Open() Catch ex As Exception End Try End Sub This is the code which connects to the backend database. The code is in the category of more of a trainwreck than a WTF. It's got a wonderful mix of nonsense in here, though- a hard-coded connection string which includes plaintext passwords, regex munging to modify the string, then hard-coding a string again, only to use regexes to extract a subset of the string. A subset we don't use. And then, for a bonus, the whole thing has a misleading comment- \"modify the following line\" if we move to a different server? We have to modify several lines, because we keep copy/pasting the string around. Oh, and of course, it uses the pattern of \"open a database connection at application startup, and just hold that connection forever,\" which is a great way to strain your database as your userbase grows. The good news about the hard-coded password is that it got GRH access to the database. With that, it was easy to see what the problem was: the database was full. The system was overly aggressive with logging, the logs went to database tables, the server was an antique with a rather small hard drive, and the database wasn't configured to even use all of that space anyway. Cleaning up old logs got the engineers working again. GRH kept working on the code, though, cleaning it up and modernizing it. Updating to latest version of the .NET Core framework modified the data access to be far simpler, and got rid of the need for hard-coded connection strings. Still, GRH left the method looking like this: Public Sub connect2PCdb() 'Dim cPath As String = Path.Combine(strConverterPath, \"c.pfx\") 'Dim strCN As String ' JES 12/6/2016: Modify the following line if MySQL server is changed to a different server. A dump file will be needed to re-create teh database in the new server. 'strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;sslmode=Required;certificatepassword=REDACTED;certificatefile=REDACTED\\c.pfx;password=REDACTED'\" 'strCN = Regex.Replace(strCN, \"certificatefile=.*?pfx\", \"certificatefile=\" \u0026 cPath) 'pcContext = New Entities(strCN) 'strCN = \"metadata=res://*/Model1.csdl|res://*/Model1.ssdl|res://*/Model1.msl;provider=MySql.Data.MySqlClient;provider connection string='server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;persistsecurityinfo=True;database=REDACTED;password=REDACTED'\" 'strCN = Regex.Match(strCN, \".*'(.*)'\").Groups(1).Value 'GRH 2021-01-15. Connection information moved to App.Config 'GRH 2021-08-13. EF Core no longer supports App.Config method pcContext = New PcEntities Try ' GRH 2021-08-21 This variable no longer exists in .NET 5 'strCN = pcContext.Database.Connection.ConnectionString ' GRH 2021-08-20 Keeping the connection open causes EF Core to not work 'cnPC.ConnectionString = \"server=REDACTED;user id=REDACTED;password=REDACTED;database=REDACTED;SslMode=none\" 'cnPC.Open() Catch ex As Exception End Try End Sub It's now a one-line method, with most of the code commented out, instead of removed. Why on Earth is the method left like that? GRH explains: Yes, I could delete the function as it is functionally dead, but I keep it for the same reasons that a hunter mounts a deer's head above her mantle.

    "description": "No obvious pattern fell out of last week's submissions for Error'd, but I did especially like Caleb Su's example. Michael R. , apparently still job hunting, reports \"I have signed up to outlier.ai to make some $$$ on the side. No instructions necessary.\"   Peter G. repeats a recurring theme of lost packages, saying \"(Insert obligatory snark about Americans and geography. No, New Zealand isn't located in Washington DC).\" A very odd coincidence, since neither the lat/long nor the zip code are particularly interesting.   \"The Past Is Mutable,\" declares Caleb Su , explaining \"In the race to compete with Gmail feature scheduling emails to send in the *future*, Outlook now lets you send emails in the past! Clearly, someone at Microsoft deserves a Nobel Prize for defying the basic laws of unidirectional time.\" That's thinking different.   Explorer xOneca explains this snapshot: \"Was going to watch a Youtube video in DuckDuckGo, and while diagnosing why it wasn't playing I found this. It seems that youtube-nocookie.com actually *sets* cookies..?\"   Morgan either found or made a funny. But it is a funny. \"Now when I think about it I do like Option 3 more…\" I rate this question a 👎   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
