    "description": "Everyone likes to think that they're the exception to a rule, usually because they're so certain that they're so much better and smarter than everybody. The reality of the situation couldn't be further from the truth, and the truth is this: If you think you're the exception, the rule exists for you.This couldn't be truer than when it comes to parents who think that their kids should be an exception to \"child-free\" events, either bringing them anyway without saying anything or making some dramatic last stand that causes a rift throughout the entire family or friend group.This online discussion was one of the rarer ones in which the original poster and their narrative are picked apart by other members of the community who suspect that the poster isn't telling the whole truth. The mother posted, sharing how she felt hurt and excluded by the new \"no kids\" rule that her sister was enforcing for family events. She felt as if the rule was directed solely at her and her children—truth be told, it probably is. The sister had made comments about how her house wasn't \"kid-proof\" and that events weren't \"relaxed,\" which is basically a nice way of saying, \"Your kids are out of control and not respectful of my things or my home and so I'd prefer if you didn't bring them here.\" So, in a sense, the mother has every right to feel targeted here, but instead of causing a stink about it, she should probably take it on board and work on parenting her children to be invited back in the future.",

    "description": "This situation sounds like every kid's dream and every neighbor's worst nightmare. If you spent ages begging your parents for a pool or a trampoline as a kid, you're not alone. It's a common experience for kids who want to get their energy out and spend countless hours swimming or bouncing with their friends. Of course, as a kid you probably aren't aware of what the neighbors think about you bouncing on a trampoline for hours every day, or splashing around loudly in a pool doing cannonballs with your friends. This person didn't want to be a bother, but their neighbor's kids were getting really out of hand with the noise. They tried to be \"patient and accommodating\" of the kids' playtime. But when the children start playing on their water slide bouncy castle at 5 in the morning, the castle blocks a beautiful mountain view, and the water is pouring out of the neighbor's yard, what's a person to do?Well, for u/imthekarn, calling in the HOA was the perfect solution. They aren't always the most helpful bunch, but in a situation like this, sometimes it's the best way to get an impolite neighbor to knock it off with the bad behavior. Next, read about the hilarious suggestions anonymous people submitted for changes in a hospital, like one person who suggested that we should \"allow patients to vote each other off the ward.\"",

You didn't just sleep a full night's sleep because you didn't have an alarm clock ringing early. You actually slept for 16 hours, which is what cats sleep during one day. Congratulations - you're a cat! So please refer to this day as Caturday. from now on.Since you're an eepy sleepy sassy cat you have some big choices to make after that oooooooh, big stretch. Option number 1: You go out there and act as cattest as you can throughout all this weekend. Option number 2: You go back to sleep. You're a cat and no one will tell you that you can't.",

There was \"a media\" and it was rigorously policed. There's simply too much information to be contiguous at this point; it must divide, partition, like a cell. People live in radically different worlds now, and the same information has a different valence in each of them. Engagement, devoid of context or meaning, is the coin of the realm where data has proliferated beyond our ability to meaningfully process it. This is how it came to be that two objectively abhorrent demons and a greasy, grinning mannequin have entered the business of feeding children.",

    "description": "As a general rule, if you're using an RDBMS and can solve your problem using SQL, you should solve your problem using SQL. It's how we avoid doing joins or sorts in our application code, which is always a good thing. But this is a general rule. And Jasmine sends us one where solving the problem as a query was a bad idea. ALTER FUNCTION [dbo].[GetName](@EntityID int) RETURNS varchar(200) AS BEGIN declare @Name varchar(200) select @Name = case E.EntityType when 'Application' then A.ApplicationName when 'Automation' then 'Automated Process' when 'Group' then G.GroupName when 'Organization' then O.OrgName when 'Person' then P.FirstName + ' ' + P.LastName when 'Resource' then R.ResourceName when 'Batch' then B.BatchComment end from Entities E left join AP_Applications A on E.EntityID = A.EntityID left join CN_Groups G on E.EntityID = G.EntityID left join CN_Organizations O on E.EntityID = O.EntityID left join CN_People P on E.EntityID = P.EntityID left join Resources R on E.EntityID = R.EntityID left join AR_PaymentBatches B on E.EntityID = B.EntityID where E.EntityID = @EntityID return @Name END The purpose of this function is to look up the name of an entity. Depending on the kind of entity we're talking about, we have to pull that name from a different table. This is a very common pattern in database normalization- a database equivalent of inheritance. All the common fields to all entities get stored in an Entities table, while specific classes of entity (like \"Applications\") get their own table which joins back to the Entities table. On the surface, this code doesn't even really look like a WTF. By the book, this is really how you'd write this kind of function- if we were going by the book. But the problem was that these tables were frequently very large, and even with indexes on the EntityID fields, it simply performed horribly. And since \"showing the name of the thing you're looking at\" was a common query, that performance hit added up. The fix was easy- write out seven unique functions- one for each entity type- and then re-write this function to use an IF statement to decide which one to execute. The code was simpler to understand and read, and performed much faster. In the end, perhaps not really a WTF, or perhaps the root WTF is some of the architectural decisions which allow this to exist (why a function for getting the name, and the name alone, which means we execute this query independently and not part of a more meaningful join?). But I think it's an interesting example of how \"this is the right way to do it\" can lead to some unusual outcomes.
