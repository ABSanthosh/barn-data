    "description": "No one likes a line cutter. Whether it's at the post office, the DMV, or at a restaurant, there is an expectation of decency when it comes to following the social order of \"first come, first serve.\" Of course, most social phenomena should be questioned, dissected, and reconsidered, but every so often, there is one that makes sense because it's what is fair and equitable for all. This might sound over the top, but the truth of the matter is that waiting in line is most certainly one of those necessary social norms.This continues to apply to coffee shops, which tend to be popular and busy in the mornings as cranky customers are on the hunt for their reason to push forward before they head to work. However, no matter how cranky you are or how desperately you need caffeine injected into your system, the social norms of \"first come, first serve\" are still worth following, unless you want to make enemies like this Karen customer did.",

    "description": "If we had a nickel for every single outlandish thing any of our toxic bosses have ever said to us, we'd probably be able to buy a million-dollar mansion. It's kind of a right of passage for employees, new and old, to get berated by their entitled superiors. Maybe there's something in the water that many bosses drink, but more often than not, you'll be faced with a manager or supervisor who thinks they're a god.So what do you do with all of the sour memories? Well, you can report them to HR. If that fails, you can either escalate the situation to court or even better, rant about them on Reddit for everyone to see and comment on. If the situation can't be remedied, it makes for some solid, yet twisted, entertainment. The employees who wrote about their experiences in this Reddit thread have a lot to say about their bosses' questionable mentorship tactics, but we'll let you be the judge of that.",

If not, stop whatever you're doing, get back into your pajamas, and snuggle up with your nearest cat (or four). If Caturdays are for cat memes and all things feline, then Sundays are for sleeping in and snoozing soundly. And we've got just the sweet kitties you need to inspire a slow, sensual start to your sleepy Sunday.Is there anything more purrfectly peaceful than watching your cat sleep? We'll wait, but we can already tell you that the answer is no. It ignites something in our hoooman hearts that just puts us at ease. Maybe it's seeing something we love feel so safe in the home we built for them, or their sweet tongues sticking out in blissful bleps while they dream. Whatever it is, it makes us want to enjoy the rest of the day from the comfort of our beds. Enjoy these cute kitties and we wish you a pawsitively restful weekend!",

I can already tell this year's columns are going to be filled with my (least) favorite form of WTF, the impossible endless gauntlet of flaming password hurdles to jump over or crawl under. Please comment if you know why this week's column has this title and why it doesn't have the title Swordfish. Peter G. starts off our new year of password maladies with a complaint that is almost poetic. \"Between desire and reality. Between fact and breakfast. Between 8 and -6:00. Madness lies, lies, lies...\"   Rick P. keeps it going. \"Must begin with a capital letter!!!\" he exclaims with three (3!) exclamation points. I think it deserved four.   Mark Whybird justifiably grumbled \"If I knew what the policy was, maybe then I could come up with a password to satisfy it!\"   R3D3-1 who swears he is NOT a bot, found a kind of interestingly complicated error challenge, opining \"Password requirements can be annoying. Especially when they don't tell you what the requirements are, only that you failed. But here they send me a confirmation Email, and only when clicking the confirmation Email did they even tell me! That's kind of a new low there... \"   And finally ending this beginning, faithful Pascal remarks only: \"WTF\". Well said.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Ash's company outsourced to an offshore vendor. This is an example of what they got back: public System.Data.DataSet SetQuotaCellTotal(string sessionId, ArrayOfKeyValueOfintintKeyValueOfintint[] cellData, bool modifyTotalSample) The notable bit in this code is the type ArrayOfKeyValueOfintintKeyValueOfIntint. We're in the world of InternalFrameInternalFrameTitlePaneInternalFrameTitlePaneMaximizeButtonWindowNotFocusedState in terms of names, but this one has the added bonus of being misleading. This type represents a key/value pair. They're both integers. That's it. It's a pair of ints. As a bonus, they're passing an array of key value pairs into the function- an array of ArrayOfKeyValueOfintintKeyValueOfintint. That's a mouthful.
