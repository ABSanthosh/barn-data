    "description": "Parenthood is not easy. We all know that, and cats know it too. Kittens, as independent as they like to pretend they are, have a lot to learn in those beginning stages of life. Kittens have to learn how to drink water without it getting all up in their noses. Kittens have to learn how to communicate effectively, so that they will know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their humans. Kittens need to learn the basics from their parents, so it's no surprise that cat parenthood can be overwhelming to some. And let's not forget just how hyperactive and wiggly and squeaky kittens are in the beginning. You pick them up and they wiggle-jiggle right out of your hand. The chaos starts young with these guys. We know it, but this Maine Coon cat dad… seems to not have gotten the warning. Yeah, you would think that the first meeting between a cat dad and his babies would be wholesome… and it is. It's just hilarious at the same time.",

    "description": "We honestly wish we could tweet about our cat so he could respond. We low-key want to be able to talk to our cat without being met with endless meows that make us think we need to pet him- wait, no, he wants us to pick him up- no, no, no, put him back down immediately- is it a treat that you want?- not this one, okay, okay, we get it- why do you block us from walking?- what do you want?!It'll be so much easier if we could just talk directly to our cat, even through text, and he'll answer. But since this is not the case, with every cat - all cat pawrents turn to share their cats' shenanigans online. We gathered some hilariously accurate cat tweets made by cat pawrents, who we're sure would like to have a real word with their cats as we do, but can't. As we can't. Believe us, if you're a cat pawrent - this bunch of cat tweets is the most relatable it gets out there.",

    "description": "Tech support is a wonderful service for technologically illiterate people. However, this customer got awfully condescending with his valiant over-the-phone hero after getting saved from moronic assumptions. Usually, when someone's there to help you, it's ill-advised to talk down to them. It's an unpopular opinion with all of the Karens and the Kevins out there, but in my mind, a customer service representative wants to get you off the phone with your ticket item concluded and solved faster than you do. And when the expert on the other line is asking probing questions about your technology, they can only assume you at least sort of know what you're talking about—unlike the Boomer in this next story. Caught between the cross-hairs of entitlement and uselessness, this Kevin was unable to identify the difference between an iPad and a laptop, yet blamed his tech support guy for his own shortcomings. Read on for the details of this uncomfortable customer service encounter where a guy makes a fool of himself and has no other way to reset his pride than by leaving a scathing review of his IT guy.",

    "description": "When you're a girl growing up, there's no day more special than a mother-daughter Girl's Day Out. Maybe you go get mani-pedis, maybe you go on a shopping spree, or maybe you just spend a chill day running errands. No matter what, this mother-daughter bonding experience is second to none, and I, for one, wouldn't miss it for the world. One mother had a very special tradition with her daughter for their Girl's Day Out: twice a year, they go to London's West End to see a musical. A perfect way to spend the day, both mother and daughter are lucky to have each other for it. There's one problem this year, though: Mom has a new boyfriend, and he is feeling left out of their plans. He wants to be able to tag along, but Mom stands her ground. Dear reader, I must ask: isn't the point of mother-daughter days to get away from the boys for a minute? If they really wanted to be included, that's why we come home and give them the fashion show after the shopping sprees. Read what this woman has to say to see if she's right to leave her boyfriend out of her Girl's Day Out.",

Or better not published at all?\" A little translation explanation: the list of options provided would in English be \"Public/Protected, Public, Protected, Published, Unpublished\". I have no idea what the differences mean.   And the pièce de résistance from Mark Whybird \"I've always hated click here as a UX antipattern, but Dell have managed to make it even worse.\" Or maybe better?

    "description": "Sammy's company \"jumped on the Ruby on Rails bandwagon since there was one on which to jump\", and are still very much a Rails shop. The company has been around for thirty years, and in that time has seen plenty of ups and downs. During one of those \"ups\", management decided they needed to scale up, both in terms of staffing and in terms of client base- so they hired an offshore team to promote international business and add to their staffing. A \"down\" followed not long after, and the offshore team was disbanded. So Sammy inherited the code. I know I'm generally negative on ORM systems, and that includes Rails, but I want to stress: they're fine if you stay on the happy path. If your data access patterns are simple (which most applications are just basic CRUD!) there's nothing wrong with using an ORM. But if you're doing that, you need to use the ORM. Which is not what the offshore team did. For example: class Request \u003c ActiveRecord::Base def self.get_this_years_request_ids(facility_id) # There are several other methods that are *exactly* the same, except for the year requests = Request.where(\"requests.id in (select t.id from requests as t # what is the purpose of this subquery? where t.unit_id=token_requests.unit_id and t.facility_id=token_requests.facility_id and t.survey_type = '#{TokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE}' # why is SURVEY_TYPE a constant? and EXTRACT( YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM current_timestamp) order by t.id desc) and token_requests.facility_id = #{facility_id.to_i} # so we get all the requests by year, then by by ??? and token_requests.survey_type = '#{Request::SURVEY_TYPE}'\") Comments from Sammy. Now, if we just look at the signature of the method, it seems like this should be a pretty straightforward query: get all of the request IDs for a given facility ID, within a certain time range. And Sammy has helpfully provided a version of this code which does the same thing, but in a more \"using the tools correctly\" way: def self.request_ids_for_year(facility_id,year = Time.now.year) token_requests = TokenRequest.where( :facility_id=\u003efacility_id, :survey_type=\u003eTokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE, :created_at=\u003e(DateTime.new(year.to_i).beginning_of_year .. DateTime.new(year.to_i).end_of_year)) Now, I don't know Ruby well enough to be sure, but the DateTime.new(year.to_i) whiffs a bit of some clumsy date handling, but that may be a perfectly cromulent idiom in Ruby. But this code is pretty clear about what it's doing: finding request objects for a given facility within a given year. Why one uses Request and the other uses TokenRequest is a mystery to me- I' m going to suspect some bad normalization in the database or errors in how Sammy anonymized the code. That's neither here nor there. Once we've gotten our list of requests, we need to process them to output them. Here's how the offshore code converted the list into a comma delimited string, wrapped in parentheses. string_token_request_ids = \"(-1)\" if token_requests \u0026\u0026 token_requests.length \u003e 0 for token_request in token_requests if string_token_request_ids != \"\" string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + \",\" end string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + token_request.id.to_s end string_token_request_ids = \"(\" + string_token_request_ids + \")\" end end end Look, if the problem is to \"join a string with delimiters\" and you write code that looks like this, just delete your hard drive and start over. You need extra help. We start by defaulting to (-1) which is presumably a \"no results\" indicator. But if we have results, we'll iterate across those results. If our result string is non-empty (which it definitely is non-empty), we append a comma (giving us (-1),). Then we append the current token ID, giving us (-1),5, for example. Once we've exhausted all the returned IDs, we wrap the whole thing in parentheses. So, this code is wrong- it's only supposed to return (-1) when there are no results, but as written, it embeds that in the results. Presumably the consuming code is able to handle that error gracefully, since the entire project works. Sammy provides us a more idiomatic (and readable) version of the code which also works correctly: return \"(#{token_requests.count \u003e 0 ? token_requests.map(\u0026:id).join(',') : '(-1)'})\" I'll be honest, I hate the fact that this is returning a stringly-typed list of integers, but since I don't know the context, I'll let that slide. At the very least, this is a better example of what joining a list of values into a string should look like. Sammy writes: It seems these devs never took the time to learn the language. After asking around a bit, I found out they all came from a Java background. Most of this code seems to be from a VB playbook, though. That's a huge and undeserved insult to Visual Basic programmers, Sammy. Even they're not that bad. .comment{border:none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",
