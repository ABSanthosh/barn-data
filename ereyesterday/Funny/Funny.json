But, then and again, it is your day, and you should have it pretty much exactly how you want it. But, even still, you have made somewhat of an obligation to properly feed the people who have gathered together to celebrate you (though there will be wildly different opinions of what \"properly\" is), and there's nothing worse than being left hungry at a wedding due to a lack of food.Still, regardless of how you might feel about the host's choice of food, you can imagine it would be wildly inappropriate to go ahead and usurp the proceedings at a wedding by rolling 20 meaty pizzas through the door of your vegan cousin's wedding before dinner is even properly served.",

    "description": "This grandparent is tired of spending time with their grandkids, but they may have a good reason for why that would be. As much as there's a prevailing stereotype of grandparents being thrilled to spend time with their grandkids, it's just not true for every family. In the beginning, when the kids are little, many grandparents dote on them and want to spend endless amounts of time with them. Some grandparents lavish the kiddos with gifts, while others love taking them to playgrounds or fun community events. Parents tend to love this, too. They can catch a break from the kids knowing that they're safe with their grandparents. This grandparent isn't feeling the love with their own family lately, as they shared to r/AmItheA******. It's one of those stories that no one on the internet can seem to agree upon. Some commenters think that the original poster is hiding something, since they briefly mention an accident that led to them being banned from driving the kids around. Others felt for this grandparent, and told them they weren't in the wrong for wanting to move away from family members who were acting just lukewarm about seeing them. Check the full story out below and decide for yourself! Up next, read about these newlyweds who were dismayed to receive just $3,000 from their wedding guests, because they spent a stunning $60,000 on their wedding, and were hoping to make that money back!",

So far I have managed to avoid getting back into LOL. I’ve been down that road enough times that I know how it ends. Spoiler warning, it ends with me uninstalling the game in a fit of rage.",

    "description": "We think that everyone knows at this point that foxes are just… cat software running on dog hardware. If you think about it for just a few seconds, you will realize that it is true. So, is it really a surprise that cats and foxes are such good friends sometimes, that if their paths cross, they end up getting along? We don't think so. But after such a long time writing for ICHC, we have seen it many times. We have seen cats and foxes play together. We have seen cats groom foxes. We have seen foxes reunite with cats that they grew up with, and it's as emotional as any reunion video we've seen. This duo just kind of makes sense, so coming across this video didn't even surprise us. It did make us aww though. And we're sure it will do the same to you. Because no matter how many times you see it, watching cats and foxes be such good friends is one of the cutest, most wholesomest things in the world.",

    "description": "When \"dog guys\" gather together on the internet, things get… wholesome. You'll see what we mean shortly. Cats are an ideal pet for kids who want a sweet companion and parents who don't want a big lift in responsibilities. Cats are low maintenance, all they need is food, a clean litter box, water, and lots of love. Their charming nature can turn even the most extreme \"dog guy\" into a cat-loving king. And this phenomenon often occurs after dads provide their children with a friendly feline companion. It's no secret why dads nearly always become best friends with the cats they got for their kids or didn't even want to begin with. Get ready for a series of sweet, funny, and downright adorable photos that show just how irresistible a cat can be!",

    "description": "ArSo works at a small company. It's the kind of place that has one software developer, and ArSo isn't it. But ArSo is curious about programming, and has enough of a technical background that small tasks should be achievable. After some conversations with management, an arrangement was made: Kurt, their developer, would identify a few tasks that were suitable for a beginner, and would then take some time to mentor ArSo through completing them. It sounded great, especially because Kurt was going to provide sample code which would give ArSo a head start on getting things done. What better way to learn than by watching a professional at work? DateTime datTmp; File.Copy(strFileOld, strFileNew); // 2 seconds delay datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); File.Delete(strFileOld); This code copies a file from an old path to a new path, and then deletes the old path after a two second delay. Why is there a delay? I don't know. Why is the delay written like this? I can't possibly explain that. Check the time at the start of the loop. When the second part of that time stops matching the second part of the current time, we assume one second has passed. This is, of course, inaccurate- if I check the time at 0:00:00.9999 a lot less than a second will pass. This delay is at most one second. In any case, ArSo has some serious questions about Kurt's mentorship, and writes: Now I don't know if I should ask for more coding tasks. Honestly, I think you should ask for more. Like, I think you should just take Kurt's job. You may be a beginner, but honestly, you're likely going to do a better job than this.

    "description": "Alicia recently inherited a whole suite of home-grown enterprise applications. Like a lot of these kinds of systems, it needs to do batch processing. She went tracking down a mysterious IllegalStateException only to find this query causing the problem: select * from data_import where id \u003e 10000 The query itself is fine, but the code calling it checks to see if this query returned any rows- if it did, the code throws the IllegalStateException. First, of course, this should be a COUNT(*) query- no need to actually return rows here. But also… what? Why do we fail if there are any transactions with an ID greater than 10000? Why on Earth would we care? Well, the next query it runs is this: update data_import set id=id+10000 Oh. Oh no. Oh nooooo. Are they… are they using the ID to also represent some state information about the status of the record? It sure seems like it! The program then starts INSERTing data, using a counter which starts at 1. Once all the new data is added, the program then does: delete from data_import where id \u003e 10000 All this is done within a single method, with no transactions and no error handling. And yes, this is by design. You see, if anything goes wrong during the inserts, then the old records don't get deleted, so we can see that processing failed and correct it. And since the IDs are sequential and always start at 1, we can easily find which row caused the problem. Who needs logging or any sort of exception handling- just check your IDs. The underlying reason why this started failing was because the inbound data started trying to add more than 10,000 rows, which meant the INSERTs started failing (since we already had rows there for this). Alicia wanted to fix this and clean up the process, but too many things depended on it working in this broken fashion. Instead, her boss implemented a quick and easy fix: they changed \"10000\" to \"100000\". [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
