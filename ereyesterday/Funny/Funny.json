    "description": "The real estate market is always so crazy. The ups and downs are always all over the place. So many people, these days, tend to rent. These guys are called tenants and they have a landlord they have to pay every month. Usually the landlord is the homeowner. And sometimes these landlords can be greedy and lazy—they want the most passive income they can get with the least amount of effort put in. So they hire a property management company that takes care of their homes for them! Sometimes this can be great news and you get a very helpful management company. Sometimes, you get a shady one that is just as greedy and lazy as the landlord. This is when rent skyrockets for houses that feel like they're already one foot in the grave. Usually, when you get a bad management company, that means there is something shady going on within its own ranks. Take this employee, for example—he worked at a property management company and immediately was able to sniff out that his higher ups weren't doing the right thing.",

    "description": "There is a downside to revealing too much about your personal life to your coworkers. Obviously, keeping everything about your life outside of work private is unrealistic. After all, these are the people with whom you spend a considerable amount of time every week. The truth is going to come out regarding basic life details like what neighborhood you live in, where you're originally from, and notably, your dating status.I always worry when I hear about how much some of my friends reveal to their coworkers about their relationships, from details about breakups to every little argument. While it's weird to be too secretive, it's definitely more unhealthy to be too open. Plus, telling your coworkers everything can backfire fairly quickly. For this server, he made the mistake of revealing his newfound single status to his older coworker. Now, she started assuming that whenever she needed a shift covered, he would be free because it's not like he has anyone to come home to at the end of the day. This, of course, says a lot more about the coworker's warped worldview than anything else. Why should being single matter, and why should his free time be less valuable as a single person? Thankfully, the author behind this tale was not willing to let his coworker walk all over him.",

Whether you're a proud Hufflepurr, a noble Gryffinpaw, a cunning Slythenyan, or a wise Ravenclaw, every true Hogwarts student knows the real magical creatures are the cats prowling the castle corridors like they own the place (they do, obviously).These wizardly feline memes are for anyone who's ever looked at a cat and thought, \"Yes, that's clearly an Animagus who just couldn't be bothered to change back\". Or for anyone whose familiar refuses to be summoned unless snacks are involved. Honestly, Minerva McGonagall would be proud of this lineup - Transfiguration students, take notes.From floofs guarding the Room of Requirement to tabbies practicing their Patronus (spoiler: it's also a cat), these memes are full of hissterical Hogwarts energy. So grab your butterbeer, curl up in the common room, and enjoy these magical meowments. Mischief managed? Hardly - the feline chaos is just getting started.Fluff. Chaos. Drama!

If you really cared about the cat, you would want what is best for it, and we all know how disruptive it can be to continually move a cat around to new homes.This is why we say this (almost every time) - cats are a 15-20 year commitment. In the purrfect scenario, your cat survives to be a sweet, soft senior cat who just cuddles and sleeps all day. But if something happens and you and your cat have to be separated for some reason, prepurr to say goodbye, unless it's for a short amount of time.

    "description": "Adam's organization was going through a period of rapid growth. Part of this growth was spinning up new backend services to support new functionality. The growth would have been extremely fast, except for one thing applying back pressure: for some reason, spinning up a new service meant recompiling and redeploying all the other services. Adam didn't understand why, but it seemed like an obvious place to start poking at something for improvement. All of the services depended on a library called \"ServiceLib\"- though not all of them actually used the library. The library was a set of utilities for administering, detecting, and interacting with services in their environment- essentially a homegrown fabric/bus architecture. It didn't take long, looking at the source control history, to understand why there was a rebuild after the release of every service. Each service triggered a one line change in this: enum class Services { IniTechBase = 103, IniTechAdvanced = 99, IniTechFooServer = 102, … } Each service had a unique, numerical identifier, and this mapped them into an enumerated type. Adam went to the tech lead, Raymond. \"Hey, I've got an idea for speeding up our release process- we should stop hard coding the service IDs in ServiceLib.\" Raymond looked at Adam like one might examine an over-enthusiastic lemur. \"They're not hard-coded. We store them in an enum.\" Eventually Raymond got promoted- for all of their heroic work on managing this rapidly expanding library of services. The new tech lead who came on was much more amenable to \"not storing rapidly changing service IDs in an enum\", and \"not making every service depend on a library they often don't need\", and \"putting admin functionality in every service because they're linked to that library whether they like it or not.\" Eventually, ServiceLib became its own service, and actually helped- instead of hindered- delivering new functionality. Unfortunately, with no more highly visible heroics to deliver functionality, the entire department became a career dead end. Sure, they delivered on time and under budget consistently, but there were no rockstar developers like Raymond on the team anymore, the real up-and-comers who were pushing themselves.
