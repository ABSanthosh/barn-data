    "description": "One of the best parts of working in an office is developing a work crush. It's an easy thing to do: you see these people every day for most of the day, so there's bound to be someone you have a connection. Having a crush makes going to work all the more worth it. It helps get you up in the morning; it gets you excited to be there. It may even make you more productive! A harmless work crush is the backbone of a working society, and without it, well, work wouldn't be worth doing.A work crush gets complicated when it starts to get too real. Dating in the workplace is unbelievably messy, and on top of the general work stress, it's not worth it to have the added stress of getting your feelings hurt. If all of a sudden you start to have real feelings for this person, or it gets in the way of you being able to do real work, you may need to take a step back. That's what one guy tried to do when his work crush said she didn't feel similarly, but things got weird when she started sending mixed messages. So, was this guy right to get HR involved? Or was this one to shove under the rug?",

    "description": "I'm curious to know: is it okay to buy flowers for your ex (and mother of your child) on Valentine's Day? This poor person did exactly that, but their new GF is upset about it, and they're receiving mixed advice about the situation. Parents who remain friendly after a divorce are doing their best for the kids. It's in the children's best interest to see their parents getting along amicably instead of squabbling all the time. But it can also be tricky for parents to navigate the new family dynamics. There are bound to be awkward moments as the parents move forward with their lives and start fresh relationships. This parent found that out first hand on Valentine's Day, after a gesture of goodwill threw his new girlfriend for a loop.Although this dude seems to have had good intentions, he just didn't really think through the consequences of what he was doing. As commenters lightly scolded them, it was a good reminder to prioritize the new GF, instead of focusing on the past. The parent has a big heart, and next Valentine's Day, I bet they'll get everything right for all three women in their life: daughter, girlfriend, and ex/child's mother. Next, check out some of these unbelievable baking mistakes fresh from the oven, like one person who admitted, \"We call this the 'cookie soup' incident.\"",

We could identify them if you blindfolded us, spun us around ten times, and then put us in a room filled with 100 other cats. We like to think we could, anyway. But in reality, if you put one of our cats next to one of their siblings, we might not be able to tell them apart if it were a real expurriment.In the thread below, you'll meet a feline pawrent and the cute cat they adopted. They went in knowing exactly which cat they wanted, and left with what they thought was their cat. Fast forward 1.5 meowgnificent years of love and care, and after looking through some old photos, they realized that their cat looked different than the pictures at the rescue shelter! What a cat-astrophe! Scroll down to read the full story below and figure out what caused this meowrvelous mixup.",

    "description": "Well, feline fans, yet another Valentine's Day has arrived and we're still choosing our cats as our dates. It's okay, we actually prefurr it. Cats are way better than hoomans anyway. Sure, they may wake us up at 5 AM every day to feed them, but they don't text us for days and then randomly ghost us, or tell us that they \"don't eat vegetables because vegetables are for women.\" No, our cats are there for us when we're feeling down, when we're happy, and are actually way better cuddlers than any of the hoomans we've met.So this year, we're skipping the Valentine's Day drama by staying in and scrolling through some pawsitively hissterical cat posts instead. It's us on the couch with our cats, a pizza, and reruns of our current favorite binge-watch. It's better than getting all dressed up and braving the winter weather, just to be disappointed a few hours later. If you've read this far, we prrrobably didn't even need to convince you anyway. Enjoy!",

    "description": "Eric writes: Yes, we actually do have code reviews and testing practices. A version of this code was tested successfully prior to this version being merged in, somehow. Well, that's ominous. Let's look at the code. public static SqsClient create() { try { SqsClient sqsClient = SqsClient.builder() ... .build(); return sqsClient; } catch (Exception e) { log.error(\"SQS - exception creating sqs client\", e); } finally { // Uncomment this to test the sqs in a test environment // return SqsClient.builder(). ... .build(); return null; } } Eric found this when he discovered that the application wasn't sending messages to their queue. According to the logs, there were messages to send, they just weren't being sent. Eric made the mistake of looking for log messages around sending messages, when instead he should have been looking at module startup, where the error message above appeared. This code attempts to create a connection, and if it fails for any reason, it logs an error and returns null. With a delightful \"comment this out\" for running in the test environment, which, please, god no. Don't do configuration management by commenting out lines of code. Honestly, that's the worst thing in this code, to me. In any case, the calling code \"properly\" handled nulls by just disabling sending to the queue silently, which made this harder to debug than it needed to be. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
