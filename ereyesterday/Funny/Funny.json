As it turns out, she was not willing to cut her new neighbor—a mother of 3-under-3—any slack for her screaming kids. Interestingly enough, the reception of this story was polarized, claiming both sides were in the wrong, but I'll leave you to be the judge of that.",

So when he failed to do so, his coworker was forced to take action herself, teaching the little girl some manners in the workplace because her father didn't bother to.",

There are plenty of people who go out of their way to help and feed stray cats, but do you know of any people who feed outcast lions? We certainly don't. But that's what makes Ginger's story below so special. Ginger was the world's oldest recorded lion, who lived to a purrfectly remarkable age of 17 years in the wild. For reference, most don't live past 10.But Ginger's story isn't just about his age. He was cast out of his pride and lived solo for years, until one day, he approached a pride of lions, led by his sons. He arrived to them nearly blind, his teeth filed down by time, and his face filled with memories of his long life - and yet, they accepted him back into their pride. He did his time and earned their respect, which is one of the hardest things to come by in the animal kingdom. Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -  subscribe here.",

Whether it's a silly habit, a comforting purr, or the way they ruled your home like royalty - cats leave a mark. Years later, we might still talk about them or feel a lump in our throat when we hear their name. That's not weird - it's love. The kind of love that doesn't fade just because the whiskers do.But there's remembering a beloved cat… and then there's using that memory to quietly override others' boundaries. When someone holds onto a cat's legacy in secretive, shady ways, especially without honesty or context, that's not sweet, it's disrespectful. To the cat, whose story deserves transparency. To the people around them, who deserve the truth. And in this story? The person didn't even admit they were honoring the cat. They just… kept quiet. That says a lot.Fluff. Chaos. Drama!

    "description": "Misha has a co-worker who has unusual ideas about how database performance works. This co-worker, Ted, has a vague understanding that a SQL query optimizer will attempt to find the best execution path for a given query. Unfortunately, Ted has just enough knowledge to be dangerous; he believes that the job of a developer is to write SQL queries that will \"trick\" the optimizer into doing an even better job, somehow. This means that Ted loves subqueries. For example, let's say you had a table called tbl_updater, which is used to store pending changes for a batch operation that will later get applied. Each change in updater has a unique change key that identifies it. For reasons best not looked into too deeply, at some point in the lifecycle of a record in this table, the application needs to null out several key fields based on the change value. If you or I were writing this, we might do something like this: update tbl_updater set id = null, date = null, location = null, type = null, type_id = null where change = @change And this is how you know that you and I are fools, because we didn't use a single subquery. update tbl_updater set id = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set date = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set location = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set type = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set date = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set type_id = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) So here, Ted uses where updater in (subquery) which is certainly annoying and awkward, given that we know that change is a unique key. Maybe Ted didn't know that? Of course, one of the great powers of relational databases is that they offer data dictionaries so you can review the structure of tables before writing queries, so it's very easy to find out that the key is unique. But that simple ignorance doesn't explain why Ted broke it out into multiple updates. If insanity is doing the same thing again and again expecting different results, what does it mean when you actually do get different results but also could have just done all this once?
