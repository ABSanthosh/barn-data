    "description": "Remember when you were little and you would fake sick to get out of going to school? You would sneak a heating pad on your forehead, or put it close to your lamp. You'd wail and moan about your stomach hurting. You'd fake some coughing and sneezing. And maybe if you were really good, you'd fake some upchucking. It was truly an art form. It's always been looked down upon from your educators, parents, and other authority figures. But little did they know, you could use that talent when you got older—especially, if you went into the medical field.  You can see faking sick as a kid coming in handy with this Reddit thread! A healthcare professional who worked for the military did some medical work on the side, which was totally acceptable. He would submit leave and take a day to get some extra cash. Smart, really. However, this time he had a new first sergeant that didn't like his \"moonlighting\" work. So when he submitted to get a day of leave so he could go make some good money, he was denied. Unjustly, according to him! So, instead of taking the L, he put his medical expertise to work…",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what your conversations would sound like if you were completely honest with the person standing in front of you? Or even how the world would look like if people truly spoke up and said what is on their minds?There are several funny skits online, and even an iconic movie about a world in which people cannot lie, and always tell the truth to each other. All to show just how easy, and slightly chaotic, the world could look like if we were all just a little bit more honest and open.However realistically, we do not live in a world where people simply say whatever they want. There are etiquettes and social rules in place, that are here to ensure we do not embarrass ourselves and others when we engage in conversation. Whether we're talking to colleagues, friends, family, or even hiring managers, there are some things you should keep to yourselves, even if it sounds extremely freeing to let it all go and speak your mind.",

    "description": "Hello, cat pawrents and general feline fanatic fans! We all need some sweet cat wholesomeness in our lives. But not only because you're already a feline fan, or only because you already have a sweet feline friend at home (reigning over your home, let's be honest). No, we're saying that because we think it's true for every hooman out there. Every person can benefit from a cat's purrs and pets, from their loving gazes and soft fur, and from their wholesome and cute demeanor. Cats are just so delightful and so adorable, and we really think a cat's love can heal a lot.But what happens if you don't have that cat right next to you? Well, that's where wholesome cat memes come in. We gathered some sweet and cute cat memes so we can all enjoy them - even if you're a cat pawrent who already has a fluffy friend at home, even if you're a feline fanatic fan who adores cats' adorableness, and even if you're just a person who wants to see what's all the fuss about.",

Seeing things like dad cats meeting their kittens for the first time, laughing at cat moms being overwhelmed by the realities of parenthood, seeing momma cats raise babies from different litters together as if they are their own, or seeing kitty siblings be just like human siblings and drive each other up the wall… we love it. It humanizes cats for us, and for others as well, we think, and with all the people out there who don't see cats as something to care for, we think that stories like these are important. And yet, even with all of the stories that we have seen about cat families, we don't think that we have ever seen three generations of cats in the same place. Kittens, a mom, and the most grandma-looking grandma cat that you have ever seen in your lives. And this Maine Coon grandma is about to meet her grand-kittens for the first time.",

    "description": "If you could watch a pringle instead of eat one, just look at it and absorb it, that's essentially Love is Blind. The show is Certifiable, definition 2. It's a dating show in its molecular form, it's clearly been designed by certified (definition 1) psychiatric experts to perforate human beings, to peel them like an onion. Its structure is something like a rocket - there's a Booster Phase where the participants can't see each other, and the participants wade through waist-high gossip to and from the little chambers they make them sit in. Then, once that phase balls into the atmosphere, they get fucking engaged with these people they've never seen before and this goes all the ways you think. You gotta meet a woman's dad who hates you and hates the show and thinks it's a mockery of the society they grew up in. Then you see if any of those people actually go through with it. Then they do an episode where they get all those people later and put them in the same room! Heavy sheets of plastic are laid down and stapled to the walls because three to four people get murdered in this episode, on average.",

Even a UUIDv4, which is just a random number, presents challenges: doing randomness correctly is hard, and certain bits within the UUID are reserved for metadata about what kind of UUID we're generating. But Gretchen's co-worker didn't reach for a library. What they did reach for was… regular expressions? function uuidv4() { return \"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\".replace(/[xy]/g, function (c) { var r = (Math.random() * 16) | 0, v = c == \"x\" ? r : (r \u0026 0x3) | 0x8; return v.toString(16); }); } At a glance, this appears to be a riff on common answers on Stack Overflow. I won't pick on this code for not using crypto.randomUUID, the browser function for doing this, as that function only started showing up in browsers in 2021. But using a format string and filling it with random data instead of generating your 128-bits as a Uint8Buffer is less forgivable. This solution to generating UUIDs makes a common mistake: confusing the representation of the data with the reality of the data. A UUID is 128-bits of numerical data, with a few bits reserved for identification (annoyingly, how many bits are reserved depends on which format we're talking about). We render it as the dash-separated-hex-string, but it is not a dash-separated-hex-string. In the end, this code does work. Awkwardly and inefficiently and with a high probability of collisions due to bad randomness, but it works. I just hate it.

    "description": "We like trains here at Error'd, and you all seem to like trains too. That must be the main reason we get so many submissions about broken information systems. \"Pass,\" said Jozsef . I think that train might have crashed already.   An anonymous subscriber shared an epic tale some time ago. They explained thus. \"(I couldn't capture in the photo, but the next station after Duivendrecht was showing the time of 09:24+1.) We know Europe has pretty good trains, and even some high-speed lines. But this was the first time I boarded a time-traveling train. At first I was annoyed to be 47 minutes late. I thought I could easily walk from Amsterdam Centraal to Muiderpoort in less than the 53 minutes that this train would take. But I was relieved to know the trip to the further stations was going to be quicker, and I would arrive there even before arriving at the earlier stations.\" I think the explanation here is that this train is currently expected to arrive at Muiderport around 10:01. But it's still projected to arrive at the following stop at 9:46, and more surprisingly at the successive stops at 9:35 and 9:25.   Railfan Richard B. recently shared \"Points failure on the West Coast Main Line has disrupted the linear nature of time.\"   and quite some time ago, he also sent us this snap, singing \"That train that's bound for glory? It runs through here.\"   An unrelated David B. wonders \"When is the next train? We don't know, it's running incognito.\"   And finally, courageous Ivan got sideways underground. \"Copenhagen subway system may have fully automated trains, but their informational screens need a little manual help every now and then.\"   [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
