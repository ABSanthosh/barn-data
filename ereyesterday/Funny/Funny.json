    "title": "CodeSOD: Format Identified",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/format-identified",
    "description": "Many nations have some form of national identification number, especially around taxes. Argentina is no exception. Their \"CUIT\" (Clave Única de Identificación Tributaria) and \"CUIL\" (Código Único de Identificación Laboral) are formatted as \"##-########-#\". Now, as datasets often don't store things in their canonical representation, Nick's co-worker was given a task: \"given a list of numbers, reformat them to look like CUIT/CUIL. That co-worker went off for five days, and produced this Java function. public String normalizarCuitCuil(String cuitCuilOrigen){ String valorNormalizado = new String(); if (cuitCuilOrigen == null || \"\".equals(cuitCuilOrigen) || cuitCuilOrigen.length() \u003c MINIMA_CANTIDAD_ACEPTADA_DE_CARACTERES_PARA_NORMALIZAR){ valorNormalizado = \"\"; }else{ StringBuilder numerosDelCuitCuil = new StringBuilder(13); cuitCuilOrigen = cuitCuilOrigen.trim(); // Se obtienen solo los números: Matcher buscadorDePatron = patternNumeros.matcher(cuitCuilOrigen); while (buscadorDePatron.find()){ numerosDelCuitCuil.append(buscadorDePatron.group()); } // Se le agregan los guiones: valorNormalizado = numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().substring(0,2) + \"-\" + numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().substring(2,numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().length()-1) + \"-\" + numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().substring(numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().length()-1, numerosDelCuitCuil.toString().length()); } return valorNormalizado; } We start with a basic sanity check that the string exists and is long enough. If it isn't, we return an empty string, which already annoys me, because an empty result is not a good way to communicate \"I failed to parse\". But assuming we have data, we construct a string builder and trim whitespace. And already we have a problem: we already validated that the string was long enough, but if the string contained more trailing whitespace than a newline, we're looking at a problem. Now, maybe we can assume the data is good, but the next line implies that we can't rely on that- they create a regex matcher to identify numeric values, and for each numeric value they find, they append it to our StringBuilder. This implies that the string may contain non-numeric values which need to be rejected, which means our length validation was still wrong. So either the data is clean and we're overvalidating, or the data is dirty and we're validating in the wrong order. But all of that's a preamble to a terrible abuse of string builders, where they discard all the advantages of using a StringBuilder by calling toString again and again and again. Now, maybe the function caches results or the compiler can optimize it, but the result is a particularly unreadable blob of slicing code. Now, this is ugly, but at least it works, assuming the input data is good. It definitely should never pass a code review, but it's not the kind of bad code that leaves one waking up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat. No, what gets me about this is that it took five days to write. And according to Nick, the responsible developer wasn't just slacking off or going to meetings the whole time, they were at their desk poking at their Java IDE and looking confused for all five days. And of course, because it took so long to write the feature, management didn't want to waste more time on kicking it back via a code review. So voila: it got forced through and released to production since it passed testing. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Our anonymous submitter, whom we'll call Craig, worked for GlobalCon. GlobalCon relied on an offshore team on the other side of the world for adding/removing users from the system, support calls, ticket tracking, and other client services. One day at work, an urgent escalated ticket from Martin, the offshore support team lead, fell into Craig's queue. Seated before his cubicle workstation, Craig opened the ticket right away: The new GlobalCon support website is not working. Appears to have been taken over by ChatGPT. The entire support team is blocked by this. Instead of feeling any sense of urgency, Craig snorted out loud from perverse amusement. \"What was that now?\" The voice of Nellie, his coworker, wafted over the cubicle wall that separated them. \"Urgent ticket from the offshore team,\" Craig replied. \"What is it this time?\" Nellie couldn't suppress her glee. \"They're dead in the water because the new support page was, quote, taken over by ChatGPT.\" Nellie laughed out loud. \"Hey! I know humor is important to surviving this job.\" A level, more mature voice piped up behind Craig from the cube across from his. It belonged to Dana, his manager. \"But it really is urgent if they're all blocked. Do your best to help, escalate to me if you get stuck.\" \"OK, thanks. I got this,\" Craig assured her. He was already 99.999% certain that no part of their web domain had gone down or been conquered by a belligerent AI, or else he would've heard of it by now. To make sure, Craig opened support.globalcon.com in a browser tab: sure enough, it worked. Martin had supplied no further detail, no logs or screenshots or videos, and no steps to reproduce, which was sadly typical of most of these escalations. At a loss, Craig took a screenshot of the webpage, opened the ticket, and posted the following: Everything's fine on this end. If it's still not working for you, let's do a screenshare. Granted, a screensharing session was less than ideal given the 12-hour time difference. Craig hoped that whatever nefarious shenanigans ChatGPT had allegedly committed were resolved by now. The next day, Craig received an update. Still not working. The entire team is still blocked. We're too busy to do a screenshare, please resolve ASAP. Craig checked the website again with both laptop and phone. He had other people visit the website for him, trying different operating systems and web browsers. Every combination worked. Two things mystified him: how was the entire offshore team having this issue, and how were they \"too busy\" for anything if they were all dead in the water? At a loss, Craig attached an updated screenshot to the ticket and typed out the best CYA response he could muster. The new support website is up and has never experienced any issues. With no further proof or steps to reproduce this, I don't know what to tell you. I think a screensharing session would be the best thing at this point. The next day, Martin parroted his last message almost word for word, except this time he assented to a screensharing session, suggesting the next morning for himself. It was deep into the evening when Craig set up his work laptop on his kitchen counter and started a call and session for Martin to join. \"OK. Can you show me what you guys are trying to do?\" To his surprise, he watched Martin open up Microsoft Teams first thing. From there, Martin accessed a chat to the entire offshore support team from the CPO of GlobalCon. The message proudly introduced the new support website and outlined the steps for accessing it. One of those steps was to visit support.globalcon.com. The web address was rendered as blue outlined text, a hyperlink. Craig observed Martin clicking the link. A web browser opened up. Lo and behold, the page that finally appeared was www.chatgpt.com. Craig blinked with surprise. \"Hang on! I'm gonna take over for a second.\" Upon taking control of the session, Craig switched back to Teams and accessed the link's details. The link text was correct, but the link destination was ChatGPT. It seemed like a copy/paste error that the CPO had tried to fix, not realizing that they'd needed to do more than simply update the link text. \"This looks like a bad link,\" Craig said. \"It got sent to your entire team. And all of you have been trying to access the support site with this link?\" \"Correct,\" Martin replied. Craig was glad he couldn't be seen frowning and shaking his head. \"Lemme show you what I've been doing. Then you can show everyone else, OK?\" After surrendering control of the session, Craig patiently walked Martin through the steps of opening a web browser, typing support.globalcon.com into the header, and hitting Return. The site opened without any issue. From there, Craig taught Martin how to create a bookmark for it. \"Just click on that from now on, and it'll always take you to the right place,\" Craig said. \"In the future, before you click on any hyperlink, make sure you hover your mouse over it to see where it actually goes. Links can be labeled one thing when they actually take you somewhere else. That's how phishing works.\" \"Oh,\" Martin said. \"Thanks!\" The call ended on a positive note, but left Craig marveling at the irony of lecturing the tech support lead on Internet 101 in the dead of night.

    "description": "When you're a poorly behaved 4-year-old, on the one hand, you're only 4 years old, so you can't really expect to understand the difference between good behavior and right and wrong. But, on the other hand, your parents should be teaching you those things and certainly not encouraging them by giving in to your tiny-fisted, screaming, and crying demands.While no one wants to be \"that person\" and tell someone how to parent their children, and while some children are just uncharacteristically difficult to manage, it's pretty apparent when you have someone in your life who is doing everything wrong. If you have someone like this in your life, then you know exactly what this is like and are probably silently nodding or shaking your head to yourself at this very moment… If you're helping this person with their children, without any form of payment for your time and services nonetheless, it doesn't matter how close you are, if they refuse to work on the things that aren't working for you then by all means you have the right to remove yourself from that situation, which is exactly what this aunt did after she had been babysitting her spolied and destructive nephew in her own home with his parents refusing to recognize or work on any issue.",

    "description": "When it comes to the service industry, there are a lot of different working mechanisms that keep the establishment rolling. It's not just the cooks and the servers. There is also the host, busser, food runner, dishwashers, to-go station, manager, etc. You see? It takes an army to provide exceptional service to all those who deserve it and even those who don't—I'm looking at you, Karen! So, when you are working at a restaurant, it's important to respect every single role equally. Sure, Chef might act like he's the only one working there, but he really is nothing without his entire team: Front AND back of house.  When you end up working in the service industry and you have even one incompetent co-worker, it messes everything up and then everyone is in a bad mood. Everyone has to do their job, and have to do it well! So when this co-worker at this restaurant/movie theater was slacking, his fellow dishwashers had it…",

    "description": "This story, friends, is why we keep telling everyone that, one day, we will end up on the news for trying to pet something that we shouldn't. Because there is no way that we would not have tried making friends with this puma. And it's not our fault that we want to do this! Not totally… It's just that we keep seeing videos of people cuddling with cheetahs, and people hanging out with lions, and of people adopting rescued black panthers, and it just means… that it's pawssible to be friends with big cats. It's pawssible. This story is an oldie but goodie that re-popped up on the internet recently and for good reason. Because although you wouldn't think that a cougar breaking into someone's house would be cute, it totally was. No one was hurt, and the puma, more than anything, was interested in being the cat that she is and destroying some blinds. Because that's what cats do, no matter what size they are.   Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "We don't know how we're going to have hooman children one day if we can barely keep our heads on straight with our feline ones. Seriously. Last week one of our cats all but stopped eating for a few days, so we took her to the vet to see if something was wrong. $400 later, the vet told us she just has a tummy-ache from eating too quickly. As soon as we got home, she started eating again and then attempted to climb to the top of the curtains. We think it's safe to say she's feeling better.This is a purrfectly calm story compared to the night these pawrents had. They spent a sleepless (and very expensive) night at the emergency vet after their orange brain-cell-less goober cat decided to chomp down on mom's cross-stitching needle. But luckily, thanks to the quick actions of mom and dad, this ginger goofball is back to being as healthy as a horse.

Also, like… my dad woke up at three in the morning to go fishing, according to some Naiad Lore whose provenance was never fully explained to me. Also, you had to be quiet in a boat for about a thousand years. Reader, let me tell you: it was a task at which I did not excel. Gabriel was a disappointment also but time heals all wounds.",
