    "description": "The terms of relationships aren't drawn out on a piece of paper—well, there are marriage licenses, but they're unique in that fact. Even still, signing your names and such on a little piece of paper, while legally significant, does little else to define the relationship outside of the nature of the commitment.Relationships need to bloom and blossom naturally, you can't just command them to be so. They're formed through shared experiences of both joy and hardship, forging a bond that cannot be broken.It's always hard bringing two different groups of people together, there's a reason there are so many memes and jokes about how much it makes you sweat to introduce two different friend groups to each other. And with families, of course, this is even far more extreme with it being a much more intimate and close knit type of relationship.",

    "description": "Look, generally speaking, we are not fans of people having wild cats like these as pets. It's a bad idea for a bunch of reasons, but most of all, it's often not good for the cats. There are some exceptions though. Sometimes, when animals cannot be returned back into the wild, we might be their best hope for a good life. Like for the rescued bobcat who fell on its head as a kitten. It couldn't be re-released, but now, we know that his favorite toy is fennel. Or the rescued black panther who was rejected as a cub and got very sick. Now, he has a Rottweiler best friend and is living an awesome life. Or the mountain lion who was injured and could not go back into the wild who now has a loving family and a second chance at happiness. The two Serval kittens in this video were in a similar situation. Unfortunately, their momma rejected them as babies, and if not for these kind people rescuing them, we don't know what their fates would have been. What we do know is that now, they are happy, and that is what really matters.",

    "description": "One of our favorite things about cats is that each and every one of them is unique. Black cats are meowgical. They are agents of darkness. They cause mischief like no one else. Ginger cats have one braincell to share between all of them, and although most days, they will just be silly little dudes and dudettes, sometimes, they will blind you with their brilliance. Sphynx cats look like angry old men, and they act like it as well. Don't ask us to explain how. They just do. So, what happens if you take these colors and mix them up? What happens if you throw some brown onto a black cat? What happens if a cat is born a chimera - half black and half ginger? We don't know exactly what happens, but we do know that these unique and rare cats are incredibly beautiful and intriguing. So, we have put together a list of some of the coolest, rarest cats that we have ever seen, and really, it's anyone's guess how much chaos they cause on a daily basis, but we would bet that it's a whole lot.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/too-many-red-flags",
    "description": "Fresh out of university, Remco accepted a job that allowed him to relocate to a different country. While entering the workforce for the first time, he was also adjusting to a new home and culture, which is probably why the red flags didn't look quite so red. The trouble had actually begun during his interview. While being questioned about his own abilities, Remco learned about Conglomcorp's healthy financial position, backed by a large list of clients. Everything seemed perfect, but Remco had a bad gut feeling he could neither explain nor shake off. Being young and desperate for a job, he ignored his misgivings and accepted the position. He hadn't yet learned how scarily accurate intuition often proves to be. The second red flag was run up the mast at orientation. While teaching him about the company's history, one of the senior managers proudly mentioned that Conglomcorp had recently fired 50% of their workforce, and were still doing great. This left Remco feeling more concerned than impressed, but he couldn't reverse course now. Flag number three waved during onboarding, as Remco began to learn about the Java application he would be helping to develop. He'd been sitting at the cubicle of Lars, a senior developer, watching over his shoulder as Lars familiarized him with the application's UI. \"Garbage Collection.\" Using his mouse, Lars circled a button in the interface labeled just that. \"We added this to solve a bug some users were experiencing. Now we just tell everyone that if they notice any weird behavior in the application, they should click this button.\" Remco frowned. \"What happens in the code when you click that?\" \"It calls System.gc().\" But that wasn't even guaranteed to run! The Java virtual machine handled its own garbage collection. And in no universe did you want to put a worse-than-useless button in your UI and manipulate clients into thinking it did something. But Remco didn't feel confident enough to speak his mind. He kept silent and soldiered on. When Remco was granted access to the codebase, it got worse. The whole thing was a pile of spaghetti full of similar design brillance that mostly worked well enough to satisfy clients, although there was a host of bugs in the bug tracker, some of which had been rotting there for over 7 years. Remco had been given the unenviable task of fixing the oldest ones. Remco slogged through another few months. Eventually, he was tasked with implementing a new feature that was supposed to be similar to existing features already in the application. He checked these other features to see how they were coded, intending to follow the same pattern. As it turned out, each and every one of them had been implemented in a different, weird way. The wheel had been reinvented over and over, and none of the implementations looked like anything he ought to be imitating. Flummoxed, Remco approached Lars' cubicle and explained his findings. \"How should I proceed?\" he finally asked. Lars shrugged, and looked up from a running instance of the application. \"I don't know.\" Lars turned back to his screen and pushed \"Garbage Collect\". Fairly soon after that enlightening experience, Remco moved on. Conglomcorp is still going, though whether they've retained their garbage collection button is anyone's guess.

Rudi A. reported this Errord, chortling \"Time flies when you're having fun, but it goes back when you're walking along the IJ river!\" Is the point here that the walking time is quoted as 77 minutes total, but the overall travel time is less than that? I must say I don't recommend swimming the Ij in March, Rudi.   I had to go back quite a while for this submission from faithful reader Adam R., who chimed \"I found a new type of datetime handling failure in this timestamp of 12:8 PM when checking my past payments at my medical provider.\" I hope he's still with us.   Literary critic Jay commented \"Going back in time to be able to update your work after it gets published but before everyone else in your same space time fabric gets to see your mistakes, that's privilege.\" This kind of error is usually an artifact of Daylight Saving Time, but it's a day too late.   Lucky Luke H. can take his time with this deal. \"The board is proud to approve a 20% discount for the next 8 millenia,\" he crowed.   At nearly the other end of the entire modern era, Carlos found himself with a nostalgic device. \"Excel crashed. When it came back, it did so showing this update banner.\" Some programmer confused \"restore state\" with the English Restoration. Not that state, bub.   [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
