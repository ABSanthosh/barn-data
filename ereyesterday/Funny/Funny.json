    "description": "When you come from a family with a lot of grief and strife, there's often a ton of finger-pointing and random blaming. Some people can't own up to their own misgivings, so they try to make up a story to explain their actions without them being at fault. Other times, people are ready to come clean about their actions, but the hurt is too far embedded that no apology could revoke the damage done. There are also a lot of complicated feelings caught up in family drama. You love them all in a way you can't explain because they're family and they're yours, but also, you know them better than anyone and have no fear telling them that they're wrong. Or at least that you think they're wrong.Whatever the case, every family has drama and trauma that is unique to them and would be hard to explain to anyone who can't understand your family dynamics. Still, it helps to ask an outside opinion to explain the actions of the ones we love. One woman posted to Reddit searching for advice for her family troubles. Her brother wants to come back into the lives of his two daughters, whom he abandoned at a young age, and they don't want him back in their lives. This woman takes her niece's side, but she's wondering if she's being too harsh on her brother. What do you think?",

Oh, sweet summer children, how naive we were! While working from home has liberated us from fluorescent lighting and mysterious break room odors, it's created an entirely new circus of corporate absurdities.We're all living in this bizarre new world where our homes have become fishbowls, broadcasted to colleagues through the unforgiving eye of webcams. Suddenly, everyone's a critic of your bookshelves, your choice of virtual background, or just exposed to that questionable art piece your mother-in-law gifted you that's now visible unfortunately.Some companies have apparently developed policies more complex than international trade agreements about what can and cannot appear in your sacred two-foot-square Zoom rectangle, Or the unwritten rules about what constitutes a \"professional\" home office environment.Which leads me to today's story corporate acrobat: a dedicated employee who committed the unthinkable crime of allowing his five-year-old daughter to briefly exist in the same space as a late-night video call.",

But really though, marriage is a beautiful thing. It's the happiest day of your life, hopefully. It's also a very stressful day. For those of you who are married, you know the craziness that comes on your wedding day. You have a schedule that's packed tighter than a cat in a purrito, there is no margin for error and no time for any distractions.That is, unless, the cat distribution system knocks on your door. Imagine you're getting ready, your hair and makeup are done, you take your two-minute and 30-second break in the schedule to walk around and get some fresh air….and then you hear some meowing. Not just one meow, but four, eight, sixteen meows! Naturally, you investigate. You find four kittens in the venue, so what else can you do except put your wedding on hold and rescue the smol little babies? That's exactly what happened below, so scroll down to watch the whole heartwarming video!",

    "description": "Are you a pawrent of an orange cat? If you are, on the one hand - you have less to worry about, because you have the cat but minus the brain. So, technically, it's less to worry about, because it's literally less of a thing in the cat. But on the other hand, the fact your orange buddy has yet to obtain the single brain cell all orange cats share creates other things you should worry about. Like the orange cat behavior. And yes, we're 200% sure that if you're an orange cat pawrent you know exactly what sort of behavior we're talking about. The orange kind.For everyone else who does not pawrent an orange feline friend, let us demonstrate it to you with the power of memes. We gathered some cat memes that demonstrate the power of a 0 brain cell orange cat to create silly chaos all around them. But it's not just the chaos, it's the… orangeness. And it's definitely great for meme material. It's no wonder this genre of cat memes is flourishing.",

    "description": "A Representative Line is a short snippet that makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code.\" A CodeSOD is a longer snippet, which also frequently makes you think, \"wow, I'd hate to see the rest of the code,\" but also is bad in ways that require you to look at the relationship between the lines in the code. I bring that up, because today's code sample is a long section, but really, it's just a collection of representative lines. Each line in this just makes me die a little on the inside. Belda found this: ## helper functions function stripmagic($x) { return get_magic_quotes_gpc() ? stripslashes($x) : $x; } function pre_r(\u0026$x) { return ''.PHSC(print_r($x, true)).''; } function PSS($x) { return str_replace('\\\\\"','\"',$x); } function PVS($x) { return preg_replace(\"/\\n[^\\\\S\\n]*(?=\\n)/\", \"\\n\u003c:vspace\u003e\", $x); } function PVSE($x) { return PVS(PHSC($x, ENT_NOQUOTES)); } function PZZ($x,$y='') { return ''; } function PRR($x=NULL) { if ($x || is_null($x)) $GLOBALS['RedoMarkupLine']++; return $x; } function PUE($x) { return preg_replace('/[\\\\x80-\\\\xff \\'\"\u003c\u003e]/e', \"'%'.dechex(ord('$0'))\", $x); } function SDV(\u0026$v,$x) { if (!isset($v)) $v=$x; } function SDVA(\u0026$var,$val) { foreach($val as $k=\u003e$v) if (!isset($var[$k])) $var[$k]=$v; } This collection of one-line \"helper\" functions has it all. Cryptic function names. PRR mutates global variables. PZZ just… returns an empty string. I don't know what PHSC does, and I don't want to, but it's called inside of pre_r and PVSE. Which I also don't know what they do. Speaking of PVSE, I note the regex is using backreferences, which is some advanced regex but I still have no idea what it's doing. I could figure it out, but I don't want to. PUE looks like it might be handling some misencoded characters, maybe. SDV is maybe kinda a coalesce function. Each line is its own representative line. None of this is code I'd want to maintain. On the flip side, the abbreviated function names, when read in reverse order, are exactly the sounds I made when I read this code: \"SDVASDVPUEPRRPZZPVSEPVSPSS\". It's okay, the doctors say I'll make a full recovery.
