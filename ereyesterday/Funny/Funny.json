Clashing patterns with a Peter Pan-collared shirt were go-tos for your party fit. Yes, you're probably wincing a little right now—but embrace the cringe! It seems like nobody wants to anymore.What happened to the \"thinkers\" of our generation? Folks these days are so obsessed with carefully calculated \"individuality\" instead of embracing the sleaze that their indie forefathers paved the way for. Stockings come pre-ripped instead of from falling on the concrete during a wild night out; folks are going to hair salons to cut their scene bangs instead of impulsively doing it themselves in the bathroom… It's pure stale mayhem out here!Fashion and pop culture in general are cyclical. When one trend perishes and the next big thing skyrockets to the top of public opinion, a negative outlook toward the newest trend's predecessor grows. This perpetuates a growing cynicism that disallows folks to embrace their cringe and vilify it instead. What even is cringe? Nothing and everything. Hear me out…",

    "description": "16 years old is way too young to know how to independently handle your finances, and your parents are supposed to be the ones guiding you towards that understanding. Some do this by giving their children an allowance. That way, the kids can gain some understanding of saving money. If they want a gaming system, they can calculate how many months they'll have to save for before getting one. Or they can choose to buy toys or food or spend the money on gas for their car. Regardless of how they spend it, they'll learn a little bit more about money matters than they knew before. For this teen, money issues are getting in the way of his relationship with his parents. They keep spoiling his younger siblings using his money! The kid is fed up, and you can read below all of the kind advice that commenters had for this young person as he learns some hard truths about family. Next, read about the high schooler who got petty revenge on an entitled classmate who tried to exclude them from snack day: 'The 12 donuts I've been bringing in… doesn't count?'",

Not everyone can purrvide those things, especially not truckers who frequently work 14+ hour days. Heck, we can barely manage to keep our cats happy when we're gone for only nine hours a day! After rescuing this cute black cat, the trucker and the kitty formed an ameowzing bond. However, because the pawrent is gone so much, the cat acts out. There's nothing that can be done - the pawrent has to work and the cat can't come with him. So the pawrent wonders to himself, \"Maybe my cat is better off with someone else?\" Naturally, they look for every solution, including finding a new job, but he finds out that he will have to pay his company $10,000 if he wants to quit. That's quite a steep price!He writes about the whole thing below so give it a scroll and let us know what you think!",

Cats are also an endless source of love and affection, making biscuits on your lap because they love you so much. Cats also provide an endless source of silly situations which are funny, and the fact they make us laugh is so underappreciated amongst humanity.

It doesn't matter if they're dark and dank memes, or silly and soft cat memes to nurture your soul - they'll be the best of their genre. Yes, only because they have cats in them, because cats are the absolute best.In fact, cat memes are so good that we gathered these silly feline funnies in meme form for you to refresh your soul during this week. They're full of fluffy felines and hilarious cat comedy. It's the best way to boost your mood on a workweek such as this.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/exactly-a-date",
    "description": "Alexandar sends us some C# date handling code. The best thing one can say is that they didn't reinvent any wheels, but that might be worse, because they used the existing wheels to drive right off a cliff. try { var date = DateTime.ParseExact(member.PubDate.ToString(), \"M/d/yyyy h:mm:ss tt\", null); objCustomResult.PublishedDate = date; } catch (Exception datEx) { } member.PubDate is a Nullable. So its ToString will return one of two things. If there is a value there, it'll return the DateTimes value. If it's null, it'll just return an empty string. Attempting to parse the empty string will throw an exception, which we helpfully swallow, do nothing about, and leave objCustomResult.PublishedDate in whatever state it was in- I'm going to guess null, but I have no idea. Part of this WTF is that they break the advantages of using nullable types- the entire point is to be able to handle null values without having to worry about exceptions getting tossed around. But that's just a small part. The real WTF is taking a DateTime value, turning it into a string, only to parse it back out. But because this is in .NET, it's more subtle than just the generation of useless strings, because member.PubDate.ToString()'s return value may change depending on your culture info settings. Which sure, this is almost certainly server-side code running on a single server with a well known locale configured. So this probably won't ever blow up on them, but it's 100% the kind of thing everyone thinks is fine until the day it's not. The punchline is that ToString allows you to specify the format you want the date formatted in, which means they could have written this: var date = DateTime.ParseExact(member.PubDate.ToString(\"M/d/yyyy h:mm:ss tt\"), \"M/d/yyyy h:mm:ss tt\", null); But if they did that, I suppose that would have possibly tickled their little grey cells and made them realize how stupid this entire block of code was?

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/would-a-function-by-any-other-name-still-be-wtf",
    "description": "\"Don't use exception handling for normal flow control,\" is generally good advice. But Andy's lead had a PhD in computer science, and with that kind of education, wasn't about to let good advice or best practices tell them what to do. That's why, when they needed to validate inputs, they wrote code C# like this: public static bool IsDecimal(string theValue) { try { Convert.ToDouble(theValue); return true; } catch { return false; } } They attempt to convert, and if they succeed, great, return true. If they fail, an exception gets caught, and they return false. What could be simpler? Well, using the built in TryParse function would be simpler. Despite its name, actually avoids throwing an exception, even internally, because exceptions are expensive in .NET. And it is already implemented, so you don't have to do this. Also, Decimal is a type in C#- a 16-byte floating point value. Now, I know they didn't actually mean Decimal, just \"a value with 0 or more digits behind the decimal point\", but pedantry is the root of clarity, and the naming convention makes this bad code unclear about its intent and purpose. Per the docs there are Single and Double values which can't be represented as Decimal and trigger an OverflowException. And conversely, Decimal loses precision if converted to Double. This means a value that would be represented as Decimal might not pass this function, and a value that can't be represented as Decimal might, and none of this actually matters but the name of the function is bad.
