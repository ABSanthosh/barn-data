    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/40994309/employee-told-he-is-going-to-lose-all-of-his-leave-by-the-end-of-the-year-takes-it-all-at-once",
    "description": "It's amusing to think that PTO exists solely for the purpose of taking a break from work when needed, yet you just never seem to use it. Like it is specifically there to use, but the reality is that all it's really there for is so that you can watch the balance slowly climb forever. It really feels like you're always too busy to take some time off, but are we conditioned to feel this way, or is it some internal need we're fulfilling to ourselves? To make this even worse, as you're sitting there watching your leave balance climb, your employer will be getting increasingly antsy about it. See, depending on where you work and what arrangement you have, your employer may be on the hook for making sure that the balance of their employee's PTO is available to be paid out, which becomes a pretty big risk when you add it all up. So, at some point, you'll be told that your leave balance is expiring, or if there's a round of layoffs, you might even end up on the chopping block simply because the amount of money your leave balance represents to the business. Then that massive leave/PTO balance, which was yours to rightfully take, was all for naught. This worker was told they were going to lose all their leave at the end of the year, but that backfired for their employer when they took all of it during the busiest and most important time of the year, leaving important projects struggling to be finished before deadlines.",

Often taken out of context or as a display of power, a workplace ultimatum can get lost in translation, leading to a trip down the hall to the HR office or a completely misunderstood instruction.

Like when you do all the work in a math question, but every number along the way is wrong and you're not even doing the right thing, and yet you still got the right answer. Was it luck or are you secretly a genius and just discovered a new way to math? Most likely the luck one, because math is hard…  In the case of this itty bitty kitten, she might have gone to the wrong doctor's office, but she still ended up finding the exact kind of doctor she needed! This sick little baby waltz on into the waiting room of a human hospital clinic. She was meowing her little head off and everybody was ignoring her—except one person. A lady who was waiting patiently for her appointment. This lady, however, wasn't just any 'ole body, she was a veterinarian!

A major company you have definitely heard of and depending upon the size of the area you live in, they may even have a bank branch near you. I've reloaded the page and clicked the sort button multiple times to order the rows by date in both ascending and descending order. It always ends up the same. May 17th and 18th happened twice, but not in the expected order.\" I must say that it is more fun when we know who they are.   A job hunter with the unlikely appelation full_name suggested titling this \"[submission_title]\" which seems appropriate.   \"The browser wars continue to fall out in HTML email,\" reports Ben S. \"Looking at the source code of this email, it was evidently written by \u0026 for Microsoft products (including tags!), and the author likely never saw the non-Microsoft version I'm seeing where only a haphazard assortment of the links are styled. But that doesn't explain why it's AN ELEVEN POINT SCALE arranged in a GRID.\"   \"The owl knows who you are,\" sagely stated Jan. \"This happens when you follow someone back. I love how I didn't have to anonymize anything in the screenshot.\"   \"Location, location, location!\" crows Tim K. who is definitely not a Time Lord. \"Snarky snippet: Found while cleaning up miscellaneous accounts held by a former employee. By now we all know to expect how these lists are sorted, but what kind of sadist *created* it? Longer explanation: I wasn't sure what screenshot to send with this one, it just makes less and less sense the more I look at it, and no single segment of the list contains all of the treasures it hides. \"America\" seems to refer to the entire western hemisphere, but from there we either drill down directly to a city, or sometimes to a US state, then a city, or sometimes just to a country. The only context that indicates we're talking about Jamaica the island rather than Jamaica, NY is the timezone listed, assuming we can even trust those. Also, that differentiator only works during DST. There are eight entries for Indiana. There are TEN entries for the Antarctic.\" Well. In this case, there is a perfectly good explanation. TRWTF is time zones, that's all there is to it. These are the official IANA names as recorded in the public TZDB. In other words, this list wasn't concocted by a mere sadist, oh no. This list was cooked up by an entire committee! If you have the courage, you can learn more than you ever wanted to know about time at the IANA time zones website   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Dan's co-workers like passing around TDWTF stories, mostly because seeing code worse than what they're writing makes them feel less bad about how often they end up hacking things together. One day, a co-worker told Dan: \"Hey, I think I found something for that website with the bad code stories!\" Dan's heart sank. He didn't really want to shame any of his co-workers. Fortunately, the source-control history put the blame squarely on someone who didn't work there any more, so he felt better about submitting it. This is another ASP .Net page, and this one made heavy use of GridView elements. GridView controls applied the logic of UI controls to generating a table. They had a page which contained six of these controls, defined like this: \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth1\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth2\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e \u003casp:GridView ID=\"gvTaskMonth3\" runat=\"server\" CssClass=\"leadsGridView\" AutoGenerateColumns=\"False\" OnRowDataBound=\"gvTaskMonth1_RowDataBound\"\u003e ... asp:GridView\u003e The purpose of this screen was to display a roadmap of coming tasks, broken up by how many months in the future they were. The first thing that leaps out to me is that they all use the same event handler for binding data to the table, which isn't in-and-of-itself a problem, but the naming of it is certainly a recipe for confusion. Now, to bind these controls to the data, there needed to be some code in the code-behind of this view which handled that. That's where the WTF lurks: /// /// Create a roadmap for the selected client /// private void CreateRoadmap() { for (int i = 1; i \u003c 7; i++) { switch (i) { case 1: if (gvTaskMonth1.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); } break; case 2: if (gvTaskMonth2.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); } break; case 3: if (gvTaskMonth3.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); } break; case 4: if (gvTaskMonth4.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); } break; case 5: if (gvTaskMonth5.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); } break; case 6: if (gvTaskMonth6.Rows.Count \u003e 0) { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } break; } } } Ah, the good old fashioned loop-switch sequence anti-pattern. I understand the motivation: \"I want to do the same thing for six different controls, so I should use a loop to not repeat myself,\" but then couldn't quite figure out how to do that, so they just repeated themselves, but inside of a loop. The \"fix\" was to replace all of this with something more compact: private void CreateRoadmap() { InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth1, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod1.Text), \"1\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth2, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod2.Text), \"2\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth3, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod3.Text), \"3\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth4, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod4.Text), \"4\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth5, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod5.Text), \"5\"); InsertTasks(gvTaskMonth6, DateTime.Parse(txtDatePeriod6.Text), \"6\"); } That said, I'd recommend not trying to parse date times inside of a text box inside of this method, but that's just me. Bubbling up the inevitable FormatException that this will generate is going to be a giant nuisance. It's likely that they've got a validator somewhere, so it's probably fine- I just don't like it. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
