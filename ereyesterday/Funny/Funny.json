    "description": "Be careful what you say while you're in court… It may seem like common sense, but many people can't help but mouth off to the judge during their legal case. No one wants to be in court, obviously, but that is not the time or place to start an argument with the judge or your lawyer. As the lawyers of the internet explained, their clients often choose the exact wrong time to blurt out new information. As they take the stand, some people will just admit to their actions, leading them to longer sentences. For some reason, people won't tell their lawyers the whole story. Then when they get to the courtroom, they reveal things under cross-examination, surprising their lawyer. That lawyer can't help the client if they don't have all the facts! Instead of being on their best behavior, other people choose to act out. One dude fell asleep in court, which didn't exactly win over the judge in his case. A different woman had an open-and-shut case. But when she got to the stand, she began acting as if she was in a TV show, being way too dramatic. It turned the jury against her, unfortunately. Check out a bunch of the funniest times lawyers did a facepalm by scrolling below. Up next, read about the parents who chose to see an air show instead of going to their daughter's celebrity contest win.",

    "description": "It doesn't matter how old you are when it comes to purchasing a stuffed animal, but for a fully grown lady to throw a tantrum over one is a whole different ballgame. Here's the deal: if stuffed animals or blankets provide you comfort as a sixty-something-year-old, that is well within your right. Whatever provides comfort to help you go through this harsh world is a personal choice, and we should de-stigmatize the idea that being an adult means not clinging to those sources of comfort. That being said, there's a line, of course, and for this Karen, she probably should not have overreacted in a public setting over the price of a stuffed animal. Her tantrum only makes the idea of wanting a stuffed animal as an adult seem childish, but we should be clear here. What's childish is her tantrum, not the stuffed animal itself.Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

And that is that in some part of your heart, if not all of it, you love Santa. He represents so much good, in a world filled with so much bad, that this figure is engrained in many of our memories as a sign that if even only for a moment, everything will be ok.A great example of this being that every Home Alone movie ended at Christmas when the family came home and Kevin McCallister was found to be right as rain by his family. Even if they were going to do the same thing the following year. So we figured that we might pump up the feels by incorporating cute cats into this list of heartwarming cat memes to nourish your Santa-loving soul.",

If Marvels was a bit more constrained, or if R6 were a little less… whatever it is, maybe they would start bleeding into each other. In a round of Rainbow, for example, we probably won't be erased from reality by Scarlet Witch's \"Reality Erasure\" ult. You know? It helps you compartmentalize.

    "description": "Michael had a co-worker who was new to the team. As such, there was definitely an expected ramp-up time. But this new developer got that ramp up time, and still wasn't performing. Worse, they ended up dragging down the entire team, as they'd go off, write a bunch of code, end up in a situation that they couldn't understand why nothing was working, and then beg for help. For example, this dev was tasked with adding timestamps to a set of logging messages. The logs had started as simple \"print\" debugging messages, but had grown in complexity and it was time to treat them like real logging. This stumped them, as the following C# code only ever printed out a zero: DateTime d = new DateTime(); int timestamp = d.Minute + d.Second + d.Millisecond; Console.WriteLine(timestamp + message); On one hand, this is a clear example of not understanding operator overloading- clearly, they understood that + could be used for string concatenation, but they seem to have forgotten that it could also be used for arithmetic. I don't think this actually only ever printed out a zero. It certainly didn't print out a timestamp, but it also didn't print out a zero. So not only is the code bad, but the understanding of how it's bad is also bad. It's bad. Bad. Bad. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

    "description": "Conditional statements, we would hope, are one of the most basic and well understood constructs in any programming language. Hope, of course, is for fools and suckers, so let's take a look at a few short snippets. Our first installment comes from Jonas. if (!checkAndDelete(Definitions.DirectoryName, currentTime)); //Empty statement I appreciate the comment, which informs us that this empty statement is intentional. Why it's intentional remains mysterious. Jonas found this while going through linter warnings. After fixing this, there are only 25,000 more warnings to go. Brodey has a similar construct, but from a very different language. If (Session.Item(Session.SessionID \u0026 \"Origional\") IsNot Nothing) Then End If I have to give bonus points for the origional spelling of \"original\". But spelling aside, there's a hint of something sinister here- we're concatenating strings with the SessionId- I don't know what is going wrong here, but it's definitely something. Our last little snippet comes from Midiane. While not a conditional, it shows a misunderstanding of either booleans or comments. $mail-\u003eSMTPAuth = false; // turn on SMTP authentication The comment clearly is out of date with the code (which is the main reason we shouldn't repeat what is in the code as a comment). At least, we hope the comment is just out of date. A worse scenario is that setting the flag equal to false enables it. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
