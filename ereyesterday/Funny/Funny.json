We hope that the people we know (who are employed) will find it in their hearts to refer us to people they know who might be hiring, or just help us network for when the next role might be available. Applications upon applications, and you hear nothing; the real way to get your foot in the door after having been unemployed for a while is through friends. Keep in mind, however, that only friends who know your work ethic and can actually vouch for you should be sought out… If you think that you're better than certain jobs and find them beneath you, then reconsider the reason you don't have a job in the first place…The entitled friend in this next story managed to mess up the only shot they had at landing a job, which their friend so graciously helped them get an interview for.

No teenager is just born with the work ethic and the business perspective of their older counterparts, so when company drama unfolds, it's their first time navigating this type of thing. This teenager learned quickly how important it is to communicate with both your schedule manager and the owner of the company. After getting caught in the crosshairs of a nightmarish communication scuffle, this teenager was spared the continued employment under inefficient and under-qualified managers. Lucky for them, they were taught a valuable lesson in the workforce before getting set free to find a new job under better managers.",

It's time to meet the newly adopted faces of the week, everyone! Every single week, we bring you a whole new collection of the cutest, newest cat adoption stories on the web. And every single week, seeing these felines find their homes brings us so much so, so every single week, we say thank you to you guys - to each and every person who adopted. And as always, an even bigger thank you goes out to everyone who adopted the \"impurrfect cats\" - the senior cats, the sick cats, the cats that have behavioral issues, and every other feline who needs a little more care than most. You have done an amazing thing, and we wish you all many happy and healthy years together.",

    "description": "Black cats are a blessing. It is long rumored that black cats bring bad luck, but nothing could be further from the truth. Black cats are a true blessing of cuteness, beauty, and lots of feline funnies. We asked the black cat pawrents around the office why having a black cat is such a blessing, and these are our favorite answers, in no particular order:\"I was gaming in the dark and was sure my cat was lounging next to me on the table. Every time I lost, I talked it through with my cat, like she was there to help me through the frustration. After I turned the game off, I realized I was talking to my crumpled black sweatshirt all along.\" \"A couple of nights ago, I was about to fall asleep when I felt my absolute unit of a cat jump onto the bed. He usually does that when I'm falling asleep, so I was not surprised, but this time - he was climbing onto my chest, putting his face an inch from mine, and releasing the loudest meow out of his mouth. I opened my eyes in horror and saw nothing but his glowing eyes in the darkness of his fur and the room. With his chonker weight pressing on my chest, I thought that this is what paralysis demon must feel like.\" \"My partner and I were looking for my void cat everywhere for a few minutes, just because I wondered where she could be. We called her name a few times, and nothing. She doesn't usually respond to her name, but we walked around the house, looking in her usual hiding spots and napping places, we couldn't find her. I started worrying, but then my partner called me and pointed to the turned-off TV - lo and behold, my cat was just sitting in front of the black screen in complete camouflage. Panic averted.\"",

Now, you might say, \"But Java has a built in for that, Integer.parseInt,\" and have I got good news for you: they actually used it. It's just everything else they did wrong. private int makeInteger(String s) { int i=0; try { Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { i=0; return i; } i=Integer.parseInt(s); return i; } This function is really the story of variable i, the most useless variable ever. It's doing its best, but there's just nothing for it to do here. We start by setting i to zero. Then we attempt to parse the integer, and do nothing with the result. If it fails, we set i to zero again, just for fun, and then return i. Why not just return 0? Because then what would poor i get to do? Assuming we didn't throw an exception, we parse the input again, storing its result in i, and then return i. Again, we treat i like a child who wants to help paint the living room: we give it a dry brush and a section of wall we're not planning to paint and let it go to town. Nothing it does matters, but it feels like a participant. Now, Mark went ahead and refactored this function basically right away, into a more terse and clear version: private int makeInteger(String s) { try { return Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { return 0; } } He went about his development work, and then a few days later came across makeInteger reverted back to its original version. For a moment, he wanted to be mad at someone for reverting his change, but no- this was in an entirely different class. With that information, Mark went and did a search for makeInteger in the code, only to find 39 copies of this function, with minor variations. There are an unknown number of copies of the function where the name is slightly different than makeInteger, but a search for Integer.parseInt implies that there may be many more.
