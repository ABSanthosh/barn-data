If can simply come from showing your character in the heat of the moment. True, that can go either way, but sometimes it can be epic. Take, for example, this beautiful father and son bonding moment. It blossomed out of a situation sparked by some entitled dude at a gas station. He pulled up behind them in a big 'ole truck and decided they were taking too long pumping their gas. So while the son was inside getting snacks and the dad was cleaning the windows as the gas was pumping, this entitled guy puffed out his chest and took the gas pump right out of their car!",

At first, you think their nagging is helpful, maybe even a gesture of goodwill to help you learn the ropes. And then the reality hits—they're less mentor and more menace.  This is the coworker who demands endless help while simultaneously critiquing your work, like they're chairing your performance review on their lunch break. They'll ask you to do their job, then circle back 20 minutes later to let you know you're doing yours wrong. \"We're a team, right?\"",

This cat is loving, caring, and adjusts well to life at your home. Then, you get a phone call from the animal shelter, saying something you never thought you would hear - someone wants your new cat back. Wait, what? But it's our cat, how could it be their cat? And why did they get rid of them in the first place?Well, it turns out that their \"new cat\" was actually someone's cat who trusted their daughter to take care of their cats while they underwent a meowdical procedure. During this time, their selfish child surrendered not one, not two, but all five of their cats to a local shelter because their children had allergies and didn't want to deal with them. So what do you do? Do you give your cat back to their original owner, or keep them in their new home? This story is spicy and pawsitively juicy, so scroll down to read the full thread below!",

Just as when a cat is met with the smell of a yummy treat they know not to ask, but to demand it. They know they deserve it, and they'll make it your problem until you realize it yourself as well. They want it here, they want it now, and they'll get it eventually. This is the kind of cat confidence we want. Also we'd like to be as cute as cats, but we're not that confident yet as to ask for these two things at once. We'll wait patiently.While we wait for this cat confidence, we'd like to help both you and us to pass the time with some furrbulous feline memes. They're some really fantastic memes, and they have all that cat confidence already, so they don't need you to tell them that. But we hope this cat confidence is contagious, because we'd like to have some. At least we know that with these funny cat memes, we'll have a good laugh.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/time-for-identification",
    "description": "If you need a unique ID, UUIDs provide a variety of options. It's worth noting that variants 1, 2, and 7 all incorporate a timestamp into the UUID. In the case of variant 7, this has the benefit of making the UUID sortable, which can be convenient in many cases (v1/v2 incorporate a MAC address which means that they're sortable if generated with the same NIC). I bring this up because Dave inherited some code written by a \"guru\". Said guru was working before UUIDv7 was a standard, but also didn't have any problems that required sortable UUIDs, and thus had no real reason to use timestamp based UUIDs. They just needed some random identifier and, despite using C#, didn't use the UUID functions built in to the framework. No, they instead did this: string uniqueID = String.Format(\"{0:d9}\", (DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks / 10) % 1000000000); A Tick is 100 nanoseconds. We divide that by ten, mod by a billion, and then call that our unique identifier. This is, as you might guess, not unique. First there's the possibility of timestamp collisions: generating two of these too close together in time would collide. Second, the math is just complete nonsense. We divide Ticks by ten (converting hundreds of nanoseconds into thousands of nanoseconds), then we mod by a billion. So every thousand seconds we loop and have a risk of collision again? Maybe, maybe, these are short-lived IDs and a thousand seconds is plenty of time. But even if that's true, none of this is a good way to do that. I suppose the saving grace is they use UtcNow and not Now, thus avoiding situations where collisions also happen because of time zones?
