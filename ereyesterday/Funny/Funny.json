    "description": "Here's a classic catastrophe brewing: this person's best friend's boyfriend is a chronic complainer who's already snarked about everything, including the location of a cookout at the cat owner's place. To make things trickier, he's allergic to cats, and the pawrent has two furry divas who hide when guests arrive. Despite the boyfriend visiting twice with no complaints, the best friend insists the cats be locked away all day to spare his sneezes.This pawrent isn't having it, suggesting the boyfriend take allergy meds instead of putting the cats through the stress of isolation. It's a real cat-and-mouse game between making guests comfortable and protecting the well-being of beloved pets. Sure, the boyfriend's grumpy attitude might be rubbing fur the wrong way, but prioritizing the cats' comfort over a difficult guest seems totally pawsible.At the end of the day, it's about respecting boundaries, especially when cats are involved. Sometimes standing firm is the best way to keep the peace and avoid turning the home into a feline fiasco.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

If you're reading this while heavy-eyed and running on zero sleep because your feline friend decided this was the time to knock things off shelves, sprint around the house like a fuzzy lightning bolt, or demand snacks with a symphony of \"MEOW!\" - you are not alone.Sleep-deprived cat pawrents everywhere know this struggle. The moment your head hits the pillow, your cat suddenly remembers they're a mighty nocturnal hunter with a full to-do list: yell at invisible ghosts, rearrange the furniture, practice opera in the hallway, or just stare at you until you wake up. Why? Because they can.So, what's a tired hooman to do while their cat is mid-zoomies and their dreams are on pause? Scroll through some weirdly relatable and delightfully unhinged cat memes, of course. These feline funnies were practically made for 4 AM scrolling sessions. They're the purrfect companion for your late-night wake-up calls… right alongside the fluffy chaos gremlin currently sitting on your chest.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.

Do you let them be, hoping that they'll come to their senses and realize they're living next to a completely normal person? Or, do you fight fire with fire, figuring out the best way to scare them off? Both approaches have their pros and cons, but I'd be lying if I said there weren't any complications with trying to level with someone who is clearly running on some rather illogical fumes.Some folks have bad days; that's a given. There are weeks when I'll avoid eye contact with all of my neighbors because I'd rather stick to myself. There's nothing wrong with wanting to avoid social interactions. However, when you seek not only interaction but negative interactions, you might want to check in with a therapist or a different kind of doctor. Picking fights for the sake of picking a fight is inherently problematic and causes issues for everyone who lives within a block radius of you; You don't need this lecture, though. The neighbor in this next story does.This neighbor, who opens a homeowner's mail containing their new debit card, accuses them of trying to steal her identity.

Regularly fueling our disdain for them, gross coworkers reveal their truest selves while they're on the clock, only bolstering their unlikability with each shift. And when you're an overworked assistant manager who already hates your boss's guts, perhaps you'd also lunge at the opportunity to be rid of them forever—especially if they deserve it.",

    "description": "Sometimes, you see some code which is perfectly harmless, but illustrates an incredibly dangerous person behind them. The code isn't good, but it isn't bad in any meaningful way, but it was written by a cocaine addled Pomeranian behind the controls of a bulldozer: it's full of energy, doesn't know exactly what's going on, and at some point, it's going to hit something important. Such is the code which Román sends us. public static function registerUser($name, $lastName, $username, ...) { // 100% unmodified first lines, some comments removed $tsCreation = new DateTime(); $user = new User(); $name = $name; $lastname = $lastName; $username = $username; $user-\u003esetUsername($username); $user-\u003esetLastname($lastname); $user-\u003esetName($name); // And so on. } This creates a user object and populates its fields. It doesn't use a meaningful constructor, which is its own problem, but that's not why we're here. We're here because for some reason the developer behind this function assigns some of the parameters to themselves. Why? I don't know, but it's clearly the result of some underlying misunderstanding of how things work. But the real landmine is the $lastname variable- which is an entirely new variable which has slightly different capitalization from $lastName. And you've all heard this song many times, so sing along with the chorus: \"this particular pattern shows up all through the codebase,\" complete with inconsistent capitalization. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
