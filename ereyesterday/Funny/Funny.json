    "description": "Being a cat lover can mean a lot of things. For some, it's spoiling one or two floofy companions with treats and toys. For others, it's having a whole litter of kitties running between your feet - and earning the title of \"Crazy Cat Lady\" with pride. But for every cat pawrent, no matter how many meows fill the room, one thing should always come first: the well-being of the cats themselves.That's why this story from a loving grandchild hit so close to home. Their grandma started out with good intentions - feeding strays, giving them shelter - but things have spiraled out of control. Now, more than 30 sick outdoor cats and several indoor ones are living in cramped conditions, with new litters constantly arriving. The grandchild is doing their best, taking their own cats with them to a new place, but their heart is breaking watching the other cats on their grandmother's property.Many of us in the online feline family know how easy it is for care to turn into overwhelm, especially when you have a soft spot for every stray paw that wanders by. But loving cats also means making hard choices - like asking for help, finding shelters, or setting up TNR (trap-neuter-return) programs. If you've been through something similar, have resources to share, or just want to offer words of kindness, let's come together to help both this family and their overwhelmed cat colony find a healthier path.Fluff.

It feels like at least Thursday, if not Furiday. So there's no way it can be Wednesday, right? Okay, good, as long as we both agree that it's definitely after Wednesday, then we're fine. We'd like to tell you that the timelessly silly feline funnies we collected below are purrfect for getting you ready for Caturday, but that wouldn't be the truth. They're not even ready to pump you up for Furiday. They might get you out of that midweek slump you're currently sitting in, though. These cat memes may be pawerful, but they are not all-pawerful (unfortunately). They cannot meowgically make it Furiday, but they can make you smile, no matter what day it is. Even if it is only Wednesday.Let's giggle for a few minutes together and try to get through the middle of the week with some pawsitivity, okay?Fluff. Chaos. Drama!

Except that the younger brother is a child for whom her boyfriend is the legal guardian, whereas she is a grown-grass adult who needs to fend for herself, so it's really not the same thing at all. It takes a special kind of someone to look at the care that an adult guardian is offering a child and think to themself, \"I want in on that.\"There's really nothing stopping her from moving in with her boyfriend and his brother together either, but thinking that she can do so without contributing to expenses and then further overstepping by trying to get the little brother out of the way simply so that she can have more space to herself is simply out the gate.There's definitely a lesson to learn here about knowing and understanding the people whom you let into your life, but fortunately, the boyfriend is learning it before it's too late.",

    "description": "One of the endless struggles in writing reusable API endpoints is creating useful schemas to describe them. Each new serialization format comes up with new ways to express your constraints, each with their own quirks and footguns and absolute trainwrecks. Maarten has the \"pleasure\" of consuming an XML-based API, provided by a third party. It comes with an XML schema, for validation. Now, the XML Schema Language has a large number of validators built in. For example, if you want to restrict a field to being a date, you can mark it's type as xsd:date. This will enforce a YYYY-MM-DD format on the data. If you want to ruin that validation, you can do what the vendor did: \u003cxsd:simpleType name=\"DatumType\"\u003e \u003cxsd:annotation\u003e \u003cxsd:documentation\u003eYYYY-MM-DDxsd:documentation\u003e xsd:annotation\u003e \u003cxsd:restriction base=\"xsd:date\"\u003e \u003cxsd:pattern value=\"(1|2)[0-9]{3}-(0|1)[0-9]-[0-3][0-9]\" /\u003e xsd:restriction\u003e xsd:simpleType\u003e You can see the xsd:pattern element, which applies a regular expression to validation. And this regex will \"validate\" dates, excluding things which are definitely not dates, and allowing very valid dates, like February 31st, November 39th, and the 5th of Bureaucracy (the 18th month of the year), as 2025-02-31, 2025-11-39 and 2025-18-05 are all valid strings according to the regex. Now, an astute reader will note that this is a xsd:restriction on a date; this means that it's applied in addition to ensuring the value is a valid date. So this idiocy is harmless. If you removed the xsd:pattern element, the behavior would remain unchanged. That leads us to a series of possible conclusions: either they don't understand how XML schema restrictions work, or they don't understand how dates work. As to which one applies, well, I'd say 1/3 chance they don't understand XML, 1/3 chance they don't understand dates, and a 1/3 chance they don't understand both.

They burned through rockstars faster than Spinal Tap goes through drummers. The result is gems like this: private void init(){ ResourceHelper rh = new ResourceHelper(); for ( int i = 0; i \u003c 12; i++) { months[i] = rh.getResource(\"calendar.\"+monthkeys[i]+\".long\"); months_s[i] = rh.getResource(\"calendar.\"+monthkeys[i]+\".short\"); } StaticData data = SomeService.current().getStaticData(); this.bankHolidayList = data.getBankHolidayList(); colors.put(\"#dddddd\", \"#dddddd\"); colors.put(\"#cccccc\", \"#cccccc\"); colors.put(\"#e6e6e6\", \"#e6e6e6\"); colors.put(\"#ff0000\", \"#ffcccc\"); colors.put(\"#ffff00\", \"#ffffcc\"); colors.put(\"#00ff00\", \"#ccffcc\"); colors.put(\"#5050ff\", \"#ccccff\"); colors.put(\"#aa0000\", \"#ff9999\"); colors.put(\"#ff8000\", \"#ffcc99\"); colors.put(\"#99ff99\", \"#ccffcc\"); colors.put(\"#ffcc99\", \"#ffffcc\"); colors.put(\"#ff9966\", \"#ffcc99\"); colors.put(\"#00c040\", \"#99cc99\"); colors.put(\"#aadddd\", \"#ccffff\"); colors.put(\"#e0e040\", \"#ffff99\"); colors.put(\"#6699ff\", \"#99ccff\"); } There are plenty of things in this function that raise concerns- whatever is going on with the ResourceHelper and the monthkeys array, for example. But let's just breeze past that into that colors lookup table, because boy oh boy. There's the obvious issue of using server-side code to manage colors instead of CSS, which is bad, sure. But this translation table which converts some colors (presumably already used in the display?) to some other colors (presumably to replace the display colors) is downright mystifying. How did this happen? Why did this happen? What happens when we attempt to apply a color not in the lookup table? I want to say more mean things about this, but the more I stare at the original colors and what they get translated to, I think this lookup table is trying to tell me I should… … … lighten up.
