Everybody else is just going to have to wait for their turn next week. Frist up it's Daniel D. \"I wanted to see events for the dates I would be in London. Is Skiddle (the website in question) telling me I should come to London more often?\" They're certainly being very generous with their interpretation of dates.   But wait, there's more! Daniel follows with a variation: \"Skiddle here again - let's choose June 7th to June 14th, but Skiddle knows better and sets the dates to June 6th to June 13th.\"   \"I was not aware the Berlin to London route passes through Hawaii (which is Mokulele'shome turf)\" chuckles our old friend Michael R. He seems to believe it's an Error'd but I think the real WTF is simply the Byzantine tapestry of partnerships, resellers, rebranding, whitelabeling and masquerades in the air transport biz.   \"Maybe it's just a Monday morning thing,\" he reports from the airport.   But Monday had everybody troubled, and Michael was already thinking of Friday. \"I am so sure I took the Circle Line just last Friday. And the other lines have the option Monday-Friday/Saturday/Sunday.\" I hope there isn't a subtext here.   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet.

    "description": "One of the key points of confusion for people unfamiliar with Java is the distinction between true object types, like Integer, and \"primitive\" types, like int. This is made worse by the collection types, like ArrayList, which needs to hold a true object type, but can't hold a primitive. A generic ArrayList is valid, but ArrayList won't compile. Fortunately for everyone, Java automatically \"boxes\" types- at least since Java 5, way back in 2004- so integerList.add(5) and int n = integerList.get(0) will both work just fine. Somebody should have told that to Alice's co-worker, who spends a lot of code to do some type gymnastics that they shouldn't have: try { ps = conn.prepareStatement(SQL_GET_LOT_WORKUP_STATUSES); ps.setLong(1, _lotId); rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { result.add(new Integer(rs.getInt(1))); } } finally { CloseUtil.close(ps,rs); } // instatiate a the array _workupStatuses = new int[result.size()]; // convert the integers to ints for (int h=0; h This runs a query against the database, and then iterates across the result to populate a List type with integers, and right away we're getting into confused territory. rs.getInt returns an int primitive, which they manually box with new Integer, and stuff into the List. And look, I wouldn't really call that a WTF, but it's what they do next that leaves me scratching my head. They initialize a private member, _workupStatuses to a new array of ints. Then they copy every integer from the result collection into the array, first by casting the get return value to Integer, then by pulling off the intValue. In the end, this whole dance happens because Java ResultSet types open cursors on the database side and thus don't have the capacity to tell you how many rows they returned. You need to iterate across each record until it runs out of results. That's why they populate an intermediate list. Then they can check the size and create an array, but that itself is a big why. I'm not going to say that using arrays in Java is an instant anti-pattern, but it's always something to be suspicious of, especially when you're holding result sets. It's probably a premature optimization: the key performance distance is on insertions where an ArrayList may need to resize and copy its internal backing store. My suspicion, however, is that this code falls into the category of \"C programmer forced to do Java\". They're comfortable with an array of integers, which is covers 90% of the data types you use in C but a dynamic, complicated data structure is horrifying to them. So they use it when they absolutely have to, and then throw it away as quickly as they can to get back to what they're familiar with. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "link": "https://cheezburger.com/40919813/marketing-demands-review-of-all-technical-documents-programmer-creates-a-fake-protocol-to-mess-with",
    "description": "The interplay between departments and their personalities is one of the more fascinating dynamics in any workplace; undoubtedly, there is no greater discrepancy—no contrast more glaring—in personality and presentation than between the technical department and sales or marketing. It's pretty much a \"Yin and Yang\" situation, except without much harmonious existence and more of a quiet standoff of incompatible values. The charisma and peacocking personalities of sales, prioritizing smoke and mirrors, and grand gestures clash with the quiet, logical precision of the technical workers. Expectations are never going to meet the reality of what is technically possible, and when sales/marketing overpromise, it becomes hard to deliver a product that is going to keep clients happy. And when it comes to finalizing a project together and shipping it to clients, there's always going to be disagreements as the two values collide. When this marketing department demanded a review of all technical documents that a client might possibly see, it prompted this programmer to implement a satirical protocol, proving that marketing was not capable of properly reviewing technical documents anyway, due to their inability to piece together the hidden message in the protocol's operation.",

Like, if you are literally one minute late, then they won't make a big deal about it. As long as you're doing what you were hired to do, well, and with no complaints, then what is one minute? Well, apparently some supervisors use that one minute as a way to make themselves look better—and it doesn't matter how buddy buddy you've gotten with them. Why would you ever cover for a supervisor who throws you under the bus after literally one minute? Well, that's exactly what happened to this employee. His supervisor would sometimes not even show up for an entire shift, but he didn't mind. He would just stay longer and have her back. However, one day, after covering her closing shift, he should up ONE minute late to work. That's right. Not an hour late, not even 10 minutes late, just one minute. And instead of her even approaching him to ask what's up or talk to him about anything, she marched right to HR and reported him. So he got written up for being one minute late…. ONE MINUTE.",

Our floofy felines are proud of their two daddies and they make up our fuzzy family that we couldn't live without. That's why we've collected some of the silliest cat memes from across the whiskery wild web of cats supporting their pawrents during Pride month (in their own feline way, of course).These kitties don't care wherever you fall underneath the LGBTQ+ umbrella, they are equally as judgmental either way. They've got that funny feline flavor that we know and love from classic cat memes, but with some added rainbows and sass that comes with a bunch of gays gathered together.

Bobcats are playful, and they will break into a golf course if they see a ball there that they want to play with. Bobcats are affectionate, and they will take in kittens from other families and other species and raise them as their own. Bobcats are silly and get attached to the silliest of toys, even if that toy is just… fennel. And bobcats seems to be learning… little by little, that some humans are not so bad. Now, that might not always be a good thing. Wild things are wild for a reason, and most of these cats still stay away. But some make the same calculation that house cats do… maybe sticking around humans, especially when you are in need of help or are vulnerable, like this momma bobcat who just had her kittens, is better than being in the wild.  Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.
