    "description": "You won't find many people who would argue with you for wanting a child-free wedding—except, of course, those parents who think their little darlings are the exception to any and every rule. It can get a little harder to sell this idea, however, when you try and pass the \"child-free\" rule for one specific individual: your \"bad apple\" 9-year-old cousin. Let's consider here that in most cases, for a kid that young, the problem is actually the parents themselves… regardless of what \"attempts\" they might be making to fix the behavior.However, this bride is considering doing exactly this, wanting to exclude her problematic 9-year-old cousin from her wedding due to his exceptionally bad behavior and flair for inappropriate language. Distressed by the decision facing her and wanting all of her better-behaved younger cousins to attend, she turned to this online community to seek advice as to whether or not she should proceed with the targeted exclusion. Commenters on the thread shared lots of helpful advice and largely sided with her and her decision to exclude the single problematic child.",

    "description": "When a couple who loves cooking starts living with a guy who can't cook anything, hilarity ensues! It sounds like the start of a goofy movie, but for this couple, it's their reality. Cooking seems awfully easy when you're just watching someone do it. How hard could it be to turn on the heat, throw some food in a pan, and make magic happen? Well, it's certainly more difficult than that, but this house guest didn't know. He's under the impression that he can cook, but it's becoming increasingly clear that he cannot even make eggs correctly. You can immediately tell if someone can cook or not just by observing them. Do they preheat their pan or oven? Can they tell if water is boiling just by the sound of it? Do they actually understand how to know if their food is cooking correctly, or if their meat is fully cooked? It's not hard to tell someone's experience level… but this house guest still felt fine with lying about it. At least the couple he's staying with will have some hilarious stories to tell for years to come! Up next, read some of the funniest things people have written to get themselves into college, like one person who revealed that \"I wrote a 750-word admissions essay describing the smell of baked potatoes... I got in.\"",

And a few years back, for the person in this story in particular, a little cat-shaped Christmas miracle happened which they finally decided to share. This person rescued a kitten on Christmas eve, which is a miracle and a story in and of itself. But the kitten they rescued was one that truly needed their help. If this woman hadn't rescued her, this night would have turned from a Christmas miracle into a Christmas disaster for this kitten, because chances are that in her condition, she wouldn't have made it through the night.

Every day with them is a gift of purrfect silliness, memeable meowments, and pawsitively snuggly evenings. That's one of the great things about cats: they make our lives better just by being themselves. This is the exact reason why we can scroll through cat content for hours and hours on end! Because everyone's cat is unique and awwdorable, and we love seeing the lives of other people's fur babies.When you search for \"silly cat pictures\" on the interwebz, you can come up with enough content to keep you glued to the screen for days, nay, weeks, nay, years! But that's too much, so we made your job easier and found some of the most hissterical cat pictures from the lives of pawsitively pawdorable fur babies to deck your Wednesday with lols aplenty. Santa came to town early this year and delivered us these beautiful, derpy cats that just can't help but make you smile. (We're Santa in this analogy, in case you didn't get it). Merry two weeks until Christmas!",

    "description": "One of the long-tenured developers, Douglas at Patrick's company left, which meant Patrick was called upon to pick up that share of the work. The code left behind by Douglas the departing developer was, well… code. For example, this block of Java: private String[] getDomainId(Collection particularCase) { // Get all domainId Collection ids = new ArrayList(); for (ParticularCaseEntity case : particularCase) { ids.add(case.getDomainId()); } Set domainIdsWithoutRepeat = new HashSet(); domainIdsWithoutRepeat.addAll(ids); Collection domainIds = new ArrayList(); for (String domainId : domainIdsWithoutRepeat) { domainIds.add(domainId); } return domainIds.toArray(new String[0]); } The purpose of this code is to get a set of \"domain IDs\"- a set, specifically, because we want them without duplicates. And this code takes the long way around to do it. First, it returns a String[]- but logically, what it should return is a set. Maybe it's meant to comply with an external interface, but it's a private method- so I actually think this developer just didn't understand collection types at all. And I have more evidence for that, which is the rest of this code. We iterate across our ParticularCaseEntitys, and add each one to an array list. Then we create a hash set, and add all of those to a hash set. Then we create another array list, and add each entry in the set to the array list. Then we convert that array list into an array so we can return it. At most, we really only needed the HashSet. But this gives us a nice tour of all the wrong data structures to use for this problem, which is helpful. Speaking of helpful, it didn't take long for Patrick's employer to realize that having Patrick doing his job, and also picking up the work that Douglas used to do was bad. So they opened a new position, at a higher pay grade, hoping to induce a more senior developer to step in. And wouldn't you know, after 6 months, they found a perfect candidate, who had just finished a short six month stint at one of their competitors: Douglas! .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "Rob's co-worker needed to write a loop that iterated across every element in an array. This very common problem, and you'd imagine that a developer would use one of the many common solutions to this problem. The language, in this case, is JavaScript, which has many possible options for iterating across an array. Perhaps that buffet of possible options was too daunting. Perhaps the developer thought to themselves, \"a for each loop is easy mode, I'm a 10x programmer, and I want a 10x solution!\" Or perhaps they just didn't know what the hell they were doing. Regardless of why, this is the result: try { var index = 0; while (true) { var nextItem = someArray[index]; doSomethingWithItem(nextItem); index++; } } catch (e) { } This code iterates across the array in an infinite while loop, passing each item to doSomethingWithItem. Eventually, they hit the end of the array, and someArray[index] starts returning undefined. Somewhere, deep in doSomethingWithItem, that causes an exception to be thrown. That is how we break out of the loop- eventually something chokes on an undefined value, which lets us know there's nothing left in the array. Which puts us in an interesting position- if anyone decided to add better error handling to doSomethingWithItem, the entire application could break, and it wouldn't be obvious why. This is a peak example of \"every change breaks somebody's workflow\", but specifically because that workflow is stupid. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
