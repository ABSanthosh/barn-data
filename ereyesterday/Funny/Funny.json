    "description": "Let's gobble up some delicious Thanksgiving fails! Every family has that one legendary story of the funniest way someone ruined Thanksgiving. For some, it's the time an aunt forgot to turn the stove on, and let a turkey \"cook\" in a cold oven for ten hours. For others, the most memorable moments were the time the dog ate an entire tray of stuffing, or when an uncle burnt cookies so badly that the whole house smoked up. There are plenty of ways to mess up a big meal for tons of people, and the pressure's on to make it as good as possible. Mistakes certainly do happen, as the people below can tell you. It isn't just food that can mess up someone's turkey day. As one person shared, the lines at the grocery store can be super long, and it takes ages just to pay for your food. Another person managed to get their food, but then discovered they'd bought moldy food. Too bad they discovered this on Thanksgiving day… Oh well, there's always next year! Up next, this audacious 20-year-old office worker called out a colleague, saying they \"told a nepo baby that he only has his job because of his uncle,\" and adding that he was only pretending to be humble.",

It takes a particular kind of human being to have that mentality during a family gathering, but if there's any event that attracts this type of personality, it's most certainly Thanksgiving.Here, we have an entitled sister-in-law who insisted on making a number of Thanksgiving dishes despite the fact that the Redditor expressed a desire to take the lead, as she was the host after all. On top of this tension going into the day, the sister-in-law was difficult once she arrived as well. They ended up only having half an hour to eat because of her shenanigans, so when she left without helping clean the plates, the Redditor couldn't help but notice that she didn't take her precious gravy home with her. That's where the petty revenge comes in!Keep scrolling below for the full story and for the best reactions from folks in the comments section.

    "description": "Today is holiday in the US, where we celebrate a cosplay version of history with big meals and getting frustrated with our family. It's also a day where we are thankful- usually to not be at work, but also, thankful to not work with Brad. Original --Remy Anita parked outside the converted garage, the printed graphic reading Global Entertainment Strategies (GES) above it. When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct. “Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner. He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him. “Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.” “I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.” Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.” Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl. “We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.” Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.” Sticky Escalation Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harder to read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that have nothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed with development. -Anita Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?” “Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!” “I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him. The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!” Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space. “Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!” Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage. The Avalanche “Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business. “Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica. We even have a wiki for our framework!” “Well, listen to this. The day after you quit, the AC unit in the garage broke. I came into work to see Brad crying in a corner in his office. All of the sticky notes had curled in the humidity and fallen to the floor. The day after he got us all copies of Word. “Too bad we still don’t know what the title of the game is.” [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "description": "Today, we're going to start with the comment before the method. /** * The topology type of primitives to render. (optional) * Default: 4 * Valid values: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] * * @param mode The mode to set * @throws IllegalArgumentException If the given value does not meet * the given constraints * */ This comes from Krzysztof. As much as I dislike these JavaDoc style comments (they mostly repeat information I can get from the signature!), this one is promising. It tells me the range of values, and what happens when I exceed that range, what the default is, and it tells me that the value is optional. In short, from the comment alone I have a good picture of what the implementation looks like. With some caveats, mind you- because that's a set of magic numbers in there. No constants, no enum, just magic numbers. That's worrying. Let's look at the implementation. public void setMode(Integer mode) { if (mode == null) { this.mode = mode; return ; } if (((((((mode!= 0)\u0026\u0026(mode!= 1))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 2))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 3))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 4))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 5))\u0026\u0026(mode!= 6)) { throw new IllegalArgumentException(((\"Invalid value for mode: \"+ mode)+ \", valid: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\")); } this.mode = mode; } This code isn't terrible. But there are all sorts of small details which flummox me. Now, again, I want to stress, had they used enums this method would be much simpler. But fine, maybe they had a good reason for not doing that. Let's set that aside. The obvious ugly moment here is that if condition. Did they not understand that and is a commutative operation? Or did they come to Java from LISP and miss their parentheses? Then, of course, there's the first if statement- the null check. Honestly, we could have just put that into the chain of the if condition below, and the behavior would have been the same, or they could have just used an Optional type, which is arguably the \"right\" option here. But now we're drifting into the same space as enums- if only they'd used the core language features, this would be simpler. Let's focus, instead, on one last odd choice: how they use whitespace. mode!= 0. This, more than anything, makes me think they are coming to Java from some other language. Something that uses glyphs in unusual ways, because why else would the operator only get one space on one side of it? Which also makes me think the null check was written by someone else- because they're inconsistent with it there. So no, this code isn't terrible, but it does make me wonder a little bit about how it came to be.

    "description": "Cats are meowjestic creatures - and we're not just saying that because we love cats. They really are meowjestic. They can be large and floofy, small and skinny, tiny and regal, and liquid or solid. Yes, you read that correctly. Cats come in both liquid and solid form (although not at the same time). Have you ever tried to pick up your cat and it feels like picking up a sack of potatoes? That's because they were in their liquid form, where they turned their bones into noodles. It's both hissterical and ameowzing, as we don't know any other creature on the planet that can do such a thing. To prove our point, we've collected a whole dinner table full of hilarious pictures of literally liquid cats that are meltier than the butter on your Thanksgiving rolls. If you would pick them up, they would slide right out of your hands. If you would put them in a bowl, they would become the bowl. It's a purrrely feline phenomenon, and one of the many reasons why cats are superior to other pets. But just like the butter on your Thanksgiving rolls, they won't stay liquid for long, so scroll down to soak up all of these feline goodness before it's too late!",
