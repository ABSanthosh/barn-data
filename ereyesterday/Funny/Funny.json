    "description": "Being the 'new guy' in a workplace is never an easy role to assume. No one wants to be the outsider, the one who doesn't know anyone's name, and needs someone else to guide them through the office's etiquette and unspoken rules. It usually takes months, or the arrival of another new employee, for one to finally be rid of the 'new guy' label, and even then, it still takes time until you completely blend in.Usually, when you're the new employee, you tend to stay out of trouble. You want to fit in, so you don't make a fuss. You first learn everything that there is to learn about your boss and your coworkers, and only when you have gathered enough information (and obviously, the confidence) do you start to consider the possibility of offering a change.Never have I ever heard of a determined new hire who, within their first month in a company, managed to make a change that would benefit everyone around them, but that is what happened in the story below.",

    "description": "Normally, it would be prudent to keep your eyes open for any issues you might see outside of your immediate role. The common-sense rationalization of this is that it's often better to address problems early on before they become bigger ones that are more costly and serious to manage.You might expect the reaction for doing so to be praise and recognition, but surprisingly, this couldn't be further from the truth. Unfortunately, some people just don't like to hear about when something is wrong; they'd much rather just carry on down the highway to disaster rather than lift a finger and take an exit.For instance (and this will happen many times in your career), if you're expressing problems with a plan or changes to a process that your boss has shared with you, they'll usually just wind up branding you as \"negative,\" \"old school,\" or \"resistant to change.\" Of course, when exactly what you were warning about transpires, they'll pull out the proverbial brush and shovel and sweep everything under the rug, pretending nothing happened at all before repeating the process.Meanwhile, if you're reporting a workplace hazard, chances are there's some manager immediately above you or some bean counter further up the chain who won't appreciate having a risk outlined in writing. They might have even already been aware that it existed, but now that someone has pointed it out, they have to do something about it before it becomes a liability.",

We studied hard to get into a good college, were the captain of our sports team, and pawticipated in many extra-curricular activities. But none of that, and we really mean none, could compare to what Robin Lee Graham did when he was a teenager. At the young age of 16 years old, he decided to set sail across the world, traveling over 33,000 nautical miles with no help except for the companionship of his cute sailor cats he brought with him.He faced many hardships along the way, including losing his mast shortly after departing, and even having to change boats midway due to extensive damage to his ship. He said, however, that the cats helped him deal with loneliness and feel comforted. So this proves it once and for all that cats are the best companions to have, right?

To begin with they have no boundaries or social awareness, making them poor team players and even worse when they receive negative feedback. Then you have the whole lack of impulse control, which as any factory worker will tell you is a one way ticket to living a short life. And then you add on top of all of this their terribly lacking persistence with regard to their jobs, and you get probably the worst workers on the planet.Especially when you consider that they can be petulantly persistent when it comes to food. So it should come as little surprise that working in a Pâwtisserie would be a poor hiring decision on the part of the owner.",

    "description": "Early in my career, I had the misfortune of doing a lot of Crystal Reports work. Crystal Reports is another one of those tools that lets non-developer, non-database savvy folks craft reports. Which, like so often happens, means that the users dig themselves incredible holes and need professional help to get back out, because at the end of the day, when the root problem is actually complicated, all the helpful GUI tools in the world can't solve it for you. Michael was in a similar position as I was, but for Michael, there was a five alarm fire. It was the end of the month, and a bunch of monthly sales reports needed to be calculated. One of the big things management expected to see was a year-over-year delta on sales, and they got real cranky if the line didn't go up. If they couldn't even see the line, they went into a full on panic and assumed the sales team was floundering and the company was on the verge of collapse. Unfortunately, the report was spitting out an error: \"A day number must be between 1 and the number of days in the month.\" Michael dug in, and found this \"delight\" inside of a function called one_year_ago: Local StringVar yearStr := Left({?ReportToDate}, 4); Local StringVar monthStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 5, 2); Local StringVar dayStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 7, 2); Local StringVar hourStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 9, 2); Local StringVar minStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 11, 2); Local StringVar secStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 13, 2); Local NumberVar LastYear; LastYear := ToNumber(YearStr) - 1; YearStr := Replace (toText(LastYear),'.00' , '' ); YearStr := Replace (YearStr,',' , '' ); //DateTime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec); //Year + Month + Day + Hour + min + sec; // string value DateTime(ToNumber(YearStr), ToNumber(MonthStr), ToNumber(dayStr), ToNumber(HourStr), ToNumber(MinStr),ToNumber(SecStr) ); We've all seen string munging in date handling before. That's not surprising. But what's notable about this one is the day on which it started failing. As stated, it was at the end of the month. But which month? February. Specifically, February 2024, a leap year. Since they do nothing to adjust the dayStr when constructing the date, they were attempting to construct a date for 29-FEB-2023, which is not a valid date. Michael writes: Yes, it's Crystal Reports, but surprisingly not having date manipulation functions isn't amongst it's many, many flaws. It's something I did in a past life isn't it?? The fix was easy enough- rewrite the function to actually use date handling. This made a simpler, basically one-line function, using Crystal's built in functions. That fixed this particular date handling bug, but there were plenty more places where this kind of hand-grown string munging happened, and plenty more opportunities for the report to fail.

    "description": "…the average American, I think, has fewer than three friends. And the average person has demand for meaningfully more, I think it's like 15 friends or something, right? - Mark Zuckerberg, presumably to one of his three friends Since even the President of the United States is using ChatGPT to cheat on his homework and make bonkers social media posts these days, we need to have a talk about AI. Right now, AI is being shoe-horned into everything, whether or not it makes sense. To me, it feels like the dotcom boom again. Millipedes.com! Fungus.net! Business plan? What business plan? Just secure the domain names and crank out some Super Bowl ads. We'll be RICH! In fact, it's not just my feeling. The Large Language Model (LLM) OpenAI is being wildly overvalued and overhyped. It's hard to see how it will generate more revenue while its offerings remain underwhelming and unreliable in so many ways. Hallucination, bias, and other fatal flaws make it a non-starter for businesses like journalism that must have accurate output. Why would anyone convert to a paid plan? Even if there weren't an income problem—even if every customer became a paying customer—generative AI's exorbitant operational and environmental costs are poised to drown whatever revenue and funding they manage to scrape together. Lest we think the problem is contained to OpenAPI or LLMs, there's not a single profitable AI venture out there. And it's largely not helping other companies to be more profitable, either. A moment like this requires us to step back, take a deep breath. With sober curiosity, we gotta explore and understand AI's true strengths and weaknesses. More importantly, we have to figure out what we are and aren't willing to accept from AI, personally and as a society. We need thoughtful ethics and policies that protect people and the environment. We need strong laws to prevent the worst abuses. Plenty of us have already been victimized by the absence of such. For instance, one of my own short stories was used by Meta without permission to train their AI. The Worst of AI Sadly, it is all too easy to find appalling examples of all the ways generative AI is harming us. (For most of these, I'm not going to provide links because they don't deserve the clicks): We all know that person who no longer seems to have a brain of their own because they keep asking OpenAI to do all of their thinking for them. Deepfakes deliberately created to deceive people. Cheating by students. Cheating by giant corporations who are all too happy to ignore IP and copyright when it benefits them (Meta, ahem). Piles and piles of creepy generated content on platforms like Youtube and TikTok that can be wildly inaccurate. Scammy platforms like DataAnnotation, Mindrift, and Outlier that offer $20/hr or more for you to \"train their AI.\" Instead, they simply gather your data and inputs and ghost the vast majority of applicants. I tried taking DataAnnotation's test for myself to see what would happen; after all, it would've been nice to have some supplemental income while job hunting. After several weeks, I still haven't heard back from them. Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) block job applications from ever reaching a human being for review. As my job search drags on, I feel like my life has been reduced to a tedious slog of keyword matching. Did I use the word \"collaboration\" somewhere in my resume? Pass. Did I use the word \"teamwork\" instead? Fail. Did I use the word \"collaboration,\" but the AI failed to detect it, as regularly happens? Fail, fail, fail some more. Frustrated, I and no doubt countless others have been forced to turn to other AIs in hopes of defeating those AIs. While algorithms battle algorithms, companies and unemployed workers are all suffering. Horrific, undeniable environmental destruction. Brace yourself: a 14 year-old killed himself with the encouragement of the chatbot he'd fallen in love with. I can only imagine how many more young people have been harmed and are being actively harmed right now. The Best of AI? As AI began to show up everywhere, as seemingly everyone from Google to Apple demanded that I start using it, I had initially responded with aversion and resentment. I never bothered with it, I disabled it wherever I could. When people told me to use it, I waved them off. My life seemed no worse for it. Alas, now AI completely saturates my days while job searching, bringing on even greater resentment. Thousands of open positions for AI-based startups! Thousands of companies demanding expertise in generative AI as if it's been around for decades. Well, gee, maybe my hatred and aversion is hurting my ability to get hired. Am I being a middle-aged Luddite here? Should I be learning more about AI (and putting it on my resume)? Wouldn't I be the bigger person to work past my aversion in order to learn about and highlight some of the ways we can use AI responsibly? I tried. I really tried. To be honest, I simply haven't found a single positive generative AI use-case that justifies all the harm taking place. So, What Do We Do? Here are some thoughts: don't invest in generative AI or seek a job within the field, it's all gonna blow. Lobby your government to investigate abuses, protect people, and preserve the environment. Avoid AI usage and, if you're a writer like me, make clear that AI is not used in any part of your process. Gently encourage that one person you know to start thinking for themselves again. Most critically of all: wherever AI must be used for the time being, ensure that one or more humans review the results. li { margin: 0.5em; list-style: circle } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
