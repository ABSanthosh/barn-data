    "description": "You know, in someways it is arguable that the acronym DIY was meant to set us up for failure. Something in the nature of doing it yourself has this haphazard feeling to it, as though each and every one of us is that unhinged that simple physics and logistics are completely lost on us and no matter what we do we will end up making the problem worse before it has a chance of getting better (also known as calling a professional repair person to fix the original damage and what we added to it).And if this list is anything to go by, then yes, we humans are truly terrible at building stuff without experience. Some of the ideas and executions that people had in this list truly boggle the mind and will likely cause heart attacks amongst anyone in the construction industry. So take this as your fair warning, because some of these fails are so bad, you have to wonder how they stayed upright for more than two seconds.",

    "description": "When using something that doesn't belong to you, the correct thing to do is to always respect it, whatever it may be. However, do these rules still apply when it belongs to your sister?Many sisters like to claim the 'what's mine is yours' mindset, but only when it benefits themselves. And many times, sharing is a common act of sisterly love, but the minute that is taken for granted, that is when things may turn a bit sour.  Picture this: You got your first car about a year ago. You're a bit of a clean freak and take pride in keeping it in pristine condition. Then enters your younger sister, filthy cowboy boots and all. She goes out to feed the farm animals every day, never bothers to clean her boots, and expects you to drive her around while refusing to take them off. At this point, you'd think they're attached to her feet by the level of her selfish refusal. So what's a girl to do? Easy. Tell your sister either she's taking those mud-stained shoes off before entering your car, or she can learn how to take the bus, just as you used to…the choice is hers.",

    "description": "Unfortunately, we know that we cannot adopt every cat that we see. We want to, but there is a limit. That doesn't mean that we can't help as many cats as possible. TNR - trap–neuter–return - oftentimes, this is the best solution. If you see a stray cat that is struggling, and you want to help, one of the best things that you can do for them is take them to a vet and help them get better. And although we know that not everyone can do this either, we certainly encourage as many people as possible to do it if they can. That is what this person thought they were going to do - they just wanted to give this cat a quick TNR, and that is it. But the cat was too sick to be left outside again. It would not have survived on its own out there. So, this rescuer took it as a sign… that this cat was meant to be theirs. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

When you have a live-in floofy emperor who dictates what you do, when you do it, and exactly how you do it - life becomes much easier.Some people may ask themselves \"Isn't it a crazy schedule to adhere to? Wouldn't it be too much to constantly go on a whim of someone else?\", and we say to these people a loud, clear, meowing \"No!\". Living with a cat makes everything better. Why would we mind putting \"Cute cuddling time\" or \"Snuggling meeting\" into our calendars? Who would refuse that?Having more cats in your life is never bad. On the contrary - it's the best thing a person can achieve. This is why being a Crazy Cat Lady is actually a compliment, never an insult. So, when you need more cats in your life? We usually turn to consuming cute cat memes. It's floofing funny, and brings more cat joy into your life.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Sometimes, you see some code which is perfectly harmless, but illustrates an incredibly dangerous person behind them. The code isn't good, but it isn't bad in any meaningful way, but it was written by a cocaine addled Pomeranian behind the controls of a bulldozer: it's full of energy, doesn't know exactly what's going on, and at some point, it's going to hit something important. Such is the code which Román sends us. public static function registerUser($name, $lastName, $username, ...) { // 100% unmodified first lines, some comments removed $tsCreation = new DateTime(); $user = new User(); $name = $name; $lastname = $lastName; $username = $username; $user-\u003esetUsername($username); $user-\u003esetLastname($lastname); $user-\u003esetName($name); // And so on. } This creates a user object and populates its fields. It doesn't use a meaningful constructor, which is its own problem, but that's not why we're here. We're here because for some reason the developer behind this function assigns some of the parameters to themselves. Why? I don't know, but it's clearly the result of some underlying misunderstanding of how things work. But the real landmine is the $lastname variable- which is an entirely new variable which has slightly different capitalization from $lastName. And you've all heard this song many times, so sing along with the chorus: \"this particular pattern shows up all through the codebase,\" complete with inconsistent capitalization. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
