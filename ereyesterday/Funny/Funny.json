Any one of the wargames that Games Workshop makes could be your entire life - they could certainly be your entire paycheck. They were playing Kill Team and Warhammer 40k 9th edition at the same time, and it didn't help that each of these games shares some language that doesn't actually mean the same thing in the different contexts. Plus, the 9th Edition of 40k just isn't as fun as the new one - they got a taste of 10 and they're sticking with it, despite my most fervent attempts.",

    "description": "Nothing in this world can make us happy about going back to work tomorrow. Literally nothing….except for cats. Cats make everything better! From their smooshy little faces to their purrfect paws, we're only mildly obsessed with them and their serotonin-producing nature. However, there is one type of cat that we especially love, and those cats are pallas' cats. Known as the world's most expressive cat, pallas' cats are truly one-of-a-kind, and also one of the floofiest! So, to soften (literally) our arrival to the work week, we brought some pictures of purrfect pallas' cats and an adorable abundance of floofy fluffballs.If you thought normal cats were floofy, just wait until you feast your eyes on these fluffy felines. Move over Maine coons and Norweigan forest cats, pallas' cats are here to get their hairs all over your house, your clothes, even your food, and they've got the floofy tails to prove it. Embrace these fluffballs like the warm, pawsitive creatures they are and we hope you have a very soft beginning of your work week. Bye!",

    "description": "What is the etiquette these days when it comes to public transport? Not to sound like an \"old man shouting at clouds,\" but it really does seem like etiquette—along with mutual unspoken respect and other social decorum—has gone completely out the window. Still, along with that, and theoretically causal of the previous issue is that people just seem generally more entitled and individualistic, it's all about \"me me me\" and \"what can be done that benefits me\" rather than partaking in the upholding of the greater good…The greater good.Still, it seems like entitlement and not poor public transport etiquette behavior was the issue here. Normally, as a younger, able-bodied person, you'd give up your seat in a second for someone who was elderly, pregnant, or otherwise handicapped. Otherwise, seats sort of tend to operate on a first-come-first-serve basis, and just being \"previously pregnant\" (aka a mother) doesn't really qualify you to be entitled to a seat… Even though, evidently, some parents seem to think it does.Besides, kids have a whole lot of years of standing ahead of them so they might as well start with standing somewhere. Plus, their joints don't ache yet, so really, they should be the last ones to get a seat.",

    "description": "Is it really even petty revenge when you revoke your recently ex-employers' access to your personal software that you paid for and were only using for your work out of goodwill? At that point, you're just reclaiming what was rightfully yours, to begin with, and since the company had been effectively leasing your software license, you might as well go ahead and send them a bill for however long they had been using it, too. It's not your fault if they can't properly invest in the resources needed to complete the work of their business. Whereas the poster of this story acts like they were doing some sort of nefarious deed, this really reads as the most professional and fair thing they could have done in the situation. After six years of service, you would think that they could have treated their departing employee with a little more tact and compassion.",

The text doesn't match the image, the pricing is goofy, or some other mixup that are just bound to happen with a database of zillions of products uploaded by a plethora of barely-literate mountain village drop-shippers. So I don't usually feature them, preferring to find something with at least a chance of being a creative new bug. But I uncovered a story by Mark Johansen about his favorite author, and decided that since so many of you obviously DO think online retail flubs are noteworthy, what the heck. Here is Mark's plain-text story, and a handful of bungled products. They're not exactly bugs, but at least some of them are about bugs. \"I guess I missed your item about failings of AI, but here's one of my favorites: Amazon regularly sends me emails of books that their AI thinks I might want to read, presumably based on books that I've bought from them in the past. So recently I got an email saying, \"The newest book by an author you've read before!\" And this new book was by ... Ernest Hemingway. Considering that he died almost 60 years ago, it seemed unlikely that he was still writing. Or where he was sending manuscripts from. Lest you wonder, it turned out it was a collection of letters he wrote when he was, like, actually alive. The book was listed as authored by Ernest Hemingway rather than under the name of whomever compiled the letters.\" What do we all think? Truly an Error'd, or just some publisher taking marketing advice from real estate agents? Let me know. A while back, Christian E. \"Wanted to order some groceries from nemlig.com. So I saw the free (labelled GRATIS) product and pressed the info button and this popped up. Says that I can get the product delivered from the 1st of January (today is the 2nd of march). Have to wait for a while then...\" Not too much longer, Christian.   Reliable Michael R. muttered \"msofas either have their special math where 5% always is GBP10 or they know already what I want to buy.\"   \"Do not feed to vegetarians.\" warns Jeffrey B.   \"Not sure how this blue liquid works for others, but there has been no sucking here yet,\" reports Matthias.   \"Nice feature but I am not sure if it can fit in my notebook,\" writes Tiger Fok.   Lady-killer Bart-Jan is preparing for Friday night on the town, apparently. Knock 'em dead, Bart! \"It says 'Fragrance for Men'. Which is fine, as long as it also does a good job deterring the female mosquitoes.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "Damiano's company had more work than staff, and opted to hire a subcontractor. When hiring on a subcontractor, you could look for all sorts of things. Does their portfolio contain work similar to what you're asking them to do? What's the average experience of their team? What are the agreed upon code quality standards for the contract? You could do that, or you could hire the cheapest company. Guess which one Damiano's company did? If you're not sure, look at this code: if(jQuery('table').hasClass('views-view-grid')){ var EPid= \".views-view-grid\"; jQuery(EPid +' td').each(function(){ if(!jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-article-in-right-sidebar') \u0026\u0026 !jQuery(this).parent().parent().parent().parent().parent().hasClass('view-offers-in-right-sidebar')){ var title = jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").html(); var body = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-body\").html(); var datetime = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-event-date-time\").html(); var flyer = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-flyer a\").attr(\"href\"); var imageThumb = jQuery(this).find(\".field-name-field-image-thumb\").html(); var readMore = 'jQuery(this).find(\"h2 a\").attr(\"href\")+'\" class=\"read-more\"\u003eREAD MORE'; var str = ''; if(title != null \u0026\u0026 title != \"\"){ if(imageThumb \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != \"\" \u0026\u0026 imageThumb != null) str = str + imageThumb; if(datetime \u0026\u0026 datetime != \"\" \u0026\u0026 datetime != null) str = str + ''+datetime+''; str = str + ''+title+''; str = str + body + ''; str = str + readMore; } if(flyer) str = str + ''\"\u003etype == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e'; str = str + ''; jQuery(this).children('.node').remove(); jQuery(this).append(str); } }); This was in a Drupal project. The developer appointed by the contractor didn't know Drupal at all, and opted to build all the new functionality by dropping big blobs of JavaScript code on top of it. There's so much to hate about this. We can start with the parent().parent() chains. Who doesn't love to make sure that your JavaScript code is extremely fragile against changes in the DOM, while at the same time making it hard to read or understand. I like that we create the EPid variable to avoid having a magic string inside our DOM query, only to still need to append a magic string to it. It hints at some programming by copy/paste. Then there's the pile of HTML-by-string-concatenation, which is always fun. But this couldn't be complete without this moment: type == \"events\"){ echo 'download the flyer'; }else {echo 'download the article';} ?\u003e Oh yeah, buried in this unreadable blob of JavaScript there's a little bonus PHP, just to make it a little spicier. The entire project came back from the contractor in an unusable state. The amount of re-work just to get it vaguely functional quickly outweighed any potential cost savings. And even after that work went it, it remained a buggy, unmaintainable mess. Did management learn their lesson? Absolutely not- they bragged about how cheaply they got the work done at every opportunity, and entered into a partnership agreement with the subcontractor. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
