So when a unionized restaurant comes around, you might think it's a good idea. Look at that, you have mandatory breaks, your job is clearly spelled our, and you get benefits and such. Exciting, right? Apparently not. According to this bartender, they had a horrible time and had to do a little malicious compliance to change the tide.  You see, the servers and bartenders didn't split tip. So the servers would get all the tip and bartenders wouldn't get anything. Because everyone usually sat at a table, and bartenders weren't allowed to tend tables. Yet, they still found themselves bussing tables and running food for the servers…",

    "description": "Hi there, feline fam. There are a few situations where we would consider it \"appropriate\" for a pet cat to be outside. The first would be if the cat had an epically enormous cat-shaped cat house that their owner built them. The second, and similarly, would be if your cat had a closed patio, which they could spend time outside without fear of escaping. The third would be if you have harness-trained your cats and take them on walks outside. That's it. Especially in months with harsh weather, like now where it's pawsitively sweltering outside.All of this to say that we get where this neighbor is coming from in the post below. They felt their neighbor's cat choose them after being left to survive outside, and now they're wondering what they should do. They're moving, and they don't want to abandon the cat that clearly feels safe with them, but the cat still isn't \"theirs\" to begin with. What would you do?Fluff. Chaos. Drama!

    "description": "\"This keeps giving me a primary key violation!\" complained one of Nancy's co-workers. \"Screw it, I'm dropping the primary key constraint!\" That was a terrifying thing to hear someone say out loud. Nancy decided to take a look at the table before anyone did anything they'd regret. CREATE TYPE record_enum AS ENUM('parts'); CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS parts ( part_uuid VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL, record record_enum NOT NULL, ... ... ... PRIMARY KEY (part_uuid, record) ); This table has a composite primary key. The first is a UUID, and the second is an enum with only one option in it- the name of the table. The latter column seems, well, useless, and certainly isn't going to make the primary key any more unique. But the UUID column should be unique. Universally unique, even. Nancy writes: Was the UUID not unique enough, or perhaps it was too unique?! They weren't able to explain why they had designed the table this way. Nor were they able to explain why they kept violating the primary key constraint. It kept happening to them, for some reason until eventually it stopped happening, also for some reason.

    "description": "Adam's organization was going through a period of rapid growth. Part of this growth was spinning up new backend services to support new functionality. The growth would have been extremely fast, except for one thing applying back pressure: for some reason, spinning up a new service meant recompiling and redeploying all the other services. Adam didn't understand why, but it seemed like an obvious place to start poking at something for improvement. All of the services depended on a library called \"ServiceLib\"- though not all of them actually used the library. The library was a set of utilities for administering, detecting, and interacting with services in their environment- essentially a homegrown fabric/bus architecture. It didn't take long, looking at the source control history, to understand why there was a rebuild after the release of every service. Each service triggered a one line change in this: enum class Services { IniTechBase = 103, IniTechAdvanced = 99, IniTechFooServer = 102, … } Each service had a unique, numerical identifier, and this mapped them into an enumerated type. Adam went to the tech lead, Raymond. \"Hey, I've got an idea for speeding up our release process- we should stop hard coding the service IDs in ServiceLib.\" Raymond looked at Adam like one might examine an over-enthusiastic lemur. \"They're not hard-coded. We store them in an enum.\" Eventually Raymond got promoted- for all of their heroic work on managing this rapidly expanding library of services. The new tech lead who came on was much more amenable to \"not storing rapidly changing service IDs in an enum\", and \"not making every service depend on a library they often don't need\", and \"putting admin functionality in every service because they're linked to that library whether they like it or not.\" Eventually, ServiceLib became its own service, and actually helped- instead of hindered- delivering new functionality. Unfortunately, with no more highly visible heroics to deliver functionality, the entire department became a career dead end. Sure, they delivered on time and under budget consistently, but there were no rockstar developers like Raymond on the team anymore, the real up-and-comers who were pushing themselves.
