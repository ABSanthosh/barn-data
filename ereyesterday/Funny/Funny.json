Turns out, they were trying to hoodwink the whole company into thinking they were taking a catastrophic loss when they were actually hitting record profits. The shareholders aren't going to like this…Every time an employee tries to negotiate a raise, the company is going through a 'downturn in profits' or a 'shift in salary budgeting' that allows them to shuffle off the lowly hard workers at the bottom. We're just looking for a 5% pay increase to cover inflation so we can buy groceries without taking a proverbial pay cut, but okay, if the company is drowning, I suppose saying no to a raise is better than getting fired, right? Well, the dude in this next story was fed up with the lies from his company and decided to get even with the higher-ups by revealing actual profit margins with his coworkers, giving everybody the leverage they needed to negotiate a respectable raise, akin to what the shareholders might be pocketing.",

    "description": "If you had a $90 cake sitting in your fridge at home, I imagine you'd eat every last bite of it. You can get a fantastic cake for a fraction of the price. This woman just decided to shell out 70€, or roughly $90, for an expensive cake. Along with having the money to buy such a pricey dessert, this woman also has a really inexpensive babysitter. Babysitting is one of those jobs that parents want to pay well for: their kid is the most valuable thing in the world for them, and they're buying the peace of mind. They feel comfortable going out to a workout class or a date night because they trust their babysitter. It can be even more beneficial if the babysitter is a family member who the kids have always known, which is the case with this 17-year-old niece. For a while, the arrangement was a win-win: the niece got some spending money to buy coffee, and the aunt got a cheap sitter. Now that this expensive cake is causing a rift in the family, this person is being urged not to let their teen babysit for the family any more… or at least she'll have to raise her rates to pay off that slice or two of cake. As people also mentioned, a two-week-old cake is basically garbage, and the teen should be thankful if she doesn't contract any kind of food poisoning from it! Up next, this 22-year-old was thrown a surprise party that they adamantly did not want, and when they fled the shindig, they \"woke up to over 50 texts\" from surprised family members.",

We love them, you love them, people love them, even other animals love cats. Our cats make us better versions of ourselves, so why not spread all those purrfectly wholesome feelings around? Everyone deserves love and the opportunity to be a better person, so one correctional facility in Indiana took a chance, and it pawsitively paid off!They implemented a feline foster program that allowed inmates with good behavior to foster homeless shelter cats. Not only did the cats get a hooman to love them, but it actually increased behavior in the prison and reduced the amount of fights! Of course, we could have told you this would happen, but it's nice to see it happen in real life. Be the hooman your floofy, fabulous feline thinks you are.

They always know what time it is right now, and their strict schedule actually helps us, humble hoomans, to keep track of our lives. Cats are fiercely independent and can take care of themselves. It's not that they don't love us, but they are definitely sharp and capable. And finally, they know their family - other hoomans and animals of the house - and they're very smart to know that they are part of something.CAT MEMES ARE THE SILLIEST SMARTEST MEMES.

For the last twenty six years or so there's always something bizarre happening that you might be able to project, but a few of them just don't make any sense at all. We started putting comics online because it seemed clear to us that nobody in their right mind would publish them physically, and it ended up being a whole thing. In 2003 we started a donation drive called Child's Play in the most aggressive way a charity has ever been started I think, and its modern incarnation is an entity that is at the forefront of using VR and AR as therapeutic tools - one that is about to release a certification process for technicians who merge technology and child life. It seemed like more people should be able to go to E3, but they couldn't, and so we made another thing and that one is still going - we're coming up on PAX Unplugged, and the three-day badges just sold out. We made a D\u0026D Podcast before podcasts were super a thing, and it's entirely possible we started Actual Play accidentally. In fact, that's how I came to know the Secretary of State, Steve Hobbs: He's a fan of Acquisitions Incorporated, somehow…?",

    "description": "Matt needed to add a new field to a form. This simple task was made complicated by the method used to save changes back to the database. Let's see if you can spot what the challenge was: public int saveQualif(String docClass, String transcomId, String cptyCod, String tradeId, String originalDealId, String codeEvent, String multiDeal, String foNumber, String codeInstrfamily, String terminationDate, String premiumAmount, String premiumCurrency, String notionalAmount, String codeCurrency, String notionalAmount2, String codeCurrency2, String fixedRate, String payout, String maType, String maDate, String isdaZoneCode, String tradeDate, String externalReference, String entityCode, String investigationFileReference, String investigationFileStartDate, String productType, String effectiveDate, String expiryDate, String paymentDate, String settInstrucTyp, String opDirection, String pdfPassword, String extlSysCod, String extlDeaId, String agrDt) throws TechnicalException, DfException That's 36 parameters right there. This function, internally, creates a data access object which takes just as many parameters in its constructor, and then does a check: if a field is non-null, it updates that field in the database, otherwise it doesn't. Of course, every single one of those parameters is stringly typed, which makes it super fun. Tracking premiumAmount and terminationDate as strings is certainly never going to lead to problems. I especially like the pdfPassword being stored, which is clearly just the low-security password meant to be used for encrypting a transaction statement or similar: \"the last 4 digits of your SSN\" or whatever. So I guess it's okay that it's being stored in the clear in the database, but also I still hate it. Do better! In any case, this function was called twice. Once from the form that Matt was editing, where every parameter was filled in. The second time, it was called like this: int nbUpdates = incoming.saveQualif(docClass, null, null, null, null, null, multiDeal, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null, null); As tempted as Matt was to fix this method and break it up into multiple calls or change the parameters to a set of classes or anything better, he was too concerned about breaking something and spending a lot of time on something which was meant to be a small, fast task. So like everyone who'd come before him, he just slapped in another parameter, tested it, and called it a day. Refactoring is a problem for tomorrow's developer.

    "description": "There's the potential for endless installments of \"programmers not understanding how UUIDs work.\" Frankly, I think the fact that we represent them as human readable strings is part of the problem; sure, it's readable, but conceals the fact that it's just a large integer. Which brings us to this snippet, from Capybara James. if (!StringUtils.hasLength(uuid) || uuid.length() != 36) { throw new RequestParameterNotFoundException(ErrorCodeCostants.UUID_MANDATORY_OR_FORMAT); } StringUtils.hasLength comes from the Spring library, and it's a simple \"is not null or empty\" check. So- we're testing to see if a string is null or empty, or isn't exactly 36 characters long. That tells us the input is bad, so we throw a RequestParameterNotFoundException, along with an error code. So, as already pointed out, a UUID is just a large integer that we render as a 36 character string, and there are better ways to validate a UUID. But this also will accept any 36 character string- as long as you've got 36 characters, we'll call it a UUID. \"This is valid, really valid, dumbass\" is now a valid UUID. With that in mind, I also like the bonus of it not distinguishing between whether or not the input was missing or invalid, because that'll make it real easy for users to understand why their input is getting rejected.
