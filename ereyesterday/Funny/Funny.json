It's the other way around that I am avoiding–there is no one I know that I like enough to have them join my office. I simply don't love my friends enough to want to see them 8 hours a day, 5 times a week.Moreover, working with someone you know outside of work can lead to a lot of unnecessary complications. What happens if they get into trouble? What happens if you find out they might lose their job? Do you tell them? Do you try to prevent it? Well, that is the dilemma the manager in the story below was facing, which made me even more sure of my decision to never send a job application to any of my friends.Keep scrolling to read the full story and find out why exactly.",

    "description": "Workplaces have a remarkable talent for blurring the line between professional and personal life until it barely exists at all. In the modern employment circus, management's solution to every problem is to treat employees' time, privacy, and sleep schedules as communal property, ripe for the taking whenever a scheduling crisis hits. The idea of a day off becomes a quaint relic, and the expectation that workers should be reachable at all hours is baked into the culture, as if everyone secretly lives in the break room and dreams in company slogans.",

TNR - trap–neuter–return - oftentimes, this is the best solution. If you see a stray cat that is struggling, and you want to help, one of the best things that you can do for them is take them to a vet and help them get better. And although we know that not everyone can do this either, we certainly encourage as many people as possible to do it if they can. That is what this person thought they were going to do - they just wanted to give this cat a quick TNR, and that is it. But the cat was too sick to be left outside again. It would not have survived on its own out there. So, this rescuer took it as a sign… that this cat was meant to be theirs. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

When you have a live-in floofy emperor who dictates what you do, when you do it, and exactly how you do it - life becomes much easier.Some people may ask themselves \"Isn't it a crazy schedule to adhere to? Wouldn't it be too much to constantly go on a whim of someone else?\", and we say to these people a loud, clear, meowing \"No!\". Living with a cat makes everything better. Why would we mind putting \"Cute cuddling time\" or \"Snuggling meeting\" into our calendars? Who would refuse that?Having more cats in your life is never bad. On the contrary - it's the best thing a person can achieve. This is why being a Crazy Cat Lady is actually a compliment, never an insult. So, when you need more cats in your life? We usually turn to consuming cute cat memes. It's floofing funny, and brings more cat joy into your life.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Sometimes, you see some code which is perfectly harmless, but illustrates an incredibly dangerous person behind them. The code isn't good, but it isn't bad in any meaningful way, but it was written by a cocaine addled Pomeranian behind the controls of a bulldozer: it's full of energy, doesn't know exactly what's going on, and at some point, it's going to hit something important. Such is the code which Román sends us. public static function registerUser($name, $lastName, $username, ...) { // 100% unmodified first lines, some comments removed $tsCreation = new DateTime(); $user = new User(); $name = $name; $lastname = $lastName; $username = $username; $user-\u003esetUsername($username); $user-\u003esetLastname($lastname); $user-\u003esetName($name); // And so on. } This creates a user object and populates its fields. It doesn't use a meaningful constructor, which is its own problem, but that's not why we're here. We're here because for some reason the developer behind this function assigns some of the parameters to themselves. Why? I don't know, but it's clearly the result of some underlying misunderstanding of how things work. But the real landmine is the $lastname variable- which is an entirely new variable which has slightly different capitalization from $lastName. And you've all heard this song many times, so sing along with the chorus: \"this particular pattern shows up all through the codebase,\" complete with inconsistent capitalization. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
