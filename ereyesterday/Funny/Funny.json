    "description": "Rescuing a kitten is one of the kindest things that you can do. It's an adventure, it's a story to tell, and it means having someone to love and be loved by for years and years. Usually. Usually, when you rescue a cat, even if it turns out to be an adventure that is a little different than you expected, it's still something that you cherish, it's still one of the best things that you can do. Then… other times, it goes very differently than what you expected. When this teenager and her brother rescued two kittens off the street, she didn't think much of it. The kitten jumped on tables, played and ran, meowed and followed her and her brother around. A normal kitten… right? Sort of. It turns out that the \"normal\" kittens that were rescued that day were actually not kittens at all. They were puma cubs - who just looked like itty bitty kittens. And although it was hard to do the right thing and say goodbye to these cuties, this teenager still did it, all in the hopes of giving this cub a chance to go back out into the wild.",

    "description": "Feline fam, we have to admit we're tired. It's not just the age, that many of you aging millennials must feel, it's the things we have to endure. We were once kids and essentially nothing happened. But from some point on, some major world events, most of them aren't the best, suddenly started occurring - and they just never seemed to stop since then. Are we wrong in this assessment? Because we feel this is an accurate description of this timeline.But despite the ongoing absolute mess of the world, there's one thing that keeps us grounded and happy, in our lane, and kept together - cats. Cats are this calming force of nature that we all have right inside our homes. Isn't that ameowzing? It is to us, at least, when we think about it. There might be another major historical event right around the corner (and we really don't wish for another, oh god, please, no) - but at least we have our cats to help us through it.If you're feeling the dread of another major historical event that's about to happen - we gathered some cat memes to help you through it. Especially if you don't have a cat in your immediate surroundings like you'd have at home. Scroll down for some very relatable cat comedy - it's like having a comforting cat right on your lap.",

Instead, one must read the dictionary, front to back, in addition to the Urban Dictionary online. Saying what you mean is not what's \"in\" in corporate settings, mostly because higher-ups have no idea what they're talking about and instead disguise their incompetence as intellect using corporate platitudes. What even is \"synergy\" in the workplace? Why should I care? Spoiler: I shouldn't, and neither should you.In this next story, a corporate employee is finally fed up with his boss's workplace speak and decides to take his words literally. This employee was told to \"think outside of the box\" and create a presentation for a client, which is not in his job description. So, he decides to put his boss's pleas for boxy thinking to rest with one memorable presentation. Scroll to read.",

    "description": "There are things which are true. Regular expressions frequently perform badly. They're hard to read. Email addresses are not actually regular languages, and thus can't truly be validated (in all their many possible forms) by a pure regex. These are true. It's also true that a simple regex can get you most of the way there. Lucas found this in their codebase, for validating emails. function echeck(str) { var at=\"@\"; var dot=\".\"; var lat=str.indexOf(at); var lstr=str.length; var ldot=str.indexOf(dot); if (str.indexOf(at)==-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(at)==-1 || str.indexOf(at)==0 || str.indexOf(at)==lstr){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(dot)==-1 || str.indexOf(dot)==0 || str.indexOf(dot)==lstr){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(at,(lat+1))!=-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.substring(lat-1,lat)==dot || str.substring(lat+1,lat+2)==dot){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(dot,(lat+2))==-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(\" \")!=-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } return true; } It checks that the string contains an \"@\", and the \"@\" is not at the beginning or end of the string. Then it does the same check for a \".\". Then it checks that there isn't a second \"@\". Then it checks that there are at least two non-\"@\" characters before the \".\". Then it checks that there's at least one \".\" after the \"@\". Then it checks that there are no spaces. Like a regex, I don't think this covers the entire space of valid and invalid email addresses, but that's just because the email address spec is complicated. It likely qualifies as \"good enough\", on that front. But it's the most awkward way to express that series of tests, especially since they create variables which might be useful, but never use them, thus calling str.indexOf many, many times. The awkwardness becomes more obvious with the way it outputs the same error message in multiple branches. Outputs them using alert I might add, which is the kind of choice that should send someone to the Special Hell™.

    "description": "The title of this week's column is making me hungry. To start off our WTFreitag, Reinier B. complains \"I did not specify my gender since it's completely irrelevant when ordering a skateboard for my daughter. That does not mean it is correct to address me as Dear Not specified.\" I wonder (sincerely) if there is a common German-language personal letter greeting for \"Dear somebody of unknown gender\". I don't think there is one for English. \"To Whom It May Concern\" is probably the best we can do.   \"A coworker shared this phishing email he got,\" reported Adam R. \"Even the scammers have trouble with their email templating variable names too.\" (It's there at the end).   Mathematically-minded Marcel V. thinks these numbers don't figure. \"The update process of my Overwatch game left me wondering. I am quite certain my computer does not have 18 Exabytes of harddisk space to reclaim. However, if bytes were meant, then how is it trying to reclaim the last .65 bytes??\"   Big Spender Jeff W. humblebrags \"If you have to ask, you can't afford it.\"   Finishing up for the week, Bruce R. signs off with \"This dialog from CNN seems a little overdone.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
