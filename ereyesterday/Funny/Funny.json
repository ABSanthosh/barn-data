Don't get us wrong, having nineteen cats sounds like a dream - a giant, fluffy dream filled with cuddle puddles and cat hair. Unfortunately, we don't have room in our house for nineteen cats, but if we had a farm, well, that's a whole other story. Luckily, we don't have nineteen cats to adopt, but the guy in this post does!While working on his farm, this man found not one, not two, but nineteen cute kitties in his barn after discovering that it is a popular place for people to dump their unwanted pets (don't even get us started on these people). Well, there's always plenty of work to do around a farm, so at the very least, mice and gophers won't be a problem anymore. Scroll down to see all of these kitties snuggled into one giant feline family photo and read more of the story below!",

You did the dirty work for them, and now the employers' games are brought to the surface. If you are unsure that you're working for a toxic company/boss, just see what they do when a new hire comes along like the one in this story.This woman has worked at her company for years and was encouraged by many to apply for a promotional position. After multiple rounds of interviews, she was passed up and told to train the person who did land the promotion, a colleague named Dave who has only been at the company for about a year. Well, she says, \"No thanks!\" Why? If she was \"under-qualified,\" she shouldn't be training anyone. Scroll to read.",

You can't just make up your own list of rules for everyone else to abide by, even if you're their legal family. That's a level on entitlement that will surely get you kicked out of the house, but luckily, the daughter in this story starts charging her live-in step dad rent and gives him a curfew among other household duties to pay for his stay.Why is she doing this? Well, hopefully you've read part one of the tale. Her stepdad has been trying to dictate what she wears, when her boyfriend is allowed over, and generally makes sour remarks in her home despite having lived there rent-free. Everything has since changed, and karma has a funny way of doing it's thing… really well.",

    "title": "CodeSOD: An Argument With QA",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/an-argument-with-qa",
    "description": "Markus does QA, and this means writing automated tests which wrap around the code written by developers. Mostly this is a \"black box\" situation, where Markus doesn't look at the code, and instead goes by the interface and the requirements. Sometimes, though, he does look at the code, and wishes he hadn't. Today's snippet comes from a program which is meant to generate PDF files and then, optionally, email them. There are a few methods we're going to look at, because they invested a surprising amount of code into doing this the wrong way. protected override void Execute() { int sendMail = this.VerifyParameterValue(ParamSendMail); if (sendMail == -1) return; if (sendMail == 1) mail = true; this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textGetCustomerForAccountStatement); IList customers = AccountStatement.GetCustomersForAccountStatement(); if (customers.Count == 0) return; StreamWriter streamWriter = null; if (mail) streamWriter = AccountStatement.CreateAccountStatementLogFile(); CreateAccountStatementDocumentEngine engine = new CreateAccountStatementDocumentEngine(); foreach (CustomerModel customer in customers) { this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textCustomerAccountStatementBegin + customer.DisplayName.ToString()); // Generate the PDF, optionally send an email with the document attached engine.Execute(customer, mail); if (mail) { AccountStatement.WriteToLogFile(customer, streamWriter); this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textLogWriting); } } engine.Dispose(); if (streamWriter != null) streamWriter.Close(); } Now, this might sound unfair, but right off the bat I'm going to complain about separation of concerns. This function both generates output and emails it (optionally), while handling all of the stream management. Honestly, I think if the developer were simply forced to go back and make this a set of small, cohesive methods, most of the WTFs would vanish. But there's more to say here. Specifically, let's look at the first few lines, where we VerifyParameterValue. Note that this function clearly returns -1 when it fails, which is a very C-programmer-forced-to-do-OO idiom. But let's look at that method. private int VerifyParameterValue(string name) { string stringValue = this.GetParam(name, string.Empty); bool isValid = this.VerifyByParameterFormat(name, stringValue); if (!isValid) return -1; int value = -1; try { value = Convert.ToInt32(stringValue); } catch (Exception e) { this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", e.Message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return -1; } return value; } We'll come back to the VerifyByParameterFormat but otherwise, this is basically a wrapper around Convert.ToInt32, and could easily be replaced with Int32.TryParse. Bonus points for spamming the log output with loads of newlines. Okay, but what is the VerifyByParameterFormat doing? private bool VerifyByParameterFormat(string name, string value) { string parameter = string.Empty; string message = string.Empty; if (value.Length != 1) { parameter = Properties.Resources.textSendMail; message = string.Format(Properties.Resources.textSendMailNotValid, value); this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return false; } string numbers = \"0123456789\"; char[] characters = value.ToCharArray(); for (byte i = 0; i \u003c characters.Length; i++) { if (numbers.IndexOf(characters[i]) \u003c 0) { parameter = Properties.Resources.textSendMail; message = Properties.Resources.textSendMailNotValid; this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return false; } } return true; } Oh, it just goes character by character to verify whether or not this is made up of only digits. Which, by the way, means the CLI argument needs to be an integer, and only when that integer is 1 do we send emails. It's a boolean, but worse. Let's assume, however, that passing numbers is required by the specification. Still, Markus has thoughts: Handling this command line argument might seem obvious enough. I'd probably do something along the lines of \"if (arg == \"1\") { sendMail = true } else if (arg != \"0\") { tell the user they're an idiot }. Of course, I'm not a professional programmer, so my solution is way too simple as the attached piece of code will show you. There are better ways to do it, Markus, but as you've shown us, there are definitely worse ways. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
