    "description": "If the world isn't in a confusing enough state currently, we now have such entitled people that they are stealing from you and then complaining about what they stole… Yep, you read that right. Can you believe we've gotten to this point? Sometimes people act in such perplexing ways that it truly makes you wonder who the heck is raising these psychos?  In the case of this insane entitlement, it was a person taking advantage of a good host. A woman hosted a small little dinner party with her close friends. They were obviously allowed to bring a +1 and she still treated them just as well as her friends. She said the usual, \"Make yourself at home!\" Which, we all know, just means feel comfortable, maybe help yourself to food, that sort of thing. It does NOT mean you can take anything you fancy… That's theft.",

There are quite a few signs here that might make a person do just that! I often encounter door signs that will instruct a person to use the other door. So then I walk around the corner searching for said entrance, only to be pointed towards another sign. Sometimes they're written unclearly, or the arrows don't face the right way, and I waste a lot of time trying to figure out where to go into this place! It's honestly pretty funny when this happens organically, and quite a few people here have snapped funny photos of the times this happened to them. From yard sale signs that are more confusing than helpful, to inspirational signs that inspire the opposite message, to signs that just got plain messed up, you can have a laugh at a bunch of them down below.Next, read about what happened when this 29-year-old employee confronted her 42-year-old boss who took a team-building experience way too seriously: 'My boss is giving me the cold shoulder.'",

And the main indicator, as you may have guessed by the title of this article is that… when cats still act like cats, then things are going to be just fine in the world/Every cat owner knows that when a cat is not feeling great - whether from sickness or from stress, its behavior changes completely. You start missing the shenanigans all of a sudden. But as long as your cat is committing crimes around your house, you know that things are going to be fine.

We have yet to see a cat actively participate in someone taking revenge over a breakup. Until today. Today, we saw it for the first time.

    "title": "Classic WTF: The Core Launcher",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/classic-wtf-the-core-launcher",
    "description": "As our vacation continues, we might want to maybe play some video games. What could possibly go wrong? Original --Remy “You R haccking files on my computer~!!!” Charles Carmichael read in a newly-submitted support ticket, “this is illigle and I will sue your whoal compiny. But first I will tell every1 nevar to buy youre stupid game agin.” The bizarre spelling and vague threats were par for the course. After all, when you market and sell a game to the general public, you can expect a certain percentage of bizarre and vague customer communications. When that game is a popular MMPORG (no, not that one), that percentage tends to hover around the majority. It took a few days to see the pattern, but the string of emails started to make sense. “Uh, when did your game become spyware?” said one email. “Are you doing this just to force us to play more often?” another customer asked. “I know you have a lot of AI and whatnot, so I think it leaked out. Because now my whole computer wants me to play all the time… like my dog bringing me his chew toy.” As it turned out, the problem started happening a few days after an update to the core launcher was published. The core launcher was one of those terrifically handy executables that could download all of the assets for any single game that was published, scan them for completeness, replace bad or missing files, and then launch the game itself after the user signed in. It’s a must-have for any modern multiplayer online game. This core launcher could also patch itself. Updates to this executable were fairly rare, but had to be made whenever a new title launched, as was recently the case. Obviously, a large battery of automated and manual testing is done to ensure that there are no problems after publishing, yet something seemed to have slipped through the cracks… at least for some customers. After a whole lot of back and forth with customers, Chris was able to compile dozens of detailed process lists, startup program launches, newly installed applications, and firewall usage rules. As he pored over the collected information, one program was always there. It was Interfersoft’s fairly popular anti-virus suite. It took a solid two days of research, but Chris was finally able to uncover the new “feature” in Interfersoft’s Advanced Firewall Protector that was causing the problems. Like many similar anti-virus suites, when a program wanted to use network services, Interfersoft would pop-up a dialog confirming that the program’s operation was authorized. Behind the scenes, if the user allowed the program, Interfersoft would make a hash of that executable file, and would allow its communications to pass through the firewall every time thereafter. Users who had this antivirus solution installed had, at one time, allowed the launcher through their firewall. The first time they connected to the game server after the launcher patch was released, their executable would download its patch, apply it to itself, and restart itself. But then of course, the executable hash didn’t match any more, and the program was no longer able to go through the firewall. Rather than asking users if they wanted to allow the program to connect to the internet, in the new version of Interfersoft’s suite, the anti-virus system would rename the executable and move it. The logic being that, if it was changed after connecting to the internet, it was probably malware. But what did they name the file? Program.exe. Unless that was already taken, then they would name it Progra~1.exe or Progra~2.exe and so forth. And where did they place this file? Well, in the root directory of C of course! This naming convention, as it turned out, was a bad idea. Back in the very old, Windows 3 days, Windows did not support long file names. It wasn’t until Windows NT 3.5.1 (and then Windows 95 later) that long file names were supported. Prior to this, there were a lot of limitations on what characters could be part of a filename or directory, one of those being a space. In fact, any space in a shell command execution was seen to be an argument. This made sense at the time so you could issue a command like this: C:\\DOOM\\doom.exe -episode 3 That, of course, would start Doom at episode 3. However, when Microsoft switched to Long File Names, it still had to support this type of invocation. So, the way the windows cmd.exe shell works is simple. You pass it a string like this: C:\\Program Files\\id Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe -nomusic And it will try to execute “C:\\Program” as a file, passing it “Files\\id Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe -nomusic” as argument to that executable. Of course, this program doesn’t exist, so it will then try to execute “C:\\Program Files\\id”, passing it “Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe -nomusic” as argument. If this doesn’t exist, it will try to execute “C:\\Program Files\\id Software\\Doom\\Doom.exe” passing in “-nomusic” as an argument. It would continue this way until a program existed and started, or until the path was depleted and no program was to be found. And on top of all this, desktop shortcuts on Windows are mostly just invocations of the shell, with the actual location of the executable you want to start (the path) stored in text inside the shortcut. When you click it, it reads this path, and passes it to the shell to start up the program. And this is why Intersoft’s process of moving files to the root directory was the worst decision they could have made. Most of the programs installed in Windows at this time were installed to the “Program Files” directory by default. This was a folder in the root (C:\\) directory. So when you wanted to launch, for instance, Microsoft Word, the shortcut on your Desktop pointed to “C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word.exe” or Firefox, which was in “C:\\Program Files\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\”. But thanks to Program.exe in the root directory, you ended up doing this: C:\\Program.exe “Files\\Microsoft\\Office\\Word.exe” and C:\\Program.exe “Files\\Mozilla\\Firefox\\” So, when users were trying to launch their application – applications which resided in the Program Files directory on their C drive – they were getting the launcher instead. Chris explained all of this in great detail to Interfersoft, all the while explaining to customers how to fix the problem with the firewall. It helped some, but several hundred customers ended up closing their accounts a direct result of the “hacking”. A few weeks later, Interfersoft started responding to the issues with their customers. Fortunately (for them), they decided to not use their own auto-update process to deliver a new version of the firewall.

    "title": "Classic WTF: Take the Bus",
    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/classic-wtf-take-the-bus",
    "description": "It's summer break time, here at TDWTF, and based on this classic, we shouldn't be traveling by bus. Original --Remy Rachel started working as a web developer for the local bus company. The job made her feel young, since the buses, the IT infrastructure, and most of their back-office code was older than she was. The bus fare-boxes were cash only, and while you could buy a monthly pass, it was just a little cardboard slip that you showed the driver. Their accounting system ran on a mainframe, their garage management software was a 16-bit DOS application. Email ran on an Exchange 5.5 server. In charge of all of the computing systems, from the web to DOS, was Virgil, the IT director. Virgil had been hired back when the accounting mainframe was installed, and had nestled into his IT director position like a tick. The bus company, like many such companies in the US, was ostensibly a private company, but chartered and subsidized by the city. This created a system which had all the worst parts of private-sector and public-sector employment merged together, and Virgil was the master of that system. Rachel getting hired on was one of his rare “losses”, and he wasn’t shy about telling her so. “I’ve been doing the web page for years,” Virgil said. “It has a hit counter, so you can see how many hits it actually gets- maybe 1 or 2 a week. But management says we need to have someone dedicated to the website.” He grumbled. “Your salary is coming out of my budget, you know.” That website was a FrontPage 2000 site, and the hit-counter was broken in any browser that didn’t have ActiveX enabled. Rachel easily proved that there was far more traffic than claimed, not that there was a lot. And why should there be? You couldn’t buy a monthly pass online, so the only feature was the ability to download PDFs of the hand-schedules. With no support, Rachel did her best to push things forward. She redesigned the site to be responsive. She convinced the guy who maintained their bus routes (in a pile of Excel spreadsheets) to give her regular exports of the data, so she could put the schedules online in a usable fashion. Virgil constantly grumbled about wasting money on a website nobody used, but as she made improvements, more people started using it. Then it was election season. The incumbent mayor had been complaining about the poor service the bus company was offering, the lack of routes, the costs, the schedules. His answer was, “cut their funding”. Management started talking about belt-tightening, Virgil started dropping hints that Rachel was on the chopping block, and she took the hint and started getting resumes out. A miracle occurred. The incumbent mayor’s campaign went off the rails. He got caught siphoning money from the city to pay for private trips. A few local cops mentioned that they’d been called in to cover-up the mayor’s frequent DUIs. His re-election campaign’s finances show strange discrepancies, and money had come in that couldn’t be tied back to a legitimate contribution. He tried to get a newly built stadium named after himself, which wasn’t illegal, but was in poor taste and was the final straw. He dropped out of the election, paving the way for “Mayor Fred” to take over. Mayor Fred was a cool Mayor. He wanted to put in bike lanes. He wanted to be called “Mayor Fred”. He wanted to make it easier for food trucks to operate in the city. And while he shared his predecessor’s complaints about the poor service from the bus company, he had a different solution, which he revealed while taking a tour of the bus company’s offices. “I’m working right now to secure federal grants, private sector funding, to fund a modernization project,” Mayor Fred said, grinning from behind a lectern. “Did you know we’re paying more to keep our old buses on the road for five years than it would cost to buy new buses?” And thus, Mayor Fred made promises. Promises about new buses, promises about top-flight consultants helping them plan better routes, promises about online functionality. Promises that made Virgil grumble and whine. Promises that the mayor… actually kept. New buses started to hit the streets. They had GPS and a radio communication system that gave them up-to-the-second location reporting. Rachel got put in charge of putting that data on the web, with a public API, and tying it to their schedules. A group of consultants swung through to help, and when the dust settled, Rachel’s title was suddenly “senior web developer” and she was in charge of a team of 6 people, integrating new functionality to the website. Virgil made his opinion on this subject clear to her: “You are eating into my budget!” “Isn’t your budget way larger?” Rachel asked. “Yes, but there’s so much more to spend it on! We’re a bus company, we should be focused on getting people moving, not giving them pretty websites with maps that tell them where the buses are! And now there’s that new FlashCard project!” FlashCard was a big project that didn’t involve Rachel very much. Instead of cash fares and cardboard passes, they were going to get an RFID system. You could fill your card at one of the many kiosks around the city, or even online. “Online” of course, put it in Rachel’s domain, but it was mostly a packaged product. Virgil, of all people, had taken over the install and configuration, Rachel just customized the stylesheet so that it looked vaguely like their main site. Rachel wasn’t only an employee of the bus company, she was also a customer. She was one of the first in line to get a FlashCard. For a few weeks, it was the height of convenience. The stop she usually needed had a kiosk, she just waved her card at the farebox and paid. And then, one day, when her card was mostly empty and she wasn’t anywhere near a kiosk, she decided to try filling her card online. Thank you for your purchase. Your transaction will be processed within 72 hours. That was a puzzle. The kiosks completed the transaction instantly. Why on Earth would a website take 3 days to do the same thing? Rachel became more annoyed when she realized she didn’t have enough on her card to catch the bus, and she needed to trudge a few blocks out of her way to refill the card. That’s when it started raining. And then she missed her bus, and had to wait 30 minutes for the next one. Which is when the rain escalated to a downpour. Which made the next bus 20 minutes late. Wet, cold, and angry, Rachel resolved to figure out what the heck was going on. When she confronted Virgil about it, he said, “That’s just how it works. I’ve got somebody working full time on keeping that system running, and that’s the best they can do.” Somebody working full time? “Who? What? Do you need help? I’ve done ecommerce before, I can-” “Oh no, you’ve already got your little website thing,” Virgil said. “I’m not going to let you try and stage a coup over this.” With an invitation like that, Rachel decided to figure out what was going on. It wasn’t hard to get into the administration features of the FlashCard website. From there, it was easy to see the status of the ecommerce plugin for processing transactions: “Not installed”. In fact, there was no sign at all that the system could even process transactions at all. The only hint that Rachel caught was the configuration of the log files. They were getting dumped to /dev/lp1. A printer. Next came a game of hide-and-seek- the server running the FlashCard software wasn’t in their tiny data-center, which meant she had to infer its location based on which routers were between her and it. It took a few days of poking around their offices, but she eventually found it in the basement, in an office. In that office was one man with coke-bottle glasses, an antique continuous feed printer, a red document shredder, and a FlashCard kiosk running in diagnostic mode. “Um… can I help you?” the man asked. “Maybe? I’m trying to track down how we’re processing credit card transactions for the FlashCard system?” The printer coughed to life, spilling out a new line. “Well, you’re just in time then. Here’s the process.” He adjusted his glasses and peered at the output from the printer: TRANSACTION CONFIRMED: f6ba779d22d5;4012888888881881;$25.00 The man then kicked his rolly-chair over to the kiosk. The first number was the FlashCard the transaction was for, the second was the credit card number, and the third was the amount. He punched those into the kiosk’s keypad, and then hit enter. “When it gets busy, I get real backed up,” he confessed. “But it’s quiet right now.” Rachel tracked down Virgil, and demanded to know what he thought he was doing. “What? It’s not like anybody wants to use a website to buy things,” Virgil said. “And if we bought the ecommerce module, the vendor would have charged us $2,000/mo, on top of an additional transaction fee. This is cheaper, and I barely have enough room in my budget as it is!” [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
