    "description": "Ah the holiday season, a time for love, a time to celebrate life, a time to fight with your family and cause a scene so dramatic that no one talks to each other for the next ten months until it is forgotten and it is time to start planning the next holiday season. And seeing as yesterday was Thanksgiving we would not be at all surprised if you have had a little more than a little taste of what that maelstrom is like. So we figured you might need some help cooling off, which is why we made this list of hilarious cat child memes to help you calm down after a tumultuous Thanksgiving with your own family.From the simple-minded house cat who cannot help but hoover dry crunchies and puke them back up, to the freeloading feline who has a warning attached to its collar for all those who might try to feed him, to the surprising fur baby who not only loves a visit to the vet, but also particularly enjoys the sink at the vet's.",

    "description": "Next time someone asks why the younger generation changes jobs every few years, instead of sticking with the same company for 30 years, you can simply send them this story as an explanation. The sad reality is that it is much easier to get further in your career by changing workplaces every few years than by staying in the same place. Companies today would rather hire external employees than promote employees from within, which means people find themselves changing jobs altogether in order to move ahead in their careers.The employee in this Reddit story sure tried to get a promotion within their current workplace and was even encouraged by their boss to interview for a better position. However, the company instead hired an external candidate, whom OP (original poster) then had to train. Three weeks later the new hire quits, and OP is left to pick up the pieces, but this time with no motivation or desire to do any of the work…Keep scrolling to read the full story. Up next, check out this story of a boss who fired a hardworking employee, and then begged them to come back a week later.",

    "description": "Retail workers of the world are in for a crazy day each and every Black Friday. Just in case they wanted to try and escape that day, many employers refuse to let their employees take that day off. It's so important to the sales of the stores that they need all hands on deck. They know that as soon as they open their doors to the customers, there will be a wave of people rushing to get their hands on the newest tech, the hottest clothes, or whichever toy is THE holiday toy for kids (in previous years, it was Tickle-Me-Elmo or Elsa toys). Each year there's at least one toy that people will try their hardest to get before the other customers grab them all up. All employees can do is try to control the crowds and get everyone into the checkout line safely and quickly. However, as the people below can tell you, working Black Friday can quickly become a harrowing experience that they'll never want to repeat. At least one employee had a positive Black Friday experience, though. One grocery store worker wrote that they loved working the day after Thanksgiving because, after all, who buys food when they have a full fridge of delicious leftovers? Up next, this person is refusing to buy their wife a plane ticket, just because she's working hard to pull herself out of debt!",

But this month, the message sent Today 08:02, telling me I had to pay by tomorrow 21-Nov was sent on... 21-Nov. The amount I owed was missing the decimal point. They then apologised for freaking me out, but got that wrong too, by not replacing the placeholder for the amount I really needed to pay. \"   Faithful Michael R. levels a charge of confusion against what looks like.. Ticketmaster, maybe? \"My card indeed ends with 0000. Perhaps they do some weird math with their cc numbers to store them as numerics.\" It's not so much weird math as simply reification. Your so called \"credit card number\" is not actually a number; it is a digit string. And the last four digits are also a digit string.   Marc Würth, who still uses Facebook, gripes that their webdevs also don't understand the difference between numbers and digit strings. \"Clicking on Mehr dazu (Learn more), tells me: \u003e About facebook.com on older versions of mobile browsers \u003e [...] \u003e Visit facebook.com from one of these browsers, if it’s available to download on your mobile device: \u003e [...] \u003e Firefox (version 48 or higher) \u003e [...] Um...

Grumbles DC \"Somebody please explain to me how 5+2+2+2+2+2+2+0.75+2+2=23. If WebAssign itself can't even master basic arithmetic, how can I trust it teaching me calculus? \"   Finally Andrew C. has a non-mathematical digit or two to share, assuming you're inclined to obscure puns. \"As well as having to endure the indignity of job seeking, now I get called names too!\" This probably requires explanation for those who are not both native speakers of the King's English and familiar with cryptographic engineering.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "description": "Today is holiday in the US, where we celebrate a cosplay version of history with big meals and getting frustrated with our family. It's also a day where we are thankful- usually to not be at work, but also, thankful to not work with Brad. Original --Remy Anita parked outside the converted garage, the printed graphic reading Global Entertainment Strategies (GES) above it. When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct. “Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner. He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him. “Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.” “I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.” Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.” Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl. “We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.” Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.” Sticky Escalation Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harder to read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that have nothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed with development. -Anita Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?” “Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!” “I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him. The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!” Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space. “Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!” Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage. The Avalanche “Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business. “Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica. We even have a wiki for our framework!” “Well, listen to this. The day after you quit, the AC unit in the garage broke. I came into work to see Brad crying in a corner in his office. All of the sticky notes had curled in the humidity and fallen to the floor. The day after he got us all copies of Word. “Too bad we still don’t know what the title of the game is.” [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
