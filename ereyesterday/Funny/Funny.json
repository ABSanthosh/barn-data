    "description": "When it comes to encountering a completely reckless and aggressive driver who has no business on the road, it's difficult to know what to do. Sometimes they can be extremely volatile and it's scary to confront them. Sometimes the road rage in drivers is so overwhelming, you truly can't predict what they are going to do next. But sometimes they are so heinous, you feel an obligation to approach them. For instance, when they are an idiot driver AND a litter bug.  The combo is atrocious. Sure, decades ago you wouldn't even bat an eye at someone throwing trash out of their window, but now it's nauseating. After everything we've learned about the environment you're still going to be trashing it like that? Come on. I thought humanity has evolved at least a tiny bit from that?! Apparently not, but some of us have and just like this Redditor, some of us make sure there is instant karma when you're driving like a clown and littering.",

    "description": "If bug cats are not our friends, then why are they friend shaped? It's a question we wish we could answer, but we don't know how. Like many of you, cat lovers and feline fanatic fans, we consider big cats just cats, despite their size. We want to cuddle them like cats, play with them like cats, pet them like cats, and tell them they're the cutest angel we've ever seen like cats. Is this really too much to ask? We feel like nature is being unfair here. We honestly want to give love to all cats, and that includes big cats. We don't care about their teeth and claw size, they are still tiny little babies who need a scratch under their chins.And if you doubt that premise for one second, let us assure you we come with receipts. And you already know what kind of receipts we provide here around Cheezburger, in any topic - memes, and loads of them. So here we bring you the proof with big cat memes that have the same cat energy all cats have.",

    "description": "People who have never had cats in their lives have all kinds of misconceptions about them. People think that cats are aloof or that cats are mean, but that's not true. The vast majority of cats are neither of these things, and of the cats that do seem aloof or mean… there is usually a reason. If you treat a cat well, if you give them the love and respect and time that they need, usually, even the \"meanest\" cat will open up to you and show you affection. Today's story just reinforces this notion. A demon cat - that's what this poor little thing was called throughout his life. He was mean to everyone except for his owner and her husband. But once the owner passed and the cat was adopted by her sister, his real colors started to show. In that house, he was neglected sad, so he was \"mean\" to people. In his new house, he got the things that he truly needed, and just like that, he became the sweetest cuddle-bug .",

    "description": "For testing networking systems, load simulators are useful: send a bunch of realistic looking traffic and see what happens as you increase the amount of sent traffic. These sorts of simulators often rely on being heavily multithreaded, since one computer can, if pushed, generate a lot of network traffic. Thus, when Jonas inherited a heavily multithreaded system for simulating load, that wasn't a surprise. The surprise was that the developer responsible for it didn't really understand threading in Java. Probably in other languages too, but in this case, Java was what they were using. public void startTraffic() { Configuration.instance.inititiateStatistics(); Statistics.instance.addStatisticListener(gui); if (t != null) { if (t.isAlive()) { t.destroy(); } } t = new Thread(this); t.start(); } Look, this is not a good way to manage threads in Java. I don't know if I'd call it a WTF, but it's very much a \"baby's first threading\" approach. There are better abstractions around threads that would avoid the need to manage thread instances directly. I certainly don't love situations where a Runnable also manages its own thread instance. This is almost certainly a race condition, but I don't know if this function is called from multiple threads (but I suspect it might be). But what's more interesting is where this code gets called. You see, starting a thread could trigger an exception, so you need to handle that: public void run() { while (true) { try { loaderMain.startTraffic(); break; } catch (Exception e) { System.out.println(\"Exception in main loader thread!\"); e.printStackTrace(); } } } Inside of an infinite loop, we try to start traffic. If we succeed, we break out of the loop. If we fail, well, we try and try again and again and again and again and again and again… Jonas writes: Since I'm the only one that dares to wade through the opaque mess of code that somehow, against all odds, manages to work most of the time, I get to fix it whenever it presents strange behavior. I suspect it's going to present much more strange behavior in the future. [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",

    "description": "Sebastian is now maintaining a huge framework which, in his words, \"could easily be reduced in size by 50%\", especially because many of the methods in it are reinvented wheels that are already provided by .NET and specifically LINQ. For example, if you want the first item in a collection, LINQ lets you call First() or FirstOrDefault() on any collection. The latter option makes handling empty collections easier. But someone decided to reinvent that wheel, and like so many reinvented wheels, it's worse. public static LoggingRule FindFirst (this IEnumerable rules, Funcbool\u003e predicate) { foreach (LoggingRule rule in rules) { return rule; } return null; } This function takes a list of logging rules and a function to filter the logging rules, starts a for loop to iterate over the list, and then simply returns the first element in the list, thus exiting the for loop. If the loop doesn't contain any elements, we return null. From the signature, I'd expect this function to do filtering, but it clearly doesn't. It just returns the first element, period. And again, there's already a built-in function for that. I don't know why this is exists, but I especially dislike that it's so misleading. There's only one positive to say about this: if you did want to reduce the size of the framework by 50%, it's easy to see where I'd start.
