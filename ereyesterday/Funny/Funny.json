    "description": "There are so many rules and social constructs one has to follow during a hiring process, it often becomes impossible to remember it all. What your resume must look like, what words you should use or avoid, how to answer certain questions during an interview, and what questions you should always ask the other side. You are constantly being carefully examined under a magnifying glass, and it is downright exhausting. You'd think that once you get a job offer, you can take a breath, but no. Even then there are do's and don'ts you should remember if you want to secure that job once and for all. For example, negotiating the salary. If you're not careful, you can make one grave mistake that might take away the offer completely, and leave you with nothing at all. This is exactly what happened to the job candidate in the story down below.We must say, we were surprised by what happened to this candidate, and rules or no rules, they may have seriously dodged a bullet when their job offer was revoked.",

    "description": "Expertise means nothing to entitled people. You can have 10 years of experience in your field, but you know who thinks he's better than you? That random client who spent 5 minutes Googling the issue, and who now wants to berate you for not solving the problem in a timely manner. This seems to be especially true for those who work in the IT field. Even though a lot of people aren't especially good at navigating their computer issues, they'll still snap at the very people who are trying to help them. Apparently, a lot of people will refuse to check if their computer is plugged in, which is one of the first questions an IT person will ask if a computer won't start up. To work around this, the IT guy will ask them to check something on the prong of the computer cord, which allows the customer or client to save face if their device wasn't plugged in. For other issues, they tend to easily solve things that an average Joe could never figure out. That didn't make this client act nicely towards his IT person, and he ended up paying a huge price for that decision. Next, read about one person who was so inspired by their HOA's rules that they got petty about their parking situation: \"My HOA will learn that I absolutely live by the letter of the law.\"",

    "description": "Good meowrning, I Can Has-ers. We think all cats are beautiful, from the meowjestic maine coons to the standard-issue tabby cats that are a dime a dozen. Each cat has their own unique traits that make them beautiful and we don't need a fancy or rare fur pattern to convince us that each cat is the most beautiful cat in the world. That's because as long as the cat wants love, trusts us, and considers us its family (or servants, as the case may be), we think that that is where the beauty comes from.Now, don't get us wrong, our jaws still drop when we see a beautiful bengal…we have even been known to stop in our tracks for a sultry serval cat every so often. But those physical things don't matter to us, and they also didn't to the wholesome people in this post! They found a stray street cat in need, fell in love with him and adopted him, only to realize later that he is a \"designer breed\" that is not only uncommon, but expensive.

    "description": "Jenny had been perfectly happy working on a series of projects for her company, before someone said, \"Hey, we need you to build a desktop GUI for an existing API.\" The request wasn't the problem, per se. The API, on the other hand, absolutely was. The application Jenny was working on represented a billing contract for materials consumed at a factory. Essentially, the factory built a bunch of individual parts, and then assembled them into a finished product. They only counted the finished product, but needed to itemize the billing down to not only the raw materials that went into the finished product, the intermediate parts, but also the toilet paper put in the bathrooms. All the costs of operating the factory were derived from the units shipped out. This meant that the contract itself was a fairly complicated tree structure. Jenny's application was meant to both visualize and allow users to edit that tree structure to update the billing contract in sane, and predictable ways, so that it could be reviewed and approved and when the costs of toilet paper went up, those costs could be accurately passed on to the customer. Now, all the contract management was already implemented and lived library that itself called back into a database. Jenny just needed to wire it up to a desktop UI. Part of the requirements were that line items in the tree needed to have a special icon displayed next to them under two conditions: if one of their ancestors in the tree had been changed since the last released contract, or if they child was marked as \"inherit from parent\". The wrapper library wasn't documented, so Jenny asked the obvious question: \"What's the interface for this?\" The library team replied with this: IModelInheritFromParent : INotifyPropertyChanged { bool InheritFromParent {get; set;} } \"That covers the inheritance field,\" Jenny said, \"but that doesn't tell me if the ancestor has been modified.\" \"Oh, don't worry,\" the devs replied, \"there's an extension method for that.\" public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeA); Extension methods in C# are just a way to use syntactic sugar to \"add\" methods to a class: IModelTypeA does not have a GetChangedIndicator method, but because of the this keyword, it's an extension method and we can now invoke aInstance.GetChangedIndicator(). It's how many built-in .Net APIs work, but like most forms of syntactic sugar, while it can be good, it usually makes code harder to understand, harder to test, and harder to debug. But Jenny's main complaint was this: \"You can't raise an event or something? I'm going to need to poll?\" \"Yes, you're going to need to poll.\" Jenny didn't like the idea of polling the (slow) database, so at first, she tried to run the polling in a background thread so it wouldn't block the UI. Unfortunately for her, the library was very much not threadsafe, so that blew up. She ended up needing to poll on the main UI thread, which meant the application would frequently stall while users were working. She did her best to minimize it, but it was impossible to eliminate. But worse than that, each contract item may implement one of four interfaces, which meant there were four versions of the extension method: public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeA); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeB); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeC); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeD); To \"properly\" perform the check, Jenny would have to check which casts were valid for a given item, cast it, and then invoke GetChangedIndicator. It's worth noting that had they just used regular inheritance instead of extension methods, this wouldn't have been necessary at all. Using the \"fun\" syntactic sugar made the code more complicated for no benefit. This left Jenny with another question: \"What if an item implements more than one of these interfaces? What if the extension methods disagree on if the item is changed?\" \"Good question,\" the team responsible for the library replied. \"That should almost never happen.\" Jenny quit not long after this.

    "description": "Once upon a time, Ryan's company didn't use a modern logging framework to alert admins when services failed. No, they used everyone's favorite communications format, circa 2005: email. Can't reach the database? Send an email. Unhandled exception? Send an email. Handled exception? Better send an email, just in case. Sometimes they go to admins, sometimes they just go to an inbox used for logging. Let's look at how that worked. public void SendEMail(String receivers, String subject, String body) { try { System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient clnt = new System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"SmtpServer\"]); clnt.Send(new System.Net.Mail.MailMessage( ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Sender\"], ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"Receivers\"], subject, body)); } catch (Exception ex) { SendEMail( ConfigurationManager.AppSettings[\"ErrorLogAddress\"], \"An error has occurred while sending an email\", ex.Message + \"\\n\" + ex.StackTrace); } } They use the Dot Net SmtpClient class to connect to an SMTP server and send emails based on the configuration. So far so good, but what happens when we can't send an email because the email server is down? We'll get an exception, and what do we do with it? The same thing we do with every other exception: send an email. Ryan writes: Strangely enough, I've never heard of the service crashing or hanging. We must have a very good mail server!
