    "description": "Teens act out in all sorts of strange ways, and this 18-year-old is no exception. Teens truly are an unpredictable bunch. As they near adulthood, they want all the perks of being a grown-up, though they're often still immature and impulsive. It's a difficult balance for a parent to find when they're navigating their child's teen years. How much should the kid be allowed to get away with before facing a punishment? Once they're 18, can their parents still tell them what to do? This teen was faced with an odd dilemma with her own family. She decided to leave her family at the airport! That's such a startling thing to do. Don't we all get scared during takeoff and landing and need to hold the hand of the family member sitting next to us? No? Just me? Well, even so… it says a lot about how this woman feels about her family that she was so quick to leave them behind.",

    "description": "Does your inbox currently have zero unopened emails? Probably not, because an empty inbox in the 21st century is practically just a myth. These days, our email inboxes are flooded with just about everything. Work messages, spam, newsletters we swear we never signed up for, and promotional emails from companies whose websites we visited once—by accident—five years ago. And don't even get me started on the relentless wave of \"Final sale!\" reminders or the \"Are you still thinking about this item?\" guilt trips. Yes, I'm still thinking about it, but no, my bank account won't allow me to buy it. And no matter how many times you hit unsubscribe or move those messages to spam, they somehow always crawl back in. It's like fighting digital cockroaches. Renters, if you know, you know.But every once in a while, a revenge story like this comes along and you can't help but mentally fist pump for the underdog who put an end to his endless spam emails.",

It's a spot so purrfect for any cat pawrent who likes to game, it's a spot for you to kek and for some cat shenanigans in meme form. Get out of your high DPS mindset and unwind with us here, in the home-base of online cat comedy. We gathered a very special collection of cat memes - it is tailored for all you late-night gamers, who game when your cat is sprawled on your lap.This isn't a DLC, you can incorporate this cat-gaming hybrid meme break, just like any game genre hybridization. Your cat-gaming meme break can be a little puzzle-adventure, but it can also be casual-RPG. Sometimes, with cats being cats, it can be a little action-FPS - but that's okay, because cats will be cats, and this is exactly why we love them.",

    "description": "Happy 2025 to all our readers. I can already tell this year's columns are going to be filled with my (least) favorite form of WTF, the impossible endless gauntlet of flaming password hurdles to jump over or crawl under. Please comment if you know why this week's column has this title and why it doesn't have the title Swordfish. Peter G. starts off our new year of password maladies with a complaint that is almost poetic. \"Between desire and reality. Between fact and breakfast. Between 8 and -6:00. Madness lies, lies, lies...\"   Rick P. keeps it going. \"Must begin with a capital letter!!!\" he exclaims with three (3!) exclamation points. I think it deserved four.   Mark Whybird justifiably grumbled \"If I knew what the policy was, maybe then I could come up with a password to satisfy it!\"   R3D3-1 who swears he is NOT a bot, found a kind of interestingly complicated error challenge, opining \"Password requirements can be annoying. Especially when they don't tell you what the requirements are, only that you failed. But here they send me a confirmation Email, and only when clicking the confirmation Email did they even tell me! That's kind of a new low there... \"   And finally ending this beginning, faithful Pascal remarks only: \"WTF\". Well said.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
