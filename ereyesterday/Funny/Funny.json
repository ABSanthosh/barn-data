    "description": "Time off is time OFF. This man's coworker didn't realize the importance of separation of church and state when it comes to the workplace and vacation time. Although they were happily enjoying their time away from the store, this retail worker just couldn't function without them…One of my first jobs was in retail, tagging T-shirts, folding jeans, and watching the clock tick down until my shift was over. Anyone who's ever worked in retail can attest that it's the sort of environment that takes the soul right out of you, one that begs to be left behind for greener pastures. So when this retail worker decided to take a well-deserved vacation to clear his mind of work follies and workplace drama, he expected to feel free of the shackles of the timecards, the repetitive Pandora station, and his coworker's neediness. However, with his personal cell number distributed around the sales floor, it was going to be hard to catch a break. Read on for the snarky fallout when this worker draws the line, protecting their work/life balance with a dash of salt and a whole lot of sass.",

    "description": "Public transportation can be very hit-or-miss. On normal days, trains and buses arrive on time. You get on, ride to your destination, and barely register that you've been on board. But other days will make you regret ever setting foot on public transportation. From irritating people to delays to messy seats and floors, there are plenty of ways that a regular commute can become mildly infuriating. Recently, I was on the train in the early morning hour of 9:30 AM, heading to my job here, when I entered a nearly empty train car. A three-man band entered with me, bringing guitars and an accordion along with them. I thought, \"They wouldn't play to just like four people in a subway car, right?\" Wrong! Very wrong! Instead, the band began to play at top volume, echoing in the empty car. It was so loud and startling, and extremely unpleasant, since most of us on the train car looked half-asleep still! I know they're just busking, hoping for a few extra dollars, but I really don't think the two train riders who were jolted out of their sleep by the accordion appreciated their musical talents enough to tip them. That's just one thing that might befall you when you step foot onto public transportation, and the people below have their own mildly infuriating moments to share with us. After that, read about this poor 16-year-old who's already burnt out from working too hard, saying, \"I quit my job and I told my parents I won't work again until I'm out of their house.\"",

    "description": "It's a pretty rough winter out there in some places. Sometimes, we don't notice, what with being inside - in the office or at home, cuddles up under blankets with our cats, keeping warm as the world gets covered in a blanket of white out there. But it's true. And it's important to pay attention. This winter, we have come across so many stories of cats freezing alone outside in these harsh winter conditions, and we want everyone to make sure that their cats are not going to join this list. It happens though. Cats are curious creatures, and they do manage to escape out sights every once in a while. Even this senior blind cat somehow slipped past its owner and ended up running out into the cold. This cat would have frozen has he not been rescued in time, that's a certainty. The woman who spotted him \"floating\" in the middle of the lake saw him drowning. It's a miracle that the kitty was saved, and we are thankful to everyone involved in the rescue. Now, we just have to hope that no more stories like these are going to come across our feeds any time in the future.",

    "description": "Cats are so silly. Even when they're the supreme rulers of your house, even when they prance like they own the place, even when they have the most sleek and smooth fur that looks meowjestic - they are still silly little creatures. All you have to do to break this emperor / empress facade is either open a tuna can, click the laser pointer, or simply listen to the silly little sounds they produce. Cats are so silly and funny, but they don't even know it. Cats sure do like to think of themselves as the kings and queens of their house (which they are, but not as they think) - but in reality, they are as silly as they can get.To enjoy this silliness to its full potential, we recommend some seriously silly cat memes. But don't worry. You don't have to search far and wide, because we gathered some funny feline memes full of silly cat comedy. These memes are here to remind us of cats' silliness, and having that in our consciousness is much better than not having it.",

    "description": "Greg was fighting with an academic CMS, and discovered that a file called write_helper.js was included on every page. It contained this single function: function document_write(s) { document.write(s); } Now, setting aside the fact that document.write is one of those \"you probably shouldn't use this\" functions, and is deprecated, one has to wonder what the point of this function is. Did someone really not like object-oriented style code? Did someone break the \".\" on their keyboard and just wanted to not have to copy/paste existing \".\"s? It's the kind of function you expect to see that someone wrote but that isn't invoked anywhere, and you'd almost be correct. This function, in a file included on every page, is called once and only once. More like the wrong helper, if we're being honest. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "Gretchen saw this line in the front-end code for their website and freaked out: let bucket = new AWS.S3({ params: { Bucket: 'initech-logos' } }); This appeared to be creating an object to interact with an Amazon S3 bucket on the client side. Which implied that tokens for interacting with S3 were available to anyone with a web browser. Fortunately, Gretchen quickly realized that this line was commented out. They were not hosting publicly available admin credentials on their website anymore. .comment { border: none; } They used to, however, and the comments in the code made this a bit more clear: // inside an angular component: uploadImage(): void { const uniqueName = `${this.utils.generateUUID()}_${this.encrDecSrvc.getObject(AppConstants.companyID)}_${this.file.name}` /*; @note: Disable usage of aws credential, transfer flow to the backend. @note; @disable-aws-credential */ /*; AWS.config.region = 'us-east-1' let bucket = new AWS.S3({ params: { Bucket: 'initech-billinglogos' } }); */ const bucket = ( AWSBucketMask ); const params = { Bucket: 'initech-logos', Key: 'userprofilepic/' + uniqueName, ACL: \"public-read\", Body: this.file }; const self = this; bucket.upload( params, function (err, data) { if (err) { console.log(\"error while saving file on s3 server\", err); return; } self.isImageUrl = true; self.imageUrl = data.Location; self.myProfileForm.controls['ProfilePic'].setValue(self.imageUrl); self.encrDecSrvc.addObject(AppConstants.imageUrl, self.imageUrl); self.initechAPISrvc.fireImageView(true); self.saveProfileData(); self.fileUpload.clear() }, self.APISrvc ); } Boy, this makes me wonder what that AWSBucketMask object is, and what its upload function does. export class AWSBucketMask { public static async upload( option, callback, service ){ const fileReader = new FileReader( ); fileReader.onloadend = ( ( ) =\u003e { const dataURI = ( `${ fileReader.result }` ); const [ entityType, mimeType, baseType, data ] = ( dataURI.split( /[\\:\\;\\,]/ ) ); option.ContentEncoding = baseType; option.ContentType = mimeType; option.Body = data; service.awsBucketMaskUpload( option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback( null, responseData.data ); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } ); fileReader.readAsDataURL( option.Body ); } public static async deleteObject( option, callback, service ){ service.awsBucketMaskDeleteObject( option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback( null, responseData ); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } public static async deleteObjects( option, callback, service ){ service.awsBucketMaskDeleteObjects( option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback( null, responseData ); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } public static async getSignedUrl( namespace, option, callback, service ){ service.awsBucketMaskGetSignedUrl( namespace, option ) .subscribe( function( responseData ){ callback(null, responseData.data); }, function( error ){ callback( error ); } ); } } The important thing to notice here is that each of the methods here invokes a web service service.awsBucketMaskUpload, for example. Given that nothing actually checks their return values and it's all handled through callback hell, this is a clear example of async pollution- methods being marked async without understanding what async is supposed to do. But that's not the real WTF. You may notice that these calls back to the webservice are pretty thin. You see, here's the problem: originally, they just bundled the S3 into the client-side, so the client-side code could do basically anything it wanted to in S3. Adding a service to \"mask\" that behavior would have potentially meant doing a lot of refactoring, so instead they made the service just a dumb proxy. Anything you want to do on S3, the service does for you. It does no authentication. It does no authorization. It runs with the admin keys, so if you can imagine a request you want to send it, you can send it that request. But at least the client doesn't have access to the admin keys any more. This is an accounting application, so some of the things stored in S3 are confidential financial information.
