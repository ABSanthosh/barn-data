People really come to you for the easiest, most quickly solvable situations simply because they don't feel like doing it. It's ridiculous. If you don't understand, you have never worked at a restaurant or bar and it's showing… Guests will come up to servers, whose job is to take your order and give you your order, or hostess, whose jobs is to seat everyone as timely and organized as possible, and STILL ask questions that have nothing to do with their job description. Of course, most people who work in the service industry will just answer the question and go roll their eyes in the walk-in afterwards. But wouldn't it be nice if we DIDN'T have to do that? Perhaps provide these types of customer with a little gentle parenting on how to figure out simple question on their own? Well, one hostess has perfected a technique that does just that!",

It is inconvenient, to be sure, but all you really need to do to avoid that inconvenience is make sure that you're setting fair rules that everyone, including yourself, should be following for the betterment of everyone affected. Everyone despises their HOA, but undoubtedly, rules like this are important when it comes to the fair enjoyment of your own space. No one likes to hear unnecessary noise from a neighbor.It's just especially ironic that this neighbor also happened to be one of only three board members for the complex… holding ⅓ of the power for the entire HOA, and he still couldn't follow the rules. Not to mention, he clearly intends to rent his unit out, which will mean an even more uncontrolled amount of noise for this downstairs neighbor.The downstairs neighbor shared their experience with this online community, wondering if they were in the wrong for reporting the breaches their upstairs neighbor, who was on the HOA board, had committed.",

Because everyone knows that for some reason, every year, cats decide to have a war with Christmas. Or maybe it's not a war. Maybe it's love that's making cats get inside of Christmas trees the second that they are put up. But everyone knows that love can lead to chaos, and the same is true for cats and Christmas trees.And so, another year, and the madness continues. It's only the beginning of December, and not all of us have put up their trees yet, but the ones of us who decided to start the party a little earlier than most are already experiencing the meowgic of Christmas, because cats don't care how early, they will get up on those Christmas trees and make sure that the party starts instantly.",

All of a sudden, we're wrapped up in giant, poofy coats, bundled up in scarves and hats, and wishing we were back inside underneath the coziness of our comforters (well, that's nothing new). With this cold winter weather and the sun going down earlier and earlier, we can't be bothered to go outside at all. In fact, we've been inside so much that even our cats are starting to get tired of us! That's why we've collected a flurry of feline funnies for you to pursue while weathering the cold winter winds (from the warmth of your own home).No matter rain or shine, snow or sleet, these cold-weather cat memes are sure to keep your hearts and fingers warm while any sort of storm rages outside. Now we just need a cup of hot chocolate to keep us company while our cats take up the whole heater. Not only is it the purrfect day to stay inside, but it's also the purrfect day to scroll through these feline funnies. Enjoy!",

That's a lot of nested blocks. I don't know what the code looks like, but also I don't want to know what the code looks like. Also, as someone who programs with a large font size, this is a special kind of hell for me. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.

    "description": "As often happens, Luka started some work but didn't get it across the finish line before a scheduled vacation. No problem: just hand it off to another experienced developer. Luka went off for a nice holiday, the other developer hammered away at code, and when Luka came back, there was this lovely method already merged to production, sitting and waiting: vvv(x, y) { return typeof x[y] !== 'undefined'; } \"What is this?\" Luka asked. \"Oh, it's a helper function to check if a property is defined on an object.\" Luka could see that much, but that didn't really answer the question. First, it wasn't the correct way to check if a property existed. Mind you, actually doing those checks in JavaScript is a complicated minefield because of prototype inheritance, but between the in operator, the hasOwn and hasOwnProperty methods, there are simpler and cleaner ways to get there. But of course, that wasn't what got anyone's attention. What caught Luka up was the name of the function: vvv. And not only was it a terrible name, thanks to the other dev's industriousness, it was now called all over the codebase. Even places where a more \"correct\" call had been used had been refactored to use this method. \"But it's so brief, and memorable,\" the developer said. Luka was vvvery upset by that attitude.
