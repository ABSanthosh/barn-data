    "description": "There are bold birthday wishes and then there's Lisa, pioneering the new frontier of neighborhood entitlement—forget cake or invitations, she's here for your bandwidth. Never mind that Wi-Fi is the modern equivalent of your toothbrush (intimate, by invitation only, and definitely not communal), Lisa knocks on the door like she's delivering a pie and instead requests the digital keys to your kingdom. It's her special day, after all, so why shouldn't every rando within a three-house radius stream cat videos and FaceTime grandma on your dime?She presents her case: data cap maxed out, budget blown on balloons and finger food, so naturally, the solution isn't to… I don't know, skip a streamer or two, but to turn your private network into the local hot spot for the Lisa Birthday Internet Jubilee. When met with a polite but rational NO, because, you know, basic boundaries exist. Lisa delivers a gold-medal eyeroll and accuses you of crushing her dreams of declaring Free Wi-Fi for All, as if she's running fiber-optic out of her living room.Not to be deterred by your unreasonable attachment to digital privacy, she comes back, now trying a \"just five special guests\" negotiation tactic, like you're an open bar with velvet rope access. At this point, the party favor becomes shutting the door, because some neighborhood boundaries are better left password-protected. Happy birthday, Lisa—hope your data plan enjoys the afterparty.",

    "description": "This barista got petty by not uttering a word. Sometimes, the best way to prove to your manager that they were being disrespectful and out of line is to behave exactly how they claim they would like you to behave.Now, when it comes to chatting with coworkers, there is, of course, a time and a place, but it seems like these employees were only chatting it up with one another while cleaning the coffee shop where they worked. There weren't any customers who weren't being served. The coworkers weren't distracting one another from getting their work done. They were just doing their jobs while striking up a conversation so as to make the day a little less dreary. What are they supposed to do? Ignore one another's presence? Well, unfortunately for this author, their new manager decided that today was the day to assert her authority for no good reason. She decided to forbid her employees from speaking to each other. You can probably imagine how this comment backfired…",

    "description": "Hello, all you furbulous felines on the internet today. We have some special cat memes for you today. They are purrfectly silly, hilariously hissterical and meowrvelously… moist? Yes. They are moist. Usually, cats don't like getting wet (they do, however, make the purrfect lifeguards), but this one cat in purrticular loves taking baths. They love the oily look on their smooth skin (no, we're not talking about hairless sphynx cats that look like raw chickens), living their lives in the shape of a football, and disappointing feline fanatics around the world. That's because these cat memes are actually purrfect pygmy hippos.For some reason, someone on the internet made a bunch of memes of this awwdorable pygmy hippo (who we presume to be the infamous Moo Deng) and claimed that they are the worst cat pawssible. We'll leave that up to you to decide, but because they are technically cat memes, we couldn't pass up the awwportunity to share them with you. Without further ado, we hope you have a purrfectly moist day…. or something like that. Enjoy! Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

For some it is a feisty feline fix, for others a fluffy, but no matter what we all need it and need it regularly. It is the principle reason that dog pawrents are so anti-cat, because they are jealous that they cannot cheat on their canine children and get their feline fix. But you, dear hooman, are lucky enough not to be limited by a pawdorable pupper and are free to fill your soul with sweet cats whenever you want.At least we are assuming that, seeing as you are here. So we welcome you to today's feline fix, which is a wholesome and funny one that comes wrapped in the most whimsical of wrappers, whiskers. And if these felines are not enough for your fix, then check out these cute cattos to round out your feline fixation.",

    "description": "Our anonymous submitter, whom we'll call Carmen, embarked on her IT career with an up-and-coming firm that developed and managed eCommerce websites for their clients. After her new boss Russell walked her around the small office and introduced her to a handful of coworkers, he led her back to his desk to discuss her first project. Carmen brought her laptop along and sat down across from Russell, poised to take notes. Russell explained that their newest client, Sharon, taught CPR classes. She wanted her customers to be able to pay and sign up for classes online. She also wanted the ability to charge customers a fee in case they cancelled on her. \"You're gonna build a static site to handle all this,\" he said. Carmen nodded along as she typed out notes in a text file. \"Now, Sharon doesn't want to pay more than a few hundred dollars for the site,\" Russell continued, \"so we're not gonna hook up an endpoint to use a service-provided API for payments.\" Carmen glanced up from her laptop, perplexed. \"How are we gonna do it, then?\" \"Via email,\" Russell replied smoothly. \"The customer will enter their CC info into basic form fields. When they click Submit, you're gonna send all that to Sharon's business address, and also CC it to yourself for backup and recovery purposes.\" Carmen's jaw dropped. \"Just ... straight-up email raw credit card data?\" \"Yep!\" Russell replied. \"Sharon knows to expect the emails.\" Her heart racing with panic, Carmen desperately cast about for some way for this to be less awful. \"Couldn't ... couldn't we at least encrypt the CC info before we send it to her?\" \"She's not paying us for that,\" Russell dismissed. \"This'll be easier to implement, anyway! You can handle it, can't you?\" \"Yyyes—\" \"Great! Go get started, let me know if you have any more questions.\" Carmen had plenty of questions and even more misgivings, but she'd clearly be wasting her time if she tried to bring them up. There was no higher boss to appeal to, no coworkers she knew well enough who could slip an alternate suggestion into Russell's ear on her behalf. She had no choice but to swallow her good intentions and implement it exactly the way Russell wanted it. Carmen set up the copied emails to forward automatically to a special folder so that she'd never have to look at them. She cringed every time a new one came in, reflecting on how lucky Sharon and her customers were that the woman supporting her website had a conscience. And then one day, a thought came to Carmen that really scared her: in how many places, in how many unbelievable ways, was her sensitive data being treated like this? Eventually, Carmen moved on to bigger and better things. Her first project most likely rests in the hands of Russell's newest hire. We can only hope it's an honest hire.

    "description": "We've talked about ASP .Net WebForms in the past. In this style of development, everything was event driven: click a button, and the browser sends an HTTP request to the server which triggers a series of events, including a \"Button Click\" event, and renders a new page. When ASP .Net launched, one of the \"features\" was a lazy repaint in browsers which supported it (aka, Internet Explorer), where you'd click the button, the page would render on the server, download, and then the browser would repaint only the changed areas, making it feel more like a desktop application, albeit a laggy one. This model didn't translate super naturally to AJAX style calls, where JavaScript updated only portions of the page. The .Net team added some hooks for it- special \"AJAX enabled\" controls, as well as helper functions, like __doPostBack, in the UI to generate URLs for \"postbacks\" to trigger server side execution. A postback is just a POST request with .NET specific state data in the body. All this said, Chris maintains a booking system for a boat rental company. Specifically, he's a developer at a company which the boat rental company hires to maintain their site. The original developer left behind a barnacle covered mess of tangled lines and rotting hull. Let's start with the view ASPX definition: \u003cscript\u003e function btnSave_Click() { if (someCondition) { //Trimmed for your own sanity //PostBack to Save Data into the Database. javascript:\u003c%#getPostBack()%\u003e; } else { return false; } } script\u003e \u003chtml\u003e \u003cbody\u003e \u003cinput type=\"button\" value=\" Save Booking \" id=\"btnSave\" class=\"button\" title=\"Save [Alt]\" onclick=\"btnSave_Click()\" /\u003e body\u003e html\u003e __doPostBack is the .NET method for generating URLs for performing postbacks, and specifically, it populates two request fields: __EVENTTARGET (the ID of the UI element triggering the event) and __EVENTARGUMENT, an arbitrary field for your use. I assume getPostBack() is a helper method which calls that. The code in btnSave_Click is as submitted, and I think our submitter may have mangled it a bit in \"trimming\", but I can see the goal is to ensure than when the onclick event fires, we perform a \"postback\" operation with some hard-coded values for __EVENTTARGET and __EVENTELEMENT. Or maybe it isn't mangled, and this code just doesn't work? I enjoy that the tool-tip \"title\" field specifies that it's \"[Alt]\" text, and that the name of the button includes extra whitespace to ensure that it's padded out to a good rendering size, instead of using CSS. But we can skip past this into the real meat. How this gets handled on the server side: Protected Sub Page_Load(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.Load '// Trimmed more garbage If Page.IsPostBack Then 'Check if save button has been Clicked. Dim eventArg As String = Request(\"__EVENTARGUMENT\") Dim offset As Integer = eventArg.IndexOf(\"@@@@@\") If (offset \u003e -1) Then 'this is an event that we raised. so do whatever you need to here. Save() End If End If End Sub From this, I conclude that getPostBack populates the __EVENTARGUMENT field with a pile of \"@\", and we use that to recognize that the save button was clicked. Except, and this is the important thing, if they populated the ID property with btnSave, then ASP .Net would automatically call btnSave_Click. The entire point of the __doPostBack functionality is that it hooks into the event handling pattern and acts just like any other postback, but lets you have JavaScript execute as part of sending the request. The entire application is a boat with multiple holes in it; it's taking on water and going down, and like a good captain, Chris is absolutely not going down with it and looking for a lifeboat. Chris writes: The thing in its entirety is probably one of the biggest WTFs I've ever had to work with. I've held off submitting because nothing was ever straight forward enough to be understood without posting the entire website. Honestly, I'm still not sure I understand it, but I do hate it.
