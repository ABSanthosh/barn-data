    "description": "This group of employees wasn't sure how to handle the workplace weirdo… because he doesn't technically work with them. This person wrote in for advice using a throwaway account called u/throwRA-nonSeq. They shared that they work in an office complex with a bunch of different businesses, and there's one dude who's being an utter creep. He's being just annoying enough to really weird out the other employees, especially the women, who he seems to target in particular. But, as is often the case with workplace issues, these workers didn't know if it was \"bad enough\" to report to HR. And the other issue is that they didn't even know where this dude worked, so they didn't know if HR could even take up their case. However, sometimes HR works exactly as it's supposed to. As you can read about in the original story and the following two updates, HR worked fast to get rid of this dude. It's never acceptable to intimidate those you work with, and the quicker you call out the bad behavior, the safer and happier everyone else in the office will be. Up next, read the stories of employees who left their bad bosses behind to find better jobs, like one person who resigned with their entire team!",

    "description": "What is the purpose of homeowner's associations if not to stir up unnecessary trouble?We have seen countless stories where HOAs enforce ridiculous rules and regulations just for the sake of flexing their muscles, yet we have rarely seen a group of neighbors band together in support of one of their own, who successfully got rid of a ridiculous new policy. In this scenario, the HOA in question randomly decided to require that several members of the neighborhood replenish their decks and landscaping areas. However, according to the rules and regulations expressly written in the HOA handbook, these areas were under the direct jurisdiction of the HOA and were actually not at all owned by the residents. This meant that they should not have to foot the bill and pay the costs for these renovations. Let's just say that when one resident gained the support of other neighbors and called out these specifications to the head of the HOA, the HOA was not happy. For more stories like this, check out this post about another feud in a tight-knit community.",

    "description": "Hello cat-loving humans. Those of us who have cats at home know that there is never a dull moment with your faithful feline companions. One moment you could gaze at them sleeping on the dog's bed, snoring softly but adorably, the next moment they're knocking over all of your good china. Oh yeah, things get real interesting real fast. One thing however remains consistent, and that is the way that our cats simultaneously bring both joy and chaos to our every day human lives. Cats make life so much more interesting. On that note, I'm thinking back to a time when I flew across the country with my cat to visit family, and he was being such a good boy just sleeping in his carrier throughout the flight. I had managed to doze off on this flight, which was about 6 hours of flight time total, only to feel a tap at my shoulder a few moments later. The person next to me alerted me that my cat had escaped from his carrier and was making his rounds around the plane. And that just about sums up the joy and chaos of being a cat parent. Enjoy all the silliness!",

We wouldn't know, we're definitely not a cat typing this listicle right now, we're 100% hooman. We pay taxes, go to work, and only eat tuna once per day. Anyway, as we were saying, life can be a real hairball sometimes. If we need something to help us get through a purrticularly pawful day, we turn to wholesome funny feline memes. They're like our medicine, but this medicine is a catnip-coated spoonful of sugar. Us hoomans love catnip too, right? Can't get enough of it!Erm, we mean, we like catnip just as much as the next hooman. But back to these silly cats that make our days better, they're just the cat's meow. And we're not saying that because we're a cat, remember, it's just a normal hooman expression. We feel like we're not really getting our paw across here. Point! We meant to say point. Just scroll down already and enjoy this listicle, catnip or not (but it's better with catnip…right?).",

Even the core parts of the platform are a nightmare We're going to take this one in chunks, because it's big and ugly. try { if (isset($_POST)) { $name = $_POST['objName']; $lst_name = $_POST['objLstName']; $email = $_POST['objEmail']; $phone = $_POST['objGsm']; $message = $_POST['objMsg']; $verifycode = $_POST['objVerifyCode']; /******************************************************/ $objCmpT = $_POST['objCmpT']; $objCmpS = $_POST['objCmpS']; $objCountry = $_POST['objCountry']; $objCity = $_POST['objCity']; $objName2 = $_POST['objName2']; $objLstName2 = $_POST['objLstName2']; $objQuality = $_POST['objQuality']; $objEmail = $_POST['objEmail']; $objMsg2 = $_POST['objMsg2']; $objVerifyCode2 = $_POST['objVerifyCode2']; I don't love that there's no structure or class here, to organize these fields, but this isn't bad, per se. We have a bunch of form fields, and we jam them into a bunch of variables. I am going to, with no small degree of willpower, not comment on the hungarian notation present in the field names. Look at me not commenting on it. I'm definitely not commenting on it. Look at me not commenting that some, but not all, of the variables also get the same hungarian prefix. What's the point of hungarian notation when everything just gets the same thing anyway; like hungarian is always bad, but this is just USELESS Ahem. Let's continue with the code. $ok = 0; $ok2 = 0; $sendTo = \"example@example.com\"; $golableMSG = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $name . ' ' . $lst_name . ' -email :' . $email . ' -Phone Number : 0' . $phone . ' -Message : ' . $message; $globaleMSG2 = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $objName2 . ' ' . $objLstName2 . ' -Email :' . $objEmail . ' -Type of company : ' . $objCmpT . ' -Sector of activity : ' . $objCmpS . ' -Country : ' . $objCountry . ' -City : ' . $objCity . ' -Your position within the company : ' . $objQuality . ' -Message : ' . $objMsg2; We munge all those form fields into strings. These are clearly going to be the bodies of our messages. Only now I'm noticing that the user had to supply two different names- $name and $objName2. Extra points here, as I believe they meant to name both of these message variables globaleMSG but misspelled the first one, golableMSG. Well, let's continue. if (!$name) { $data['msg1'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg1'] = ''; } if (!$lst_name) { $data['msg2'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg2'] = ''; } if (!$email) { $data['msg3'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg3'] = ''; } if ($phone \u003c= 0) { $data['msg4'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg4'] = ''; } if (!$message) { $data['msg5'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg5'] = ''; } if (!$verifycode) { $data['msg6'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg6'] = ''; } /*********************************************************************************/ if (!$objCmpS) { $data['msg7'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg7'] = ''; } if (!$objCountry) { $data['msg8'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg8'] = ''; } if (!$objCity) { $data['msg9'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg9'] = ''; } if (!$objName2) { $data['msg10'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg10'] = ''; } if (!$objLstName2) { $data['msg11'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg11'] = ''; } if (!$objQuality) { $data['msg12'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg12'] = ''; } if (!$objMsg2) { $data['msg13'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg13'] = ''; } if (!$objVerifyCode2) { $data['msg14'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg14'] = ''; } What… what are we doing here? I worry that what I'm looking at here is some sort of preamble to verification code. But why is it like this? Why? /********************************************************************************/ if ($ok == 6) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $name)) { $data['msg1_1'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $lst_name)) { $data['msg2_2'] = ''; $subject = $name . \" \" . $lst_name; if (filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) { $data['msg3_3'] = ''; $from = $email; if (preg_match(\"/^[6-9][0-9]{8}$/\", $phone)) { $data['msg4_4'] = ''; if (intval($verifycode) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr1']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr2'])) { $data['msg6_6'] = ''; $headers = 'From: ' . $from . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject, $golableMSG, $headers); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; /*$data = array('success' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } else { $data['msg6_6'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg4_4'] = 'Votre Numéro est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg3_3'] = 'Votre Email est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg2_2'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg1_1'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Oh look, it is validation code. Their verification code system, presumably to prevent spamming messages, is not particularly secure or useful. The real thing I see here, though, is the namespaced keys. Earlier, we set $data['msg1'], and now we're setting $data['msg1_1'] which is a code stench that could kill from a hundred yards. And don't worry, we do the same thing for the other message we send: /**************************************************************/ if ($ok2 == 8) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objName2)) { $data['msg10_10'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objLstName2)) { $data['msg11_11'] = ''; $subject2 = $objName2 . \" \" . $objLstName2; if (intval($objVerifyCode2) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr3']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr4'])) { $from2 = $objEmail; $data['msg14_14'] = ''; $headers2 = 'From: ' . $from2 . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject2, $globaleMSG2, $headers2); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; } else { $data['msg14_14'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg11_11'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg10_10'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Phew. Hey, remember way back at the top, when we checked to see if the $_POST variable were set? Well, we do have an else clause for that. } else { throw new \\Exception($mot[86]); } Who doesn't love throwing messages by hard-coded array indexes in your array of possible error messages? Couldn't be bothered with a constant, could we? Nope, message 86 it is. But don't worry about that exception going uncaught. Remember, this whole thing was inside of a try: } catch (\\Exception $e) { $data['msgfinal'] = \"Votre Messsage n'est pas bien envoyer\"; /*$data = array('danger' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage pas bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } Yeah, it didn't matter what message we picked, because we just catch the exception and hard-code out an error message. Also, I don't speak French, but is \"message\" supposed to have an extra \"s\" in it? Charles writes: It’s crazy to see such sloppy work on a platform that seems okay at first glance. Honestly, this platform is the holy grail of messy code—it could have its own course on how not to code because of how bad and error-prone it is. There are also even worse scenarios of bad code, but it's too long to share, and honestly, they're too deep and fundamentally ingrained in the system to even begin explaining. Oh, I'm sure we could explain it. The explanation may be \"there was a severe and fatal lack of oxygen in the office, and this is what hypoxia looks like in code,\" but I'm certain there'd be an explanation. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "Once upon a time, web browsers weren't the one-stop-shop for all kinds of possible content that they are today. Aside from the most basic media types, your browser depended on content plugins to display different media types. Yes, there was an era where, if you wanted to watch a video in a web browser, you may need to have QuickTime or… (shudder) Real Player installed. As a web developer, you'd need to write code to check which plugins were installed. If they don't have Adobe Acrobat Reader installed, there's no point in serving them up a PDF file- you'll need instead to give them an install link. Which brings us to Ido's submission. This code is intended to find the Acrobat Reader plugin version. acrobatVersion: function GetAcrobatVersion() { // Check acrobat is Enabled or not and its version acrobatVersion = 0; if (navigator.plugins \u0026\u0026 navigator.plugins.length) { for (intLoop = 0; intLoop \u003c= 15; intLoop++) { if (navigator.plugins[intLoop] != -1) { acrobatVersion = parseFloat(navigator.plugins[intLoop].version); isAcrobatInstalled = true; break; } } } else {...} } So, we start by checking for the navigator.plugins array. This is a wildly outdated thing to do, as the MDN is quite emphatic about, but I'm not going to to get hung up on that- this code is likely old. But what I do want to pay attention to is that they check navigator.plugins.length. Then they loop across the set of plugins using a for loop. And don't use the length! They bound the loop at 15, arbitrarily. Why? No idea- I suspect it's for the same reason they named the variable intLoop and not i like a normal human. Then they check to ensure that the entry at plugins[intLoop] is not equal to -1. I'm not sure what the expected behavior was here- if you're accessing an array out of bounds in JavaScript, I'd expect it to return undefined. Perhaps some antique version of Internet Explorer did something differently? Sadly plausible. Okay, we've found something we believe to be a plugin, because it's not -1, we'll grab the version property off of it and… parseFloat. On a version number. Which ignores the fact that 1.1 and 1.10 are different versions. Version numbers, like phone numbers, are not actually numbers. We don't do arithmetic on them, treat them like text. That done, we can say isAcrobatInstalled is true- despite the fact that we didn't check to see if this plugin was actually an Acrobat plugin. It could have been Flash. Or QuickTime. Then we break out of the loop. A loop that, I strongly suspect, would only ever have one iteration, because undefined != -1. So there we have it: code that doesn't do what it intends to, and even if it did, is doing it the absolute wrong way, and is also epically deprecated.
