But in this quiet cul-de-sac, the homeowner's association is run by a thirty-two-year-old mother with a toddler and zero grasp of boundaries.What started with an impromptu appearance at the backyard wedding (because who doesn't love wedding crashers?) soon escalated to unsolicited therapy sessions on the porch, tales of marital unhappiness, and the kind of trauma-dumping that makes the family dog want to call animal control.For the past year and a half, this neighborly performance art has reached new heights: two unannounced drop-ins a week, a talent for holiday crashing, and a sixth sense for popping by mid-Zoom call. There's no invitation, she's just \"catching you,\" because texting is for the weak.",

    "description": "Going through multiple rounds of interviews can feel unnecessary, but having to complete unpaid labor that takes entire days to finish should be a bridge too far for many prospective candidates. Unfortunately, in this day and age, assignments such as these have become standard practice during the recruitment process. Job applicants can expect to have to do a little work in subsequent rounds of interviews prior to sitting down with more people. This is an opportunity for candidates to demonstrate their skillset outside of whatever is written in your cover letter or on your resume. In theory, assignments make sense. However, at the same time, they need to be realistic. Far too many applicants have had to essentially do work for potential future employers without substantial feedback or support. Sometimes, they do all that work only to be ghosted when scheduling a follow-up interview. Employers have taken the idea of assignments and have instead used them to deceive candidates into doing free work and wasting their time in the process. Keep scrolling below for this one candidate's story, in which he completed what seemed appropriate for a job application and was criticized for not doing more!",

At least it's a common thought between all cat pawrents, general feline fanatic fanes, and all the crazy cat ladies around the world. That's a lot of people who think cats are great. But… they are! Regardless of whether other people don't think that cats are great. But they're wrong, because cats are great. And, honestly, most cats are greater than other humans. That's how great cats are.Now, we can agree on that fact easily, but you know what else? We think cat memes are great. No, not just great - we think cat memes are the best kind of memes. It's no wonder cat memes rule the internet, it's because they're the greatest. Cat memes are funnier than most other memes, and they're definitely cuter and much more adorable. When you look at some wholesome cat memes you get this warm and fuzzy feeling, and you also laugh - which is a great bonus. So, are cats great? Yes. Are cat memes great? Yes.",

    "description": "Good meowrning, friends and felines. If you know anything about kittens, you know that they should be with their mothers until they're about 12 weeks old. Any sooner than that, and you have to do the mothering for them. It's also crucial for their mental and social development. But, life isn't purrfect, and oftentimes kittens are separated from their meowthers too early. Sometimes it happens naturally, and other times, hoomans are the cause.After hearing the meows of a poor kitten outside, one teen went to check out the situation. He found a 6-week-old kitten crying for help, all alone on their neighbor's property. He did as any of us would, and took the cat in to start caring for it. A few days later, he found another one around the same age - it seemed that their neighbors were leaving these kittens outside to fend for themselves. The kitten formed an emeowtional bond with him, and the neighbors never said a thing. Scroll down to read more about these adopted (stolen?) babies below.",

    "description": "Andre has inherited a rather antique ASP .Net WebForms application. It's a large one, with many pages in it, but they all follow a certain pattern. Let's see if you can spot it. protected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ArrayList paramsRel = new ArrayList(); paramsRel[\"Name\"] = txtNome.Text; paramsRel[\"Date\"] = txtDate.Text; Session[\"paramsRel\"] = paramsRel; List clients = Controller.FindClients(); //Some other code } Now, at first glance, this doesn't look terrible. Using an ArrayList as a dictionary and frankly, storing a dictionary in the Session object is weird, but it's not an automatic red flag. But wait, why is it called paramsRel? They couldn't be… no, they wouldn't… public List FindClients() { ArrayList paramsRel = (ArrayList)Session[\"paramsRel\"]; string name = (string)paramsRel[\"Name\"]; string dateStr = (string)paramsRel[\"Date\"]; DateTime date = DateTime.Parse(dateStr); //More code... } Now there's the red flag. paramsRel is how they pass parameters to functions. They stuff it into the Session, then call a function which retrieves it from that Session. This pattern is used everywhere in the application. You can see that there's a vague gesture in the direction of trying to implement some kind of Model-View-Controller pattern (as FindClients is a member of the Controller object), but that modularization gets undercut by everything depending on Session as a pseudoglobal for passing state information around. The only good news is that the Session object is synchronized so there's no thread safety issue here, though not for want of trying. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
