    "description": "There is a new workplace culture going around these days that encourages you to find a balance between work and life. Whatever that means for you, it's the \"healthiest\" way to lead your life in this capitalistic society. Because of this, many employees are opting out of any optional social events planned by their workplace. They already have friends and they'd like to use their off hours with them—it's really not that crazy. Separation of work life and social life can be way healthier than the other way around, because usually, even if you are in a \"social\" setting, when you're with your co-workers, you are still within a hierarchy of power.  Unfortunately, there are many stories online of employees getting in trouble to opting out of social events planned by their work. It's like, they make it optional, but not really… Like when this employee opted out due to personal reasons, her manager started making her work-life a nightmare.",

    "description": "Mayo is a little traumatizing. I've since grown out of my aversion, but when I was a child, my sister had a bad case of lice that could only be solved with mayo. Since then, I have never seen it the same way again. Globby, white, and disgustingly eggy, mayo is easily the most foul condiment in the fridge when left to its own devices. Now, as an adult, I can appreciate mayo in moderation, but if left to its own devices, the haunting image of the mayonnaise melting on my sister's scalp pops back up in my memory.I've got the heebie jeebies just thinking about it. This roommate gave his ex-friend a similar kind of traumatic mayonnaise experience, except as a punishment for breaking a roomie's cardinal rule: Don't steal food that isn't yours. Rightfully earned, this roommate's mayo memory is about to be a vivid reminder of his long-standing thievery of a buddy's milk, since he spent months stealing increments of milk. We can see the levels going down, sir. There's no hiding your sins this time—it's the mayo for you, then!",

    "description": "Hey there, almost-30 crowd. Millennials who remember dial-up but also know what TikTok is. People who now groan as they're sitting down. You've made it this far. And honestly? That deserves a gold star, a nap, and probably a cat or two curled on your lap for emeowtional support.Adulting is weird. One moment you're buying a rug and feeling proud, the next you're crying because someone finished your oat milk. But through it all, one thing has stayed constant: cats. Their little bleps. Their dramatic stares. Their chaotic 3 AM zoomies. Their refusal to respect personal space (but only when you're busy).These wholesome cat memes are like a fuzzy little blanket for your soul. They're here to remind you that even if your back hurts for no reason, even if your inbox has 87 unread emails, and even if your dinner is just vibes and cereal... you're doing okay. So take a break, breathe deep, and scroll through these almost-30-approved feline funnies. It's not a hug from your childhood cat, but it's pretty darn close.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Purrsonally, we understand the desire to help every cat you meet. It's something instinctual in us. We see a cat on the street and we are swept up by the urge to take them home, feed them some tuna, and teach them to snuggle. However, not every cat needs saving, despite how they may look on the outside. Some cats have a pawsitively enjoyable neighborhood life, with one main family and several side-families that feed them, love them, and house them. You might be surprised how common it is for a cat to have multiple families.So, when the cat lover in this post wrote about how she wanted to save this cat from a life outside, we get it. However, she goes on to say that the cat is clean and well-cared for, so at what point does she need to convince herself that she's not actually saving the cat, but stealing it? We'll leave it to you to find out what happens in the end, but let's just say that everyone gets a purrfectly happy ending!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly.

I love to watch them though, which is fully in-line with the profound, unique spectacle they offer. 2 Live Crew's third album was entitled \"As Nasty As They Wanna Be,\" and there is a version of this principle in place for Hideo Kojima - very, very few people are allowed by the universe to be this true to their instincts, to \"shock the world\" as Silkk The Shocker put it. I'm trying to figure out another old school hip hop reference but I think this paragraph is essentially spent. Everything that we say in the strip is true, though.",

    "description": "Wikipedia describes the (very old) English children's game. I wonder if there's a similar game in Germany. In any case, the Worcester News is definitely confused about how this game is played. Martin I. explains \"This is a cookie acceptance dialog. It seems to struggle with labeling the buttons when the user's browser is not set to English ...\"   In Dutch, Robert R. is playing a different game. \"Duolingo is teaching users more than just languages - apparently web development fundamentals are included when HTML entities leak into the user interface. That's one way to make \" \" part of your vocabulary!\" We wonder why the webdev would want to use a nbsp in this location.   Ninja Squirrel shares a flubstitution nugget. \"Since I've been waiting a long time for a good deal on a new gaming keyboard and the Logitech Play Days started today, I thought I'd treat myself. I wasn't prepared for what Logitech then treated me to - free gifts and wonderful localization errors in the productive WebShop. What started with a simple “Failed to load resource [Logitech.checkout.Total]” in the order overview ended with this wonderful total failure after the order was placed. What a sight to behold - I love it! XD\"   David P. imagines that Tesla's web devs are allowed near embedded systems. \"If Tesla can't even do dates correctly, imagine how much fun Full Self Driving is.\" Given how often FSD has been promised imminently, I conclude that date confusion is simply central to the corporate culture. Embrace it.   But it's not only Tesla that bungles whens. Neil T. nails another big name. \"Has Google's Gemini AI hallucinated a whole new calendar? I'm pretty sure the Gregorian calendar only has 30 days in June.\"   And that's it for this week.

    "description": "Maybe we'll just try and read a book. That's a good way to spend your vacation. This can't possibly go badly! Original --Remy \"Have you had a chance to look at that JIRA ticket yet?\" Marge debated pretending she hadn't seen the Slack message yet—but, if she did, she knew Gary would just walk over to her desk and badger her further. In truth, she didn't want to look at the ticket: it was a low priority ticket, and worse, it only affected a small fraction of one client's customers, meaning it was likely to be some weird edge case bug nobody would ever run into again. Maybe if I ignore it long enough, it'll go away on its own, she thought. The client was a bookseller with a small but signifigant-to-them online presence; the software they used to sell books, including your standard e-commerce account functionality, was made by Marge's company. The bug was somewhere in the password reset feature: some customers, seemingly at random, were unable to use the password reset link the software emailed out. Marge pulled up the ticket, looking over the half-hearted triage work that had been done before it landed on her desk to solve. The previous guy had pulled logs and figured out that all the customers who were complaining were using the same ISP based out of Germany. He'd recommended reaching out to them, but had been transferred to another division before he'd gotten around to it. When Marge realized that the contact information was all in German, she almost gave up then and there. But with the magic of Google Translate, she managed to get in touch with a representative via email. After a bit of back and forth, she noticed this gem in one of his (translated) replies: We want to display mails in our webmail client as close to the original as possible. Since most mails are HTML formatted, the client supports the full HTTP protocol and can display (almost) all HTML tags. Unfortunately, this means that \"evil\" JS-Content in such mails can do all kinds of stuff in the browser and therefore on the customer's PC. To avert this, all mails are processed by a \"SafeBrowsing\"-module before they are displayed, to recognize and circumvent such manipulations. One of those security measures is the recognition of js-modules that begin with \"on...\", since that are mostly js functions that are triggered by some event in the browser. Our \"countermeasure\" is to just replace \"on...\" with \"no...\" before the HTML content is sent to the rendering process. Marge frowned at the answer for a bit, something nagging at her mind. \"There's no way,\" she murmured as she pulled up the access logs. Sure enough, the url for the reset link was something like https://bookseller.com?oneTimeToken=deadbeef ... and the customers in question had accessed https://bookseller.com?noeTimeToken=deadbeef instead. A few lines of code and it was resolved: a conditional would check for the incorrect query string parameter and copy the token to the correct query string parameter instead. Marge rolled her eyes, merged her change into the release branch, and finally, at long last, closed that annoying low-priority ticket once and for all. hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); code { font-family: Consolas, monospace; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
