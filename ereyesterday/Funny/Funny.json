    "description": "You never know when you'll be down on your luck. That's why it's important to treat everyone with the respect they deserve, regardless of their economic and living situations. What truly matters is the kind of person you are, and those who have beauty within will always win. To be rich in spirit and kindness and spread that good energy around, regardless of what your situation might be, is something special.Then, there are those people who want to make everyone else miserable with their snap judgments. The Karen in this story was strolling through the park when she noticed a homeless man (who the original poster (OP) states is adored by the community) and began to berate him. She claims that he has no right to be in the park, despite his very kind and unbothersome nature. Shouts of \"get a job\" and \"stop being so lazy\" exit her mouth, and then she calls the authorities. When they arrive, it turns out they know the homeless man very well and ask him how he's doing. Instead of believing Karen's false accusations, they proceed to tell her if she doesn't stop causing a disturbance, she will be the one removed from the park. Once she stomps away, the entire community shows up for the homeless man, Tim in a heartwarming turn of events.",

    "description": "These people are having some second thoughts about the people they're dating, and they're sharing the exact moments they realized they got the ick. What does it take for you to get \"the ick\" from someone while you're dating? It's often just a little thing, but a relationship is comprised of a million little pieces, so even a few things that seem off can be enough to make you cancel that second date. For example, some people highlighted an interesting tidbit: they've had dates who just didn't like any music. Not that they disliked a specific artist or genre… they just did not like music, point blank period. Many people enjoy going to concerts or dancing to music at a club, so it's just a nonstarter to disagree on something so fundamental. That's a pretty general ick, but @jadeeatskids wanted to know people's most niche red flags. One person's super specific dislike is the guys wear basketball shorts under their pants. Another person loses interest if someone has really bad handwriting. And people are also highly specific about the types of tattoos and piercings they like! You can check out these funny and very specific dating icks down below.Up next, read about the college kids who baffled their teachers and peers, like one person who was upset that the professor \"didn't send him an email reminding him homework was due.\" Welcome to the real world, dude!",

    "description": "I had joined the Games Workshop fandom at the tail end of 9th edition. I started out learning standard Warhammer 40k and ended up choosing the Black Templars as my army. While attempting to learn that, I was shown Kill Team which of course I also bought a rule book for and tried to learn. Around this time I discovered they had a whole nother game called Age Of Sigmar with even more armies and so I had to check that out. Then they hit me with Boarding Actions and finally 10th edition. I think I blew some sort of fuse in my brain at that point and had to check out of all of it.  I never really felt like I had a firm grasp of the rules for any of those games. It was just too much too quickly.",

Many people are being displaced by the hurricanes, but what a lot of people don't think about are the animals that are also being affected. One smol tortie kitten got separated from its mother, but luckily enough, one kindhearted hooman was there to help (you know we can't resist a story with a happy ending). After finding the adorably tiny fur baby, the man who described himself as 'NOT a cat person' walked around for hours with the kitten in hand to find its mother.They may not have found the kitten's momma, but the kitten certainly found a new papa! The new cat pawrent instantly fell in love with this tiny tortie and they are growing together despite life's challenges.

And when it does this, it is not so that we act out and unleash our frustrations unto others. But it does so such that we take full advantage of the precious free time we have been gifted.From the obsessive orange cat who has been reading up on how to be super annoying and cute, to the clawminal cat who hangs out with other criminals casually, to the pawdorable pirate kitty who is ready to get into the nautical themed party his pawrent will be hosting later this evening.",

    "description": "...to know which way the wind blows. This week, it's been an ill one. Two of our readers sent us references to the BBC's reports on unusual weather in Bristol - one from the web, and one mobile. Maybe that will help you deduce the source of this error. Frist, Graham F. shared a screenshot of the beeb's mobile app, bellowing \"I know Milton is hitting the US hard right now but that's nothing compared to the 14,000 mph winds here!\"   Snecod, Jeremy P. confirms the story and provides some details from the web page. \"BBC weather is clipping windspeed making it look like it's only 5909mph and not 15909mph... At least they realise something is wrong.\"   Some anonymous American shared a snap of their weather station, which was worth a little chuckle. \"Whether you like it or not, it's the weather, sort of. And, no, this wasn't during the recent eclipse.\" It would have been worse if the crescent had been a \"sunny and clear\" icon, though, given the time of day that the snap was taken. All in all, I have to call this \"not an error'd\".   We had to dig into the surplus bin to pad out the theme with this pair from Stuart H. He opens with \"I can only assume that the forecast is for Hell or a point between the surface and the center of the Sun! I think I need to turn the aircon up a few notches.\"   \"And following on from the forecast on the front-page - it's even worse for the rest of the world!\"   Finally Eric K. reported a temperature extreme \"Hellfire or extinguished sun? My weather app seems unsure of which type of apocalyptic weather conditions we're currently experiencing.\" But I also note this represents an unusually high level of humidity. I haven't checked but maybe one of our readers will look up these coordinates and let us know which burg has been obliterated.   [Advertisement] Continuously monitor your servers for configuration changes, and report when there's configuration drift.

    "description": "Working at a company where the leadership started as technical people has its advantages, but it can also carry costs. Arthur is in one such environment, and while it means that management and labor have a common vocabulary, the company leadership forgets that they're not in a technical role anymore. So they still like to commit code to the project. And that's how things like this happen: if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } else if( this.idtoservice != null ) { sOwner = this.idtoservice.Common.Security.Owner; } This isn't one commit from the CEO, it's 4 different commits. It seems like the CEO, perhaps, doesn't understand merge conflicts? This particular bit of bad code is at least absolutely harmless and likely gets compiled out, but it doesn't mean that Arthur doesn't feel the urge to drink every time his CEO makes a new commit.
