    "description": "We know that people say that cats are independent creatures who like their space and their alone time. We know that cats are not always known for being the friendliest. We know that cats don't always have the easiest time connecting with others. We know it. We just haven't seen it many times. Seriously. In our experience, cats bond with humans or other animals incredibly hard and fast. Maybe they are not the most social creatures, but cats sure do love their cuddles. And when cats lose someone that they love, someone that they are close to, one of those creatures that they have bonded with… they certainly feel that loss very strongly. All that love that they have to give - and there is a lot of it - needs a place to go. And that's certainly true for the kittens in this story - both of them. Both orphaned, one losing its brother too… they found one another and connected because they were meant to. And although they are not biologically related, these kittens will be siblings for life.",

Still, it's better than actually starting the job before the red flags start to pop up—at least marginally. This candidate reached the point of actually laughing in the interviewer's face when they were presented with an offer that they found to be—well, laughable. Everything seemed all well and good during the process; the gig was full-time as advertised despite not guaranteeing those hours. The point of issue came when the interviewer began describing the company's travel policy, as, you see, travel would be necessary for the role. As it turns out, the company expected their staff to share hotel rooms with complete strangers while traveling for work, which prompted the candidate's uncontrollable outburst. This, of course, put a quick end to the interview as the candidate then hurried to share what had just happened online.",

As long as you're doing that, plus covering yourself with a paper trail, you should be fine to watch as his mistakes ruin his day. Managers will talk about hiring employees they can count on, then turn around and micromanage them. It's pretty self-defeating, but that doesn't stop bosses from breathing down their employees' necks for no reason at all. This person, u/Stumpy6464, had to watch as their boss made a mistake, and no matter how much this employee tried to warn them, the boss just kept referencing policy. At least this employee now has a great story of malicious compliance to share. Commenters loved their story, and added that the boss was really to blame here at the end of the day. One person noted that they especially needed a better system to ensure events like this wouldn't happen in the future, since it is wasteful to let so much product get ruined for no reason other than maliciously complying. Up next, have a laugh at some really funny costume mistakes, like one person who was exasperated to find that their \"Halloween costume came and the gloves only have 4 fingers.\"",

I’m happy to draw characters from comics,games,movies, RPG’s or even original designs. I even drew someone’s family dog a couple months ago!  I use the site Artistree which allows us to communicate through the entire process and you’ll have multiple opportunities to give feedback and make adjustments as we work through sketches, inks and finally colors.

    "description": "Horror movies, as of late, have gone to great lengths to solve the key obstacle to horror movies- cell phones. When we live in a world where help is a phone call away, it's hard to imagine the characters not doing that. So screenwriters put them in situations where this is impossible: in Midsommar they isolate them in rural Sweden, in Get Out calling the police is only going to put our protagonist in more danger. But what's possibly more common is making the film a period piece- like the X/Pearl/Maxxxine trilogy, Late Night with the Devil, or Netflix's continuing series of R.L. Stine adaptations. I bring this up, because today's horror starts in 1993. A Norwegian software company launched its software product to mild acclaim. Like every company, it had its ups and downs, its successes and missteps. On the surface, it was a decent enough place to work. Over the years, the company tried to stay up to date with technology. In 1993, the major languages one might use for launching a major software product, your options are largely C or Pascal. Languages like Python existed, but weren't widely used or even supported on most systems. But the company stayed in business and needed to update their technology as time passed, which meant the program gradually grew and migrated to new languages. Which meant, by the time Niklas F joined the company, they were on C#. Even though they'd completely changed languages, the codebase still derived from the original C codebase. And that meant that the codebase had many secrets, dark corners, and places a developer should never look. Like every good horror movie protagonist, Niklas heard the \"don't go in there!\" and immediately went in there. And lurking in those shadows was the thing every developer fears the most: homebrew date handling code. /// /// /// /// /// public static DateTime LastDayInMonth(DateTime dt) { int day = 30; switch (dt.Month) { case 1: day = 31; break; case 2: if (IsLeapYear(dt)) day = 29; else day = 28; break; case 3: day = 31; break; case 4: day = 30; break; case 5: day = 31; break; case 6: day = 30; break; case 7: day = 31; break; case 8: day = 31; break; case 9: day = 30; break; case 10: day = 31; break; case 11: day = 30; break; case 12: day = 31; break; } return new DateTime(dt.Year, dt.Month, day, 0, 0, 0); } /// /// /// /// /// public static bool IsLeapYear(DateTime dt) { bool ret = (((dt.Year % 4) == 0) \u0026\u0026 ((dt.Year % 100) != 0) || ((dt.Year % 400) == 0)); return ret; } For a nice change of pace, this code isn't incorrect. Even the leap year calculation is actually correct (though my preference would be to just return the expression instead of using a local variable). But that's what makes this horror all the more insidious: there are built-in functions to handle all of this, but this code works and will likely continue to work, just sitting there, like a demon that we've made a pact with. And suddenly we realize this isn't Midsommar but Ari Aster's other hit film, Hereditary, and we're trapped being in a lineage of monsters, and can't escape our inheritance. .comment {border: none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
