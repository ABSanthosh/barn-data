    "description": "Weddings tend to bring out the dramatic side of families, as this soon-to-be-married man can tell you. He's dealing with some complicated family issues while preparing for his big day in about a year. A lot of people question whether they're doing the right thing or not by picking and choosing who to invite to their wedding day. For many people, it's a cherished occasion that (hopefully) only happens once in a lifetime. People fret over who to invite: Friends? Coworkers? Acquaintances? Distant relatives? Should random plus-ones be allowed? It's quite the dilemma. Folks often pop onto Reddit seeking advice, but at the end of the day, it's a very personal decision that has to come from the person getting married. For this man, some sensitive family issues have reemerged after he extended an olive branch to his maternal side of the family. After years of not speaking, he chose to invite some of his maternal relatives to his wedding. What a kind thing to do, and a nuanced way of approaching a difficult decision. Now, those relatives are now trying to boss this person around! Up next,  read about the mom who's forcing her daughter to choose between her and her BF over the holidays.",

    "description": "Not everyone can think of the best answer to a question in the moment during a job interview. Thoughtful answers require time and consideration, luxuries you do not have on hand when a recruiter is sitting opposite you with a notepad full of observations about your temperament. Sometimes, the only things that come to mind are the answers you should not give. In the spirit of this self-destructive impulse, let's dig deeper into the lore of all the things one should not address in a job interview, from bad habits to oversharing of all kinds. Here, we've compiled a list of job interview memes where folks unearthed the subconscious thoughts that everyone is tempted to say even if they should not. Classic interview questions like, \"What's your greatest weakness?\" or \"Do you have any special skills?\" or \"Where do you see yourself in 10 years?\" often lead to generic and thoughtless responses, when what we really want to say is \"Late night McDonald's orders\" or \"Passing gas on command\" or \"Divorced and living with multiple cats, \"respectively.Keep scrolling below for these job interview memes.

    "description": "Losing a friend is something that is hard for everyone - humans and animals alike. And although we know that some people still find it hard to believe that some cats and dogs can be best friends… they really can. And this doggo proves it. Because when this dog's best cat friend crossed the rainbow bridge, he was heartbroken. We don't know if we have ever seen an animal actually mourn a friend, but we saw it today, in this video. It's undeniable that this doggo loved that cat, so it's hard to be mad at it for being a little wary when his family adopted a new kitty for him. But eventually, after enough time and nagging from the cute black kitty, the doggo caved. Because he had all that space in his heart left by his best friend to fill. He didn't replace his old friend, he just made a new one, and yes… yeah, get the tissues before you watch this one.",

Such an adorable little floof, no wonder he makes every weekend with him feel so feline better. We snuggled next to him when he napped, we played with him when he wanted to spend some cute cat energy, and we petted him for purrs and biscuit-making sessions. It was really the most wholesome weekend we could ever ask for.But now Monday came, and we're not in Kansas anymore. Yes, we want that weekend wholesomeness only a cat can give, but it's not the weekend. But we can help us, and you, feel like it again - with a bunch of wholesome cat memes. Their feline humor is like a sweet cat meowing softly, helping us, humble hoomans, feel heartwarming feline feels like it's the weekend.",

    "description": "As we recap some of the best moments of the year, make sure you check this report, which is very important, so important the entire company has to stop what it's doing. Original. --Remy Branon's boss, Steve, came storming into his cube. From the look of panic on his face, it was clear that this was a full hair-on-fire emergency. \"Did we change anything this weekend?\" \"No,\" Branon said. \"We never deploy on a weekend.\" \"Well, something must have changed?!\" After a few rounds of this, Steve's panic wore off and he explained a bit more clearly. Every night, their application was supposed to generate a set of nightly reports and emailed them out. These reports went to a number of people in the company, up to and including the CEO. Come Monday morning, the CEO checked his inbox and horror of horror- there was no report! \"And going back through people's inboxes, this seems like it's been a problem for months- nobody seems to have received one for months.\" \"Why are they just noticing now?\" Branon asked. \"That's really not the problem here. Can you investigate why the emails aren't going out?\" Branon put aside his concerns, and agreed to dig through and debug the problem. Given that it involved sending emails, Branon was ready to spend a long time trying to debug whatever was going wrong in the chain. Instead, finding the problem only took about two minutes, and most of that was spent getting coffee. public void Send() { //TODO: send email here } This application had been in production over a year. This function had not been modified in that time. So while it's technically true that no one had received a report \"for months\" (16 months is a number of months), it would probably have been more accurate to say that they had never received a report. Now, given that it had been over a year, you'd think that maybe this report wasn't that important, but now that the CEO had noticed, it was the most important thing at the company. Work on everything else stopped until this was done- mind you, it only took one person a few hours to implement and test the feature, but still- work on everything else stopped. A few weeks later a new ticket was opened: people felt that the nightly reports were too frequent, and wanted to instead just go to the site to pull the report, which is what they had been doing for the past 16 months. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
