    "description": "Meals are undoubtedly one of the most important daily chores, along with sleep. Being properly fed is one of the things that everything else in a successful and happy life stems from. But providing healthy meals for your family isn't cheap… Have you seen the price of groceries these days? And the time it takes to cook and clean for an entire family can't be understated. So, undoubtedly, the combination of those two things, the time and the price of the actual food, would be supremely valuable. Of course, you can just trick your sous-chef brother into cooking for your three children instead. Surely, if he's willing to do it once for free, you can just ask him to do it again and again. Even when it comes to family, there's a limit to the favors you're expected to perform, and there's a point where demanding favors just becomes freeloading and entitlement.",

However, this time, you are completely stumped.Perhaps you're not used to this phenomenon. Perhaps you were the kind of student who always studied and yet, for whatever reason, the topic presented in this one question was a complete blind spot for you in your preparation. If you're clever, you can find a way to connect the question to an adjacent, related topic that you do know something about. Unfortunately, sometimes, there is no dancing around the reality that you can't smooth talk your way out of this one. A lot of these students had fun with the fact that they were 100% failing their exams. After all, if you're going to fail, you might as well fail gloriously.Keep scrolling below for this collection of exam fails.

Just know that Magnus was a good boy who was just trying to warn his Dad about something very bad that was going to happen, but instead he ended up making his Dad super mad. Like…SUPER mad. There is a saying in the community that “Magnus did nothing wrong” and while I am not sure if that’s entirely true (he did after all destroy the magical wards that protected holy Terra from the Warp), I do think he had good intentions.",

The couldn't afford taking care of a cat anymore, they found out they were allergic… there are all kinds of reasons. At least everyone who returns a cat is a heartbroken, at least that's what we thought. We never imagined that someone would do it because the cat they adopted wanted to cuddle with them at nighttime. Everyone wants a velcro cat, right? Cuddly cats are the best! Cuddling with your cat is one of the best feelings in the world. The trust they show you, the love, the calmness that being so close to them gives you… there is nothing quite like it. To complain about a cat being too cuddly is like complaining about something being too tasty. It's silly. And ridiculous. And thank goodness that this sweet girl is now in the hands of someone who actually deserves her.",

    "description": "Ross needed to write software to integrate with a credit card payment gateway. The one his company chose was relatively small, and only served a handful of countries- but it covered the markets they cared about and the transaction fees were cheap. They used XML for data interchange, and while they had no published schema document, they did have some handy-dandy sample code which let you parse their XML messages. $response = curl_exec($ch); $authecode = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $responsecode = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $retrunamount = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $trxnnumber = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $trxnstatus = fetch_data($response, '', ''); $trxnresponsemessage = fetch_data($response, '', ''); Well, this looks… worrying. At first glance, I wonder if we're going to have to kneel before Z̸̭͖͔͂̀ā̸̡͖͕͊l̴̜͕͋͌̕g̸͉̳͂͊ȯ̷͙͂̐. What exactly does fetch_data actually do? function fetch_data($string, $start_tag, $end_tag) { $position = stripos($string, $start_tag); $str = substr($string, $position); $str_second = substr($str, strlen($start_tag)); $second_positon = stripos($str_second, $end_tag); $str_third = substr($str_second, 0, $second_positon); $fetch_data = trim($str_third); return $fetch_data; } Phew, no regular expressions, just… lots of substrings. This parses the XML document with no sense of the document's structure- it literally just searches for specific tags, grabs whatever is between them, and calls it done. Nested tags? Attributes? Self-closing tags? Forget about it. Since it doesn't enforce that your open and closing tags match, it also lets you grab arbitrary (and invalid) document fragments- fetch_data($response, \"\", \"\"), for example. And it's not like this needs to be implemented from scratch- PHP has built-in XML parsing classes. We could argue that by limiting ourselves to a subset of XML (which I can only hope this document does) and doing basic string parsing, we've built a much simpler approach, but I suspect that after doing a big pile of linear searches through the document, we're not really going to see any performance benefits from this version- and maintenance is going to be a nightmare, as it's so fragile and won't work for many very valid XML documents. It's always amazing when TRWTF is neither PHP nor XML but… whatever this is.

Have you heard about the new, hot encoding standard for 2024?!\" exclaimed Daniel , kvetching \"Well, if you haven't then Gravity Forms co. is going to change your mind: URLEncode everything now! Specially if you need to display some diacritics on your website. Throw away the old, forgotten UTF-8. Be a cool guy, just use that urlencode!\"   Immediately afterward, Daniel also sent us another good example, this time from Hetzner. He complains \"Hetzner says the value is invalid. Of course they won't say what is or isn't allowed. It wasn't the slash character, it was... a character with diacritics! Hetzner is clearly using US-ASCII created in 1960's.\"   Finally this week, we pulled something out of the archive from Boule de Berlin who wrote \"Telekom, the biggest German ISP, shows email address validation is hard. They use a regex that limits the TLD part of an email address to 4 chars.\" Old but timeless.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
