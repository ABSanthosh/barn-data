    "description": "There are people in this world whose first instinct is to play the fool when they are caught doing something wrong. Of course, this is the kind of behavior we often associate with children when they are caught eating one more piece of candy after their parents have said they have consumed enough sweets or when they sneak out of their rooms well after bedtime to watch one more hour of television. Regardless of how strict parents are with their children, kids will always break the rules and then pretend they have no idea that they are doing anything wrong. It's expected behavior.Now, when adults are caught red-handed, one would think they would have enough chutzpah to confess their wrongdoing and own up to it… but one would be wrong to think this way. In fact, many adults have the tendency to double down on their behavior, as this entitled fool did when he was caught using a stranger's email address with the same first and last name for hotel bookings.",

    "description": "Nobody is above the law, not even people who work in law enforcement, especially not people who work for law enforcement. Not only are they not above it, but if they try to use their status to their favor, they should definitely not be getting away with those kinds of actions.The main problem is, that not many people would be willing to stand up to people like that. It is not easy to stand in front of an officer and tell them that they are wrong, or that they are using their power for \"bad\". People who are brave enough to stand up and call out law enforcement people like that, definitely deserve some kind of award.The resident in this story did just that when they encountered an entitled driver who kept parking in their private parking spot. At one point, the resident decided they had enough of that behavior, and blocked the entitled driver's car with his own, essentially preventing him from leaving. That led to quite a dispute when the driver returned to their car, realized he couldn't leave, and pulled out a badge to intimidate the resident into letting him drive off. Keep scrolling to see how that worked out for him…",

    "description": "One of the things that we love the most about itty bitty kittens is that no one can resist their cuteness. Absolutely no one. You can be the meanest, buffest, scariest looking human, and once you see a kitten, you will just melt. We all turn into fluffy marshmallows when a kitten shows us even the smallest bit of attention. It's the only thing that explains why so many buff men fall in love with kittens. Because they can't help it. And kittens seem to love those buff dudes just as much as the dudes love them. And you know what? We love all of it. The kittens, the buffness, the combination of the two. We can't resist it either. So when we saw this video coming across our timeline, it just- hit. A tiny fur-ball kitten asks huge, kind dude to become his mom, and what do you know? It happens. Just like that. Irresistible. And to top it all off, the two of them do everything together- all the way up to and including going to the gym.",

We awoke this meowrning, like we do almost every meowrning, to our cat stepping on our face to wake us up and demand we feed them breakfast (at 6 o'clock in the morning). We've grown to accept this, although we must say that in the beginning it was quite the back-and-forth between us. Like all good hooman servants, we caved, and now we get up at six to feed our cat breakfast, then go back to bed.This is our cat's toxic trait, and we're sure your cats have some hilarious traits as well that you wish were non-existent. The cat pawrents of the internet confessed, and let's just say that we're happy ours just wakes us up in the early hours of the meowrning. This thread is not only silly, but purrfectly relatable. Just know that you're not alone, and all of our cats also drive us a little coo-coo for cocoa puffs sometimes. Scroll down and enjoy all these hissterical kitties below!",

    "description": "Ted's company hired a contract team to build an application. The budget eventually ran out without a finished application, so the code the contract team had produced was handed off to Ted's team to finish. This is an example of the Ruby code Ted inherited: def self.is_uniqueness(mr_number) out = false mrn = PatientMrn.find_by_mr_number(mr_number) if mrn out = true return mrn end return nil end The function is called is_uniqueness which is definitely some language barrier naming (is_unique is a more English way of wording it). But if we trace through the logic, this is just a wrapper around PatientMrn.find_by_mr_number- it returns an \"mrn\". So, the first obvious problem: this isn't checking uniqueness in any way, shape or form. Then there's the whole check for a valid record- either we find a record or we return nil. But since find_by_mr_number is clearly returning something falsy, that doesn't seem necessary. And that is the default behavior for the Rails generated find_by methods- they just return nil if there are no records. So none of the checks are needed here. This whole method isn't needed here. Finally, there's out. I have no idea what they were trying to accomplish here, but it smells like they wanted a global variable that they could check after the call for error statuses. If that was their goal, they failed in a few ways- first, returning nil conveys the same information. Second, global variables in Ruby get a $ sigil in front of them. What the out variable truly represents is \"do I want out of this codebase?\" True. That is definitely true.

    "description": "Happy 2025 to all our readers. I can already tell this year's columns are going to be filled with my (least) favorite form of WTF, the impossible endless gauntlet of flaming password hurdles to jump over or crawl under. Please comment if you know why this week's column has this title and why it doesn't have the title Swordfish. Peter G. starts off our new year of password maladies with a complaint that is almost poetic. \"Between desire and reality. Between fact and breakfast. Between 8 and -6:00. Madness lies, lies, lies...\"   Rick P. keeps it going. \"Must begin with a capital letter!!!\" he exclaims with three (3!) exclamation points. I think it deserved four.   Mark Whybird justifiably grumbled \"If I knew what the policy was, maybe then I could come up with a password to satisfy it!\"   R3D3-1 who swears he is NOT a bot, found a kind of interestingly complicated error challenge, opining \"Password requirements can be annoying. Especially when they don't tell you what the requirements are, only that you failed. But here they send me a confirmation Email, and only when clicking the confirmation Email did they even tell me! That's kind of a new low there... \"   And finally ending this beginning, faithful Pascal remarks only: \"WTF\". Well said.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
