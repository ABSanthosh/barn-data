    "description": "As children, we waited for the day we could live in a place of our own without our parents breathing down our necks and dictating what we could and couldn't do. Being a child means abiding by your parents' rules. Fine, I'll take it. Once we move out, however, it's free reign. We can throw parties, have potential romantic partners over for a candlelit dinner, and walk around in any kind of clothes we want. Living alone is beautiful for a multitude of reasons. That's why sacrificing our bachelor(ette) pads is so difficult when family needs to stay with us for a while. When said family starts acting like they own your house, especially when they're not paying anything to live under your roof. In this next story, a 27-year-old woman decides to start charging her stepdad rent after he tries to start dictating what she wears and when her boyfriend can come over \"their\" house. The daughter makes it known that she's had enough of his tyranny.",

    "description": "With 8 inches of snow covering the ground, one guy got to work shoveling. It's not the most fun job in the world, but someone's got to do it! For most people, shovelling snow is one of those reasons they dread the sight of any snowfall. While kids get to frolic around in the snow and build snow forts, the adults are stuck sweeping the snow from pathways and using those ice scrapers to de-ice the windshields. This person had not only one car to save from the 8 inches of snow, but two! They report that it took them roughly 45 minutes in freezing cold temperatures to get the two cars shoveled out. That explains their reaction when they realized their neighbor did them wrong! This neighbor had the audacity to steal that freshly-shoveled spot with their own car. That's just asking for trouble! Next, read about the employees who are driving their coworkers crazy with their incompetence, like one woman who is \"manually deleting… 180,000 emails.\"",

    "description": "The beautiful thing about the CDS (also know as the iconic and impeccable Cat Distribution System) is that it can hit you at any time. You never see it coming. A cat can adopt you when you go on a walk, just walking up to you, choosing you and making you theirs. A cat might jump into your car and leave you with absolutely no choice but to take them with you, no matter where it is that you are going. A momma cat might show up at your door with kittens, and then, you will simply have to adopt them all. That's how it works. Even on a simple, short, pizza run, you are not safe from the CDS. Not that you would want to be safe from it. Getting chosen by the CDS is an honor, and having an adorable stray cat jump into your loving arms and agree to go with your wherever you are going while you are on a pizza run is just about the best thing that could happen to anyone.",

However, there is the occasional mix-up. We're not mad about it, in fact, the mix-up usually ends up being better than what we ordered in the first place. It's the darndest thing, really. We open our package, turn around for one second, and poof! All of a sudden, a cat is in our package instead of what we ordered!We're not sure what kind of sorcery this is, but it's purrfectly silly and we love it. These packages may not have what we ordered, but they do contain four cat paws and a whole lot of love, so that's better than anything we could have ordered in the first place. Whatever you're doing Amazon, keep doing it. It's pawsitively meowgical. Scroll down to see all of these boxes below that meowgically made some kitties appear. It's almost too silly to believe!",

I don't think there is one for English. \"To Whom It May Concern\" is probably the best we can do.   \"A coworker shared this phishing email he got,\" reported Adam R. \"Even the scammers have trouble with their email templating variable names too.\" (It's there at the end).   Mathematically-minded Marcel V. thinks these numbers don't figure. \"The update process of my Overwatch game left me wondering.

However, if bytes were meant, then how is it trying to reclaim the last .65 bytes??\"   Big Spender Jeff W. humblebrags \"If you have to ask, you can't afford it.\"   Finishing up for the week, Bruce R. signs off with \"This dialog from CNN seems a little overdone.\"   [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "Kirill writes: I've worked in this small company for a year, and on a daily basis I've come across things that make my eyes sink back into their sockets in fear, but mostly I've been too busy fixing them to post anything. It being my last day however, here's a classic We'll take this one in parts. First, every element of the UI the user can navigate to is marked with an enum, defined thus: enum UiItem { SectionA, SectionB, SectionC,...SectionG } These names are not anonymized, so already I hate it. But it's the next enum that starts my skin crawling: enum SecurityUiItem { SectionA = UiItem.SectionA, SectionB = UiItem.SectionB, ... SectionG = UiItem.SectionG } A SecurityUiItem is a different type, but the values are identical to UiItem. These enums are used when trying to evaluate role-based permissions for access, and that code looks like this: if ((currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionA) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionA] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionA; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionB] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionB; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionC] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionC; ..... else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionG] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionG; else return UiItem.Unknown; Honestly, I don't hate the idea of having one data type representing the actual UI objects and a separate data type which represents permissions, and having a function which can map between these two things. But this is a perfect example of a good idea executed poorly. I also have to wonder about the fall-through pattern. If I have access to SectionA, I only seem to get SectionA out of this function. Are these permissions hierarchical? I have no idea, but I suspect there's a WTF underpinning this whole thing. Congratulations on Kirill's last day. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
