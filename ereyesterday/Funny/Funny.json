    "description": "When anyone first starts a new job at a new company, they hope they'll get along with not only their boss and their boss's boss but also their fellow colleagues. Work settings, however, do not rid their employees' of the childish mindset and behaviors they've been building since elementary school. When you think about it, workplaces are just adult daycare (for a paycheck), and someone is bound to step out of line and expose themselves for the whiny adult baby they are… If you've experienced an unprofessional, vengeful coworker, you know what I'm talking about.The story you're about to read is a tale about a coworker's vendetta against their colleague, the individual who posted the story. This coworker has been deleting and taking credit for work the colleague has completed, and their higher-ups are doing nothing about it but saying they'll \"keep an eye\" on it. If you're interested in this story, you can scroll below and see how it unfolds. Additionally, you'll find some comments from users who are offering advice on what their next steps should be.",

Dark, I know, but those who know what I am talking about, understand the struggle.Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there are always people who you want, and need, to please. You want them to like you, so you would do anything to make it happen, even if it hurts you in the process. You absolutely know it makes no sense, that you cannot expect everyone who meets you to like you, and you shouldn't put everyone else's needs above your own. But you do it anyway, and you cannot stop, which is how we end up with stories like the one down below.Wanting to be liked by your neighbors is one of the biggest challenges of a people pleaser, especially because neighbors are the worst. You can be as accommodating and considerate as possible, and your neighbor will still find something to complain about.If you don't believe me, maybe you will after reading this story.",

We could identify them if you blindfolded us, spun us around ten times, and then put us in a room filled with 100 other cats. We like to think we could, anyway. But in reality, if you put one of our cats next to one of their siblings, we might not be able to tell them apart if it were a real expurriment.In the thread below, you'll meet a feline pawrent and the cute cat they adopted. They went in knowing exactly which cat they wanted, and left with what they thought was their cat. Fast forward 1.5 meowgnificent years of love and care, and after looking through some old photos, they realized that their cat looked different than the pictures at the rescue shelter! What a cat-astrophe! Scroll down to read the full story below and figure out what caused this meowrvelous mixup.",

    "description": "Well, feline fans, yet another Valentine's Day has arrived and we're still choosing our cats as our dates. It's okay, we actually prefurr it. Cats are way better than hoomans anyway. Sure, they may wake us up at 5 AM every day to feed them, but they don't text us for days and then randomly ghost us, or tell us that they \"don't eat vegetables because vegetables are for women.\" No, our cats are there for us when we're feeling down, when we're happy, and are actually way better cuddlers than any of the hoomans we've met.So this year, we're skipping the Valentine's Day drama by staying in and scrolling through some pawsitively hissterical cat posts instead. It's us on the couch with our cats, a pizza, and reruns of our current favorite binge-watch. It's better than getting all dressed up and braving the winter weather, just to be disappointed a few hours later. If you've read this far, we prrrobably didn't even need to convince you anyway. Enjoy!",
