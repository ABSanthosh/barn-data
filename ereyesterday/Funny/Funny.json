    "description": "Allergies should be taken seriously, obviously. I'm allergic to bees; Truthfully, a big ol' carpenter bee was in my house this morning. I had a cup, a giant blanket, sunglasses, and a dream… Needless to say, crisis averted. I'm the first person to say that allergies can make or break someone, literally, and it's important to abide by the allergic person's requests sometimes. This is especially true when someone has an allergy to food, and the good ol' peanut allergy knows how to ruin someone's day.Why are peanuts in almost every factory? What's up with that? Even still, it's up to the employees working the register to let their inquiring customers know if their allergen is in the food products. Some entitled folks, though, ask the questions but don't believe the answers. You'd think that if the employee triple-checked a container to make sure no allergens were in a tub of ice cream, the customer would feel at peace. At that point, it might be safe to say that they shouldn't eat out if they require a call to the Ben \u0026 Jerry's factory…Scroll below to see the fallout between a young, seasonal ice cream shop employee and a customer who refuses to believe them.",

    "description": "If you packed a lunch for work today, pat yourself on the back. That is such a good habit to get in! Some people are forced to do that because their office is in a food desert, but when it's not… Well, let's just say it's hard to find the motivation to pack a lunch every single day to bring to work when you can just walk right outside and grab a delicious sandwich. Usually, packing your own lunch tends to be healthier and cheaper. So when you pack a lunch, that is a great achievement! Congrats. Now you have something to look forward to! But, oh no, what's this? You have a psychopath in the bunch who is stealing people's lunches! Somehow they are too sneaky to get caught and you can't do the ole laxative in the food thing or else HR will get you for poisoning or something. Luckily, in the case of this woman and her office lunch thief, she didn't even have to take any action to catch him.",

    "description": "Hey there, almost-30 crowd. Millennials who remember dial-up but also know what TikTok is. People who now groan as they're sitting down. You've made it this far. And honestly? That deserves a gold star, a nap, and probably a cat or two curled on your lap for emeowtional support.Adulting is weird. One moment you're buying a rug and feeling proud, the next you're crying because someone finished your oat milk. But through it all, one thing has stayed constant: cats. Their little bleps. Their dramatic stares. Their chaotic 3 AM zoomies. Their refusal to respect personal space (but only when you're busy).These wholesome cat memes are like a fuzzy little blanket for your soul. They're here to remind you that even if your back hurts for no reason, even if your inbox has 87 unread emails, and even if your dinner is just vibes and cereal... you're doing okay. So take a break, breathe deep, and scroll through these almost-30-approved feline funnies. It's not a hug from your childhood cat, but it's pretty darn close.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Purrsonally, we understand the desire to help every cat you meet. It's something instinctual in us. We see a cat on the street and we are swept up by the urge to take them home, feed them some tuna, and teach them to snuggle. However, not every cat needs saving, despite how they may look on the outside. Some cats have a pawsitively enjoyable neighborhood life, with one main family and several side-families that feed them, love them, and house them. You might be surprised how common it is for a cat to have multiple families.So, when the cat lover in this post wrote about how she wanted to save this cat from a life outside, we get it. However, she goes on to say that the cat is clean and well-cared for, so at what point does she need to convince herself that she's not actually saving the cat, but stealing it? We'll leave it to you to find out what happens in the end, but let's just say that everyone gets a purrfectly happy ending!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly.

    "description": "Maybe we'll just try and read a book. That's a good way to spend your vacation. This can't possibly go badly! Original --Remy \"Have you had a chance to look at that JIRA ticket yet?\" Marge debated pretending she hadn't seen the Slack message yet—but, if she did, she knew Gary would just walk over to her desk and badger her further. In truth, she didn't want to look at the ticket: it was a low priority ticket, and worse, it only affected a small fraction of one client's customers, meaning it was likely to be some weird edge case bug nobody would ever run into again. Maybe if I ignore it long enough, it'll go away on its own, she thought. The client was a bookseller with a small but signifigant-to-them online presence; the software they used to sell books, including your standard e-commerce account functionality, was made by Marge's company. The bug was somewhere in the password reset feature: some customers, seemingly at random, were unable to use the password reset link the software emailed out. Marge pulled up the ticket, looking over the half-hearted triage work that had been done before it landed on her desk to solve. The previous guy had pulled logs and figured out that all the customers who were complaining were using the same ISP based out of Germany. He'd recommended reaching out to them, but had been transferred to another division before he'd gotten around to it. When Marge realized that the contact information was all in German, she almost gave up then and there. But with the magic of Google Translate, she managed to get in touch with a representative via email. After a bit of back and forth, she noticed this gem in one of his (translated) replies: We want to display mails in our webmail client as close to the original as possible. Since most mails are HTML formatted, the client supports the full HTTP protocol and can display (almost) all HTML tags. Unfortunately, this means that \"evil\" JS-Content in such mails can do all kinds of stuff in the browser and therefore on the customer's PC. To avert this, all mails are processed by a \"SafeBrowsing\"-module before they are displayed, to recognize and circumvent such manipulations. One of those security measures is the recognition of js-modules that begin with \"on...\", since that are mostly js functions that are triggered by some event in the browser. Our \"countermeasure\" is to just replace \"on...\" with \"no...\" before the HTML content is sent to the rendering process. Marge frowned at the answer for a bit, something nagging at her mind. \"There's no way,\" she murmured as she pulled up the access logs. Sure enough, the url for the reset link was something like https://bookseller.com?oneTimeToken=deadbeef ... and the customers in question had accessed https://bookseller.com?noeTimeToken=deadbeef instead. A few lines of code and it was resolved: a conditional would check for the incorrect query string parameter and copy the token to the correct query string parameter instead. Marge rolled her eyes, merged her change into the release branch, and finally, at long last, closed that annoying low-priority ticket once and for all. hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); code { font-family: Consolas, monospace; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.

    "description": "Where did you GOTO on your vacation? Nowhere. GOTO is considered harmful. Original --Remy Everybody knows that you should never use \"goto\" statements. Well, except in one or two rare circumstances that you won't come across anyway. But even when you do come across those situations, they're usually \"mirage cases\" where there's no need to \"goto\" anyway. Kinda like today's example, written by Jonathan Rockway's colleague. Of course, the irony here is that the author likely tried to use \"continue\" as his label, but was forced to abbreviate it to \"cont\" in order to skirt compiler \"reserved words\" errors. while( sysmgr-\u003egetProcessCount() != 0 ) { // Yes, I realize \"goto\" statements are considered harmful, // but this is a case where it is OK to use them cont: //inactivation is not guaranteed and may take up to 3 calls sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eTryInactivate(); if( sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eIsActive() ) { Sleep(DEFAULT_TIMEOUT); goto cont; } /* ED: Snip */ //disconnect child processes if( sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eHasChildProcesses() ) { /* ED: Snip */ } /* ED: Snip */ if( sysmgr-\u003eCurrentProcess()-\u003eIsReusable() ) { sysmgr-\u003eReuseCurrentProcess(); goto cont; } sysmgr-\u003eCloseCurrentProcess(); } [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
