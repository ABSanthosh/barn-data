    "description": "Father's Day is difficult for those without their fathers present in their lives, whether that be because of forces beyond their control or otherwise. The holiday might be a reminder of bad memories or the absence of good ones. This is why one should never assume anything about another's family life, especially in the workplace. In the office, especially if you're in a leadership position, you have to be very careful about what you say to your colleagues. If you're not careful, willful ignorance and arrogance with leave you with a one-way ticket out of the office door.This next story is a testament to the notion that one should never assume. An arrogant middle manager tries to guilt an employee for not gifting their father something for Father's Day. Little does the manager know that the employee couldn't give their father a gift even if they wanted to… Scroll below to read the rest of the story. Let's just say that the poster of this next story knows how to play with their morbid humor effectively…",

This guy was getting into his car with his wife after their weekly trip to the grocery store when an impatient driver began honking at them because she wanted their parking space. Of course, this was pretty unnecessary, but the author and his wife just went about their routine. They finished putting their groceries in the trunk and got into their car at their own pace, while this lady was driving closer and closer to their car to make herself known. The author obviously had taken the hint at this point, but this woman couldn't help herself. It got to the point that by the time the author was backing out of his parking space, he could barely move because this woman's car was so close to his. It's as if she wanted to get into an accident. At that point, the author had had enough of this lady and decided to enact some well-deserved petty revenge…",

And they always behave like cats - they will have the same moments of shenanigans and love, no matter who they are. We mean that. And still, we know that some people still have a special kind of appreciation for special breed cats, like Maine Coon cats or Norwegian forest cats. Those cats are stunning and meowgestic and amazing, and we understand why someone would want that. We are also really happy to see that when things don't quite work out, and the special breed cat that you paid for turned out to not be what you wanted it to be, that people still remember that cats are cats, and cats deserve love and homes whether they are worth thousands of dollars or not. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

From the theft of food from right under our noses, to mind-bending leaps that defy the very laws of physics, to singing the songs of their people. There is hardly a thing in the world that our clever cattos do not excel at. And one of those special qualities is their ability to sleep in some of the strangest and silliest positions known to man. The kind of poses that hurt your back just to look at them, let alone to imagine falling asleep in them for several hours.And today we wanted to celebrate these creative sleepers with this list of cats who turn nap time into an Olympic sport of peculiar poses. So get your pen and paper out and get ready to judge this fierce feline competition. Just be prepawed for a feisty response from the losers.",

They also got a bit combative about people critiquing their Perl code: # COMPLEX SUBNET MATH # Looking up a value in an array was faster than any mathematical solution. Yes, it's hard coded, but these values won't ever change anyway. Stop being so #### about it. $Subnets = @(\"0.0.0.0\",\"128.0.0.0\",\"192.0.0.0\",\"224.0.0.0\",\"240.0.0.0\",\"248.0.0.0\",\"252.0.0.0\",\"254.0.0.0\",\"255.0.0.0\",\"255.128.0.0\",\"255.192.0.0\",\"255.224.0.0\",\"255.240.0.0\",\"255.248.0.0\",\"255.252.0.0\",\"255.254.0.0\",\"255.255.0.0\",\"255.255.128.0\",\"255.255.192.0\",\"255.255.224.0\",\"255.255.240.0\",\"255.255.248.0\",\"255.255.252.0\",\"255.255.254.0\",\"255.255.255.0\",\"255.255.255.128\",\"255.255.255.192\",\"255.255.255.224\",\"255.255.255.240\",\"255.255.255.248\",\"255.255.255.252\",\"255.255.255.254\",\"255.255.255.255\") I believe them when they say that the lookup array is faster, but it leaves me wondering: what are they doing where performance matters that much? I don't actually think this ascends to the level of a WTF, but I do think the defensive comment is funny. Clearly, the original developer was having a time with people complaining about it. Frank notes that while Perl has a reputation as a \"write only language,\" this particular set of scripts was actually quite easy to read and maintain. So yes, I guess we should stop being so #### about it.

    "description": "Ah, bad date handling. We've all seen it. We all know it. So when Lorenzo sent us this C# function, we almost ignored it: private string GetTimeStamp(DateTime param) { string retDate = param.Year.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Month \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Day \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; else retDate = retDate + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; if (param.Hour \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Minute \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Second \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; if (param.Millisecond \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Millisecond.ToString(); else retDate = retDate + param.Millisecond.ToString(); return retDate; } Most of this function isn't terribly exciting. We've seen this kind of bad code before, but even when we see a repeat like this, there are still special treats in it. Look at the section for handling milliseconds: if the number is less than 10, they pad it with a leading zero. Just the one, though. One leading zero should be enough for everybody. But that's not the thing that makes this code special. You see, there's another function worth looking at: private string FileTimeStamp(DateTime param) { string retDate = param.Year.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Month \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Month.ToString() + \"-\"; if (param.Day \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; else retDate = retDate + param.Day.ToString() + \" \"; if (param.Hour \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Hour.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Minute \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Minute.ToString() + \":\"; if (param.Second \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; else retDate = retDate + param.Second.ToString() + \".\"; if (param.Millisecond \u003c 10) retDate = retDate + \"0\" + param.Millisecond.ToString(); else retDate = retDate + param.Millisecond.ToString(); return retDate; } Not only did they fail to learn the built-in functions for formatting dates, they forgot about the functions they wrote for formatting dates, and just wrote (or realistically, copy/pasted?) the same function twice. At least both versions have the same bug with milliseconds. I don't know if I could handle it if they were inconsistent about that. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
