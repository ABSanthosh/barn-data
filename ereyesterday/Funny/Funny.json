    "description": "Neighborly parking disputes are no new thing, but they almost constitute \"friendly fire\" when they take shape between members of the same household. There's nothing worse than living with someone who just thinks they're completely immune to the rules and social obligations that everyone else has to follow. This type of behavior speaks volumes to the propensity for people to be petty and selfish, trying to shape the world around them into a form that best suits them independent of any moral or even logical reason. At this point, you probably already have someone in mind who fits this description, probably even a specific former roommate, as it's simply the luck of the draw that you'll have some such roommate at least some point in your life.This young woman got her own roommate's car towed when her roommate repeatedly insisted on blocking both of their allocated spots, taking up both spots so that it was easier to get her own car in and out at the expense of the ability of her roommates to park in the second spot. After the confrontation that was sparked by her roommate's behavior and her own drastic measures, she turned to this online community to see if she was in the wrong for her actions.",

    "description": "Just because someone throws a fit does not mean you have to give in to their demands. On the flip side, just because you threw a fit does not mean you have earned what you want. You would think that these sentiments would be common knowledge to any decent, empathetic human being. But alas, you'd be surprised. Here, we have a Redditor who specifically booked a window seat for her upcoming flight because the one thing she genuinely enjoys about flying is looking at the clouds. Of course, this experience was ruined when a family of three approached her seat and the entitled six-year-old son started having a full-blown meltdown because he wanted the window seat his parents had not purchased. Thankfully, the Redditor refused to back down despite the fact that everyone else on the plane had turned their heads to watch this fiasco unfold. While the kid's parents proved to be unhelpful and aggressive to the passenger, hopefully the kid learned a valuable lesson that day: you can't scream and cry your way into everything you want.For more stories like this, take a look at this one about a husband who confronted his wife over her Taylor Swift-themed Holiday decorations around the house.",

You might get adopted by a kitten on a hike, when you go out for that mental health walk that everyone talks about. Or you might get adopted by a kitten who just… shows up one day and sits on driveway, ready to rule your entire home before you even know it's coming. Or… maybe you're like this couple, and the most important day of your life also turns out to be the most impurrtant day of your future kitten's life.Not only did this kitten crash this couple's wedding, but she did it straight in the middle of the ceremony, forcing them to stop it and pay attention to her. Because the Cat Distribution System doesn't ask when to give you a cat, it just does it, and you… are just blessed by it.",

And what's a better official opening ceremony for such a festive event there is other than scrolling through a bunch of wholesome cat memes? Under the blanket, of course. With your cat cuddled with you, of course. For us, it sounds like the pawrfect purrlympics opening ceremony. To be honest, we're doing the same. As we write these words, we're under a comfy blanket, snuggled with our cute cat. That's purrfection.To complete this blanket season opening, scroll down for a dose of sweetness in the form of wholesome cat memes. It fits any purrtrovert in your blanket-y situation.",

    "description": "Alice has the dubious pleasure of working with SalesForce. Management wants to make sure that any code is well tested, so they've set a requirement that all deployed code needs 75% code coverage. Unfortunately, properly configuring a code coverage tool is too hard, so someone came up with a delightful solution: just count how many lines are in your tests and how many lines are in your code, and make sure that your tests make up 75% of the total codebase. Given those metrics, someone added this test: public void testThis() { int i = 0; i++; i++; i++; i++; i++; // snip 35,990 lines i++; i++; i++; i++; } Keep adding lines, and you could easily get close to 100% code coverage, this way. Heck, if you get close enough to round up, it'll look like 100% code coverage. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "This week, a double dose of Daniel D. First he shared a lesson he titled \"Offer you can't refuse a.k.a. Falsehood programmers believe about prices\" explaining \"Some programmers believe that new prices per month (when paid annually) are always better then the old ones (when paid monthly). Only this time they have forgotten their long-time clients on legacy packages.\"   Then he found a few more effs. \"This e-shop required to create an account to download an invoice for order already delivered.

Well, because their programmers didn't expect somebody to paste a password. Once I did another JS event - e.g. clicked a submit button, it fixed itself.\"   And our Best Beastie in Black discovered \"Anomalies in the causal structure of our particular 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold have apparently caused this secure message portal belonging to a tax prep/audit company to count emails that haven't yet been sent by sender.\"   Traveler Tim R. struggled to pay for a visa, and reports this result. Rather than an error reported as success, we appear to have here a success reported as an error. \"We're all familiar with apps that throw up an eror dialog with the error message as success but it's particularly irritating when trying to submit a payment. This is what happened when I tried to pay for an Indian visa with Paypal. To add insult to injury, when you try to pay again, it says that due to errors and network problems, you must check back in 2 hours before attempting a repeat payment.\"   Finally Robert H. is all charged up about Chevy shenanigans. \"I thought one of the advantages of EV vehicles was they don't need oil changes?\"   [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
