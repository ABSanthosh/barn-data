    "description": "These HR pros wondered how employees thought they'd get away with their schemes. In this day and age, digital receipts and/or cameras will catch any workplace foolishness! Still, there are a lot of workers out there who just don't seem to care. One of the best stories here is about one creative employee who found a way to avoid working all day every day. Apparently he kept clocking in, disappearing all day, and then leaving at the end of the day. No one could figure out where he was, although he was definitely inside the building still. After a little sleuthing, the higher-ups finally realized that this dude had found an elevator shaft with a crawl space in it. He was spending 8 hours a day napping there! That's one of the most dangerous and most ingenious ways to get out of work ever… until the elevator needs maintenance, that is! At least that worker got discovered before he got hurt, and good for him for taking naps on company time (he's living the dream!). Scroll down to check out a bunch of great stories from HR professionals and employees who witnessed their coworkers getting fired. Then, this couple was dealing with a nosy neighbor, so they gave her exactly what she wanted so they'd fit into the neighborhood: \"We decorated.\"",

    "description": "It doesn't seem likely that this family will ever recover after this wedding debacle.The groom had been in an 18-year relationship with his fiancée and had previously gotten into hot water after chickening out of their first engagement three years prior to this go-around (talk about commitment issues!). This time, he hadn't shown up to the altar and was nowhere to be found. Three hours passed when finally the groom's sister received a call from her brother-in-law saying they found the groom at a bar, and he had been acting like a child. The groom's sister decided enough was enough and put him on speaker phone so his fiancée could hear everything he was saying. Let's just say the wedding never came to be.Keep scrolling below for the full story and let us know who you think was in the wrong here.

We gathered you all here today to try and answer this question - how would watching cats doing cat things change our day? Just watching cats sit, sleep, make biscuits, zoom around in zoomies mode, meow profusely for their feline food, play with a random piece of string, get scared of the wall, become fascinated with the water in the tap, ekekek at birds… you know, cat things.Let us all start our experiment here, with this cat meme list of cats doing their cat thing - which is every cat thing ever. As cat lovers, we're sure you'll appreciate looking at more and more cats, especially in meme form.",

But somehow, people still believe it. So, we are here, once again, to attempt to show these people reason. It can't be that cats \"don't care\" if they do things like this - if they are so quick to take care of others as if they are their own kin. And this is not the first time that we have seen this happen. We have seen cats adopt kittens from other litters and treat them as if they are their own. We have seen cats adopt lynxes and raise them alongside their own babies. Even with humans, this is not the first time that we have seen a cat go out of its way to help them. Everyone knows, or should know, the story of Masha, the cat who saved a freezing human baby by wrapping around it in the snow all night, and in the morning, getting help and saving it. Cats care.

    "description": "Sometimes, there's code so bad you simply know it's unused and never called. Bernard sends us one such method, in Java: /** * Finds a GroupEntity by group number. * * @param group the group number. * @return the GroupEntity object. */ public static GroupEntity find(String group) { return GroupEntity.find(group); } This is a static method on the GroupEntity class called find, which calls a static method on the GroupEntity class called find, which calls a static method on the GroupEntity class called find and it goes on and on my friend. Clearly, this is a mistake. Bernard didn't supply much more context, so perhaps the String was supposed to be turned into some other type, and there's an overload which would break the recursion. Regardless, there was an antediluvian ticket on the backlog requesting that the feature to allow finding groups via a search input that no one had yet worked on. I'm sure they'll get around to it, once the first call finishes. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.

    "description": "Simon recently found himself working alongside a \"very senior\" developer- who had a whopping 5 years of experience. This developer was also aggrieved that in recent years, Object Oriented programming had developed a bad reputation. \"Functional this, functional that, people really just don't understand how clean and clear objects make your code.\" For example, here are a few Java objects which they wrote to power a web scraping tool: class UrlHolder { private String url; public UrlHolder(String url) { this.url = url; } } class UrlDownloader { private UrlHolder url; public String downloadPage; public UrlDownLoader(String url) { this.url = new UrlHolder(Url); } } class UrlLinkExtractor { private UrlDownloader url; public UrlLinkExtractor(UrlDownloader url) { this.url = url; } public String[] extract() { String page = Url.downloadPage; ... } } UrlHolder is just a wrapper around string, but also makes that string private and provides no accessors. Anything shoved into an instance of that may as well be thrown into oblivion. UrlDownloader wraps a UrlHolder, again, as a private member with no accessors. It also has a random public string called downloadPage. UrlLinkExtractor wraps a UrlDownloader, and at least UrlLinkExtractor has a function- which presumably downloads the page. It uses UrlDownloader#downloadPage- the public string property. It doesn't use the UrlHolder, because of course it couldn't. The entire goal of this code is to pass a string to the extract function. I guess I don't understand object oriented programming. I thought I did, but after reading this code, I don't.
