    "description": "Training your replacement can be a stressful process. If you're leaving the company on poor terms, the last thing you want to do is give your soon-to-be former boss more of your time and hard work. However, if you're leaving on good terms, you likely will go through with the training anyway so as not to burn any bridges. It's the so-called \"professional\" thing to do after all. But what happens when the person you're training turns out to be woefully incompetent? Do you tell your ex-boss that they are making a huge mistake in hiring this person, or do you keep your mouth shut, do your best to explain what you can, and let the new hire fail as they inevitably will?This was the conundrum that the author of this tale of workplace drama found himself in. Two months after he left his previous company, he was still answering calls and texts from his replacement with incessant questions, many of which he had explained before and some of which he thought was general knowledge (such as attaching documents to emails in Outlook). Clearly, this guy's ex-boss did not do his due diligence when he hired this lady. Now, there was nothing the author could do to salvage the situation!",

    "description": "Before Siri sweet-talked us through every turn, before Google Maps rerouted us around traffic like a literal fairy godmother, we had… MapQuest. Good ol' MapQuest, where you'd print out 12 pages of driving directions and cling to them the entirety of your trip. Good luck missing one turn. You'd be pulling over, flipping through those sheets like you were decoding a tedious math problem from high school algebra class. And if you were really old school, you used an actual map, like one of those giant, accordion-folded monsters that unfolded to the size of your windshield and nearly guaranteed you'd clip a mailbox.If you traveled for work back then, your best strategy was to commit every highway exit and side street to memory, just to avoid the full-body stress of navigating unfamiliar roads with nothing but a printed map and a prayer.",

    "description": "Before we started writing for I Can Has Cheezburger, one of our biggest fears was our cats getting out and never coming back. However, one thing we've learned from all of these reunion stories is that you should never give up hope. Your lost cat may be closer than you think, and no matter how long you've been separated, they will still remember you. Whether it's four months, or they've been missing for over six years, there is always the pawssibility that your pet will find their way back to you.In the story below, the nanny accidentally let the cat out while retrieving a package. The pawrent searched frantically for four months. They tore apart their house to search every nook and cranny, they posted flyers, cried into the arms of strangers, and almost let their hope go. But then, they heard a meow in the middle of the night. They ran out, screaming his name, and there he was! There's a lot more to this beautiful reunion, so read the full story below!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

But… maybe we could have it twice a week, that wouldn't be so bad, right? That's why we've devised the purrfect plan to extend Caturday by another day, with the help of some hilarious cat snaps! They bring all the silly vibes of Caturday to Sunday because if memes don't rest, then neither do we.Sure, you could be boring and nap all day, but we've still got a little bit of catnip left, so let's keep this pawty going! With all the giggle-worthy cat memes we have on the site fluffy feline tweets we rounded up this week, you've got plenty of meowterial here to keep the pawsitive vibes going all the way until Meownday. In fact, let's not even think about Meownday yet. Not while this pawty is pumping!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

Without debating the merits of loads of getters and setters versus bare properties, ideally, getters and setters are the easiest code to write. Many IDEs will just generate them for you! How can you screw up getters and setters? Well, Dave found someone who could. private ReportDatesDao reportDatesDao; @Resource(name = CensusDao.BEAN_NAME) public void setAuditDao(CensusDao censusDao) { this.reportDatesDao = reportDatesDao; } The function is called setAuditDao, takes a CensusDao input, but manipulates reportDatesDao, because clearly someone copy/pasted and didn't think about what they were doing. The result, however, is that this just sets this.reportDatesDao equal to itself. I'm always impressed by code which given the chance to make multiple decisions makes every wrong choice, even if it is just lazy copy/paste.
