Even though customer service's single job is to provide service to the customer, countless problems always prevent them from doing that job. We're not necessarily pointing fingers at those who work there, but, c'mon, someone must take the blame.If you ask us, the worst kind of customer service, is when something breaks in our apartment, and we need someone to come and fix it. It starts with spending hours on the phone trying to reach the company in charge of the repair. Then you must schedule a time for someone to come and fix it, which is never a comfortable time for you, but you make it work anyway. Except, when the day finally comes, and you cleared up your entire schedule for this one thing, they are either extremely late, or never even show up in the first place. And then the cycle begins again…However, for the customer in the story below, things went a little differently…",

    "description": "No matter how great the workplace environment is, a single irritating employee can ruin it for everyone. Just think about it. Have you ever come into the office and plopped down in your desk, only to be followed by a colleague who has a question for you first thing in the morning. They're wondering why they can't get into their email. Well. Okay. Instead of doing your actual job, you now have to help this guy figure out his email situation. So you start looking at his laptop and see that he's logged out of his email for some bizarre reason. You ask him his password, and he pulls out one of those little notebooks where you write in your passwords by hand. Then he flips through it for ages while you stand there, bored out of your mind. These people also have coworkers who are just so inept, so technologically illiterate, or so frightfully dim that everyone around them is pulling out their hair. If there's someone in your office who prints out their emails, they belong on this list. One person mentioned that they know someone who only writes in Excel, instead of Word, because that's the program they're most familiar with. Whatever works, I suppose, but in the end, they're just wasting company time and burning through the patience of everyone around them. Next, read about this woman who threw a party with one rule: no children allowed, please. Guess which friend showed up with a 3-year-old in tow anyway and \"used her child to get her way?\"",

    "description": "The beautiful thing about the CDS (also know as the iconic and impeccable Cat Distribution System) is that it can hit you at any time. You never see it coming. A cat can adopt you when you go on a walk, just walking up to you, choosing you and making you theirs. A cat might jump into your car and leave you with absolutely no choice but to take them with you, no matter where it is that you are going. A momma cat might show up at your door with kittens, and then, you will simply have to adopt them all. That's how it works. Even on a simple, short, pizza run, you are not safe from the CDS. Not that you would want to be safe from it. Getting chosen by the CDS is an honor, and having an adorable stray cat jump into your loving arms and agree to go with your wherever you are going while you are on a pizza run is just about the best thing that could happen to anyone.",

However, there is the occasional mix-up. We're not mad about it, in fact, the mix-up usually ends up being better than what we ordered in the first place. It's the darndest thing, really. We open our package, turn around for one second, and poof! All of a sudden, a cat is in our package instead of what we ordered!We're not sure what kind of sorcery this is, but it's purrfectly silly and we love it. These packages may not have what we ordered, but they do contain four cat paws and a whole lot of love, so that's better than anything we could have ordered in the first place. Whatever you're doing Amazon, keep doing it. It's pawsitively meowgical. Scroll down to see all of these boxes below that meowgically made some kitties appear. It's almost too silly to believe!",

    "description": "Kirill writes: I've worked in this small company for a year, and on a daily basis I've come across things that make my eyes sink back into their sockets in fear, but mostly I've been too busy fixing them to post anything. It being my last day however, here's a classic We'll take this one in parts. First, every element of the UI the user can navigate to is marked with an enum, defined thus: enum UiItem { SectionA, SectionB, SectionC,...SectionG } These names are not anonymized, so already I hate it. But it's the next enum that starts my skin crawling: enum SecurityUiItem { SectionA = UiItem.SectionA, SectionB = UiItem.SectionB, ... SectionG = UiItem.SectionG } A SecurityUiItem is a different type, but the values are identical to UiItem. These enums are used when trying to evaluate role-based permissions for access, and that code looks like this: if ((currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionA) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionA] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionA; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionB) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionB] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionB; else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionC) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionC] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionC; ..... else if (!currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) || (currentAccess.ContainsKey(SecurityUiItem.SectionG) \u0026\u0026 currentAccess[SecurityUiItem.SectionG] != AccessLevel.NoAccess)) return UiItem.SectionG; else return UiItem.Unknown; Honestly, I don't hate the idea of having one data type representing the actual UI objects and a separate data type which represents permissions, and having a function which can map between these two things. But this is a perfect example of a good idea executed poorly. I also have to wonder about the fall-through pattern. If I have access to SectionA, I only seem to get SectionA out of this function. Are these permissions hierarchical? I have no idea, but I suspect there's a WTF underpinning this whole thing. Congratulations on Kirill's last day. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "The CEO of Delia's company retired. They were an old hand in the industry, the kind of person who worked their way up and had an engineering background, and while the staff loved them, the shareholders were less than pleased, because the company was profitable, but not obscenely so. So the next CEO was a McKinsey-approved MBA who had one mission: cut costs. Out went the senior devs, and much of the managers. Anyone who was product or customer focused followed quickly behind. What remained were a few managers handpicked by the new CEO and a slew of junior engineers- and Pierre. Pierre was a contractor who followed the new CEO around from company to company. Pierre was there to ensure that nobody wasted any time on engineering that didn't directly impact features. Tests? Wastes of time. Module boundaries? Just slow you down. Move fast and break things, and don't worry about fixing anything because that's your successors' problem. So let's take a look at how Pierre wrote code. This block of PHP code was simply copy/pasted everywhere it needed to be used, across multiple applications. foreach($alphaCheck as $checkField) { if($paramsArray[$checkField['field']]) { if($paramsArray[$checkField['field']]) { $invalidChars = false; $checkValue = trim(strtoupper($paramsArray[$checkField['field']])); $allowedChars = explode('|',\"A|B|C|D|E|F|G|H|I|J|K|L|M|N|O|P|Q|R|S|T|U|V|W|X|Y|Z|-| |.|'\"); for($i=0; $i\u003cstrlen($checkValue); $i++) { if(!in_array($checkValue[$i],$allowedChars)) { $invalidChars = true; } } if($invalidChars) { $errorMsgs[] = $checkField['name'] . ' contains invalid characters'; } } } } This isn't the worst approach to this problem I've seen in PHP, but the fact that this is just a copy/pasted blob, and worse- the $allowedChars may vary a bit in each place it's copy/pasted is what makes it terrible. Don't worry. The new CEO only stayed for 18 months, got a huge bonus thanks to all the cost-cutting, and then left, taking Pierre along to the next company.
