    "description": "There will be times in life where everyone in the room seemingly agrees that you're in the wrong, while this might often mean that you are actually in the wrong and should apologize, that's not always actually the case. There can be any number of factors at play, including groupthink, favoritism, and social manipulation. All perpetrated by enablers and sycophants. This often happens with \"rainbow\" babies and other family favorites and golden children who can do no wrong and inexplicably get away with almost anything that none of their peers can. Unfortunately, it doesn't end with childhood and will continue throughout your life in your work and friend groups. Just because \"groupthink\" comes into play and a group agrees on something, doesn't mean it's the reality. The reality is, though, that if you're in a room with a bunch of people who are gaslighting you into thinking you're wrong when you have a moral and ethical reason behind your actions, you probably don't want to be in that room any longer.Families are strange, especially so when they're not your own, and when this boyfriend attended his girlfriend's mom's birthday party, he was shocked by the behavior he witnessed from his girlfriend's nephew that no one was doing anything about. He gently intervened but earned the ire of the family in the process. While you can't blame someone for their family, if they don't see the problem, perhaps it's time to reconsider the relationship.",

    "description": "Managers notice things. While we imagine they're ignoring the workplace's cries for help when it comes to their overwhelming workload, managers aren't blind to the dismay of their employees, they're simply biding their time. When you can wring a person out for all their worth, then replace them with an intern who's only asking for 70% of their replacement's salary, you've got a good capitalistic business model, right? But not a very humane one. Sometimes, all it takes to land that promotion you've been searching for is not working harder, staying late in the office, and running yourself into the ground. When all else fails, just know that your manager is watching, wondering when you'll reach your limit, so when you've decided to completely give up, they know it's a sign of potentially cutting loose from the company entirely. And when you're completely indispensable, that gives you some promotional leverage—maybe even a 15% raise-worth of leverage.",

We studied hard to get into a good college, were the captain of our sports team, and pawticipated in many extra-curricular activities. But none of that, and we really mean none, could compare to what Robin Lee Graham did when he was a teenager. At the young age of 16 years old, he decided to set sail across the world, traveling over 33,000 nautical miles with no help except for the companionship of his cute sailor cats he brought with him.He faced many hardships along the way, including losing his mast shortly after departing, and even having to change boats midway due to extensive damage to his ship. He said, however, that the cats helped him deal with loneliness and feel comforted. So this proves it once and for all that cats are the best companions to have, right?

To begin with they have no boundaries or social awareness, making them poor team players and even worse when they receive negative feedback. Then you have the whole lack of impulse control, which as any factory worker will tell you is a one way ticket to living a short life. And then you add on top of all of this their terribly lacking persistence with regard to their jobs, and you get probably the worst workers on the planet.Especially when you consider that they can be petulantly persistent when it comes to food. So it should come as little surprise that working in a Pâwtisserie would be a poor hiring decision on the part of the owner.",

    "description": "Early in my career, I had the misfortune of doing a lot of Crystal Reports work. Crystal Reports is another one of those tools that lets non-developer, non-database savvy folks craft reports. Which, like so often happens, means that the users dig themselves incredible holes and need professional help to get back out, because at the end of the day, when the root problem is actually complicated, all the helpful GUI tools in the world can't solve it for you. Michael was in a similar position as I was, but for Michael, there was a five alarm fire. It was the end of the month, and a bunch of monthly sales reports needed to be calculated. One of the big things management expected to see was a year-over-year delta on sales, and they got real cranky if the line didn't go up. If they couldn't even see the line, they went into a full on panic and assumed the sales team was floundering and the company was on the verge of collapse. Unfortunately, the report was spitting out an error: \"A day number must be between 1 and the number of days in the month.\" Michael dug in, and found this \"delight\" inside of a function called one_year_ago: Local StringVar yearStr := Left({?ReportToDate}, 4); Local StringVar monthStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 5, 2); Local StringVar dayStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 7, 2); Local StringVar hourStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 9, 2); Local StringVar minStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 11, 2); Local StringVar secStr := Mid({?ReportToDate}, 13, 2); Local NumberVar LastYear; LastYear := ToNumber(YearStr) - 1; YearStr := Replace (toText(LastYear),'.00' , '' ); YearStr := Replace (YearStr,',' , '' ); //DateTime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec); //Year + Month + Day + Hour + min + sec; // string value DateTime(ToNumber(YearStr), ToNumber(MonthStr), ToNumber(dayStr), ToNumber(HourStr), ToNumber(MinStr),ToNumber(SecStr) ); We've all seen string munging in date handling before. That's not surprising. But what's notable about this one is the day on which it started failing. As stated, it was at the end of the month. But which month? February. Specifically, February 2024, a leap year. Since they do nothing to adjust the dayStr when constructing the date, they were attempting to construct a date for 29-FEB-2023, which is not a valid date. Michael writes: Yes, it's Crystal Reports, but surprisingly not having date manipulation functions isn't amongst it's many, many flaws. It's something I did in a past life isn't it?? The fix was easy enough- rewrite the function to actually use date handling. This made a simpler, basically one-line function, using Crystal's built in functions. That fixed this particular date handling bug, but there were plenty more places where this kind of hand-grown string munging happened, and plenty more opportunities for the report to fail.
