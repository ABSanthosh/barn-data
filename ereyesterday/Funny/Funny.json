    "description": "There's always one person in our lives who we can never trust with money and always seems to need it. You go out to dinner with them and cover the bill because they insist on paying you back, but you know that money will never get back to you. Even when they ask to borrow money, promising it's just a loan, you fork over the cash, knowing you'll never see it again. The invention of money-sharing apps has made it a little bit easier to hold these people accountable, but they can still swindle their way out of paying and back into our hearts. Eventually, you just have to accept that this person is never going to change and make you that whenever you go out together, it's for a cheap meal.If your life's leech person gets ahold of someone with a big heart and a leaky wallet, that's when you enter the danger zone. One woman faces this issue when she learns that her husband has been sending hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars to his sister every month or so. In this case, does family come before everything? Or is there a time and place to cut someone off?",

    "description": "Parenthood is not easy. That's just a fact. It's a lot of pressure—you don't want to raise a kid to be an entitled adult. So how do you do that? Well, there are many different ways. You can find countless articles, books, and videos about it, even courses! But one thing that is constantly repeated is making sure your child knows there are consequences to their actions. Now, the techniques in showing your child that fact is highly debated, but it's a fact that if you don't teach them this, they will think everything they do, whether it's right or wrong, is fine. That's means they can grow up, borrow a friends car, then completely wreck it and think they don't owe the owner anything. You know what happens then? Straight to court. You're not a kid anymore, you will face consequences no matter how hard your family tries to shield you from them.  In this case, it includes two teenagers. One is 13 and the other 16. The 16-year-old is a bookworm and uses her allowance to buy limited editions and first copies to the books she likes to read. She lent some books out to her 13-year-old cousin once, and got them returned destroyed.",

Kittens have to learn how to communicate effectively, so that they will know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their humans. Kittens need to learn the basics from their parents, so it's no surprise that cat parenthood can be overwhelming to some. And let's not forget just how hyperactive and wiggly and squeaky kittens are in the beginning. You pick them up and they wiggle-jiggle right out of your hand. The chaos starts young with these guys. We know it, but this Maine Coon cat dad… seems to not have gotten the warning. Yeah, you would think that the first meeting between a cat dad and his babies would be wholesome… and it is. It's just hilarious at the same time.",

But since this is not the case, with every cat - all cat pawrents turn to share their cats' shenanigans online. We gathered some hilariously accurate cat tweets made by cat pawrents, who we're sure would like to have a real word with their cats as we do, but can't. As we can't.

    "description": "Sammy's company \"jumped on the Ruby on Rails bandwagon since there was one on which to jump\", and are still very much a Rails shop. The company has been around for thirty years, and in that time has seen plenty of ups and downs. During one of those \"ups\", management decided they needed to scale up, both in terms of staffing and in terms of client base- so they hired an offshore team to promote international business and add to their staffing. A \"down\" followed not long after, and the offshore team was disbanded. So Sammy inherited the code. I know I'm generally negative on ORM systems, and that includes Rails, but I want to stress: they're fine if you stay on the happy path. If your data access patterns are simple (which most applications are just basic CRUD!) there's nothing wrong with using an ORM. But if you're doing that, you need to use the ORM. Which is not what the offshore team did. For example: class Request \u003c ActiveRecord::Base def self.get_this_years_request_ids(facility_id) # There are several other methods that are *exactly* the same, except for the year requests = Request.where(\"requests.id in (select t.id from requests as t # what is the purpose of this subquery? where t.unit_id=token_requests.unit_id and t.facility_id=token_requests.facility_id and t.survey_type = '#{TokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE}' # why is SURVEY_TYPE a constant? and EXTRACT( YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM current_timestamp) order by t.id desc) and token_requests.facility_id = #{facility_id.to_i} # so we get all the requests by year, then by by ??? and token_requests.survey_type = '#{Request::SURVEY_TYPE}'\") Comments from Sammy. Now, if we just look at the signature of the method, it seems like this should be a pretty straightforward query: get all of the request IDs for a given facility ID, within a certain time range. And Sammy has helpfully provided a version of this code which does the same thing, but in a more \"using the tools correctly\" way: def self.request_ids_for_year(facility_id,year = Time.now.year) token_requests = TokenRequest.where( :facility_id=\u003efacility_id, :survey_type=\u003eTokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE, :created_at=\u003e(DateTime.new(year.to_i).beginning_of_year .. DateTime.new(year.to_i).end_of_year)) Now, I don't know Ruby well enough to be sure, but the DateTime.new(year.to_i) whiffs a bit of some clumsy date handling, but that may be a perfectly cromulent idiom in Ruby. But this code is pretty clear about what it's doing: finding request objects for a given facility within a given year. Why one uses Request and the other uses TokenRequest is a mystery to me- I' m going to suspect some bad normalization in the database or errors in how Sammy anonymized the code. That's neither here nor there. Once we've gotten our list of requests, we need to process them to output them. Here's how the offshore code converted the list into a comma delimited string, wrapped in parentheses. string_token_request_ids = \"(-1)\" if token_requests \u0026\u0026 token_requests.length \u003e 0 for token_request in token_requests if string_token_request_ids != \"\" string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + \",\" end string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + token_request.id.to_s end string_token_request_ids = \"(\" + string_token_request_ids + \")\" end end end Look, if the problem is to \"join a string with delimiters\" and you write code that looks like this, just delete your hard drive and start over. You need extra help. We start by defaulting to (-1) which is presumably a \"no results\" indicator. But if we have results, we'll iterate across those results. If our result string is non-empty (which it definitely is non-empty), we append a comma (giving us (-1),). Then we append the current token ID, giving us (-1),5, for example. Once we've exhausted all the returned IDs, we wrap the whole thing in parentheses. So, this code is wrong- it's only supposed to return (-1) when there are no results, but as written, it embeds that in the results. Presumably the consuming code is able to handle that error gracefully, since the entire project works. Sammy provides us a more idiomatic (and readable) version of the code which also works correctly: return \"(#{token_requests.count \u003e 0 ? token_requests.map(\u0026:id).join(',') : '(-1)'})\" I'll be honest, I hate the fact that this is returning a stringly-typed list of integers, but since I don't know the context, I'll let that slide. At the very least, this is a better example of what joining a list of values into a string should look like. Sammy writes: It seems these devs never took the time to learn the language. After asking around a bit, I found out they all came from a Java background. Most of this code seems to be from a VB playbook, though. That's a huge and undeserved insult to Visual Basic programmers, Sammy. Even they're not that bad. .comment{border:none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",
