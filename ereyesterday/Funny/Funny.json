    "description": "Even though people always say you shouldn't burn any bridges when leaving a job, it's difficult not to feel resentment towards your boss if they decide to let you go. After all, they are the ones who decided you are not doing a good enough job to keep you there, and they are perfectly fine with leaving you jobless and probably replacing you with someone else. How can you not resent that?Yet there is still a pretty big gap between resenting your former boss and actively burning bridges when you leave. It doesn't have to be this big rebellious act, but you can still find ways to 'get back' at your employer for their decision. Ways that would ensure they would never hire you again, whether you like it or not.If you know for a fact you will never return to that workplace, and have no desire to ever talk to the people there again, we are not against a little petty act of rebellion as a last hurrah, just like the employee in the story below did.",

    "description": "Imagine being such a fiscal visionary that you'd rather torch 30% of your profits than let an employee miss one day of work. The logic is airtight: \"If we can't squeeze labor out of you today, we'll just set fire to all future labor forever!\" Why fix a flat tire when you can total the car and blame the road?We've all met bosses who think paid time off is code for personal betrayal, but fusing vacation and sick days? That's just genius! Because what's even the difference between those? You're not at the office, you're not working, and the boss doesn't make any profit off of you, absolutely identical if you ask me.  The common thread? You're a leech on their spreadsheet, regardless of context.To these managerial masterminds, time spent not working is a moral failing—whether you're sipping margaritas or projectile vomiting into a trash can.Firing an employee for catching a virus a coworker gifted the office. probably because of your amazing policies.",

We're not quite there yet, but thanks to people like the one in this post, we're getting closer and closer every day. If you're looking for a new cat, please consider going to a shelter and adopting one. Get a kitten, get an adult, or even better yet, get a sweet senior cat that just wants to love you. While you're at it, take a chance and adopt one with special needs. It will be more work on your end, but the rewards you get are 100% worth it. That animal will be more grateful to you than you can ever imagine.That's exactly what happened to the caring hooman below - they adopted a two-year-old cat with health issues that no one wanted, and now they cuddle 24/7.

Cats are usually option number 2, and that's just constantly funny to us, humble hoomans.Since we want to try and spread this silliness and these funny meowments everywhere, we gathered these funny cat memes.

    "description": "Today we have a whole batch of category errors, picked out from the rash of submissions and a few that have been festering on the shelf. Just for fun, I threw in an ironic off-by-some meta-error. See if you can spot it. Adam R. \"I'm looking for hotel rooms for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. Most hotels haven't opened up reservations yet, except for ridiculously overprice hospitality packages. This search query found NaN facilities available, which equates to one very expensive apartment. I guess one is not a number now?\"   Intrepid traveler BJH had a tough time at the Intercontinental. I almost feel sympathy. Almost. \"I stare at nulls at home all the time so it made me feel comfortable to see them at the hotel when traveling. And what is that 'INTERCONTINENTAL W...' at the top? I may never know!\"   Hoping to find out, BJ clicked through the mystery menu and discovered... this. But even worse, \"There was no exit: Clicking Exit did nothing and neither did any of the buttons on the remote. Since I'd received more entertainment than usual from a hotel screen I just turned everything off.\"   Striking out for some streaming entertainment Dmitry NoLastName was silently stymied by this double-decker from Frontier.com.   No streaming needed for Barry M. who can get a full dose of fun from those legacy broadcast channels! Whatever did they do before null null undefined null? \"Hey, want to watch TV tonight? NaN.\"   Hah! \"That's MISTER Null, to you,\" declared an anonymous contributor.   And finally, another entirely different anonymous contributor clarified that there are apparently NaN cellphone towers in Switzerland. Personally, I'm intrigued by the existence of that one little crumb of English on an otherwise entirely German page.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.

    "description": "Jenny had been perfectly happy working on a series of projects for her company, before someone said, \"Hey, we need you to build a desktop GUI for an existing API.\" The request wasn't the problem, per se. The API, on the other hand, absolutely was. The application Jenny was working on represented a billing contract for materials consumed at a factory. Essentially, the factory built a bunch of individual parts, and then assembled them into a finished product. They only counted the finished product, but needed to itemize the billing down to not only the raw materials that went into the finished product, the intermediate parts, but also the toilet paper put in the bathrooms. All the costs of operating the factory were derived from the units shipped out. This meant that the contract itself was a fairly complicated tree structure. Jenny's application was meant to both visualize and allow users to edit that tree structure to update the billing contract in sane, and predictable ways, so that it could be reviewed and approved and when the costs of toilet paper went up, those costs could be accurately passed on to the customer. Now, all the contract management was already implemented and lived library that itself called back into a database. Jenny just needed to wire it up to a desktop UI. Part of the requirements were that line items in the tree needed to have a special icon displayed next to them under two conditions: if one of their ancestors in the tree had been changed since the last released contract, or if they child was marked as \"inherit from parent\". The wrapper library wasn't documented, so Jenny asked the obvious question: \"What's the interface for this?\" The library team replied with this: IModelInheritFromParent : INotifyPropertyChanged { bool InheritFromParent {get; set;} } \"That covers the inheritance field,\" Jenny said, \"but that doesn't tell me if the ancestor has been modified.\" \"Oh, don't worry,\" the devs replied, \"there's an extension method for that.\" public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeA); Extension methods in C# are just a way to use syntactic sugar to \"add\" methods to a class: IModelTypeA does not have a GetChangedIndicator method, but because of the this keyword, it's an extension method and we can now invoke aInstance.GetChangedIndicator(). It's how many built-in .Net APIs work, but like most forms of syntactic sugar, while it can be good, it usually makes code harder to understand, harder to test, and harder to debug. But Jenny's main complaint was this: \"You can't raise an event or something? I'm going to need to poll?\" \"Yes, you're going to need to poll.\" Jenny didn't like the idea of polling the (slow) database, so at first, she tried to run the polling in a background thread so it wouldn't block the UI. Unfortunately for her, the library was very much not threadsafe, so that blew up. She ended up needing to poll on the main UI thread, which meant the application would frequently stall while users were working. She did her best to minimize it, but it was impossible to eliminate. But worse than that, each contract item may implement one of four interfaces, which meant there were four versions of the extension method: public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeA); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeB); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeC); public bool GetChangedIndicator(this IModelTypeD); To \"properly\" perform the check, Jenny would have to check which casts were valid for a given item, cast it, and then invoke GetChangedIndicator. It's worth noting that had they just used regular inheritance instead of extension methods, this wouldn't have been necessary at all. Using the \"fun\" syntactic sugar made the code more complicated for no benefit. This left Jenny with another question: \"What if an item implements more than one of these interfaces? What if the extension methods disagree on if the item is changed?\" \"Good question,\" the team responsible for the library replied. \"That should almost never happen.\" Jenny quit not long after this.
