    "description": "No one is going to agree on everything, and when it comes to a game where almost everything is in part determined by imagination, what you imagine might not be in line with everyone else at the table. As with anything in life, inevitably, personalities, ideas, and preferences will clash, and it's all down to tolerance and an ability and willingness to go with the flow. Not being set in your own ways and ideas just makes everything easier, even if everything isn't exactly the way you want it. That, after all, is what collaboration is all about.Of course, that's all good and well to say until the annoying rogue in your party insists on murder-hoboing every NPC before the story can properly unfold while ticking every box of edge lord cliches possible. At that point, you're probably going to have a court of group opinion put an end to their ideas. The same can be said for any player who takes an overly simplistic and predictable approach to interactions in the game. At a certain point, they're just taking over and steering the course of the campaign in a predictable manner, which can become grating to the other people at the table. These players disagreed over the \"flirtatious\" nature of the 19-year-old player's character. One player took issue with her character's flirtatious approach to every interaction and demanded that she stop. The player then took to this online community to see whether she was in the wrong for refusing to do so.",

    "description": "It's your special day, and you're hoping that everything will go as smoothly as possible. You and your soon-to-be spouse are thrilled as your guests enter the venue and watch you take your marital vows to each other. Then it's time for dinner and dancing late into the night as you celebrate your lifetime of marriage. Well, that's how every couple hopes their wedding day will go, but of course, there are bound to be a few mishaps here and there. Some people hire photographers who don't really know what they're doing, and end up with some botched photos. Others had some bad cake experiences: one person below had a gorgeous white and purple cake covered in flowers. Too bad the icing was too heavy for the cake, and fell right off the cake in a big lump! Then there are sometimes issues with guests. Some of the people you invite to your wedding won't understand or respect the dress code. There's often a teenage boy who insists on wearing basketball shorts instead of a suit, or a woman who needs to be the center of attention, and wears a white gown to the event! There's a lot that can go wrong at a wedding, and you can check out a bunch of examples below. Next, read about these people who are certainly having a worse day than you, like one person who sadly wrote, \"Guess who poured coffee into their cup noodles?\"",

    "description": "Hello cat-loving humans. Those of us who have cats at home know that there is never a dull moment with your faithful feline companions. One moment you could gaze at them sleeping on the dog's bed, snoring softly but adorably, the next moment they're knocking over all of your good china. Oh yeah, things get real interesting real fast. One thing however remains consistent, and that is the way that our cats simultaneously bring both joy and chaos to our every day human lives. Cats make life so much more interesting. On that note, I'm thinking back to a time when I flew across the country with my cat to visit family, and he was being such a good boy just sleeping in his carrier throughout the flight. I had managed to doze off on this flight, which was about 6 hours of flight time total, only to feel a tap at my shoulder a few moments later. The person next to me alerted me that my cat had escaped from his carrier and was making his rounds around the plane. And that just about sums up the joy and chaos of being a cat parent. Enjoy all the silliness!",

We wouldn't know, we're definitely not a cat typing this listicle right now, we're 100% hooman. We pay taxes, go to work, and only eat tuna once per day. Anyway, as we were saying, life can be a real hairball sometimes. If we need something to help us get through a purrticularly pawful day, we turn to wholesome funny feline memes. They're like our medicine, but this medicine is a catnip-coated spoonful of sugar. Us hoomans love catnip too, right? Can't get enough of it!Erm, we mean, we like catnip just as much as the next hooman. But back to these silly cats that make our days better, they're just the cat's meow. And we're not saying that because we're a cat, remember, it's just a normal hooman expression. We feel like we're not really getting our paw across here. Point! We meant to say point. Just scroll down already and enjoy this listicle, catnip or not (but it's better with catnip…right?).",

Even the core parts of the platform are a nightmare We're going to take this one in chunks, because it's big and ugly. try { if (isset($_POST)) { $name = $_POST['objName']; $lst_name = $_POST['objLstName']; $email = $_POST['objEmail']; $phone = $_POST['objGsm']; $message = $_POST['objMsg']; $verifycode = $_POST['objVerifyCode']; /******************************************************/ $objCmpT = $_POST['objCmpT']; $objCmpS = $_POST['objCmpS']; $objCountry = $_POST['objCountry']; $objCity = $_POST['objCity']; $objName2 = $_POST['objName2']; $objLstName2 = $_POST['objLstName2']; $objQuality = $_POST['objQuality']; $objEmail = $_POST['objEmail']; $objMsg2 = $_POST['objMsg2']; $objVerifyCode2 = $_POST['objVerifyCode2']; I don't love that there's no structure or class here, to organize these fields, but this isn't bad, per se. We have a bunch of form fields, and we jam them into a bunch of variables. I am going to, with no small degree of willpower, not comment on the hungarian notation present in the field names. Look at me not commenting on it. I'm definitely not commenting on it. Look at me not commenting that some, but not all, of the variables also get the same hungarian prefix. What's the point of hungarian notation when everything just gets the same thing anyway; like hungarian is always bad, but this is just USELESS Ahem. Let's continue with the code. $ok = 0; $ok2 = 0; $sendTo = \"example@example.com\"; $golableMSG = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $name . ' ' . $lst_name . ' -email :' . $email . ' -Phone Number : 0' . $phone . ' -Message : ' . $message; $globaleMSG2 = ' -First Name \u0026 Last Name :' . $objName2 . ' ' . $objLstName2 . ' -Email :' . $objEmail . ' -Type of company : ' . $objCmpT . ' -Sector of activity : ' . $objCmpS . ' -Country : ' . $objCountry . ' -City : ' . $objCity . ' -Your position within the company : ' . $objQuality . ' -Message : ' . $objMsg2; We munge all those form fields into strings. These are clearly going to be the bodies of our messages. Only now I'm noticing that the user had to supply two different names- $name and $objName2. Extra points here, as I believe they meant to name both of these message variables globaleMSG but misspelled the first one, golableMSG. Well, let's continue. if (!$name) { $data['msg1'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg1'] = ''; } if (!$lst_name) { $data['msg2'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg2'] = ''; } if (!$email) { $data['msg3'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg3'] = ''; } if ($phone \u003c= 0) { $data['msg4'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg4'] = ''; } if (!$message) { $data['msg5'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg5'] = ''; } if (!$verifycode) { $data['msg6'] = '*'; } else { $ok++; $data['msg6'] = ''; } /*********************************************************************************/ if (!$objCmpS) { $data['msg7'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg7'] = ''; } if (!$objCountry) { $data['msg8'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg8'] = ''; } if (!$objCity) { $data['msg9'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg9'] = ''; } if (!$objName2) { $data['msg10'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg10'] = ''; } if (!$objLstName2) { $data['msg11'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg11'] = ''; } if (!$objQuality) { $data['msg12'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg12'] = ''; } if (!$objMsg2) { $data['msg13'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg13'] = ''; } if (!$objVerifyCode2) { $data['msg14'] = '*'; } else { $ok2++; $data['msg14'] = ''; } What… what are we doing here? I worry that what I'm looking at here is some sort of preamble to verification code. But why is it like this? Why? /********************************************************************************/ if ($ok == 6) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $name)) { $data['msg1_1'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $lst_name)) { $data['msg2_2'] = ''; $subject = $name . \" \" . $lst_name; if (filter_var($email, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) { $data['msg3_3'] = ''; $from = $email; if (preg_match(\"/^[6-9][0-9]{8}$/\", $phone)) { $data['msg4_4'] = ''; if (intval($verifycode) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr1']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr2'])) { $data['msg6_6'] = ''; $headers = 'From: ' . $from . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject, $golableMSG, $headers); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; /*$data = array('success' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } else { $data['msg6_6'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg4_4'] = 'Votre Numéro est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg3_3'] = 'Votre Email est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg2_2'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg1_1'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Oh look, it is validation code. Their verification code system, presumably to prevent spamming messages, is not particularly secure or useful. The real thing I see here, though, is the namespaced keys. Earlier, we set $data['msg1'], and now we're setting $data['msg1_1'] which is a code stench that could kill from a hundred yards. And don't worry, we do the same thing for the other message we send: /**************************************************************/ if ($ok2 == 8) { if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objName2)) { $data['msg10_10'] = ''; if (preg_match(\"/^[ a-z,.+!:;()-]+$/\", $objLstName2)) { $data['msg11_11'] = ''; $subject2 = $objName2 . \" \" . $objLstName2; if (intval($objVerifyCode2) == intval($_COOKIE['nmbr3']) + intval($_COOKIE['nmbr4'])) { $from2 = $objEmail; $data['msg14_14'] = ''; $headers2 = 'From: ' . $from2 . \"\\r\\n\" . 'Reply-To: ' . $sendTo . \"\\r\\n\" . 'X-Mailer: PHP/' . phpversion(); mail($sendTo, $subject2, $globaleMSG2, $headers2); $data['msgfinal'] = 'Votre Messsage est bien envoyer'; } else { $data['msg14_14'] = 'votre resultat est incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg11_11'] = 'Votre Prénom est Incorrect'; } } else { $data['msg10_10'] = 'Votre Nom est Incorrect'; } } Phew. Hey, remember way back at the top, when we checked to see if the $_POST variable were set? Well, we do have an else clause for that. } else { throw new \\Exception($mot[86]); } Who doesn't love throwing messages by hard-coded array indexes in your array of possible error messages? Couldn't be bothered with a constant, could we? Nope, message 86 it is. But don't worry about that exception going uncaught. Remember, this whole thing was inside of a try: } catch (\\Exception $e) { $data['msgfinal'] = \"Votre Messsage n'est pas bien envoyer\"; /*$data = array('danger' =\u003e 'Votre Messsage pas bien envoyer', 'postData' =\u003e $_POST);*/ } Yeah, it didn't matter what message we picked, because we just catch the exception and hard-code out an error message. Also, I don't speak French, but is \"message\" supposed to have an extra \"s\" in it? Charles writes: It’s crazy to see such sloppy work on a platform that seems okay at first glance. Honestly, this platform is the holy grail of messy code—it could have its own course on how not to code because of how bad and error-prone it is. There are also even worse scenarios of bad code, but it's too long to share, and honestly, they're too deep and fundamentally ingrained in the system to even begin explaining. Oh, I'm sure we could explain it. The explanation may be \"there was a severe and fatal lack of oxygen in the office, and this is what hypoxia looks like in code,\" but I'm certain there'd be an explanation. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
