    "description": "One would hope that most managers who work with student workers would be sympathetic to how challenging it can be to balance education with employment. Let's face the facts: if it weren't necessary, most folks wouldn't take on all that responsibility. And yet, there are still far too many employers in this day and age who become far too concerned with their own insular experience that they are then unable to step outside of themselves and understand how hard things may be for their student workers. This Human Resources department is no exception to this fact. Not only did they demand that this student worker put in significantly more hours than what was initially written in his contract, but then they tried to reduce his pay… twice within a span of four months. As many folks in the comments section suggested, it's time for this guy to get out while he can and if he can.Keep scrolling below for the full story.

    "description": "No one enjoys being cut off, whether that's being cut off in the middle of a phone conversation or having your electricity cut off. Obviously, one of these scenarios is worse than the other, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do to make a point.Here, we have a 28-year-old daughter who helped support her father financially and recently had to call him about an upcoming electricity payment. However, her attempts to discuss this with her father were thwarted six times because he had this awful habit of ending phone conversations when he was done talking no matter what. He also was not the kind of guy who bothered responding to text messages or other forms of communication, so he was impossible to get a hold of as the deadline for this payment was approaching. So, after trying everything, the daughter decided to let the payment due date pass, thereby effectively cutting off her father's electricity all of a sudden. You can just imagine how he reacted to that.Keep scrolling below for the full story. For more stories like this, check out this post about som mildly infuriating movie theater encounters.",

We see so many stories (so many) of cats being left behind by owners. Luckily, most of them have a happy ending thanks to the compassion of the cat community, but we wish that there would be some sort purrfect punishment for the people who did the deed in the first place. Well, it took us years of searching, but we finally found a wholesome rescue story where the culprits were caught, the cat was given a good home, and all was right in the world.This heroic woman witnessed a cat being abandoned (who ended up being pregnant), and was quick on her feet to get pictures of not only the cat, but also of the license plate of the people who dumped her. She called the police, and they actually found the people! She has the court records to pawsitively prove it. Scroll down to read this incredibly satisfying adoption story. Just say it with us one more time: justice was served.",

    "description": "Simon recently found himself working alongside a \"very senior\" developer- who had a whopping 5 years of experience. This developer was also aggrieved that in recent years, Object Oriented programming had developed a bad reputation. \"Functional this, functional that, people really just don't understand how clean and clear objects make your code.\" For example, here are a few Java objects which they wrote to power a web scraping tool: class UrlHolder { private String url; public UrlHolder(String url) { this.url = url; } } class UrlDownloader { private UrlHolder url; public String downloadPage; public UrlDownLoader(String url) { this.url = new UrlHolder(Url); } } class UrlLinkExtractor { private UrlDownloader url; public UrlLinkExtractor(UrlDownloader url) { this.url = url; } public String[] extract() { String page = Url.downloadPage; ... } } UrlHolder is just a wrapper around string, but also makes that string private and provides no accessors. Anything shoved into an instance of that may as well be thrown into oblivion. UrlDownloader wraps a UrlHolder, again, as a private member with no accessors. It also has a random public string called downloadPage. UrlLinkExtractor wraps a UrlDownloader, and at least UrlLinkExtractor has a function- which presumably downloads the page. It uses UrlDownloader#downloadPage- the public string property. It doesn't use the UrlHolder, because of course it couldn't. The entire goal of this code is to pass a string to the extract function. I guess I don't understand object oriented programming. I thought I did, but after reading this code, I don't.
