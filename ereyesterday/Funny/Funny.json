    "description": "Family members can be a strange kettle of fish… and there's something almost uncanny valley about them. They're close enough to you that they're recognizable to you in mannerisms and appearance, but different enough that it's almost off-putting to witness them in existence. Like, it's strange to see them acting and behaving in a way that makes you hyper-aware of your own tendencies and mannerisms. Don't get me wrong, family is everything, and growing up with a rich and vibrant extended family is something special to experience as a kid. But, while it's nice to have family you can rely on, you'll find yourself time and time again craving and seeking your own individuality. Without a doubt, as Johnny Cash's \"A Boy Named Sue\" taught us, names are an important part of any burgeoning identity, and the last thing you want is to be stuck with the exact same name as your cousin.Finding individual niches and paths will happen naturally as you grow up and go in different directions to walk different paths, but there's nothing worse than feeling constricted by who your family wants you to be. This holds mostly for cousins, aunts, and uncles, but can also be true for siblings and the people they go on to marry. You might grow up to find that each of you has values and interests that don't mesh well with the other. This guy and his wife found themselves at odds with his brother and his sister-in-law over the naming of their children. Both his wife and his sister-in-law were pregnant and soon to give birth. The sister-in-law decided that she was going to give her child the same name that the couple had already selected so that the boys' names would be \"matching.\" An insane decision reached through flawed reasoning that would send cracks flowing through the family and its existing dynamic.",

    "description": "The audacity! When a couple separates, it is normal for friends to pick sides. Even though it can feel hurtful at times, it is not always personal. Some loyalties are just bigger than others. However, what is not 'normal' is having your ex-friends blatantly pretend your existence was merely a myth and then come running back years later, asking you for major favors, as if nothing ever happened…The worst part is, they never actually apologized for their behaviour. So, no Tom, time doesn't heal all. Especially when your exes 'bestie', who you haven't spoken to in 3 years, decides to hit you up on LinkedIn asking if you could write them a job referral for your company. The answer is simple: absolutely not. However, this is not just something you want to leave at 'ghost', would it be too far to talk to HR to ensure that they don't even reach the interview stage, or would that be taking it one step too far?",

We can, and it sounds like heaven. Unfortunately, this is not advised so this idea will have to stay in our dreams, but for one couple, it became a reality.Meet Messi, the rescue puma with a form of dwarfism that was born in a zoo. Unfortunately, due to his health issues, the zoo deemed him unfit to live in the zoo or in the wild, so he was about to meet a terrible fate. That is, until one couple saved him, and taught him how to be the purrfect pet. He knows around 10 commands and lives peacefully with his family.

    "description": "Abandoning a cat is one of the worst things that you can do to it. Your house cat is reliant on you. It doesn't know any reality except the one that you created around it. Your house cat wouldn't know how to survive outside on its own, the same way that you wouldn't know how to do it, because it has never had to. Abandoning a senior cat… that is simply cruel. A young cat might still have the time, the energy, the chance to learn how to survive outside, but throwing a senior cat out is pretty much telling it that it does not deserve to live anymore. And we don't understand why people do this. Senior cats make amazing pets. They are so affectionate, so calm, so sweet. The thought of our sweet kitty having to live out there, all on its own, looking for scraps, breaks our heart. So, we can only say thank you to the kind people in this video who didn't let this cat be in that situation any longer than it already was. Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver.

And in those ancient times, these stone tools were just fine. But computing got more and more important, and the costs for renting time kept going up and up, so they eventually bought their own AS/400. And that meant someone needed to migrate all of their COBOL to RPG. And management knew what you do for those kinds of conversions: higher a Highly Paid Consultant. On one hand, the results weren't great. On the other, the code is still in use, though has been through many updates and modernizations and migrations in that time. Still, the HPC's effects can be felt, like this block, which hasn't been touched since she was last here: // CHECK FOR VALID FIELD IF FIELD1 \u003c\u003e *BLANKS AND FIELD1 \u003c '1' AND FIELD1 \u003e '5'; BadField1 = *ON; LEAVESR; ENDIF; This is a validation check on a field (anonymized by Rob), but the key thing I want you to note is that what the field stores are numbers, but it stores those numbers as text- note the quotes. And the greater-than/less-than operators will do lexical comparisons on text, which means '21' \u003c '5' is true. The goal of this comparison was to require the values to be between 1 and 5. But that's not what it's enforcing. The only good(?) news is that this field also isn't used. There's one screen where users can set the value, but no one has- it's currently blank everywhere- and nothing else in the system references the value. Which raises the question of why it's there at all. But those kinds of questions are par for the course for the HPC. When they migrated a bunch of reports and the users compared the results with the original versions, the results didn't balance. The HPC's explanation? \"The users are changing the data to make me look bad.\" [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

    "description": "Wikipedia describes the (very old) English children's game. I wonder if there's a similar game in Germany. In any case, the Worcester News is definitely confused about how this game is played. Martin I. explains \"This is a cookie acceptance dialog. It seems to struggle with labeling the buttons when the user's browser is not set to English ...\"   In Dutch, Robert R. is playing a different game. \"Duolingo is teaching users more than just languages - apparently web development fundamentals are included when HTML entities leak into the user interface. That's one way to make \" \" part of your vocabulary!\" We wonder why the webdev would want to use a nbsp in this location.   Ninja Squirrel shares a flubstitution nugget. \"Since I've been waiting a long time for a good deal on a new gaming keyboard and the Logitech Play Days started today, I thought I'd treat myself. I wasn't prepared for what Logitech then treated me to - free gifts and wonderful localization errors in the productive WebShop. What started with a simple “Failed to load resource [Logitech.checkout.Total]” in the order overview ended with this wonderful total failure after the order was placed. What a sight to behold - I love it! XD\"   David P. imagines that Tesla's web devs are allowed near embedded systems. \"If Tesla can't even do dates correctly, imagine how much fun Full Self Driving is.\" Given how often FSD has been promised imminently, I conclude that date confusion is simply central to the corporate culture. Embrace it.   But it's not only Tesla that bungles whens. Neil T. nails another big name. \"Has Google's Gemini AI hallucinated a whole new calendar? I'm pretty sure the Gregorian calendar only has 30 days in June.\"   And that's it for this week. Next Friday is definitely not June [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",
