    "description": "Realistically, when a CEO hires employees to do a job, they hire them to take care of business they cannot take care of themselves. Whether it is because they don't have the time, or maybe they don't have the skill, either way–everyone is there for a reason. That is how you build a company, by assembling a group of people who can help the business take off, and do what needs to be done.However, since we are still talking about the CEO, they still get to treat the company like their own, and justifyingly so. They can make demands, change elements of the work, and ask employees anything, and they would not be denied. They owe everything there after all, why would they be denied?Well, the answer is that even though they run the business, that doesn't mean they understand everything about it. Again, they have employees for a reason. Employees who master and understand their field, and they do not need the CEO, or anyone else related to the CEO for that matter, to get involved.",

Sales, in particular, is a thrill ride where every deal is a rollercoaster loop and every slump a panic-inducing experience. The corporate mantra goes something like this: \"You're all stars! Unless the numbers dip, in which case, sound the alarms.\" And oh do the alarms blare.Now, imagine a bright sales star whose numbers took a holiday dip, only to find himself on a PIP under new management. A third of his office is suddenly trying to \"improve\" their way back to job security. Our salesman is a stark optimist though, he wants to believe the new boss just wants him to shine brighter.Should I tell him or is one of you guys willing to break his sweet little naive heart?",

Kittens have to learn how to drink water without it getting all up in their noses. Kittens have to learn how to communicate effectively, so that they will know exactly how to demand everything that they need from their humans. Kittens need to learn the basics from their parents, so it's no surprise that cat parenthood can be overwhelming to some. And let's not forget just how hyperactive and wiggly and squeaky kittens are in the beginning. You pick them up and they wiggle-jiggle right out of your hand. The chaos starts young with these guys. We know it, but this Maine Coon cat dad… seems to not have gotten the warning. Yeah, you would think that the first meeting between a cat dad and his babies would be wholesome… and it is. It's just hilarious at the same time.",

But since this is not the case, with every cat - all cat pawrents turn to share their cats' shenanigans online. We gathered some hilariously accurate cat tweets made by cat pawrents, who we're sure would like to have a real word with their cats as we do, but can't. As we can't. Believe us, if you're a cat pawrent - this bunch of cat tweets is the most relatable it gets out there.",

    "description": "Sammy's company \"jumped on the Ruby on Rails bandwagon since there was one on which to jump\", and are still very much a Rails shop. The company has been around for thirty years, and in that time has seen plenty of ups and downs. During one of those \"ups\", management decided they needed to scale up, both in terms of staffing and in terms of client base- so they hired an offshore team to promote international business and add to their staffing. A \"down\" followed not long after, and the offshore team was disbanded. So Sammy inherited the code. I know I'm generally negative on ORM systems, and that includes Rails, but I want to stress: they're fine if you stay on the happy path. If your data access patterns are simple (which most applications are just basic CRUD!) there's nothing wrong with using an ORM. But if you're doing that, you need to use the ORM. Which is not what the offshore team did. For example: class Request \u003c ActiveRecord::Base def self.get_this_years_request_ids(facility_id) # There are several other methods that are *exactly* the same, except for the year requests = Request.where(\"requests.id in (select t.id from requests as t # what is the purpose of this subquery? where t.unit_id=token_requests.unit_id and t.facility_id=token_requests.facility_id and t.survey_type = '#{TokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE}' # why is SURVEY_TYPE a constant? and EXTRACT( YEAR FROM created_at) = EXTRACT(YEAR FROM current_timestamp) order by t.id desc) and token_requests.facility_id = #{facility_id.to_i} # so we get all the requests by year, then by by ??? and token_requests.survey_type = '#{Request::SURVEY_TYPE}'\") Comments from Sammy. Now, if we just look at the signature of the method, it seems like this should be a pretty straightforward query: get all of the request IDs for a given facility ID, within a certain time range. And Sammy has helpfully provided a version of this code which does the same thing, but in a more \"using the tools correctly\" way: def self.request_ids_for_year(facility_id,year = Time.now.year) token_requests = TokenRequest.where( :facility_id=\u003efacility_id, :survey_type=\u003eTokenRequest::SURVEY_TYPE, :created_at=\u003e(DateTime.new(year.to_i).beginning_of_year .. DateTime.new(year.to_i).end_of_year)) Now, I don't know Ruby well enough to be sure, but the DateTime.new(year.to_i) whiffs a bit of some clumsy date handling, but that may be a perfectly cromulent idiom in Ruby. But this code is pretty clear about what it's doing: finding request objects for a given facility within a given year. Why one uses Request and the other uses TokenRequest is a mystery to me- I' m going to suspect some bad normalization in the database or errors in how Sammy anonymized the code. That's neither here nor there. Once we've gotten our list of requests, we need to process them to output them. Here's how the offshore code converted the list into a comma delimited string, wrapped in parentheses. string_token_request_ids = \"(-1)\" if token_requests \u0026\u0026 token_requests.length \u003e 0 for token_request in token_requests if string_token_request_ids != \"\" string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + \",\" end string_token_request_ids = string_token_request_ids + token_request.id.to_s end string_token_request_ids = \"(\" + string_token_request_ids + \")\" end end end Look, if the problem is to \"join a string with delimiters\" and you write code that looks like this, just delete your hard drive and start over. You need extra help. We start by defaulting to (-1) which is presumably a \"no results\" indicator. But if we have results, we'll iterate across those results. If our result string is non-empty (which it definitely is non-empty), we append a comma (giving us (-1),). Then we append the current token ID, giving us (-1),5, for example. Once we've exhausted all the returned IDs, we wrap the whole thing in parentheses. So, this code is wrong- it's only supposed to return (-1) when there are no results, but as written, it embeds that in the results. Presumably the consuming code is able to handle that error gracefully, since the entire project works. Sammy provides us a more idiomatic (and readable) version of the code which also works correctly: return \"(#{token_requests.count \u003e 0 ? token_requests.map(\u0026:id).join(',') : '(-1)'})\" I'll be honest, I hate the fact that this is returning a stringly-typed list of integers, but since I don't know the context, I'll let that slide. At the very least, this is a better example of what joining a list of values into a string should look like. Sammy writes: It seems these devs never took the time to learn the language. After asking around a bit, I found out they all came from a Java background. Most of this code seems to be from a VB playbook, though. That's a huge and undeserved insult to Visual Basic programmers, Sammy. Even they're not that bad. .comment{border:none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands. Download today!",

    "description": "Tim has been working on a large C++ project which has been around for many, many years. It's a tool built for, in Tim's words, \"an esoteric field\", and most of the developers over the past 30 years have been PhD students. This particular representative line is present with its original whitespace, and the original variable names. It has been in the code base since 2010. Assignment::Ptr ra = Assignment::makeAssignment(I, addr, func, block, RA); The extra bonus is that Assignment::Ptr is actually an alias for boost::shared_ptr. As you might gather from the name shared_ptr, that's a reference-counted way to manage pointers to memory, and thus avoid memory leaks. The developers just couldn't tolerate using the names provided by their widely used library solving a widely understood problem, and needed to invent their own names, which made the code less clear. The same is true for makeAssignment. And this pattern is used for nearly every class, because the developers involved didn't understand object lifetimes, when to allow things to be stack allocated, or how ownership should really work in an application. This is hardly the only WTF in the code, but Tim says: Preceding the 98 standard, there is a LOT of C-with-classes code. But this representative line speaks to the complete lack of thought that has gone into much of codebase. That whitespace is as-is from the source.
