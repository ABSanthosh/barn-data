    "description": "Fences exist for multiple reasons, but the biggest one is privacy. Most humans live in fairly close quarters with one another, so measures are put in place to provide each homeowner with some semblance of privacy, especially in their backyards. Nobody wants a peeping Tom peeking over their wooden fence in the early morning or late night hours of the day, and nobody should have to deal with that type of nosiness.You can take all the measures humanly possible, and still have to deal with the nosiness of a very persistent neighbor with loads of time on their hands. They'll try their best to give you a million excuses for why they're looking into your yard, wandering on your lawn, and the like. Don't give in and let it slide. If you have animals, you have the right to let them loose on your own property. If the neighbor happens to be trespassing, they have no grounds to report you for loose animals. This is what's going on in the next story you're about to read, and the homeowner is seeking police intervention as a result. Scroll to read the full story.",

    "description": "Sometimes, working relationships have the potential to turn into something a bit more personal than what you first intended. You might not feel a certain tethering to a coworker, but they might feel such ways toward you, so it's important to always prioritize your career first and foremost and always look out for your own best interest. If you don't, you might be stuck with a narcissistic colleague or boss and be forced to cut the work relationship off with them completely. One caveat: There will always be hard feelings if clingy working relationships go south. That's just the name of the game, so it's best to get the chip off your shoulder and let the dust settle. Time heals all unwarranted wounds…The employee who posted this next story explains that they needed to leave their place of work after working with their boss for over three years because the \"goal post\" was always moving in terms of expectations. So, when they quit, their boss, who seems a bit unhinged, gives them their final paycheck with a typed-out letter attached. Scroll to read below…",

We have heard of neighbors abandoning their cats and leaving them to fend for themselves, which is bad enough, but apparently, it's not even the tip of the iceberg. We have heard of neighbors stealing people's cats knowing that the cats belong to someone else. We have heard of entitled neighbors demanding people give their cats to them because they need the cat more. And today, we come across one of the most entitled neighbors yet. It's been a year since their cat has gone \"missing\", a year since their neighbor found the cat, rescued it, attempted to find its owners and been told by the vet that the cat is in such poor condition, there is no way it belonged to someone else. A year, and suddenly, these neighbors remember that they had a cat, start asking around about it, and once they find it, demand to get it back. The audacity is baffling.",

    "description": "If you're a cat pawrent, you know your cat has their routine. And honestly, every household with a cat in it is managed by the cat's schedule. That's just part of being a cat pawrent, there's nothing bad about it. Your cat decides you should get up at a specific time? Well, good morning then, because the cat has probably woken you up. Your cat is sure now it's dinner time? Bon appetit, because the cat won't stop meowing until dinner is served. Such are the lives of cat pawrents.But when your cat's routine is broken, cat pawrents get stressed. Oh, the woes of being a cat pawrent. But seriously, knowing your cat has a strict schedule and then, suddenly, it changes - it might raise some red flags. This is exactly what happened to a pair of parents who raise a cute tuxie cat. Their cat used to sleep in bed with them every night, even after they had kids. But at some point, the cat stopped sleeping in their bed. Routine change? That's suspicious. Especially because cats will be cats, meaning routine-oriented.The parents who are also pawrents investigated. But the investigation results were not as stressful as a cat changing their routine. The results were actually very, very cute. Apparently, the cat moved from one bed to another - from the parents' bed, to their toddler's bed. The cat decided that his sleeping place has changed now, and reality just has to comply. But the process of adjusting wasn't met with any objections - on the contrary, the kid embraced the idea, by embracing the cat and cuddling him to sleep.It was all caught on the security camera in the kid's room. Once shared, the online feline family collectively melted with how adorable this is. The wholesome comments came, describing hearts melting with cuteness. Some even shared their own cat cuddling stories, with cats and humans sleeping together at night. Honestly, our hearts have melted as well.",

    "description": "Andre has inherited a rather antique ASP .Net WebForms application. It's a large one, with many pages in it, but they all follow a certain pattern. Let's see if you can spot it. protected void btnSearch_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { ArrayList paramsRel = new ArrayList(); paramsRel[\"Name\"] = txtNome.Text; paramsRel[\"Date\"] = txtDate.Text; Session[\"paramsRel\"] = paramsRel; List clients = Controller.FindClients(); //Some other code } Now, at first glance, this doesn't look terrible. Using an ArrayList as a dictionary and frankly, storing a dictionary in the Session object is weird, but it's not an automatic red flag. But wait, why is it called paramsRel? They couldn't be… no, they wouldn't… public List FindClients() { ArrayList paramsRel = (ArrayList)Session[\"paramsRel\"]; string name = (string)paramsRel[\"Name\"]; string dateStr = (string)paramsRel[\"Date\"]; DateTime date = DateTime.Parse(dateStr); //More code... } Now there's the red flag. paramsRel is how they pass parameters to functions. They stuff it into the Session, then call a function which retrieves it from that Session. This pattern is used everywhere in the application. You can see that there's a vague gesture in the direction of trying to implement some kind of Model-View-Controller pattern (as FindClients is a member of the Controller object), but that modularization gets undercut by everything depending on Session as a pseudoglobal for passing state information around. The only good news is that the Session object is synchronized so there's no thread safety issue here, though not for want of trying. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
