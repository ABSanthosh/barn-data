    "description": "Shakespeare had a way with words—but for many of us who enjoy a good YA novel over a literary mouthful, we'd argue that Shakespeare had TOO MANY words. And for the sketchy car dealership salesman who was profiting from ill-fated swindles, he certainly contested that Shakespearean literature was far too wordy for him… Especially after receiving 10,000 texts containing transcripts of his plays after ripping off a disgruntled customer. Perhaps it was fate that brings us here today or the pursuit of a nobler revenge story. Simply put, this customer had accidentally purchased a lemon vehicle, condemned yet cleverly disguised as a good buy. But when his mechanic noticed a tiny detail he missed at the dealership, all was lost. Or was it? Keep scrolling to read how this guy used Shakespeare's works to get petty revenge (and a refund) at the hands of a villainous and deceitful car salesman.",

But, if you choose to become an outdoor cat, we must warn you that A) it is cold outside and B) it is not as nice as inside. But, the choice is still yours to make. Do you want to be an indoor cat or an outdoor one today? We always prefurr to be an indoor cat, the less hoomans we see on the daily the better. But, we know that it's good to get out and breathe some fresh air, so today, we will venture into the great outdoors. But we will immediately claw at the door to come back in, because one breath seems good enough for today. Just like these hissterical cat memes that are meowing to come back in after being outside for exactly 0.3 seconds. They also appreciate the comfort of being at home, just like us. Happy scrolling!",

And you know what? That's okay. We still love them endlessly. Today, we're making a bold statement, one we stand behind wholeheartedly: Cats are nature's glitchiest creation. Show us a glitchier being—we'll wait.These delightfully unpredictable creatures are experts at balancing elegance with absolute absurdity. One moment they're moving with the grace of a ballet dancer, and the next, they're contorted in ways that defy the laws of physics. They can be adorable and chaotic at the same time, which makes for some truly unforgettable moments. Just ask any cat parent! That's the magic of being a cat parent—equal parts joy and mayhem. Now, put your paws up, sit back, and enjoy this collection of purrfectly silly pictures of cats being their glitchy, ridiculous selves.",

It’s full of fun, unique cooperative mechanics that will have you and whoever you're playing with working together to navigate each new level. Kara and I had planned on giving it a quick try and then playing some Marvel Rivals but once we fired it up we couldn’t stop and spent the rest of the night in Split Fiction. The hook is also great as the game has you bouncing between the imaginations of two different writers, one who does fantasy and the other who does Sci-Fi. Don’t skip this one if you have a gaming partner. It would also make a great entry point if you have someone who isn’t a gamer yet but you want to play something with them. Kara and I give it all the thumbs up.",

I really appreciate the use of self-closing, XHTML style BR tags, which was a fad between 2000 and 2002, but never truly caught on, and was basically forgotten by the time HTML5 dropped. But this developer insisted that self-closing tags were the \"correct\" way to write HTML. Pity they didn't put any thought in the \"correct\" way to add blank space to page beyond line breaks. Or the correct way to populate the DOM that isn't accessing the inner HTML of an element. At least this was a former co-worker.

    "description": "As oft stated, the \"right\" way to validate emails is to do a bare minimum sanity check on format, and then send a verification message to the email address the user supplied; it's the only way to ensure that what they gave you isn't just syntactically valid, but is actually usable. But even that simple approach leaves places to go wrong. Take a look at this code, from Lana. public function getEmailValidationErrors($data): array { $errors = []; if (isset($data[\"email\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } if (isset($data[\"email1\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email1\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email1\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email1\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email1\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email1\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email1\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email1\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email1\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } if (isset($data[\"email2\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email2\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email2\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email2\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email2\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email2\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email2\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email2\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email2\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } if (isset($data[\"email3\"]) \u0026\u0026 !empty($data[\"email3\"])) { if (!str_contains($data[\"email3\"], \"@\")) { $error[\"email3\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_AT\"; } if (!str_contains($data[\"email3\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email3\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_DOT\"; } if (strrpos($data[\"email3\"], \"@\") \u003e strrpos($data[\"email3\"], \".\")) { $error[\"email3\"] = \"FORM.CONTACT_DETAILS.ERRORS.NO_TLD\"; } } return $errors; } Let's start with the obvious problem: repetition. This function doesn't validate simply one email, but four, by copy/pasting the same logic multiple times. Lana didn't supply the repeated blocks, just noted that they existed, so let's not pick on the bad names: \"email1\", etc.- that's just my placeholder. I assume it's different contact types for a customer, or similar. Now, the other problems range from trivial to comical. First, the PHP function empty returns true if the variable has a zero/falsy value or is not set, which means it implies an isset, making the first branch redundant. That's trivial. The way the checks get logged into the $error array, they can overwrite each other, meaning if you forget the \"@\" and the \".\", it'll only complain about the \".\", but if you forget the \".\", it'll complain about not having a valid TLD (the \"NO_DOT\" error will never be output). That's silly. Finally, the $errors array is the return value, but the $error array is where we store our errors, meaning this function doesn't return anything in the first place. And that means that it's a email validation function which doesn't do anything at all, which honestly- probably for the best.
