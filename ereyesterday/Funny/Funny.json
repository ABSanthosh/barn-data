    "description": "Growing up with siblings gives you a unique perspective on fairness. If you and your sibling are very different people, you're going to bear witness to some very different parenting styles. Often, older siblings are subjected to rules and regulations, while younger siblings get much more leniency. Older siblings can have more pressure to perform, to carry out the family's legacy, and to live up to the family name. Sometimes, it can be frustrating to watch your sibling receive gifts and privileges that you were never awarded as a kid. Especially if you are far apart in age, you may have had a completely different upbringing entirely than your sibling. This can sometimes lead to resentment and hurt, but, for the most part, it's just the way the cookie crumbles.One woman experienced this divide in parenting with her sister, who is ten years younger than her. This woman grew up with a lot fewer privileges than her sister and was expected to move out when she was 18 and put her way through school. When her sister asked her why she moved out so soon, this woman told her the truth, which caused her mother to accuse her of guilting her sister. Read on to see how it all plays out.",

    "description": "Don't be that person who writes that they're \"detal oriented\" on their resume, thereby proving themselves immediately wrong! Resume writing is a true skill, and it's one that most people don't naturally have. Bragging about yourself and your work accomplishments can feel intimidating, not to mention the imposter syndrome you may feel as you list your achievements. It's a tough balance. You want to reflect your work experience in the most flattering way possible, while also avoiding stretching the truth into a lie. I think a lot of hiring managers are skilled at reading in between the lines when it comes to interviewing. Like if you claim you \"managed an office,\" but the only duties you can talk about are turning the lights on in the morning and answering a few emails for the boss, they might think you're stretching the truth. There are all sorts of ways to spin your job title into something cool, or exaggerate your qualifications to match the job description, but at the end of the day, you've got to prove you're actually capable. Check out a few of the absolute funniest and worst resumes that hiring managers have ever laid eyes on. Then, read about this mom of twin toddlers who refused to parent them throughout a long flight, leaving the passengers near them annoyed: \"The couple next to me moved.\"",

    "description": "Hey there, cat pawrents. If you've ever adopted a kitten, you know that they are both fluffy, sweet little angels, and also purrfessional life-destroyers at the same time. One second, they're snuggled up on your chest, snoozing away, and then a few hours later (specifically at night), they're running around your house breaking literally everything pawssible. It's a lot. And the energy is never ending. This is why we always tell people to do their research before adopting a kitten, and even then it can't fully prepaw you for the chaos that will come.The only way out is through, so you just have to live through it and know that it will get better. Now, some kittens are easier than others. The really hard ones make you question your reality, and even force you to consider rehoming your tiny baby. After being sleep deprived for the last couple of months, one such feline pawrent was at their limit. They asked the internet for advice, and what they received was not quite what they expected. Scroll down to see how they solved it below!",

    "description": "There's nothing funnier in the meme sphere more than cat memes. Yes, yes, we're aware there are other memes that are funny, we do not deny reality. But there's something special about cat memes. They're not only funny, as most memes are (or at least as some memes are) - they also have cats. And if it was not clear up until this point - we're very much in the opinion that cats make everything better. Even memes. You have a meme, you make it with a cat, and it's instantly better than it was before. Cat memes are simply the best.Since cat memes are the funniest, they are the best kind of memes, we want to share as much of them with as many people as we can. This is why we prepared this comedic compound of cat comedy made of 22 funny feline memes. All these feline funnies are really making us laugh here like no other kind of meme. Can we agree at least that cat memes are cute?",

    "description": "We like trains here at Error'd, and you all seem to like trains too. That must be the main reason we get so many submissions about broken information systems. \"Pass,\" said Jozsef . I think that train might have crashed already.   An anonymous subscriber shared an epic tale some time ago. They explained thus. \"(I couldn't capture in the photo, but the next station after Duivendrecht was showing the time of 09:24+1.) We know Europe has pretty good trains, and even some high-speed lines. But this was the first time I boarded a time-traveling train. At first I was annoyed to be 47 minutes late. I thought I could easily walk from Amsterdam Centraal to Muiderpoort in less than the 53 minutes that this train would take. But I was relieved to know the trip to the further stations was going to be quicker, and I would arrive there even before arriving at the earlier stations.\" I think the explanation here is that this train is currently expected to arrive at Muiderport around 10:01. But it's still projected to arrive at the following stop at 9:46, and more surprisingly at the successive stops at 9:35 and 9:25.   Railfan Richard B. recently shared \"Points failure on the West Coast Main Line has disrupted the linear nature of time.\"   and quite some time ago, he also sent us this snap, singing \"That train that's bound for glory? It runs through here.\"   An unrelated David B. wonders \"When is the next train? We don't know, it's running incognito.\"   And finally, courageous Ivan got sideways underground. \"Copenhagen subway system may have fully automated trains, but their informational screens need a little manual help every now and then.\"   [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "There are real advantages to taking a functional programming approach to expressing problems. Well, some problems, anyway. Kevin sends us this example of elegant, beautiful functional code in C#: //create a range of dates List dates = Enumerable.Range (0, 1 + settings.EndDate.Subtract (settings.BeginDate).Days).Select (offset =\u003e settings.BeginDate.AddDays(offset)).ToList(); foreach (DateTime procDate in dates) { /*.snip.*/ } If you're not sure what this code does, it's okay- Kevin rewrote it and \"ruined\" it: DateTime procDate = settings.BeginDate; while(procDate \u003c= settings.EndDate) { /*.snip.*/ procDate= procDate.AddDays(1); } The goal of this code is simply to do something for every day within a range of dates. These two approaches vary a bit in terms of readability though. I guess the loop in the functional version isn't mutating anything, I suppose. But honestly, I'm surprised that this didn't take the extra step of using the .ForEach function (which takes a lambda and applies it to each parameter). Heck, with that approach, they could have done this whole thing in a single statement.
