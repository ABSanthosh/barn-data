    "description": "Imagine having a coworker who takes a little bit of everyone else's lunch, but then is also the loudest to complain about it! One person did just that: he would steal a little bit from each coworker's lunch, then loudly whine about how terrible it was that they were \"all\" getting stolen from. At least when that person got caught, they were swiftly shunned by the entire workplace! No matter how hungry you are, stealing from your coworkers is just bad form. I think some people like the thrill of the theft, though. There must be a certain thrill in pilfering the clementines of the dude who sits next to you plus the pasta salad that the accountant brought in and making yourself a de facto lunch. It's also just very cringe and sad. Even if they can't afford food, there are food pantries where they could get free meals! You can't just have sticky fingers whenever you decide you're ready for a treat. Check out the stories of workplace food thefts below, especially the \"monkey thieves\" story! Next, check out these oddly designed items made for people with questionable taste, leading one person to muse, \"Can't decide if I love them or hate them.\"",

    "description": "Sometimes, it's easier to try and mess up an interview than to try and do a good job. Every anxious person has had the experience of being in the hot seat and not knowing what to say that's acceptable. All that comes to mind is what not to say, and you end up feeling Bridget Jones speaking publicly. Interviewing, as we know all too well at this point, is a skill in and of itself. Unfortunately, that skill can appear to be more important than the skills one actually might need to perform the responsibilities of the job to which you're applying. Now for folks who have had the uncomfortable, albeit lucky experience of needing to turn down a job prospect, sometimes, it's easy to think of all the ways you can mess up the opportunity for yourself rather than just come clean and say you no longer want to be considered. Let these responses to the prompt \"how to mess up an interview\" serve as an indicator that it's way better to be honest…",

    "description": "Hoomans are faced with meowments of pure clarity in their lives where the 'right thing' becomes incredibly obvious. For the lonely trucker in this next story, a desperate cat in need prompted him to become the hero he was always meant to be, saving a kitty's life and tackling some terrifying truck stop foes in the process. North America is full of furry mammals in the wild that are both big enough and strong enough to take out a human—such as bears, wolves, coyotes, and moose, to name a few. The smaller critters in the wild have learned to defend themselves from becoming prey to these sharp-toothed beasts, but the graceful, mischievous, and oh-so-curious house cat was never born with these instincts. In fact, house cats are defenseless out in the wild and have no natural defense skills apart from a warrior-cry hiss and an arsenal of mean-beans that have never been used for battle. Stray cats are far more vulnerable than they lead on and sometimes a good-hearted hooman needs to step up to rescue them. Keep scrolling to read the story of a cat's unlikely survival in the face of a pack of coyotes after a trucker at a truck stop swooped in to save her.",

It's a dating show in its molecular form, it's clearly been designed by certified (definition 1) psychiatric experts to perforate human beings, to peel them like an onion. Its structure is something like a rocket - there's a Booster Phase where the participants can't see each other, and the participants wade through waist-high gossip to and from the little chambers they make them sit in. Then, once that phase balls into the atmosphere, they get fucking engaged with these people they've never seen before and this goes all the ways you think. You gotta meet a woman's dad who hates you and hates the show and thinks it's a mockery of the society they grew up in. Then you see if any of those people actually go through with it. Then they do an episode where they get all those people later and put them in the same room! Heavy sheets of plastic are laid down and stapled to the walls because three to four people get murdered in this episode, on average.",

    "description": "Python's \"batteries included\" approach means that a lot of common tasks have high-level convenience functions for them. For example, if you want to read all the lines from a file into an array (list, in Python), you could do something like: with open(filename) as f: lines = f.readlines() Easy peasy. Of course, because it's so easy, there are other options. For example, you can just convert the file directly to a list: lines = list(f). Or you can iterate across the file directly, e.g.: with open(filename) as f: for line in f: # do stuff Of course, that's fine for plain old text files. But we frequently use text files which are structured in some fashion, like a CSV file. No worries, though, as Python has a csv library built in, which makes it easy to handle these files too; especially useful because \"writing a CSV parser yourself\" is one of those tasks that sounds easy until you hit the first edge case, and then you realize you've made a terrible mistake. Now, it's important to note that CSV usually is expressed as a \"comma separated values\" file, but the initialism is actually \"character separated values\". And, as Sally's co-worker realized, newlines are characters, and thus every text file is technically a CSV file. foo = list(csv.reader(someFile, delimiter=\"\\n\")) .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "Most of us, when generating a UUID, will reach for a library to do it. Even a UUIDv4, which is just a random number, presents challenges: doing randomness correctly is hard, and certain bits within the UUID are reserved for metadata about what kind of UUID we're generating. But Gretchen's co-worker didn't reach for a library. What they did reach for was… regular expressions? function uuidv4() { return \"xxxxxxxx-xxxx-4xxx-yxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\".replace(/[xy]/g, function (c) { var r = (Math.random() * 16) | 0, v = c == \"x\" ? r : (r \u0026 0x3) | 0x8; return v.toString(16); }); } At a glance, this appears to be a riff on common answers on Stack Overflow. I won't pick on this code for not using crypto.randomUUID, the browser function for doing this, as that function only started showing up in browsers in 2021. But using a format string and filling it with random data instead of generating your 128-bits as a Uint8Buffer is less forgivable. This solution to generating UUIDs makes a common mistake: confusing the representation of the data with the reality of the data. A UUID is 128-bits of numerical data, with a few bits reserved for identification (annoyingly, how many bits are reserved depends on which format we're talking about). We render it as the dash-separated-hex-string, but it is not a dash-separated-hex-string. In the end, this code does work. Awkwardly and inefficiently and with a high probability of collisions due to bad randomness, but it works. I just hate it.
