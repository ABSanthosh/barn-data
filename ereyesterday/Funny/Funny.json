    "description": "Solidarity with our coworkers is a crucial part of a healthy workplace. If we can bond over an absurd project or the boss' annoying behavior, we're more likely to work better together. It's also important to gain trust and understanding with our coworkers so we can all get the work done and go home on time. If the boss isn't looking, it can even be fun to bend the rules a little bit with the few opportunities we have.This makes it all the more crushing when a coworker is on the boss' side more than yours. And when that one coworker is consistently hypocritical about the things they snitch on you about, then it might be time to take it up with the dreaded HR. One man had that issue with a coworker who was consistently late and took extra long lunch breaks, yet told him off if he was even minutes late. It's simple, if you're going to be late, I have no problem with it! Just don't get mad at me when I'm doing what you're doing. Read on to see if you agree with how this guy handled this situation.",

    "description": "Sometimes people choose to take the job they did because of all of the perks. For example, I used to work at a media outlet (will leave it anonymous) that provided many extra benefits for their employees. Catered lunches every day, nap breaks, tons of PTO, and lots and lots of wiggle room on expenses. If you were traveling for work, you could basically expense everything you did during that trip. Like, you decided to go to an expensive concert while you are in that city for a business conference? Expensed and not even questioned. Literally crazy thought, because not many companies do that. Why? Because that will bankrupt the company. And guess what? That place went bankrupted and shut down… So yeah, if you're even a business credit card, make sure to use it wisely.  Some employees, however, know that they are supposed to use their business expenses wisely, but still try to get away with using it like their personal checking account. A Redditor started a thread asking people what was the craziest personal expense they witnessed trying to be pulled off as a business expense after he saw someone try to expense a deck being built in their backyard for work. People really had some crazy things to add!",

    "description": "We keep telling people, when they get older, that they should adopt cats, that cats bring joy and warmth to any household that they are in. We wholeheartedly believe that. So, when we came across this video of a blind grandmother taking care of some cats, we weren't particularly surprised. What did surprise us was the number of them and the story behind them. This kind old woman rescued a bunch of kittens - 11 of them in fact. And the kittens are not the only ones that she is taking care of. She is also taking care of the momma cats who gave birth to the little fluffballs. 10 newborn kittens in total from the two stray momma cats. The 11th kitten is one that she rescued - asking a neighbor to look into a kitten that was crying outside and bringing her in when no one else wanted to. She is an amazing woman, and you can just see… in her eyes, how happy these wiggly, squeaky kittens make her.",

    "description": "Big felines—lions, tigers, and their wild cousins—are the heavyweights of the cat world. They're the undisputed rulers of their habitats, commanding respect with their sheer size, strength, and signature stealthy prowls. These apex predators rely on their solo hunting skills to take down big game like antelope and wild boar, though they won't say no to a smaller snack if the opportunity presents itself.Now, imagine our housecats having to hunt for their own meals. Realistically, they'd probably try to annoy their prey into submission with incessant meowing or demand food in their signature dramatic fashion. The struggle would be real. On the other hand, housecats are like the little cousins of these mighty wildcats—miniature versions with just as much attitude but a lot less muscle mass. They might not be prowling the savanna, but they will stalk your toes under the blanket with expert-level precision. Despite their tiny size compared to their wild relatives, they share plenty of traits: retractable claws, a love for meaty treats, and that undeniable feline confidence. Enjoy all of this big cat goodness!",

I'll have to sit down for a second and really think about where the parentheses begin and end on this shit - I'm being seized 24/7 by incalculable whorls. You usually try to figure it out from the names, there's only a few total formats they use, but occasionally you don't know and you might feel compelled to ask. I feel like asking a person if they are a bot is probably worse than leaving it ambiguous; it's nice when they simply volunteer the information. I guess we also have to consider that these bots have become ensnared by carnal hungers. I'll keep an eye on it, I guess.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/walking-the-doge",
    "description": "One thing I've learned by going through our reader submissions over the years is that WTFs never start with just one mistake. They're a compounding sequence of systemic failures. When we have a \"bad boss\" story, where an incompetent bully puts an equally incompetent sycophant in charge of a project, it's never just about the bad boss- it's about the system that put the bad boss in that position. For every \"Brillant\" programmer, there's a whole slew of checkpoints which should have stopped them before they went too far. With all that in mind, today we're doing a news roundup about the worst boss of them all, the avatar of Dunning-Kruger, Elon Musk. Because over the past month, a lot has happened, and there are enough software and IT related WTFs that I need to talk about them. For those who haven't been paying attention, President Trump assembled a new task force called the \"Department of Government Efficiency\", aka \"DOGE\". Like all terrible organizations, its mandate is unclear, its scope is unspecified, and its power to execute is unbounded. Now, before we get into it, we have to talk about the name. Like so much of Musk's persona, it's an unfunny joke. In this case, just a reference to Dogecoin, a meme currency based on a meme image that Musk has \"invested\" in. This is part of a pattern of unfunny jokes, like strolling around Twitter headquarters with a sink, or getting your product lines to spell S3XY. This has nothing to do with the news roundup, I just suspect that Musk's super-villain origin story was getting booed off the stage at a standup open-mic night and then he got roasted by the emcee. Everything else he's ever done has been an attempt to convince the world that he's cool and popular and funny. On of the core activities at DOGE is to be a \"woodchipper\", as Musk puts it. Agencies Musk doesn't like are just turned off, like USAID. The United States Agency for International Development handles all of the US foreign aid. Now, there's certainly room for debate over how, why, and how much aid the US provides abroad, and that's a great discussion that I wouldn't have here. But there's a very practical consideration beyond the \"should/should not\" debate: people currently depend on it. Farmers in the US depend on USAID purchasing excess crops to stabilize food prices. Abroad, people will die without the support they've been receiving. Even if you think aid should be ended entirely, simply turning off the machine while people are using it will cause massive harm. But none of this should come as a surprise, because Musk loves to promote his \"algorithm\". Calling it an \"algorithm\" is just a way to make it sound smarter than it is; what Musk's \"algorithm\" really is is a 5-step plan of bumper-sticker business speak that ranges from fatuous to incompetent, and not even the fawning coverage in the article I linked can truly disguise it. For example, step 1 is \"question every requirement\", which is obvious- of course, if you're trying to make this more efficient, you should question the requirements. As a sub-head on that, though, Musk says that requirements should be traceable directly to individuals, not departments. On one hand, this could be good for accountability, but on the other, any sufficiently complex system is going to have requirements that have to be built through collaboration, where any individual claiming the requirement is really just doing so to be a point of accountability. Step 2, also has a blindingly obvious label: \"delete any part of the process you can\". Oh, very good, why didn't I think of that! But Musk has a \"unique\" way of figuring out what parts of the process can be deleted: \"You may have to add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least 10 percent of them, then you didn’t delete enough.\" Or, to put it less charitably: break things, and then unbreak them when you realize what you broke, if you do. We can see how this plays out in practice, because Musk played this game when he took over Twitter. And sure, it's revenue has collapsed, but we don't care about that here. What we care about are stupid IT stories, like the new owner renting a U-Haul and hiring a bunch of gig workers to manually decommission an expensive data center. Among the parts of the process Musk deleted were: Shutting down the servers in an orderly fashion Using the proper tools to uninstall the server racks Protecting the flooring which wasn't designed to roll 2,500lb server racks Not wiping the hard drives which contained user data and proprietary information Not securing that valuable data with anything more than a set of Home Depot padlocks and Apple AirTags And, shockingly, despite thinking this was successful in the moment, the resulting instability caused by just ripping a datacenter out led Musk to admit this was a mistake. So let's take a look at how this plays out with DOGE. One of the major efforts was taking over the Treasury Department's IT systems. These are systems which handle $5 trillion in payments every year. And who do we put in change? Some random wet-behind-the-ears dev with a history of racist posts on the Internet. Ostensibly, they were there to \"audit\" payments, so was their access read only? Did they have admin access? Were they actually given write access? Could they change code? Nobody is entirely certain. Even if it was only read-only, there are plenty of questions about what kind of security risk that constitutes, which means forensic analysis to understand the breach, which is being called the largest data breach in history. Part of the goal was to just stop payments, following the Muskian \"Break things first, and unbreak them if it was a mistake,\" optimization strategy. Stop paying people, and if you find out you needed to pay them, then start paying them again. Step 2 of the \"algorithm\". Speaking of payments, many people in the US depend on payments from the Social Security Administration. This organization, founded in 1935 as part of the New Deal, handles all sorts of benefits, including retirement benefits. According to Musk, it's absolutely riddled with fraud. What are his arguments? Well, for starters, he worries that SSNs are not de-duplicated- that is, the same SSN could appear multiple times in the database. Social Security Administration has, since the 1940s, been trying to argue against using SSNs as identifiers for any purpose other than Social Security. They have a history page which is a delightful read as a \"we can't say the Executive Orders and laws passed which expanded the use of SSNs into domains where they shouldn't have been used was a bad idea, but we can be real salty about it,\" document. It's passive-aggression perfected. But you and I already know you should never expect SSNs to be a key. Also, assuming the SSA systems are mainframe systems, using flat file databases, we would expect a large degree of denormalization. Seeing \"unique\" keys repeated in the dataset is normal. On the same subject, Musk has decided that people over 150 years old are collecting Social Security benefits. Now, one could assume that this kind of erroneous data pattern is fraud, or we could wonder if there's an underlying reason to the pattern. Now, I've seen a lot of discussion on the Internet about this being an epoch related thing, which is certainly possible, but I think the idea that it's related to ISO8601 is obviously false- ISO8601 is just a string representation of dates, and also was standardized well after COBOL and well after SSA started computerizing. Because the number 150 was used, some folks have noted that would be 1875, and have suspected that the date of the Metre Convention is the epoch. I can't find any evidence that any of this is true, mind you, but we're also reacting to a tweet by a notorious moron, and I have to wonder: did he maybe round off 5 years? Because 1870 is exactly 65 years before 1935- the year Social Security started, and 65 years is the retirement age where you can start collecting Social Security. Thus, the oldest date which the SSA would ever care about was 1870. Though, there's another completely un-epoch related reason why you could have Social Security accounts well older than 150 years: your benefits can continue to be paid out to your spouse and dependents after your death. If an 80 year old marries a 20 year old, and dies the next day, that 20 year old could collect benefits on that account. The key point I'm making is that \"FRAUUUDDDD!!1111!!!\" is really not the correct reaction to a system you don't understand. And while there may be many better ways to handle dates within the SSA's software, the system predates computers and has needed to maintain its ability to pay benefits for 90 years. While you could certainly make improvements, what you can't do is take a big \"algorithm\" Number 2 all over it. Which, with that in mind, the idea that these people are trying to get access to a whole slew of confidential taxpayer information is I'm sure going to go *great. There are so, so many more things that could be discussed here, but let's close with the DOGE website. Given that DOGE operates by walking into government agencies and threatening to call Elon, there are some serious concerns over transparency. Who is doing what, when, why and with what authority? The solution? Repost a bunch of tweets to a website with a .gov domain name. Which, you'd think that spinning up a website that's just that would be easy. Trivially easy. \"Security issues\" shouldn't even be part of the conversation. But in actuality, the database was unsecured and anyone could modify the site. In the end, the hacked website is really just Elon Musk's \"algorithm\" improved: instead of breaking things that are already working, you just start with a broken website.
