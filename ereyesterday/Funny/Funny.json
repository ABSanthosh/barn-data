    "description": "Childcare is so expensive that it causes many couples to carefully consider whether or not it's worth one spouse quitting their whole career and staying at home in order to take care of the kids and save on the expense. It's a big decision, and considering the cost to that spouse's career and long-term earning potential and the fact that the vast majority of families actually need both those incomes to make ends meet, it's a big sacrifice to make. Of course, if, thanks to family or for some other reason, you're able to get free childcare, then you can circumvent that whole issue. But since the service of watching your children is worth a whole salary, this isn't something to take lightly, even if it's your parents offering to watch their grandchildren.There's a reason why we see so many stories like this online where someone tries to weasel their way into getting someone to watch their kids for free, gaslighting a sibling, or some other tenuous acquaintance into watching their kids. When this homeowner moved into a new neighborhood, she thought a good way to meet people and gain a sense of community would be to join a local \"mommy\" social media group. The problem is her status as a SAHM attracted the attention of an eager neighbor who was eager to take the chance at free childcare.",

    "description": "Some people fail to understand that just because you love your job, it doesn't mean you would do it for free. You could feel extremely fulfilled, living your dream life, working your dream job, yet you would never agree to do the same thing without getting paid. As much as we sometimes hate to admit it, money matters, and without being fairly compensated for your work, you can't really call it a 'dream job', can you?I like to think that I love what I do for work. I enjoy writing, I love reading stories and scrolling through hilarious memes, and I can genuinely say I like the office and the people I work with. But if at any point a coworker would approach me and ask me to use my day off to come in and write even more, I would laugh in their face. It doesn't matter if I like it or how good I am at it, there is simply no chance I would do it for free.",

    "description": "Some animals don't need rescuing in the traditional sense. They simply know when it is time to stop running. When it is time to trade survival for comfort. And sometimes, they know exactly which human will help them make that leap. That is what makes this story so special. This sweet street cat, once feral and cautious, spent his days navigating the great outdoors on his own. But one day, something changed. He found his human. Not because he was chased or cornered, but because he chose to trust.In just a few short weeks, he went from hiding behind the toilet to stretching out on the floor, belly up, asking for snuggles and attention. He embraced his new indoor life with such ease that even the vet noted it was like he had decided it was finally time. Time to leave the streets behind and settle into safety and love.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "... London! This week, we're showcasing some multiple submissions from two regular participants who fell into the theme. Everybody else is just going to have to wait for their turn next week. Frist up it's Daniel D. \"I wanted to see events for the dates I would be in London. Is Skiddle (the website in question) telling me I should come to London more often?\" They're certainly being very generous with their interpretation of dates.   But wait, there's more! Daniel follows with a variation: \"Skiddle here again - let's choose June 7th to June 14th, but Skiddle knows better and sets the dates to June 6th to June 13th.\"   \"I was not aware the Berlin to London route passes through Hawaii (which is Mokulele'shome turf)\" chuckles our old friend Michael R. He seems to believe it's an Error'd but I think the real WTF is simply the Byzantine tapestry of partnerships, resellers, rebranding, whitelabeling and masquerades in the air transport biz.   \"Maybe it's just a Monday morning thing,\" he reports from the airport.   But Monday had everybody troubled, and Michael was already thinking of Friday. \"I am so sure I took the Circle Line just last Friday. And the other lines have the option Monday-Friday/Saturday/Sunday.\" I hope there isn't a subtext here.   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet.

    "description": "One of the key points of confusion for people unfamiliar with Java is the distinction between true object types, like Integer, and \"primitive\" types, like int. This is made worse by the collection types, like ArrayList, which needs to hold a true object type, but can't hold a primitive. A generic ArrayList is valid, but ArrayList won't compile. Fortunately for everyone, Java automatically \"boxes\" types- at least since Java 5, way back in 2004- so integerList.add(5) and int n = integerList.get(0) will both work just fine. Somebody should have told that to Alice's co-worker, who spends a lot of code to do some type gymnastics that they shouldn't have: try { ps = conn.prepareStatement(SQL_GET_LOT_WORKUP_STATUSES); ps.setLong(1, _lotId); rs = ps.executeQuery(); while (rs.next()) { result.add(new Integer(rs.getInt(1))); } } finally { CloseUtil.close(ps,rs); } // instatiate a the array _workupStatuses = new int[result.size()]; // convert the integers to ints for (int h=0; h This runs a query against the database, and then iterates across the result to populate a List type with integers, and right away we're getting into confused territory. rs.getInt returns an int primitive, which they manually box with new Integer, and stuff into the List. And look, I wouldn't really call that a WTF, but it's what they do next that leaves me scratching my head. They initialize a private member, _workupStatuses to a new array of ints. Then they copy every integer from the result collection into the array, first by casting the get return value to Integer, then by pulling off the intValue. In the end, this whole dance happens because Java ResultSet types open cursors on the database side and thus don't have the capacity to tell you how many rows they returned. You need to iterate across each record until it runs out of results. That's why they populate an intermediate list. Then they can check the size and create an array, but that itself is a big why. I'm not going to say that using arrays in Java is an instant anti-pattern, but it's always something to be suspicious of, especially when you're holding result sets. It's probably a premature optimization: the key performance distance is on insertions where an ArrayList may need to resize and copy its internal backing store. My suspicion, however, is that this code falls into the category of \"C programmer forced to do Java\". They're comfortable with an array of integers, which is covers 90% of the data types you use in C but a dynamic, complicated data structure is horrifying to them. So they use it when they absolutely have to, and then throw it away as quickly as they can to get back to what they're familiar with. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
