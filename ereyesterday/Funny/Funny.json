In fact, when you work on a contract basis your clients are usually accusing you of wasting time or for charging time that wasn't worked or worked \"appropriately\" enough for the project. It's unusual to have the client accusing you of working too quickly and demanding that you take your time on something—unless the job is being charged at a flat rate and they're concerned about the quality of the work, at which point this inverse might prove true. When this project manager foolishly accused this concrete-cutting company of being \"too fast and unsafe\" in their work, the construction manager frustratedly declared that all members of his staff should adhere strictly to the safety protocol. This snail-like pace of work caused the time estimate of the project to spiral out of control, escalating from a $45,000 project to a $200,000 one, which saw the project manager losing his bonus from his own company while the construction manager walked away with a sizeable bonus himself and a windfall for the company.",

    "description": "If your boss is making you grind your teeth, you're in good company. The people of the internet joined together to share the reasons why their boss has been getting on their last nerves, and there are some crazy stories out there! Some people have bosses who just don't appreciate a single thing they do. The boss is so focused on meeting their goals or delivering a project to a client that they don't acknowledge all the hard work it takes to make that happen. It can be so frustrating to work a 60-hour week, only to have your boss chastise you over a typo or an unsent email. It's bad for morale, because who wants to work overtime if their work goes unnoticed? Other people shared that their bosses were too callous. Some bosses act like they were raised on a different planet or something. When someone's family member passes away, and an employee asks for time to plan a funeral or grieve, most decent humans will respect that. We'll all go through dark times in our lives, so it's only polite to handle this with grace. But some managers will just coldly insist their workers be in for their shift anyway. It's no wonder a lot of the people below ended up fleeing their jobs and heading off to a better on ASAP. Next, read about this person who had to tell a pushy family member that \"We don't need to be around each other 24/7\" after she invited herself on a vacation!",

    "description": "Cats are weird little creatures, to say the least. We can confidently guess that if you're a cat pawrent, you're nodding profusely in agreement with this statement. Cats can really get coo-coo at times, even if these times aren't the best suited for a coo-coo feline behavior. For example, cats tend to enter the zoomies mode in the middle of the night, zooming and speeding around the house while the hooman residents are sleeping deeply. Cats can also stare at a blank wall and hiss at it, just because. They push objects off of the counter just so they can witness their self-made destruction. Every cat has this crazy feral side.Since despite this cat craziness we're still crazy about cats, it only makes sense to celebrate cat coo-cooness by scrolling through a bunch of crazy cat memes. That's the correct way to embrace this cat coo-cooness and maybe join their zoomies session, or stare at a blank wall and hiss at it alongside them.",

    "description": "If there is one thing we wish for this meowliday season, it's for every adoptable cat to find their furrever home and a hooman to love them. Doesn't that sound like the purrfect Christmas miracle, feline fam? Imagine every kitty around the world roasting their cute little toe beans next to the fireplace, all warm and fuzzy, sleeping like babies for the rest of their days. It's bringing a tear to our eyes just thinking about it, and the tears will continue to flow with this tear-jerking story from a warm, loving cat mom who shared a series of uplifting pictures documenting her and her rescue kitten's journey together.They didn't have the smoothest start. She rescued the scared, shy kitten, and it took them some time to warm up to each other. But, with patience and a lot of love, they were able to get through some difficult times together. Now, they share a pillow every night, and it makes us smile from ear to ear simply scrolling through it. So, if you need a wholesome meowliday story to tell your kids, tell them this one (and maybe find a way to put Santa in there somewhow…he's magical, he can do anything!).",

    "description": "Robert was diagnosing a problem in a reporting module. The application code ran a fairly simple query- SELECT field1, field2, field3 FROM report_table- so he foolishly assumed that it would be easy to understand the problem. Of course, the \"table\" driving the report wasn't actually a table, it was a view in the database. Most of our readers are familiar with how views work, but for those who have had been corrupted by NoSQL databases: database views are great- take a query you run often, and create it as an object in the database: CREATE VIEW my_report AS SELECT t1.someField as someField, t2.someOtherField as someOtherField FROM table1 t1 INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.id = t2.id Now you can query SELECT * FROM my_report WHERE someField \u003e 5. Like I said: great! Well, usually great. Well, sometimes great. Well, like anything else, with great power comes great responsibility. Robert dug into the definition of the view, only to find that the tables it queried were themselves views. And those were in turn, also views. All in all, there were nineteen layers of nested views. The top level query he was trying to debug had no real relation to the underlying data, because 19 layers of abstraction had been injected between the report and the actual data. Even better- many of these nested views queried the same tables, so data was being split up and rejoined together in non-obvious and complex ways. The view that caused Robert to reach out to us was this: ALTER VIEW [LSFDR].[v_ControlDate] AS SELECT GETDATE() AS controlDate --GETDATE() - 7 AS controlDate This query is simply invoking a built-in function which returns today's date. Why not just call the function? We can see that once upon a time, it did offset the date by seven days, making the control date a week earlier. So I suppose there's some readability in mytable m INNER JOIN v_ControlDate cd ON m.transactionDate \u003e cd.controlDate, but that readability also hides the meaning of control date. That's the fundamental problem of abstraction. We lose details and meaning, and end up with 19 layers of stuff to puzzle through. A more proper solution may have been to actually implement this as a function, not a view- FROM mytable m WHERE m.transactionDate \u003e getControlDate(). At least here, it's clear that I'm invoking a function, instead of hiding it deep inside of a view called from a view called from a view. In any case, I'd argue that the actual code we're looking at isn't the true WTF. I don't like this view, and I wouldn't implement it this way, but it doesn't make me go \"WTF?\" The context the view exists in, on the other hand, absolutely does. 19 layers! Is this a database or a Russian Honey Cake? The report, of course, didn't have any requirements defining its data. Instead, the users had worked with the software team to gradually tweak the output over time until it gave them what they believed they wanted. This meant actually changing the views to be something comprehensible and maintainable wasn't a viable option- changes could break the report in surprising and non-obvious ways. So Robert was compelled to suffer through and make the minimally invasive changes required to fix the view and get the output looking like what the users wanted. The real WTF? The easiest fix was to create another view, and join it in. Problems compound themselves over time. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet.

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/magical-bytes",
    "description": "\"Magic bytes\" are a common part of a file header. The first few bytes of a file can often be used to identify what type of file it is. For example, a bitmap file starts with \"BM\", and a PGM file always starts with \"PN\" where \"N\" is a number between 1 and 6, describing the specific variant in use, and WAV files start with \"RIFF\". Many files have less human-readable magic bytes, like the ones Christer was working with. His team was working on software to manipulate a variety of different CAD file types. One thing this code needed to do is identify when the loaded file was a CAD file, but not the specific UFF file type they were looking for. In this case, they need to check that the file does not start with 0xabb0, 0xabb1, or 0xabb3. It was trivially easy to write up a validation check to ensure that the files had the correct magic bytes. And yet, there is no task so easy that someone can't fall flat on their face while doing it. This is how Christer's co-worker solved this problem: const uint16_t *id = (uint16_t*)data.GetBuffer(); if (*id == 0xabb0 || *id == 0xABB0 || *id == 0xabb1 || *id == 0xABB1 || *id == 0xabb3 || *id == 0xABB3) { return 0; } Here we have a case of someone who isn't clear on the difference between hexadecimal numbers and strings. Now, you (and the compiler) might think that 0xABB0 and 0xabb0 are, quite clearly, the same thing. But you don't understand the power of lowercase numbers. Here we have an entirely new numbering system where 0xABB0 and 0xabb0 are not equal, which also means 0xABB0 - 0xabb0 is non-zero. An entirely new field of mathematics lies before us, with new questions to be asked. If 0xABB0 \u003c 0xABB1, is 0xABB0 \u003c 0xabb1 also true? From this little code sample, we can't make any inferences, but these questions give us a rich field of useless mathematics to write papers about. The biggest question of all, is that we know how to write lowercase numbers for A-F, but how do we write a lowercase 3?
