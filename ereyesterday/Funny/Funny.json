    "description": "All big cats are amazing and meowgestic, but unfortunately, not every one of them gets the same start at life. Some are a little less lucky than others, but that doesn't mean that they cannot find their joy in life. And when things like that happen - when a big cat, for whatever reason, cannot be released back into the wild, it is up to us humans to make its life as good as it can be. For some big cats, it's just about making a friend - like this shy rescued cheetah cub who got paired up with a puppy or this rescued black panther who grew up with a Rottweiler. For others, it's about finding a new purpose - like this injured bobcat who became the best foster momma to other orphaned cubs. And for T'Challa, the bobcat we're going to be talking about today, who fell on its head as a kitten after a hawk grabbed it, finding joy in life just meant discovering that fennel is the best toy ever.",

And it's not just allergies (which have also been plaguing us nonstop since Spring decided it was time to release every single pollen into the air all at once), we have a pain in our feline-shaped hearts that just won't go away. So, naturally, we went to the doctor to get it checked out. You know what they said to us? The answer to our problems is purrfectly simple - and they purrscribed us 30 cat memes to make us feel better.You see, cat memes have this meowgic about them to cure the ailments of any feline-lover with just a few simple memes. We're not one to question doctors, so we went straight to the pharmacy (I Can Has Cheezburger) and filled ourselves with hissterical feline funnies, and guess what? We're feeling better already. So even if the Meownday blues got you down, don't worry, there are always cat memes to boost your mood and make sure you're feline fine. Enjoy!",

    "description": "Getting ghosted by an employer is the worst way to get 'fired,' but this ex-employee at the mall's ice rink wasn't about to let a managerial ghosting cut off his food supply. When you're fired, you have closure. Like a breakup, closure is critical to move on in your life, both emotionally and mentally. So if you're still under the impression that you're employed by a company, how are you supposed to print out your resume and campus the rest of the town for a new job? Managers utilize this tactic to keep good employees on the hook, absolving themselves of unemployment fees and saving themselves from the discomfort of actually firing someone. Alas, this college kid was too hungry to let the absence of a paycheck deter him from going to work, pillaging the break room fridge, and making management sorry they ever quiet-fired him.",

While you're only getting paid while on the clock on the job, you can cash in on overtime, pickup extra shifts for more dough, and count your skrilla at the end of each pay period. And, unlike a salary position, if you get loads of new work dumped on your plate, you'll likely get paid for it. However, the employer in this next story thought he could get away with a little daylight robbery against his employees, hoping for some free, at-home labor from his workforce. Well, Buddy, this ain't a salary position! You've messed with the hourly crew this time.",

Everything seemed to go well, at least until there was a network hiccup and the application couldn't connect to the database.

    "description": "Today we have a whole batch of category errors, picked out from the rash of submissions and a few that have been festering on the shelf. Just for fun, I threw in an ironic off-by-some meta-error. See if you can spot it. Adam R. \"I'm looking for hotel rooms for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. Most hotels haven't opened up reservations yet, except for ridiculously overprice hospitality packages. This search query found NaN facilities available, which equates to one very expensive apartment. I guess one is not a number now?\"   Intrepid traveler BJH had a tough time at the Intercontinental. I almost feel sympathy. Almost. \"I stare at nulls at home all the time so it made me feel comfortable to see them at the hotel when traveling. And what is that 'INTERCONTINENTAL W...' at the top? I may never know!\"   Hoping to find out, BJ clicked through the mystery menu and discovered... this. But even worse, \"There was no exit: Clicking Exit did nothing and neither did any of the buttons on the remote. Since I'd received more entertainment than usual from a hotel screen I just turned everything off.\"   Striking out for some streaming entertainment Dmitry NoLastName was silently stymied by this double-decker from Frontier.com.   No streaming needed for Barry M. who can get a full dose of fun from those legacy broadcast channels! Whatever did they do before null null undefined null? \"Hey, want to watch TV tonight? NaN.\"   Hah! \"That's MISTER Null, to you,\" declared an anonymous contributor.   And finally, another entirely different anonymous contributor clarified that there are apparently NaN cellphone towers in Switzerland. Personally, I'm intrigued by the existence of that one little crumb of English on an otherwise entirely German page.   [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
