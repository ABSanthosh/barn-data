    "description": "When you're in your teens and early 20s, your partner's little siblings are either the most annoying or coolest kids you know. Some of us probably even ended up like them more than our boyfriend or girlfriend, after the inevitable breakup. But no matter how much you like them or get along with them, there is going to come a point where they've been a tag-along one too many times, and you find yourself wishing that they could find something else to do so that you could spend some time with your spouse without them around.Still, it's kind of hard to tell your boyfriend's younger 15-year-old sister to get lost when she part-owns the house that you're trying to move into with your boyfriend. At that point, there are other considerations in play that you need to be mindful of. Sure, your boyfriend might be her guardian, but as such, you wouldn't be trying to kick any other minor who your spouse was responsible for out of their own home and should probably be approaching things with a more mentoring and caring mindset.That's the situation that this 15-year-old girl, who lives with her 25-year-old brother in the house that their late father left them, found herself in when she came into conflict with her brother's girlfriend, who seemed to be looking for ways to get her out of the house and out of the way. And we're not talking for the evening so that the pair could have a night together without the little sibling around, we're talking for good.It started with vague insinuations about how the 15-year-old should begin attending a boarding school before moving on to a university in a different city, clearly trying to clear the way so that she could move in. Frustrated, the teen shared her story with this online community wondering what she should be doing.",

    "description": "When a grown man finds himself stepping up to defend his mother-in-law from a neighbor, you know someone out there has really broken the unspoken code of city living. After all, few situations demand such drastic measures unless a stranger's behavior has gone so far off the rails that even familial peacemaking instincts kick into high gear. In the urban jungle, this isn't your everyday parking squabble or polite neighborly disagreement. No, it takes a special kind of alleyway outlaw, a man who parks in front of someone else's garage, cracks open a drink, and acts like the rules only apply to lesser mortals, to inspire that level of united household action.Urban areas are a fertile ground for these small-stakes tyrants, the folks whose sense of entitlement expands to fill any space not already occupied by decency. They treat every curb as a personal invitation, every \"No Parking\" sign as a challenge, and every polite request as an insult to their self-appointed authority. The real spectacle starts not when rules are broken, but when they're caught. Suddenly, there's a performance of outrage, an outpouring of self-pity, and an exit of a movie villain escaping into the night.So, when this pint-sized parking warlord ended up fielding calls from every entry-level job in the city, it wasn't just personal revenge. It was poetic proof that, in the end, the smallest acts of urban defiance can be met with the most satisfying forms of creative justice.",

    "description": "To us, as people who love big cats so, so much, it's hard to ever imagine someone treating them badly. Lion cubs are so adorable and precious. They may grow up to be fierce, meowjestic and powerful, but as cubs, lions are vulnerable and need help. In fact, we don't know if there is anything more vulnerable than a solitary lion cub. And unfortunately, there are some people out there who use that fact for their own gain. This sweet lion cub was being passed around between human to human, as they tried to sell it while hiding it from authorities. There was no care to the lion cub's well-being whatsoever. It was lucky that the cub was rescued as early as it was - before the damage done to it was irreversible. Being rescued gave the cub a second chance at an actual life, and he took that chance with all four of his paws and is living an absolutely fabulous life in a sanctuary in Africa right now.   Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content.

    "description": "Howdy, feline friends and family. We got visited by the CDS today! We woke up early this morning to hear some meowing coming from outside our house. We thought one of our cats snuck out and couldn't get back in, so we rushed out of bed to check. To our surprise, we found a purrfectly awwdorable kitten crying outside the window, with a unique fur pattern. It was white with black stripes - like one of those white tigers you see in the zoos. It was incredible!We waited around for momma cat, but she never came back, so we took the kitty inside and started caring for him. One of our friends had been wanting to adopt a kitten for a long time, so she came over and took this beauty home. The kitten was so striking, however, we couldn't help but wonder what other rare-looking cats were out there in the world - so we did some searching and found these 21 fabulous felines that are purrfectly one-of-a-kind. Meowrvel at their beauty and have a great day!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Eddie's company hired a Highly Paid Consultant to help them retool their systems for a major upgrade. Of course, the HPC needed more and more time, and the project ran later and later and ended up wildly over budget, so the HPC had to be released, and Eddie inherited the code. What followed was a massive crunch to try and hit absolutely hard delivery dates. Management didn't want their team \"rewriting\" the expensive code they'd already paid for, they just wanted \"quick fixes\" to get it live. Obviously, the HPC's code must be better than theirs, right? After release, a problem appeared in one of their sales related reports. The point-of-sale report was meant to deliver a report about which items were available at any given retail outlet, in addition to sales figures. Because their business dealt in a high volume of seasonal items, every quarter the list of items was expected to change regularly. The users weren't seeing the new items appear in the report. This didn't make very much sense- it was a report. The data was in the database. The report was driven by a view, also in the database, which clearly was returning the correct values? So the bug must be in the code which generated the report… If POSItemDesc = \"Large Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Large Sign\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"Small Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Small Sign\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"2x2 Hanging Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"2x2 Hanging Sign\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"1x1 Sign\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"1x1 Sign\" End If '.........Snipping more of these........ If POSItemDesc = \"Light Thief\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Light Thief\" End If If POSItemDesc = \"Door Strike\" Then grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"FColumn12\").Header.Caption = \"Door Strike\" End If First, it's worth noting that inside of the results grid display item, the HPC named the field FColumn12, which is such a wonderfully self documenting name, I'm surprised we aren't all using that everywhere. But the more obvious problem is that the list of possible items is hard-coded into the report; items which don't fit one of these if statements don't get displayed. At no point, did the person writing this see the pattern of \"I check if a field equals a string, and then set another field equal to that string,\" and say, \"maybe there's a better way?\" At no point, in the testing process, did anyone try this report with a new item? It was easy enough for Eddie to change the name of the column in the results grid, and replace all this code with a simpler: grdResults.Columns.FromKey(\"POSItem\").Header.Caption = POSItemDesc, which also had the benefit of actually working, but we're all left puzzling over why this happened in the first place. It's not like the HPC was getting paid per line of code. Right? Right? Of course not- no HPC would willingly be paid based on any metric that has an objective standard, even if the metric is dumb.

    "description": "... London! This week, we're showcasing some multiple submissions from two regular participants who fell into the theme. Everybody else is just going to have to wait for their turn next week. Frist up it's Daniel D. \"I wanted to see events for the dates I would be in London. Is Skiddle (the website in question) telling me I should come to London more often?\" They're certainly being very generous with their interpretation of dates.   But wait, there's more! Daniel follows with a variation: \"Skiddle here again - let's choose June 7th to June 14th, but Skiddle knows better and sets the dates to June 6th to June 13th.\"   \"I was not aware the Berlin to London route passes through Hawaii (which is Mokulele'shome turf)\" chuckles our old friend Michael R. He seems to believe it's an Error'd but I think the real WTF is simply the Byzantine tapestry of partnerships, resellers, rebranding, whitelabeling and masquerades in the air transport biz.   \"Maybe it's just a Monday morning thing,\" he reports from the airport.   But Monday had everybody troubled, and Michael was already thinking of Friday. \"I am so sure I took the Circle Line just last Friday. And the other lines have the option Monday-Friday/Saturday/Sunday.\" I hope there isn't a subtext here.   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet.
