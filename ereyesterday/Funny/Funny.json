Where else can one experience the sublime privilege of paying a mortgage just to become an unpaid zookeeper, conflict mediator, and amateur OSHA inspector? Neighbors – those delightful humans who gift us with their domestic symphonies of screaming matches at 2 AM, avant-garde landscaping built from tires stacked like modern art, and innovative security forces manned by unleashed canines with Napoleon complexes.Homeownership comes with an unexpected education in neighborly diplomacy but these new homeowners got involuntary training in the Canine Peacekeeping Corp. as their morning now started with a soundtrack of high-decibel yapping, with the dogs rehearsing a heavy metal cover of Who Let the Dogs Out?. The sidewalk becomes a daily ordeal. Is that growl a warning? A greeting? A critique of their choice of compost? Enter the Chihuahua Cartel. The neighbors' two pint-sized ambassadors operate like furry anarchists, treating property lines as abstract art and flower beds as their personal demolition derby. These tiny, trembling despots – weighing less than a laptop but armed with the audacity of war criminals have turned an entire block into their personal fiefdom.",

The job market in the last few years has stolen a sliver of all of our hearts because of how daunting and draining the process is. Oh, you went to college? Well, you don't have six years of experience for this entry-level role, get lost! Oh, you want to be paid a liveable wage? Too bad—we have another desperate prospective employee who would do the job for half the pay. Don't get me started on interviewer-hazing tactics… It's like some companies get off on the fear they instill into capable, skillful, and hardworking individuals.Even when the resume, the education, and the work experience check out, you still gotta be wary of the company that decides to hire you. Though a job is a job and you probably need some way to pay the bills, you have to also think about your mental and if you'll want to quit after your first week. You might see these red flags in the interview, but it's something to continuously be aware of… If you're on the job hunt and need a little pick-me-up after a long day on Indeed and LinkedIn, scroll below. Nothing does the trick like laughing at our pain.",

    "description": "Hey there, cat lovers and feline enthusiasts! Today, we are taking a journey through the whimsical world of the liquid-to-solid spectrum, with extra emphasis on the feline experience. Cats are amazingly able to defy the laws of physics and transform into puddles—or whatever shape they need to take to get from point A to point B—blurring the boundaries of feline physics with their liquid-solid spectrum antics. We've got to give it up for cats. Their flexibility is simply inspiring. We humans struggle to merely bend over to tie our shoes.One such liquid feline has mastered the art of sneaking into his neighbor's house. Well, it's not so much \"sneaking\" because he does it with no shame at all, in broad daylight. Because he does not give a hoot about what his neighbor thinks about these guest appearances, as far as the cat is concerned, he is the true owner of his neighbor's house. The neighbor should really be thanking Mr. Liquid Cat for allowing him to continue residing in Mr. Cat's part-time home. Read on for all the details!",

    "description": "We have a confession to make, feline fam…we finally went and adopted a Maine Coon cat. We have wanted one all of our lives, and we finally did it. There is just something so meowgical about these majestic fluffy felines. They are more like living room lions than they are cats, but snuggly ones. We have definitely seen some noticeable differences between this awwdorable Maine Coon kitten and our previous kittens, like fur example, this kitten is very active. Like, hyperactive. He always wants to play…all the time.Since we've got Maine Coons on our mind, we thought it would be nice to collect a stunning series of marvelously meowjestic and regal Maine Coon cats, but in their giant kitten form. Yes, they are even large as kittens. He barely fits in two hands…and he's only a few months old! Scroll down to see these purrfect pictures of pawdorable cats, you know you can't resist floofy kittens. At least, we can't!",

I think there's too much texture, too much detail for a single person and I am prepared to sign up for either side of the dyad.

    "description": "I'm a JSON curmudgeon, in that I think that its type-system, inherited from JavaScript, is bad. It's a limited vocabulary of types, and it forces developers to play odd games of convention. For example, because it lacks any sort of date type, you either have to explode your date out as a sub-dictionary (arguably, the \"right\" approach) or do what most people do- use an ISO formatted string as your date. The latter version requires you to attempt to parse the sting to validate the data, but validating JSON is a whole thing anyway. But, enough about me being old and cranky. Do you know one type JSON supports? Boolean values. Which is why this specification from today's anonymous submitter annoys me so much: field: sw_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: data_auto_update type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ field: spanning_tree_protocol type: string valid values: /(on)|(off)/ Their custom validator absolutely requires the use of strings, and absolutely requires that they have these values. Sending a boolean, or worse, the string \"true\" causes the request to get rejected. Our submitter doesn't explain why it's this way, but I have a strong suspicion that it's because it was originally designed to support a form submission with radio buttons. The form is long gone, but the API contract remains. [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
