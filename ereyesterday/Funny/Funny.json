    "description": "Some employees are lucky enough to work for companies that offer generous reimbursement policies, including lunch stipends, mileage reimbursements, and even perks like work-from-home equipment or home office spending allowances. Honestly, that sounds like a dream. Meanwhile, plenty of people are stuck fronting the bill for things that should be covered, like driving across town for a meeting or buying basic office supplies when the company printer runs dry.But then there's the other extreme: employees who take advantage of every loophole, expensing things like artisanal water or a $15 \"client meeting\" that's suspiciously just brunch with their roommate. Reimbursement policies can be a blessing or a curse, depending on how petty people are willing to get, which brings us to today's story.",

    "description": "Anyone who has worked in a customer-facing role has had to learn how to navigate working with a difficult personality. According to this drive-thru employee, Susan was no exception. She was the kind of entitled customer who liked to throw tantrums if someone got her order wrong or even made the slightest, negligible error. However, this employee managed to be one of the chosen few to get in her good graces. This made for an easier experience for everyone on staff whenever she came by to order, but it also paid off for the employee down the road when he was struggling to stand up to the new general manager of the location. This newbie, Jack, had a habit of enforcing pointless policies just so that he could flex his muscles and reinforce his authority. For instance, he once pulled the whole staff aside during a shift to inform them that they weren't smiling enough. You know, that kind of guy. But what happens when these kinds of managers have to deal with those kinds of entitled customers?",

So put your head back and let the eepies wash over you. Or, alternatively, you can challenge yourself to try to stay awake until the end of the gallery…",

    "description": "Nina's team has a new developer on the team. They're not a junior developer, though Nina wishes they could replace this developer with a junior. Inexperience is better than whatever this Java code is. Object[] test = (Object[]) options; List schedulePlatformList = (List)((Object[])options)[0]; List visibleTableCols = (List)((Object[])options)[1]; We start by casting options into an array of Objects. That's already a code stench, but we actually don't even use the test variable and instead just redo the cast multiple times. But worse than that, we cast to an array of object, access an element, and then cast that element to a collection type. I do not know what is in the options variable, but based on how it gets used, I don't like it. What it seems to be is a class (holding different options as fields) rendered as an array (holding different options as elements). The new developer (ab)uses this pattern everywhere.
