    "description": "This bride took to social media to address something that happened at her wedding, but she then quickly deleted the post. That's because she never addressed her family members about the issue in person! Awkward… What did she think was going to happen? Did she think they'd read the post, scoff at it, and then go on their way? Hardly, as you can read about in u/throwrathefinances's story below. As this woman shares, she and her daughter were a big part of her cousin Dana's wedding ceremony. Her daughter, at the young age of 16, was asked to perform a dance at the ceremony. While wearing all white is typically frowned upon at weddings, the bride dressed the dancer up in all white and approved her dance. But when the big day came, things didn't quite go as the bride expected. She seems to think that her family member took away the spotlight from her. But who was shining the spotlight? If the bride really wanted all eyes on her for 100% of the night, she probably shouldn't have arranged a dance performance in the first place. She then handled it poorly by posting about it online… Check out the full story, plus updates, below to see if you side with the bride or the dancer. Next, read about the way this traveler outsmarted an airport security worker to get their luggage onto the plane.",

    "description": "Difficult people often find themselves dealing with difficult consequences. At the end of the day, they have no one to blame but themselves for being, well, difficult.Here, we have an entitled Karen customer who didn't like the fact that the bank's printing machine smudged two numbers on her new debit card (this did not affect whether or not the card worked). Now, if this happened once and the customer politely requested to have it reprinted, that would have been fine. However, this lady could not be satisfied. She ended up forcing the bank teller to reprint her card eight times. What she did not realize is that there was a fee each time the card needed to be reprinted, and if she looked carefully at the form she signed each time, she would have known that. Let's just say that she was not too happy when she saw that she now owed over $100 in fees because of this inconvenience.For more stories like this, take a look at this post about a teacher who got even with a misbehaving student.",

From turkey sandwiches to cold mac \u0026 cheese (don't come for us, you probably also have some weird thing that you like that no one else understands), we love basking in the fullness of the refrigerator without having to get out a single pot or pan. But, there is one ingredient missing from these tasty turkey leftovers that we feel it is our duty to supply you with: cat memes.These post-thanksgiving memes pair purrfectly with your food coma after enjoying all the leftovers your fridge has to offer. They are best enjoyed horizontally, in stretchy pants, and with a Christmas movie on in the background. You don't have to have these things to enjoy these feast-filled feline funnies, just like you don't have to eat your mac \u0026 cheese cold, but it's just a purrsonal preference. Anyway, we hope you're relishing in your post-meowliday mewd and have a great week!",

    "description": "Cats make everything better. Every cat owner knows that. They make every moment of life more exciting and amazing. Some people would think that cats stealing food off our plates right under our noses, or cats yelling at closed doors every time we go to the bathroom, or cats sitting directly on our puzzles without any care or concern for the pieces they're obscuring… is inconvenient. But we, cat owners, see it for what it is. Entertainment. We know that life would be so much more boring without them. And so, since cats make everything so much better, it only makes sense that if you're trying to sell a second-hand item, you would… sneak your cat into the photo. Hey, you may think it's silly, but after looking at there ads, we've come to the conclusion that we're pretty sure that this would work on us. The cats are pretty much guaranteed to distract us from anything that might be wrong with whatever is being sold in there.",

    "description": "People have been saying they were gonna leave Twitter for a super long time, in the same way they often claim they're going to move to Canada, and with roughly the same level of success. I'm not trying to say they're dumb liars; full synchronicity with our personal ethics requires a nearly cosmic level of effort, and in my experience always comes with painful sacrifice, which is why most people are content merely to describe this wicked gulf in others. But it actually seems to be happening, this time. There is a sundering of sorts, the kind of thing you would read in the Silmarillion. At least, I think. I've never read it. But it's still true: BlueSky and Threads are now functional, catalyzed venues for discourse with varying levels or intentions to Federate. Federation is sort of a sophisticated concept to explain, but it might be reasonable here to say that it is an orthogonal philosophy to the Internet as it works now. Another way of saying it: Federation has ideas in common with the Internet that was stolen from us.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/layered-like-spaghetti",
    "description": "\"We use a three tier architecture,\" said the tech lead on Cristian's new team. \"It helps us keep concerns separated.\" This statement, as it turned out, was half true. They did divide the application into three tiers- a \"database layer\", a \"business layer\", and a \"presentation layer\". The \"database layer\" was a bunch of Java classes. The \"business layer\" was a collection of Servlets. And the \"presentation layer\" was a pile of JSP files. What they didn't do, however, was keep the concerns separated. Here's some code from their database layer: public synchronized StringBuffer getStocTotGest(String den, String gest) { StringBuffer sb = new StringBuffer(\"\" + \"\" + \"\" + \"\" + \"\" + \"\"); try { ResultSetrs= connectionManager .executeQuery(\"select (if(length(SUBSTRING(den,1,instr(den,'(')-1))\u003e0,SUBSTRING(den,1,instr(den,'(')-1),den)) as den,um,pret_vinz,sum(stoc) as stoc from stmarfzi_poli where den like '\" + den + \"%' \" + gest + \" group by den order by den\"); while (rs.next()) { sb.append(\"\"); sb.append(\"\"); sb.append(\"\"); } sb.append(\"DenumireCantPretVanz \" + rs.getString(\"den\") + \"\" + threeDecimalPlacesFormat.format(rs.getDouble(\"stoc\")) + \" \" + rs.getString(\"um\") + \"\" + teoDecimalPlacesFormat.format(rs.getDouble(\"pret_vinz\")) + \"\"); } catch (Exception ex) { ex.printStackTrace(); } return sb; } I guess a sufficiently motivated programmer can write PHP in any language. This just has a little bit of everything in it, doesn't it? There's the string-munged HTML generation in the database layer. The HTML is also wrong, as header fields are output with td tags, instead of th. There's the SQL injection vulnerability. There's the more-or-less useless exception handler. It's synchronized even though it's not doing anything thread unsafe. It's truly a thing of beauty, at least if you don't know what beauty is and think it means something horrible. This function was used in a few places. It was called from a few servlets in the \"business layer\", where the resulting StringBuffer was dumped into a session variable so that JSP files could access it. At least, that was for the JSP files which didn't invoke the function themselves- JSP files which mixed all the various layers together. Cristian's first task in the code base was changing the background colors of all of the rendered table headers. Since, as you can see, they weren't using CSS to make this easy, that involved searching through the entire codebase, in every layer, to find all the places where maybe a table was generated. Changing those colors was Cristian's first task in the code base. I assume that Cristian is still working on that, and will be working on that for some time to come.

    "description": "Alexandra inherited a codebase that, if we're being kind, could be called \"verbose\". Individual functions routinely cross into multiple thousands of lines, with the longest single function hitting 4,000 lines of code. Very little of this is because the problems being solved are complicated, and much more of it is because people don't understand how anything works. For example, in this C++ code, they have a vector of strings. The goal is to create a map where the keys are the strings from the vector, and the values are more strings, derived from a function call. Essentially, what they wanted was: for (std::string val : invec) { umap[val] = lookupValue(val); } This would have been the sane, obvious way to do things. That's not what they did. unordered_map func(vector invec) { unordered_map umap; vector idxvec; for(string name : invec) { umap[name] = \"\"; idxvec.push_back(make_pair(name, \u0026umap[name])); } for(auto thingy : idxvec) { //actual work, including assigning the string thingy.get\u003c1\u003e() = lookupValue(thingy.get\u003c0\u003e()); } return umap; } I won't pick on names here, as they're clearly anonymized. But let's take a look at the approach they used. They create their map, and then create a new vector- a vector which is a pair- a string and a pointer to a string. Already, I'm confused by why any of this is happening, but let's press on and hope it becomes clear. We iterate across our input vector, which this I get. Then we create a key in the map and give it an empty string as a value. Then we create a pair out of our key and our pointer to that empty string. That's how we populate our idxvec vector. Once we've looped across all the values once, we do it again. This time, we pull out those pairs, and set the value at the pointer equal to the string returned by lookup value. Which leads us all to our favorite letter of the alphabet: WHY? I don't know. I also am hesitant to comment to much on the memory management and ownership issues here, as with the anonymization, there may be some reference management that got lost. But the fact that we're using bare pointers certainly makes this code more fraught than it needed to be. And, given how complex the STL data structures can be, I think we can also agree that passing around bare pointers to memory inside those structures is a recipe for disaster, even in simple cases like this. What I really enjoy is that they create a vector of pairs, without ever seeming to understand that a list of pairs is essentially what a map is. In conclusion: can we at least agree that, from now on, we won't iterate across the same values twice? I think about 15% of WTFs would go away if we all followed that rule. Oh, wait, no. People who could understand rules like that aren't the ones writing this kind of code. Forget I said anything.
