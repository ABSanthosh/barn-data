    "description": "You know how everything feels kind of crazy right now? Every day something new, every hour another piece of news to keep up with. We miss the old days. We miss that time when we could just log off for a couple of hours, laugh at funny cat memes, and know that the world would not blow up in the background. We miss when things felt simpler, when taking a break actually felt resting. We miss it, and although we know that we cannot change the world around us, we can still enjoy some silly cat memes first thing in the morning. So, that is what we have for you here - a bunch of classic, nostalgic, hissterical cat memes for you to start the morning with. Social media will wait, the news will wait. What matters right meow is your mental health and wellbeing, and you are about to do something about it to improve it. Have a purrfect day, y'all, and remember - even when things feel a little too crazy, cat memes will always be there for you.",

    "description": "It amazes us how still, despite of all of the information that is out there, despite of all the stories that we hear, some people are still surprised when they get adopted by a cat. It's as if we have not been telling you for years that yes, it's cats who adopt the humans and not the other way around. When you walk into a shelter, you may think that you will adopt a certain cat or kitten, but it is not actually your choice. You are walking in there to be vetted, and it is you who will be the lucky one if you walk out of there with a cat. That's not all people though. Some people have been paying attention. Some people know that when they get adopted by a fluffy feline, there is no point in arguing with it. They understand that one way or another, that feline will make their way into their home. So, really, it's better to just cave. It's either you take your new cat or your new cat will fine a way into your home on their own.",

    "description": "Life is a series of calculated risks—of varying levels of calculation. Some things you'll deliberate over for months, carefully coming to the answer and risk level that is best for you. Others will be hair-brained spur of the moment without any thought at all, sometimes to grave consequence. Owning a business is a bit like that, and that's not to say that owning a business is necessarily like life itself. (Though talking to some business owners would have you believing so.)No one wants to take any risks they don't have to, especially when money is directly involved and promising your employees more compensation feels like a risk to a lot of employers, who naturally can't help but wonder why pay more for something that you're already paying for?However, they fail to account for the risk that they'll lose that worker altogether—or they do account for it, but in their hubris, they can never imagine it actually happening. Still, they'd much rather see that their \"investment\" is going to pay off and that promoting staff or simply giving them a raise will somehow result in a greater return for them.",

    "description": "How do you react when your spouse tells you to \"quit being so dramatic\"? For many people, being told that phrase immediately sets them off. But this person actually is being rather dramatic, for rather confusing reasons, over an office Valentine's Day party. Some offices celebrate every holiday with snacks or games, while other workplaces choose not to focus on holidays. It can be a nice break for the employees to snack on cupcakes or win a little prize. Everyone knows it's just a little break to have fun for like 15 minutes before heading back to your laptop to write emails. This person is pushing back against their office's planned Valentine's Day festivities, and her reasoning is that the holiday is meant for couples only. That's basically her only reason for not wanting to celebrate: she thinks that \"Valentine's Day is for couples… not coworkers to express their affection.\" But she also mentions that all of her colleagues are married, so… what's even the problem? It's not like some pink cupcakes are going to spark a torrid office romance, it's just good innocent fun. Commenters told her as much, but she didn't want to hear it. In her mind, they don't \"comprehend the concept of Valentine's Day.\" Okay, whatever you say! After that, some experienced travelers shared their biggest red flags while they're at hotels, like one person who wrote that 'When it's advertised as \"family friendly,\" that means noise.'",

Well, that's ominous. Let's look at the code. public static SqsClient create() { try { SqsClient sqsClient = SqsClient.builder() ... .build(); return sqsClient; } catch (Exception e) { log.error(\"SQS - exception creating sqs client\", e); } finally { // Uncomment this to test the sqs in a test environment // return SqsClient.builder(). ... .build(); return null; } } Eric found this when he discovered that the application wasn't sending messages to their queue. According to the logs, there were messages to send, they just weren't being sent. Eric made the mistake of looking for log messages around sending messages, when instead he should have been looking at module startup, where the error message above appeared. This code attempts to create a connection, and if it fails for any reason, it logs an error and returns null. With a delightful \"comment this out\" for running in the test environment, which, please, god no. Don't do configuration management by commenting out lines of code. Honestly, that's the worst thing in this code, to me. In any case, the calling code \"properly\" handled nulls by just disabling sending to the queue silently, which made this harder to debug than it needed to be. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.

Chris's predecessor decided to tackle the second one, mostly by accurately(?) naming a class: class SimpleCache { } This is, in fact, the simplest cache class I can imagine. Arguably, it's a bit too simple. Instances of this class abound in code, though no one is entirely sure why. Future optimization? Just no one understanding what they're doing?
