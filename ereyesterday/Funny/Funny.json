    "description": "Any employee preparing for a bump-up on the corporate hierarchy knows that a promotion isn't a promotion unless you have the supplemental compensation to prove it. Sure, a new title to slap on the ol' resume and more responsibilities to fill your time during the workday is nice, but you don't want to be doing any extra work if you're not seeing an appropriate payout along with that. Your labor is not free… Any boss that tries to convince you otherwise is just trying to save that money for their own pockets and actively engaging in toxic workplace practices.In this next story, an employee is left humiliated after their boss \"promotes\" them to a new title with more responsibilities but fails to give them a compensation raise or new benefits. Hey, that new job title is going to come in handy when they're back on the job hunt for a boss who won't take their time and effort for granted. Scroll to read.",

    "description": "Growing up, it felt like parents were always making you do things you didn't want to do. Violin lessons, even though the sound of the bow on the strings made your skin crawl. Dinner at the family friend's house where the kid you had to hang out with was a glue eater. Contact sports when you have chronic shin splints. Sometimes, it felt like they were torturing you on purpose, all behind the guise of 'building character.' And in the times when you tried to speak up and tell them that you gave it your best shot but this activity wasn't for you, it always fell on deaf ears. It felt unfair, unethical, and unreasonable. Reaching adulthood makes you realize that some of the things your parents made you do actually did help 'build some character.' Maybe the violin is your favorite instrument to listen to now, or that sport you used to hate is fun to play with a group of buddies. Other times, you realize that they really weren't listening to you, and you vow never to do the same thing to your kid. One man is face to face with that issue when his wife keeps forcing their son to play squash when he clearly hates it. Read on to see how he deals with it.",

    "description": "All cat pawrents know it's sometimes weird to have a cat. Not the actual having-a-cat thing, because everyone should have a cat in our opinion, but it brings with it a lot of weirdness that doesn't exist in the lives of other people who are not cat pawrents. For example, we all meow to our cats like we're fluent in their language, even if we're not. And for instance, we might find ourselves replacing expensive cat food, that's supposed to be a delicious treat, because our cat decided it's not fancy enough for them. Just the weird occurrences of having a cat.If we're honest, it really is weird having a cat sometimes. But at least all of us cat pawrents understand each other. That's why we gathered all these relatable cat memes that are brutally honest - because we all need to feel understood about our pawrenting. We all want to know we're not the only ones who meow more than our cat. We all want to know we're not the only ones who need to replace the not-fancy-enough feast for our cat.",

Thankfully, we don't have to face that scenario (yet) because of all of the ameowzing people that put cats before themselves and go out of their way to help floofy felines survive in this hooman world. There always seems to be someone to pick up the pieces where one purrson drops them, and for that, we are purrfectly grateful.One of the things we least understand is people who don't take their pets with them when they move. We know it's hard to move with pets, our cats did not like when we moved to a new apartment, but eventually, they got over it. But leaving them behind was never an option. And yet, some people do it! After one family moved out and left their sassy black cat behind, a kind neighbor stepped up and rescued the wholesome house panther. See more below!",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/an-argument-with-qa",
    "description": "Markus does QA, and this means writing automated tests which wrap around the code written by developers. Mostly this is a \"black box\" situation, where Markus doesn't look at the code, and instead goes by the interface and the requirements. Sometimes, though, he does look at the code, and wishes he hadn't. Today's snippet comes from a program which is meant to generate PDF files and then, optionally, email them. There are a few methods we're going to look at, because they invested a surprising amount of code into doing this the wrong way. protected override void Execute() { int sendMail = this.VerifyParameterValue(ParamSendMail); if (sendMail == -1) return; if (sendMail == 1) mail = true; this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textGetCustomerForAccountStatement); IList customers = AccountStatement.GetCustomersForAccountStatement(); if (customers.Count == 0) return; StreamWriter streamWriter = null; if (mail) streamWriter = AccountStatement.CreateAccountStatementLogFile(); CreateAccountStatementDocumentEngine engine = new CreateAccountStatementDocumentEngine(); foreach (CustomerModel customer in customers) { this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textCustomerAccountStatementBegin + customer.DisplayName.ToString()); // Generate the PDF, optionally send an email with the document attached engine.Execute(customer, mail); if (mail) { AccountStatement.WriteToLogFile(customer, streamWriter); this.TraceOutput(Properties.Resources.textLogWriting); } } engine.Dispose(); if (streamWriter != null) streamWriter.Close(); } Now, this might sound unfair, but right off the bat I'm going to complain about separation of concerns. This function both generates output and emails it (optionally), while handling all of the stream management. Honestly, I think if the developer were simply forced to go back and make this a set of small, cohesive methods, most of the WTFs would vanish. But there's more to say here. Specifically, let's look at the first few lines, where we VerifyParameterValue. Note that this function clearly returns -1 when it fails, which is a very C-programmer-forced-to-do-OO idiom. But let's look at that method. private int VerifyParameterValue(string name) { string stringValue = this.GetParam(name, string.Empty); bool isValid = this.VerifyByParameterFormat(name, stringValue); if (!isValid) return -1; int value = -1; try { value = Convert.ToInt32(stringValue); } catch (Exception e) { this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", e.Message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return -1; } return value; } We'll come back to the VerifyByParameterFormat but otherwise, this is basically a wrapper around Convert.ToInt32, and could easily be replaced with Int32.TryParse. Bonus points for spamming the log output with loads of newlines. Okay, but what is the VerifyByParameterFormat doing? private bool VerifyByParameterFormat(string name, string value) { string parameter = string.Empty; string message = string.Empty; if (value.Length != 1) { parameter = Properties.Resources.textSendMail; message = string.Format(Properties.Resources.textSendMailNotValid, value); this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return false; } string numbers = \"0123456789\"; char[] characters = value.ToCharArray(); for (byte i = 0; i \u003c characters.Length; i++) { if (numbers.IndexOf(characters[i]) \u003c 0) { parameter = Properties.Resources.textSendMail; message = Properties.Resources.textSendMailNotValid; this.TraceOutput(string.Concat(\"\\n\\n\\n\", message, \"\\n\\n\\n\")); return false; } } return true; } Oh, it just goes character by character to verify whether or not this is made up of only digits. Which, by the way, means the CLI argument needs to be an integer, and only when that integer is 1 do we send emails. It's a boolean, but worse. Let's assume, however, that passing numbers is required by the specification. Still, Markus has thoughts: Handling this command line argument might seem obvious enough. I'd probably do something along the lines of \"if (arg == \"1\") { sendMail = true } else if (arg != \"0\") { tell the user they're an idiot }. Of course, I'm not a professional programmer, so my solution is way too simple as the attached piece of code will show you. There are better ways to do it, Markus, but as you've shown us, there are definitely worse ways. .comment { border: none; } [Advertisement] Plan Your .NET 9 Migration with ConfidenceYour journey to .NET 9 is more than just one decision.Avoid migration migraines with the advice in this free guide.
