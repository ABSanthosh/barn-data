  "text": "In the Boucle Bungalow, designed by Roman Rykhlov, calm curves, plush textures, and earthy hues come together. This isn’t just another neutral-toned apartment. It’s a sculptural sanctuary designed to soothe the senses… one boucle-covered surface at a time. From cloud-like seating to low-slung wood furniture and moody lighting, every inch of this space balances softness with structure. The heart of the Boucle Bungalow is its sculptural living room: a space that feels like a quiet embrace. It is anchored by a textured boucle sofa and a chunky armchair, so the space exudes softness. The palette stays within the warm, neutral family. Think oatmeal, sand, and creamy latte. These come together to create a tonal cocoon that soothes. The low, jet-black coffee tables introduce contrast, their sharp lines playing off the room’s plush curves. Natural light floods through framed windows, softened by full-length drapes in a muted taupe. Every detail is deliberate, from the oversized paper lantern casting a gentle glow overhead to the minimal ceramics and tactile woven rug underfoot. Step through the tall double doors and into a bedroom that feels like a deep exhale. The Boucle Bungalow’s sleeping space carries the same serene palette as the rest of the home, muted taupes, soft greys, and natural wood tones, but with an even quieter energy. A low-profile platform bed in oak anchors the room, topped with relaxed linen bedding and cloud-like cushions. Above the bed, a patchwork-style textile artwork adds a whisper of color and texture (but without breaking the calm). Flanking the bed are sleek, barely-there black reading lights that blend seamlessly into the wall, emphasizing function without fuss. Long, tailored curtains frame the tall window, softening the incoming light and amplifying the sense of cocoon-like comfort. With minimal decor, no clutter, and a focus on form and feel, this bedroom proves that true luxury lies in simplicity.",
