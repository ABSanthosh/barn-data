I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!: Here's the most important tip! I think you'll be surprised at what's killing your houseplants... I know many think the more water the better, but if you're plants are struggling, you're probably watering them way too much. People are always shocked when I tell them I only water my fiddles every two to three weeks...sometimes longer! And each time I don't give them as much as you'd think. My largest plants get two cups of water at the most: Obviously smaller plants get much less.  If you're having problems keeping your plants alive, I'd be willing to bet the amount of water you're giving them is the culprit. I know it goes against what we feel is right -- it just feels good to water them often, right?  But overall indoor plants will do much better when you either wait longer between waterings, or water much less once a week. Your houseplants will thank you!:  Once I learned how little the fiddles needed, I started putting all of our plants on the same watering schedule and guess what? They THRIVED.  It really hasn't mattered what plant it is...they've ALL done much better with way less water:  The only plant I've found that needs to be watered more than every two to three weeks is the fern. I find them to be finicky, but overall even with those I water less than I used to.  Pretty earth-shattering, eh? I think most plants do much better when you ignore them a little bit. Of course they like to be talked to once in a while. ;) I think we tend to care for them too much and that's the biggest reason many fail at growing healthy houseplants.  Do you have any great plant growing tips you've found helpful? Do you water your plants a lot or a little?  Pin this image to save this info for later! If you love the fiddle leaf plant, be sure to check out this post with bunch of fiddle leaf care tips:",
