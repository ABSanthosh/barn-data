  "text": "Architects Eugenio Simonetti and Bastian San Martin have completed the KW House in Chile, a “study in duality” that juxtaposes glass-walled living areas with cozy, wood-lined bedrooms. Situated in a protected forest near the Villarrica volcano in the Araucanía region, the 309-square-meter home is designed to offer both an immersive forest experience during the summer and a cozy retreat in the winter. To achieve this, Simonetti and San Martin created a striking contrast between the two levels of KW House, featuring a fully glazed ground floor, referred to as the “aquarium,” alongside a more secluded, wood-lined upper floor. Designer: Eugenio Simonetti and Bastian San Martin “KW House is a study in duality, combining a bold engagement with the natural environment on the first floor with a carefully crafted sense of seclusion on the second,” Simonetti said. “This duality not only reflects the seasonal adaptability of the house but also serves the diverse needs of its inhabitants, whether connecting with nature or seeking privacy,” he added. During the summer months, the ground floor’s full-height glass doors can be opened to invite the surrounding forest into the home, leading out to a small wooden veranda and walkways that guide visitors to viewpoints, complete with seating areas and a fire pit. In the winter, KW House can be “hermetically sealed,” featuring a perimeter corridor that links two distinct living areas at either end. One of these spaces is slightly sunken and includes a wood-burning stove, while the other is centered around a fireplace. The home’s layout includes three structural staircases, two of which are framed by prominent X-shaped steel supports, serving to separate the living areas from the central kitchen and dining space. These staircases also segment the first floor of KW House, allowing it to be divided into a series of “apartments,” each with its landing or opened up to form a large, adaptable family area. “If the inhabitants of the bedrooms are part of the family, the second floor works with all the doors open, in which you circulate as if you were walking through a series of train cars,” said Simonetti. “If they are guests from outside the family unit, the lobbies are blocked, forcing guests to only travel along the stairs, which provides greater privacy.” Positioned above the transparent and exposed ground floor, the cabin-like bedrooms of KW House are designed to offer a sense of solitude. These spaces are illuminated by large skylights and small windows, which ensure natural light without compromising the feeling of seclusion. The pitched roof and walls are fully paneled in wood, enhancing the cozy, isolated atmosphere of these rooms. “Few windows, abundant Lenga wood panelling, and skylights create warm, introspective spaces, while west-facing skylights provide controlled views of the El Cerduo mountain range,” Simonetti said. “The thoughtful material choices and functional adaptability ensure that the design responds to both its environmental context and the lifestyle of its occupants, resulting in a harmonious and enduring architectural statement.”",
