  "text": "As the place for rest, a bedroom should be the ultimate retreat — a sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of life. If yours is feeling like it needs a refresh, we think a ‘back-to-basics’ approach is the best way to revisit and elevate the space, for  sophisticated and refined look. Less is more, after all. Start with the bed. Gone are the days of intricately upholstered ‘feature’ bedheads. Instead look for a simple, streamlined option that will anchor the bed to the room without pulling too much focus. Eva’s Delve Bed Frame is the perfect option for this with its cosy padded headboard and frame in neutral hues (plus it comes with in-built storage!). A trend we’ve been noticing of late is a return to simplified and sleek bedding choices. Think less layers, uncomplicated patterns and minimal accessories. Instead of crowding the bed with a mountain of scatter cushions, opt for a low-lying bolster cushion, paired with a couple of standard pillows. Or, find a bedcover that drapes across the whole bed and onto the floor, for a more refined ‘undone’ look. The colour scheme for the whole room should be pared-back and tonal. In our moodboard above we’ve chosen browns, beiges, creams and whites with warm undertones. Add in an accessory or two in a standout, colour — like a luxurious burgundy, repeated a couple of times in the room — to break up the tonal palette. When it comes to bedside tables, the memo is make it a statement, but don’t make it matching. In a room where the colour palette and styling is pared-down, a few statement pieces bring the interest without overwhelming the space. Our choice for a mis-matched pair of bedsides combines the playful, yet straight-lined silhouette of ELLISON STUDIOS’ Pepé Side Table with Lauren Lea Haynes Studio’s curved and textural NO.6 Sculptural Plinth. Finally, elevate the room with art. Diana Miller’s petite ‘Lost and Found’ art piece works beautifully in our bedroom moodboard above by mirroring the colours and forms in the space, but also adding a pop of darker contrast next to the softer, yet larger, work by Ash Holmes.
