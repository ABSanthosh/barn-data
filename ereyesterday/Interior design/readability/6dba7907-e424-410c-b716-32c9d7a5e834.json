Turns out our door isn't wood, but it is stained to look like it.Â  Did you know you can stain a fiberglass door and it will look just like wood? I didn't realize this until we built our current house. I had no idea you could use stain on anything but wood, and I've been at this DIY thing for a long time! We have a Therma Tru door set with sidelites (see specifics of our indoor and outdoor home finishes here) and picked the stain color called English Walnut.Â  Our front door doesn't get much of the elements because it's protected on our front porch. But even without the wind and rain hitting it directly, the dark stain was still super faded nearly eight years later.Â  I'm prepping for our son's high school graduation party, and this DIY project was on my list! The process wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. There are only a few simple steps in this application, they just take some time. The before photos of the door finish didn't look as horrible as in real life, but it was faded, worn out and chipping in some spots: This post may containÂ affiliate links for yourÂ convenience. I may earn a small commission whenÂ you make a purchase through links.Â  Our builder didn't do a great job the first time this door was stained, so we had a lot of areas (particularly in more detailed spots) that were chipping away completely:Â  The builder left some of the leftover product, so I was able to look it up online and order more stain.Â  This is actually a gel stain and is much thicker than your traditional oil-based stain. That consistency is really helpful when staining a vertical surface like a door!Â  The thicker gel stain makes it much easier to apply with the door on its hinges and it doesn't drip all over the place.Â  The first thing I did (after taping off the windows on the door and sidelites) was to sand everything well. I used an 120-grit sanding block on everything:Â  These angled sanding blocks are perfect for something like this that has a lot of hard to reach detailed areas. The angled sides make it so easy!Â  I spent most of my time working at those chipping areas -- I didn't want to stain just to have more of it flake off later. Sand those areas until smooth and no longer chipping.Â  The flat areas were quick and easy, I just did a light sand all over the door surface and trim: Make sure to use a damp rag to wipe all of the dust and debris before moving on! If you hate sanding as much as I do, and your door is in good condition with no chipping stain, you can use mineral spirits to clean the door before staining as well. Use a clean rag to apply the spirits, and then let dry.Â  Recently I've started using odd socks to apply stain. The soft cotton works great and I like that I'm getting use out of them! You can see how thick the stain is here:Â  I like using a cloth for stain when I can, as it just penetrates better into a textured surface like this:Â  Gloves are a must, even if you're using a brush or foam brush! No matter how hard I try, I always end up with stain on my hands.Â  You can see what a difference the new coat of stain made here:Â  This color is gorgeous!Â  For detailed areas I used a chip brush to get into the hard to reach spots:Â  A few more tips for staining a door:Â  Do not shake your stain container, as it will create bubbles. Use a stir stick of some kind to make sure it's mixed well. I applied stain to the door just like I paint a door -- I work on detailed sections of the door first, then move on to flat sections like the stiles (vertical sections) and rails (horizontal areas). Apply the stain in long strokes in the direction of the grain. Gel stain doesn't dry as fast so you don't have to work as quickly compared to thinner oil-based stain. It also gives you a bit more time to clean up any drips.Â  You do not need to take the door down to paint or stain. You will need to be able to keep the door open slightly for the products to dry. I found that everything dried very fast outside. It's helpful to remove door hardware if possible. If not, either cover with painter's tape or wipe away excess stain on the hardware immediately. I didn't even tape off ours, just wiped it off the metal as I worked.Â  If starting with a bare fiberglass door, I would recommend a minimum of two coats to get the best coverage. Because our door had already been stained once, I only needed one coat.Â  More coats will give the door a darker appearance. Be sure to give the stain enough dry time between coats.Â  After applying, I waited about 15 minutes and then wiped the excess stain away with a clean rag (AKA my sock).Â  If you are staining a door in hot weather, I would clean off the excess in five to ten minutes to be sure it doesn't get tacky.Â  You don't have to tape around windows, but taping them off with painter's or masking tape makes clean up much faster:Â  The stain can be removed with a flat razor afterwards, but it can get gummed up under the mullions so I find it easier to tape the windows.Â  Once the door is completely dry, it's time to add a polyurethane sealant on top to protect all of your hard work!Â  We had plenty of this topcoat left from the builder, which is what leads me to believe that it wasn't used on this side of the door from the beginning:Â  At the very least, it was a veeeery thin coat.Â  I always apply polyurethane with a foam brush. It makes for the easiest application and clean up:Â  You don't want to work the poly too much, because it will start gumming up as it dries. That milky finish is fine when applying -- it will dry clear!Â  But you also don't want the wet poly to be too thick because it will create a thicker texture when it dries. (And will take much longer to dry.) Most any high quality, exterior grade (with UV inhibitors) polyurethane would work on an exterior door, you don't have to use this specific brand.Â  Our poly was low gloss, but it still gives the door plenty of dimension and shine. The final result gives the door a beautiful, protected satin finish:Â  You can buy this Therma Tru same day stain by itself, but if you are starting from scratch, I highly recommend their whole kit. It comes with everything you'll need, down to a pair of rubber gloves and stir sticks.Â  Important note: Be sure to dispose of your application tools, clothes and rags properly! Any oil-based finish can become combustible. Check out this video for helpful tips.Â  Here's another look at the bottom portion of the door before: And the after with one additional coat of stain and poly:Â  Just gorgeous! I kept walking outside just to look at it! ðŸ˜‚: That extra wide coir welcome mat has lasted nearly eight years! I just ordered a new one -- highly recommend.Â  Now our guests will be welcomed with a beautiful dark walnut door instead of a faded and worn front door! The colors in our beautiful floral spring wreath looks so great against the dark stain:Â  This project took me about four hours over two days. I sanded and stained on one day and then added the protective sealant and cleaned up on the second.Â  Did you know you can stain fiberglass? I learn something new every day! If you've already painted your door and want this stained look, you can remove the paint completely before staining.Â  In my opinion, both stain and paint on exterior doors require similar upkeep. Latex painted doors will fade after being exposed to the elements and will need a new coat every five years or so.",
