  "text": "This renovated two-bedroom apartment in Point Piper, NSW feels like a standalone house thanks to its private entrance, and terrace that enjoys spectacular views of Sydney Harbour. It’s a far cry from how the apartment looked 10 years ago, says the vendor, Andrew Southwood-Jones, who also designed the renovation. ‘It was a bit of a case of the worst house (apartment in this case) on the best street — perhaps Australia in this case, [as] Wolseley Rd, is home to the most expensive homes in Australia with magical views of Sydney Harbour,’ says Andrew, director of Kinkfab. ‘Although there were little redeeming features in the original apartment, it had a leafy vista from every window and views through to the Harbour Bridge and Opera House. ‘Unusually, even though it was a ground floor apartment, it felt immensely private and is elevated two storeys up from the street to take advantage of the views.’ Andrew and his partner Maryam Litkouhi bought the apartment in 2014 and worked with Jonathan Hughes from Bright Build to completely strip back the interiors. They removed the walls of the second bedroom to form a multifunctional space, and installed large openings to embrace the home’s private courtyard. Like a Swiss army knife, the resulting design is supremely versatile, maximising every millimetre of space to match the storage and functionality of a much larger unit. ‘Sliding walls, fold down tables, hidden storage, and integrated lighting allow for flexible reconfiguration to adapt to various needs,’ says Andrew. The interior palette comprises timeless and natural materials that pay homage to those found in the 1971 building’s common areas, such terrazzo and stainless steel. Entertaining in the apartment is a dream thanks to the open-plan living area that spills onto the private courtyard. The apartment’s flexible layout has allowed Andrew and Maryam to live in the property as both a couple and a young family, but it’s now time for a new chapter. ‘The property’s immense privacy, high quality renovation, and functionality make it truly unique,’ Andrew says. ‘We will miss watching the NYE fireworks from our courtyard each year… Luckily, we are good friends with a few people in the building, so we will be awaiting their invite to their NYE party next year!’ 1/25 Wolseley Road, Point Piper NSW 2027 is listed for sale with Chris Helich at PPD Real Estate and will go to auction on 6pm Tuesday November 19",
