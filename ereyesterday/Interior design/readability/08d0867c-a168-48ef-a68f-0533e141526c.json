All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Photo: Getty Images; Design: Apartment TherapyIf you love to cook and spend time in the kitchen, then you’ve probably amassed quite the collection of cooking oils, spices, salts, and other condiments. Those tiny bottles can really clog up a shelf and make finding what you’re looking for almost impossible (without knocking several things over, that is). But Stanley Tucci has this situation all figured out: Rather than storing his go-to ingredients on a shelf, he uses a massive lazy Susan to keep them all within reach and easy to find.You can spot the lazy Susan in many of Tucci’s cooking videos on Instagram. It sits at the far end of his kitchen island and is loaded up with salt and pepper mills, olive oils, vinegars, and any other seasoning he might want to add to the meal of the moment. All he has to do is give the turntable a quick spin to grab what he needs, and then get back to cooking. In fact, he basically brought his entire pantry to his kitchen island, and it’s brilliant.If it’s made out of solid hardwood, a large lazy Susan like Tucci’s can actually set you back up to $500 from stores like Pottery Barn or Crate \u0026 Barrel. Luckily, though, you can snag a cheaper version on Amazon for less than $40.This 18-inch turntable, for example, is on sale right now for just under $34 and is large enough to hold all your favorite condiments and more. It’s made with durable acacia wood, and the rotation mechanism can be adjusted with a screwdriver to either glide smoother or stay more stationary.Keeping your go-to ingredients on a lazy Susan will free up so much space on your shelves, in your drawers, or in your pantry, so this investment is sort of a win-win-win! If it works for Stanley Tucci, it’s definitely going to work for you.",
