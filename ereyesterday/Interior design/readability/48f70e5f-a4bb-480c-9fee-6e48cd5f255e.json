  "text": "Tina Ramchandani grew up in the States, but traveled around the globe, surrounded by colors, textures, and cultural influences. It was when she was on one such trip with her family that she truly fell in love with design. ”Walking into a hotel, I was overcome with emotion,” Ramchandani says. “It was the first time I had experienced a place with all of my senses. I knew then that I wanted to embrace that feeling for the rest of my life, and find a way to make it my career.” Ramchandani graduated with a bachelor’s degree in interior design from the Art Institute of Philadelphia, then honed her skills at firms in Manhattan, including Vicente Wolf Associates. She was encouraged by the support from those in the design community, whose generosity and insights were invaluable. In 2014 she founded her own New York-based company, Tina Ramchandani Creative. She specializes in what she describes as Soulful Minimalism, interiors that are warm and modern, with custom elements. Rather than emphasize a single style or trend, Ramchandani creates environments that not only elevate, but also tell the stories of her clients’ lives. Always with genuine curiosity and strong desire for connection, Ramchandani has an innate ability to understand what matters to people. She listens to an individual talk about their particular needs, and then translates that vision into something tangible. It’s a process that is always interesting and fuels her dedication. When she is not working on a project, Ramchandani makes pottery, another form of expression that inspires her. “What began as a way to quiet my mind has become a creative outlet I deeply enjoy,” she notes. “I’ve even made a few vases that now live in our studio – functional reminders of the beauty in slowing down.” Today, Tina Ramchandani joins us for Friday Five! Photo: Tina Ramchandani 1. Figaro If you know me, you know Figaro. He’s more than a pet – he’s family. His expressive (and often judgmental) looks, his curious spirit, and our shared adventures bring me endless joy. He’s a reminder to pause, be present, and love unconditionally. Photo: Tina Ramchandani 2. Travel Travel is essential to how I live and design. Whether exploring stateside or abroad, I’m constantly inspired – by color pairings on a historic facade, the texture of local textiles, or the stillness of a quiet moment. Immersing myself in new cultures brings both clarity and creativity. 3. Flowers Flowers have an effortless way of bringing joy. Whether arranged thoughtfully to complete a room or discovered unexpectedly in nature, they offer a moment of beauty – a softness, a gesture. I love the way they can introduce color in the most elegant and surprising ways, adding life and energy without ever asking for attention. 4. Color I believe color is emotional. Whether it’s bold, saturated tones or layers of nuanced whites, color adds depth and narrative to a space. Thoughtful use of it allows a home to speak – and speak honestly. 5. Performance Fabrics Life is beautifully imperfect. Between my dog, my nieces, and my own clumsy moments, durable, cleanable fabrics are a must. Fortunately, performance no longer means compromising on beauty – we now have options that are as refined as they are resilient. Works by Tina Ramchandani: Design on a Dime – Soulful Feminism For our second year participating in Design on a Dime, we embraced a playful twist on our signature style, Soulful Minimalism. The theme – Soulful Feminism – allowed us to channel the energy, optimism, and creativity of our twenty-something selves. Designed for a good cause, this vignette was both nostalgic and forward-thinking, with bold styling and unapologetic personality. Library-Office – Boerum Hill Located in charming Boerum Hill, this residence called for interiors that reflected the vibrancy of its exterior. The library-office space, shown here, was designed to blend seamlessly into the architecture while still making a striking visual statement. Rich color and layered texture created a space that is equal parts retreat and reflection. Georgetown – House Beautiful Cover This colonial Georgetown home remains one of our most beloved projects. From day one, there was a deep creative trust between us and the client – a collaboration that allowed for bold decisions and vibrant color stories throughout. It was also a milestone project, as it became the cover feature of House Beautiful’s Color Issue – a proud and humbling moment for our studio. Hamptons Outdoor Living Our team had the privilege of guiding this ground-up Hamptons home from concept to completion, inside and out. The client envisioned a home that balanced their modern New York sensibility with the relaxed charm of a traditional shingle-style exterior. This particular image captures one of my favorite spaces – a sleek, expansive outdoor area designed for effortless entertaining and quiet moments alike. Personally, this home holds special meaning as it was the first completed under my newly established firm. Central Park West – A Vibrant Sanctuary Inspired by the verdant views of Central Park just beyond the windows, this space was designed as a personal retreat for a vibrant young professional. The palette draws directly from the lush green landscape, bringing the outdoors into the heart of the home. Designed for both calm and celebration, the interiors move effortlessly between intimate gatherings and lively evenings, with adaptable spaces for dining, lounging, and entertaining.
