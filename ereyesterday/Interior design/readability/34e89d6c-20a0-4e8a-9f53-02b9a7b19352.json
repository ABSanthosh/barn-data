  "text": "The EquipHotel is home to an exhibition by Radici, proud to present the Newstalgia carpet collection by Tekla Evelina Severin, otherwise known as Teklan. This collection features new innovations such as the Bloom Back surface and AlleRAD technology, allowing the carpets to be completely commercially recyclable at the end of their lifetimes. This is essential to the ethos of the collection, utilizing advanced yarn technology and backing material to achieve this impressive feat. Newstalgia pulls upon shapes we know and love from the 1970s and 1980s, available in a multitude of colors for a super customizable product. All showstoppers, the collection consists of eight unique prints, Monogram, Elliptic, Weave, Brick, Net, Snake, Folding, and Backgammon. With custom design options available, you can craft your dream scheme exactly to your specifications. Monogram is a distinctive pattern, combining twin graphic L’s to form a block, repeated over a regular rectangle. Reminiscent of iconic logos from historic fashion houses, this print will add a linear element sure to heighten any interior. Elliptic is a nod to the Op Art movement of the 1960s, where bold shapes coalesce to trick the eye. Pairing like tones together further enhances the illusion, making the shapes become shadows and the curves have a sense of life. Weave is inspired by the traditions of hand weaving, involving regular blocks of intersecting color. Blending heritage and modernity, these colorful motifs add a sense of whimsy to the space, expressing a sense of fun within a restrained color palette. Brick is defined by bold color choices and a sense of solidity. The contrasting palette features turquoise and burgundy on one side, and orange and midnight blue on the other, amplifying the unique personality of the design. These blocks fit neatly into one another, the strongest bonds of mortise and tenon adding to the strength of the motifs. Net employs more optical tricks to inscribe depth. The pleasing regularity of the horizontal and vertical forms inspire quiet within the mind. Net is available in two variants that mix four colors: peach, beige, green, and burgundy and brown, light blue, beige, and black. Snake is a bold pattern, bands of stylized color slithering across the plane. With colors highly reminiscent of the natural world, yet taken up a notch, these brilliant hues will bring a sense of the wilderness inside. Inspired by Escher, Folding explores the gap between possible and impossible shapes. Crossing the boundaries of two dimensions, this pattern adds a sense of structure and order within the chaos of life. Backgammon is the final pattern, inspired by the game beloved for eons. A 1970s dreamscape, the rich mustard yellow and deep brown adds to a sense of yesteryear, yet with modern interpretations that ground us within the present. Tekla Everina Severin is a designer that extends the boundaries of space design with this exhibit. Focused on the expansive use of color, her work spans interior design, furniture, clothing, accessories, set design, art direction, and photography. She is constantly inspired by its use: “Color is never absolute, it is always relative, it is what you put next to it that defines it.” Radici is famous for their rugs, always pushing the envelope in the sustainability category. This collection features AlleRAD, an innovative technology that reduces dust and allergens within the home. This, on top of being completely biodegradable and eco-friendly, is new within the carpet industry, paving the way for our new, lower-waste future. To learn more about the Newstalgia rug collection, visit radicicarpet.it. Growing up in NYC has given Aria a unique perspective into art + design, constantly striving for new projects to get immersed in. An avid baker, crocheter, and pasta maker, handwork and personal touch is central to what she loves about the built environment. Outside of the city, she enjoys hiking, biking, and learning about space.",
