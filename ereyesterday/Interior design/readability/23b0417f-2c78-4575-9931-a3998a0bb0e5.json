Child Studio Mellifluously Fuses Period Architecture and Soulful Modernism in a London Townhouse Located in London’s Belgravia, this Georgian townhouse has been reimagined by London-based design practice Child Studio as a nostalgia-infused retreat where bespoke craftsmanship takes centre stage. Drawing inspiration from early 20th-century European modernist villas, the designers have balanced old-world charm with soulful modernism through a lens of contemporary sophistication. Having been entirely transformed, the three-storey residence is a masterclass in tailored craftsmanship, with the majority of furnishings custom-designed to fit the architectural nuances of the space.

Stool: Tabouret Berger Stool designed by Charlotte Perriand in 1950s, produced by Cassina. Table lamp: Custom design by Child Studio inspired by Luis Barragán’s 1950’s designs. Sculpture: Neoclassical Swedish sculpture of a female nude, 1920s by an unknown artist. Rug: Vintage North African Tuareg rug. Bookcase: Custom design by Child Studio. Photography by Helen Cathcart. Child Studio’s redesign is a masterful balance of modernist influences and the townhouse’s Georgian heritage. “Our approach for this project was pared-back and evolved around a constrained selection of natural materials,” explain the studio’s founders, Che Huang and Alexy Kos. Working closely with skilled cabinetmakers and marble artisans in England and Italy, they created a home where every element feels both sculptural and functional. Reclaimed oak herringbone parquet and rounded forms—from curved plaster ceiling coves to curvaceous wooden furniture, voluptuous marble elements and cylindrical cushions—establish a cohesive visual language throughout the residence, while the Studio’s bespoke furnishings are thoughtfully interwoven with vintage and reissued modernist pieces evoking a sense of timelessness. At the heart of the home is the soaring double-height living room, the result of the renovation’s boldest move, which involved remodelling the two upper levels of the residence opening up the mansard, flooding the space with natural light. Inspired by the cinematic grandeur of Karl Lagerfeld’s Parisian library, floor-to-ceiling mahogany bookshelves stretch five meters high, forming an enveloping framework for contemplation. A newly added cast-iron spiral staircase winds up to a mezzanine level, offering a sculptural focal point while connecting the living room to an outdoor rooftop terrace. Low table, Stools, Table lamp \u0026 Bookcase: Custom design by Child Studio. Photography by Helen Cathcart. Photography by Helen Cathcart. Anchoring the seating area are bespoke mahogany wood sofas with chocolate-brown velvet upholstery, their semicircular backs echoing the curvature of the bookcase’s vertical elements. Bauhaus armchairs by Tecta upholstered in wool bouclé fabric (originally designed in 1920 by Walter Gropius and reissued) lend a sense of structured elegance, while the interplay of textures—from the vintage North African Tuareg rug to the Child Studio-designed parchment-shaded ceramic lamps—reinforces the room’s tactile richness. Beside the spiral staircase, a low table in cherry wood paired with a set of cross-legged stools, both by Child Studio, the former inspired by the works of Swedish modernist Axel Einar Hjorth, the latter by Luis Barragán, make for an elegant reading nook. In the adjacent dining area, the Studio’s Art Deco-informed round mahogany dining table subtly complements the vintage Pierre Jeanneret teak chairs, originally crafted for Le Corbusier’s Chandigarh project in the 1960s, and the vintage 1920s Neoclassical pendant light hanging above. Beneath, a wool and silk rug—another bespoke piece by Child Studio—grounds the arrangement in understated luxury, while an 18th-century limestone fireplace sourced from France lends a storied presence.

A custom caramel-tone mohair daybed by Child Studio provides a sumptuous resting place, complemented by an antique African coffee table and a tilting crystal ball lamp by Jacques Adnet. The layering of eras—with early 20th-century craftsmanship mingling with modernist silhouettes—imbues the space with a collected, lived-in quality. Defined by its gently undulating wooden headboard, a custom island bed in the principal bedroom commands the space, with built-in cylindrical nightstands adding to its sculptural presence. A daybed and stool, both custom-designed in tribute to French Art Deco pioneer Jules Leleu, introduce a refined elegance, while a travertine fireplace and an antique round mirror set between two tall windows further anchor the room.

A striking counterpoint to the warm wood tones of the bedroom, the principal bathroom is sculpted almost entirely from emerald-green Verde Guatemala marble. “The inspiration for this space came from visiting the seminal 1930s Villa Serralves,” note the designers. The bathtub and vanity counter, carved from solid marble blocks, appear to melt into the surrounding surfaces, their fluid forms a testament to artisanal precision. A vintage Ethiopian hand-carved stool and a 1930s moonstone pendant light further the room’s sculptural narrative. Antique 1930’s ‘Moonstone’ milk glass Plafonnier light.

In contrast to the airy lightness of the other spaces, the guest bedroom embraces a cocooning sensibility. Here the walls are enveloped in deep green velvet-wrapped panelling, framing a custom mahogany bed. Flanking it, early 19th-century Empire stools with intricate marquetry lend an element of historical grandeur. A vintage secretary desk by Pierre Jeanneret and a Bauhaus brass desk lamp by Marcel Breuer complete this richly textured sanctuary. With an unwavering focus on craftsmanship and materiality, Child Studio has successfully crafted a home that feels at once storied and modern where  the historical and timeless are elegantly interwoven with a refined contemporary sensibility.
