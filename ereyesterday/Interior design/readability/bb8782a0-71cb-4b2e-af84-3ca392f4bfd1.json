  "description": "Each year, over 100 million bicycles are produced worldwide, versus 94 million automobiles. The modern buyer includes urban residents seeking environmentally-friendly transport and exercise, as well as those in developing nations seeking a reliable and affordable means of transport. Bike ownership surged during the pandemic—some estimates have it at 25% growth in 2020 alone—and sales will only grow. So it's not surprising that we saw a ton of bike-related designs this year.We'll start off with the precursor to the bicycle: The running machine, a/k/a the Draisine, developed by German inventor Karl Drais in 1816. Drais could never imagined that in 208 years, his invention would yield descendants like these:This low-maintenance, corrosion-proof RCYL Bike. Some 90% of the bike is made out of plastic. Taiwanese manufacturer BESV's stylish PSF1, a folding e-bike. The Owlet, a radical new form for the e-bike. Bleeding into motorcycle territory is this electric, off-road 2x2 Ultra Bike by Russia's Robo Systems. As e-bikes proliferate, so too do e-bike accidents. In a drive to increase safety, Dutch police have begun using this roadside e-bike speed testing contraption. E-bikes need to be charged, of course. Industrial Design student Matthew Quejada designed this Ultium Lift, an e-bike charging station for garages. Another type of bike Drais probably couldn't have foreseen is the cargo bike. German company Dynamic Drives has completely re-thought the cargo bike form factor with their Intelectra pedelec. Meanwhile in London, manufacturer Cityshuttle has mashed up the electric cargo bike with a tractor-trailer to create their ePack.For those who don't need a full cargo bike, from Germany comes this Allpacka One, a collapsible cargo box for bikes.Engineer Robert G. Ozarski invented the Kradl, an electricity-free, spring-loaded bike hoist that makes it easier to store.Industrial designer Adrien Rovero designed this cheeky bike rack as a clear statement. Swiss company V-Locker designed these space-efficient, paternoster-like bike storage lockers. Also in Switzerland, industrial design firm Erfindergeist created this transforming train seating for bike storage.Bike helmets, too, are increasingly receiving design attention. The Ventete aH-1 is an inflatable, collapsible design.Industrial designers Masaru Kiyota and Sawyer Hagen designed the Oshel, a lockable bike helmet. Another industrial designer, Ash Lewin, has realized his dream for the fastest bike helmet ever. And finally, for you mountain bikers: The RinseKit Tailgate Shower makes it easy to hose your bike off after a muddy ride.",
