Through our submissions portal, we receive thousands of design projects daily from creatives worldwide, offering a platform to showcase fresh talent. From furniture pieces to small decorative items, these designs contribute to shaping our spaces, making life more practical, creative, and fun. As 2024 draws to a close, we take a moment to celebrate another year of creativity and innovation through hand-picked standout products submitted by our readers.This year’s submissions showcased an exciting blend of functionality, playfulness, and forward-thinking concepts, featuring a sculptural chair paying homage to Ton’s iconic designs, Yamaha‘s electric guitar series crafted from reclaimed scrap wood, customizable lamp sets using natural leaves, and more intriguing projects. In our annual roundup, we highlight BIG stories dedicated to our top design products of 2024, capturing the spirit and creativity of the year. Read on to see more of our TOP 10 picks of design products.SWAPPABLE ROCKS AND LEAVES CUSTOMIZE YOUR OWN NATURE-INSPIRED LAMPimage courtesy of Thomas TakadaThomas Takada explores the intricate relationship between humans and nature through his Grandpa’s Lamp collection. Each lamp integrates natural elements that serve as both decorative but also structural components, essential to its function. The lighting objects come with a rock and a leaf, but the designer encourages owners to go and seek out their own too, fostering a deeper personal connection with the natural world. As leaves change with the seasons, this practice offers a reflection of local climates and geological histories. The minimal design is built around standardized steel tubes, which house the electrical components. Left uncoated, the steel develops a rusted patina over time, adding an evolving aesthetic dimension to the lamp.read more hereYOONMO KOO TRANSPORTS MONOCHROME, TACTILE ARTS OF DANSAEKHWA INTO FURNITUREimage courtesy of Yoonmo KooBringing art into the realm of furniture, Yoonmo Koo’s Dansaek collection reimagines historic paintings as functional objects, integrating them into everyday life beyond the canvas. Inspired by Korea‘s Dansaekhwa movement—a 1950s response to the influence of Western modernism on Korean artistic traditions—the furniture series draws from the movement’s monochromatic aesthetics and embrace of modernist abstraction over realism and formalism. Koo treats wood as a canvas, carving into it and filling the voids with resin to elevate unique textures and create dynamic interplays of light, shadow, and color. The resulting benches and stools, monolithic in form and inscribed with intricate markings, celebrate vibrant hues and gradient transitions, merging art and practicality.read more hereULTRAMARINE WOODEN CIRCLES REVISE TON’S ICONIC CHAIR 14 DISPLAYED AT MILAN DESIGN WEEK 2024image by Julius FilipChair-object, or Ode to Chair 14 by designer Jiri Krejcirik pays homage to the iconic Chair 14 by furniture company Ton. Ton displayed the craftwork of Krejcirik’s sculptural chair-object at this year’s Salone del Mobile Milano – Milan Design Week 2024. ‘My Ode to Chair 14 revives the legendary Chair 14. The sculptural chair-object pays homage to this icon. The backrest is constructed from bent wooden circles that applaud the bending craftsmanship of Ton,’ notes Krejcirik.With its intricate silhouette and bold ultramarine hue, Ode to Chair 14 blurs the line between sculpture and functional design. Remarkably, this chair-object required no new molds, as it was crafted entirely from existing components and molds in Ton’s production. Staying true to Krejcirik’s signature style, Ode to Chair 14 interlaces the heritage of the past with a new innovative design.read more hereGREG DUBIN’S DUAL RECORD STORAGE AND DISPLAY ECHOES WIRED DESIGNS OF VERNER PANTONimage courtesy of Greg DubinGreg Dubin combines record storage and display with On A Wire—a contraption that takes cues from pioneers in modern design, Marcel Breuer and Verner Panton. As record collections expand quickly, collectors resort to several methods to organize their new and frequently listened-to records. Traditional solutions like stacking them on the floor, leaning them against walls, or wedging them between speakers are often proved inadequate, prompting the designer to craft his own solution.Through sketching and experimentation, Dubin identified the triangle as the most efficient profile for the design. To avoid material waste from hollow triangular shapes cut from sheets, he opted for steel wire—a material capable of withstanding the stress of the design’s tight bends. The result is a functional and minimalist storage solution tailored for the modern collector.read more hereROC H BIEL’S MONOLITHIC STEEL STOOLS EVOKE ARCHITECTURAL MARVELS FROM A DYSTOPIAN FUTURE",
