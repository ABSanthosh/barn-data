  "description": "20 years and two small renovations after buying their forever home, the owners of this brick abode in Richmond decided it was time for another update — the final edit. Tsai Design was brought on to reshape the ground floor to accommodate a bigger study, and foster a greater connection between the outdoors and the open-plan living areas. With a few clever moves (and a secret bathroom), the home has been completely transformed. See more below.",

  "text": "They say you should always live in a home to better understand how you use it what it needs, before embarking on any renovations. The owners of this Richmond home had 20 years worth of knowledge to draw on when the time came to engage Tsai Design to give it a much needed update, in 2021. The home itself wasn’t completely untouched, the owners had updated the kitchen when they first purchased it in 2001, and then 10 years later, expanded the living room and added a master suite on the first floor. Come 2021, with two teenage kids and a new work-from-home routine, the family needed another update — this time to accommodate a larger study, better indoor-outdoor flow and more storage. ‘We saw this renovation as an opportunity to bring cohesion to the aesthetic of the previous renovations,’ says Hidy Wong, Tsai Design architect. The project, aptly named ‘The Final Edit’, focussed on the ground floor of the home. Leaving the living room and master-suite untouched, Tsai Design re-shaped the rest of the floorplan and reintegrated the outdoor area as the heart of the home. ‘By keeping the living space in the same spot, we removed the existing study and bathroom to make room for the kitchen next to the deck, facing the living room,’ explains Hidy. ‘We opened up the western wall to enhance the connection to the outdoors and positioned the dining room next to this new opening.’ The deck, which previously was only accessible via the living room, is now surrounded by communal spaces — the living, dining and kitchen all enjoying sunlight, natural breeze and, most importantly, connection to the outdoors. The material palette in these spaces reflects this new open layout with light two-tone blue cabinetry and warm, pale timber. As you transition through this space into the new study, the full height joinery transforms into a darker blue, concealing a secret door to the renovated bathroom. ‘The pink-tiled bathroom provides a sweet surprise when the secret door is revealed,’ says Hidy. But that’s not her favourite feature. It’s the clever sliding door that can be closed to divide the dual access bathroom into two separate spaces, allowing one person to use the toilet while another can shower at the same time. ‘This feature is incredibly practical for a family, eliminating the morning rush for the bathroom,’ says Hidy. With its new layout, cohesive aesthetic, additional storage and improved installation, the homeowners truly believe this will indeed be ‘the final edit.’",
