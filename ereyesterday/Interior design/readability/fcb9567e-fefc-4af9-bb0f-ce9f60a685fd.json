The SWITCH series features woven garments crafted from 100% plant-based nylon, developed in collaboration with Toray Industries, Inc. These versatile pieces include detachable linings that can transform into wearable items like vests, while jackets and coats offer adjustable elements such as back panels that can be converted into hoods, allowing for dynamic styling.The FLAT DRAPE series focuses on geometric elegance, with garments folding into square forms that transform into soft yet structured silhouettes when worn. Made from sugarcane-derived polyester, the fabric strikes a balance between softness and stretch, offering a fluid yet pronounced shape.FLAT DRAPE is a series featuring the ample draped shirt, jacket, and pants which all form a square when foldedIn the HERON series, IM MEN introduces Ultrasuede®, a plant-based artificial suede used in clothing for the first time. This innovative material, lightweight yet voluminous, features gradient patterns created through precise cutting techniques. The result is a collection that balances bold visual impact with practicality.The FLY series embodies the brand’s ideas by using selvage fabric to create reversible garments without textile excess. These pieces can be styled in multiple ways, including upside-down configurations, offering a range of silhouettes and emphasizing versatility.HERON is a series created using Ultrasuede®, an artificial suede made from 100% plant-based* polyester developed by Toray Industries, Inc.Finally, the KASURI series reinterprets a traditional Japanese dyeing technique, weaving partly pre-dyed yarn to create gradient patterns in the fabric. These garments transform seamlessly between forms, such as ponchos and coats, with fastenings that allow for a variety of styling options.Meanwhile, the METALLIC ULTRA BOA series uses artificial suede combined with fleece and finished with metallic foil printing to create angular, statement-making silhouettes. The garment with two straight slits, on the front perpendicular to the hem, lined with two zippers; fastening the zippers in a lightly twisted motion completes the construction of the garment, creating a bold, angular silhouette around the elbows.Additionally, the WALL series, part of the collection, presents outerwear with bold, three-dimensional forms that showcase construction details as a design feature. Using wrinkle-resistant recycled polyester, the pieces achieve a balance between structure and wearability. The unique material lends an elegant sheen while maintaining lightness and softness. With versatility at its core, the garments allow for multiple styling options, seamlessly blending form and function.METALLIC ULTRA BOA uses an artificial sheepskin co-developed by the brand and Toray Industries, Inc.",
