  "description": "Caran d'Ache, the Swiss company known for their premium pencils, has been around since 1915. They designed their first pencil sharpener in 1933. The all-metal machine is still in production:Pinching the butterfly clamp causes the holding mechanism to protrude from the hole. You insert your pencil into it, then release the clamp, and the pencil is held securely for sharpening.If that's not fancy enough for you, the company makes a limited edition version called the Cosmic Blue Sharpening Machine. It's been lacquered in a pearlescent dark blue and features gold accents:It runs a whopping $295. (The original ain't much cheaper, at $195!)",
