  "text": "Space travel is often portrayed as a realm of high technology and daring exploration, but daily life in orbit hinges on details we rarely consider on Earth. Eating, for instance, becomes a challenge when gravity is no longer a reliable companion. Latvian designer Klinta Locmele has addressed this issue with her Zero collection, a line of tableware specifically designed for microgravity environments. The collection is designed with the astronaut’s needs in mind, aiming to make every meal in space feel as close to home as possible. The collection is built around the question of how to eat comfortably in zero gravity. Traditional plates and cutlery do not work when food threatens to float away at the slightest nudge. Locmele’s solution involves engineered forms and materials that keep food contained and accessible, removing some of the awkwardness from daily routines in space. Curved surfaces and secure lids help meals stay put, letting users focus on eating rather than chasing after runaway crumbs or droplets. Designer: Klinta Locmele Functionality is at the heart of this design. Each piece is meant to be intuitive, even for someone floating freely in a spacecraft. The collection’s pieces fit comfortably in the hand, and the ergonomics are tailored for gloved or bare hands alike. There is a sense of familiarity in the way each element feels, which is a rare comfort in the unfamiliar environment of space. The materials are easy to clean, lightweight, and safe for repeated use, ensuring that practicality is never sacrificed for aesthetics. The Zero collection includes a reusable silicone bowl with a narrow base that keeps food gathered, and a suction cup that secures it to surfaces. The accompanying spoon has a deep well and an angular shoulder, making it easy to scoop up soups and preventing liquids from sliding down the handle. The plate features grooves that use capillary action to contain sauces and spikes that hold bite-sized morsels steady for a fork or knife. Locmele even designed a ceramic teapot for the ritualistic pleasure of drinking hot beverages in orbit. The teapot’s interior contour triggers capillary action, and its spout works as a straw, allowing astronauts to enjoy hot drinks in a way that feels familiar and comforting. The collection’s value goes beyond mere function. Mealtimes can be deeply psychological, providing astronauts with moments of normalcy and connection. Locmele’s tableware is designed to foster this connection, using shapes and colors that evoke everyday dining rather than sterile, utilitarian tools. The tableware becomes a subtle bridge between worlds, turning a meal into a ritual that grounds the mind as much as it nourishes the body. The unique selling point of the Zero collection is how it centers the human experience. Locmele approaches every curve and contour intending to make astronauts feel cared for and at ease, even in extraordinary circumstances. This empathy-driven design sets the collection apart from other space tableware, which often focuses only on technical solutions. The result is a thoughtful and personal product, offering comfort and reassurance far from home.",
