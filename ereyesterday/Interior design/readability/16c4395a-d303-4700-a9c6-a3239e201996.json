Built from irregular, interlocking metal triangles, it offers a flexible and elegant solution for organizing desk essentials. With a focus on portability, minimalism, and tactile experience, KIIR transforms clutter into calm and turns productivity tools into visual statements. The system also includes branding and packaging design to complete the product ecosystem. Design Team Yuxi Liu Design ChallengeThe project began with a question: How can we create workspace tools that support modern, mobile workstyles without sacrificing aesthetics? With more people working from home or moving between shared spaces, the need for desk accessories that are both functional and portable has grown—but most organizers are static, cluttered, or uninspired.KIIR aims to solve this problem by providing a system that's easy to move, calming to use, and artful enough to live on display.Design ResearchI conducted informal interviews with home-office workers, freelancers, and creative professionals, as well as direct observation of desk setups. A few consistent pain points emerged:Traditional organizers felt bulky or mismatched with home décorUsers wanted to keep essentials visible but still feel organizedMany people moved their work setups during the day (bedroom, kitchen, living room)Cleanup needed to be fast and low-effortThese insights informed a design direction that focused on modularity, portability, and emotional satisfaction.Concept DevelopmentInspired by the way natural crystal formations interlock in irregular yet harmonious patterns, I developed KIIR as a series of modular triangular components. Each piece could stand alone or connect with others, forming a visually interesting system that adapts to various needs and desk sizes.The design evolved through sketching, 3D modeling, and low-fidelity foam prototypes to test proportions, edge conditions, and stacking behavior. Emphasis was placed on non-repetitive geometry, so no two setups look the same—offering both structure and visual surprise.Material ExplorationTo emphasize both function and beauty, I selected textured metal for the final product. Its materiality provides durability, tactility, and visual richness. The weight gives the pieces stability, while the matte finish minimizes fingerprints and adds an architectural quality to the object.FunctionalityEach triangular module serves a different organizational purpose—pen holder, open tray, vertical slot, etc.—but all share a consistent form language. The pieces can be arranged side by side or stacked vertically, and easily carried from one room to another. The goal was to make cleanup effortless and stylish—users can simply lift the set and relocate it without unpacking or rearranging.The grab-and-go functionality supports people who work in motion, while the minimalist form keeps clutter in check.Packaging \u0026 BrandingIn addition to product design, I developed KIIR's brand identity and packaging system to reflect the product's visual language. The branding is clean, minimal, and neutral—using soft tones and structured typography. The packaging is designed to feel like an extension of the product: purposeful, well-structured, and elegant.OutcomeKIIR bridges the gap between workspace utility and design-led lifestyle products. It challenges the idea that functional tools must be purely utilitarian and offers a calm, beautiful way to organize—and enjoy—your desk space. Learn More About This Projectx Favorite This Comment",
