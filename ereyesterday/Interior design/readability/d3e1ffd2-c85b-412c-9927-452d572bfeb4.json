G:RE, a brand devoted to enhancing the bond between people and their furry friends, has introduced a groundbreaking product that combines form, function, and a touch of nature’s beauty. Obile – a handy vacuum cleaner that isn’t just a tool but a lifestyle upgrade for pet-loving households. Designer: Focus studio, KSID, and Taeyeon Kim G:RE was born from a simple but powerful question: how can we create a life for pets and their humans that feels as natural as it is nurturing? As pets claim an even deeper place in our hearts and homes, G:RE envisions a world where products blend seamlessly with our lives while keeping our spaces comfortable, clean, and inspired by nature. With Obile, G:RE delivers on this promise by addressing one of the most practical challenges of pet ownership: maintaining a clean home without sacrificing style or convenience. Cleaning isn’t exactly fun, but what if your cleaning tool could feel like a piece of art infused with the warmth of the sun? That’s the magic of Obile. Designed with an elegant tilt reminiscent of sunlight streaming through a window, Obile isn’t just functional, it’s poetry in motion. The vacuum’s oblique design symbolizes the sun’s comforting rays, bringing warmth to its surroundings. Its natural hues, carefully chosen to mimic the golden tones of sunlight, make it an interior piece as much as a cleaning device. Whether it’s propped in its cradle or busy cleaning fur-lined corners, Obile feels like an extension of your home rather than an intrusive gadget. Pets bring love, joy, and of course fur. Obile is here to handle the mess without breaking a sweat, ensuring your space stays fresh for both you and your furry friends. Equipped with two nozzles – a basic nozzle and a fur brush nozzle. Obile tackles pet hair and dirt with ease. From carpets to cozy corners, it’s a cleaning powerhouse. The nozzles tuck neatly into a hidden drawer in the cradle, keeping everything tidy and within reach. Thanks to a wireless charging cradle powered by a USB-C connection, Obile is always ready for action. Its sleek design ensures it blends effortlessly into your decor, even when not in use. Through countless prototypes and full-size mock-ups, G:RE fine-tuned every detail, from the ergonomics of the handle to the seamless usability of its design. The result? A vacuum that feels like it was made just for you. Obile represents the harmony between functionality and design, a product that feels like a warm embrace for you and your pets. By bridging the gap between nature-inspired aesthetics and modern convenience, G:RE has created something truly special. So, why settle for the ordinary when you can embrace the extraordinary? With Obile, cleanliness becomes effortless, and your home transforms into a sanctuary where pets and people live in perfect harmony. Because at the end of the day, life is better when it’s shared—and clean.",
