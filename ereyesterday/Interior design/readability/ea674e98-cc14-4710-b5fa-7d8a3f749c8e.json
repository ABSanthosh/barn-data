  "text": "NEW BASINS AND JAPANESE-STYLE TUB JOIN THE OHTAKE COLLECTIONRoca introduces the next chapter of the Ohtake collection with sculptural basins and a compact bathtub designed by Rodrigo Ohtake. Celebrating the legacy of his father, architect Ruy Ohtake, the pieces reflect a refined organic language inspired by nature and tradition. Among the standout additions is a Stonex® bathtub that draws from the Japanese ritual of Ofuro bathing, offering a cocoon-like, restorative experience. Continuing a lineage of international recognition, the original Ohtake collection has a history of winning prestigious design awards — an acclaim extended by Rodrigo Ohtake’s additions, which have already received the Best in Show Revestir 2025, alongside the Red Dot Design Award in Product Design 2025 and the iF Design Award. ‘I was very honoured, but I won’t deny that it was a challenge. He was my great teacher, and my philosophy of architecture comes from him,’ shares Rodrigo, highlighting the personal significance behind this new chapter. ‘The connection to his legacy is naturally maintained as I incorporate new influences to keep the architecture evolving.’the exclusive terracotta finish adds a unique touch to the Ohtake basins | all images ©Ruy Teixeira, courtesy of RocaROCA’S IMPACT CONTINUES THROUGH SUSTAINABLE BATHROOM DESIGNFounded in 1917, Roca has become a global leader in the design and manufacture of bathroom solutions, blending over a century of expertise with a drive for innovation and a deep commitment to environmental responsibility. With operations in 170 countries and 78 factories worldwide, the family-run company continues to shape contemporary bathroom culture across diverse markets. Sustainability remains at the core of its mission, reflected in both its manufacturing processes and its collaborations, which aim to enrich daily life through thoughtful design. ‘Rodrigo Ohtake’s new designs combine tradition with innovation. Rodrigo has captured the essence of nature and the organic fluidity that characterises the original collection, adding his unique touch reflecting his own vision and artistic sensibility. Each piece on this collection combines beauty and functionality, using sustainable materials and eco-friendly manufacturing processes, in line with our mission to innovate in a responsible and sustainable way,’ says Marc Viardot, Corporate Director of Marketing and Design at the Roca Group.Rodrigo Ohtake’s new basins build on the Ohtake collection’s organic, nature-inspired designDRAWING FROM NATURE AND JAPANESE OFURO RITUALSRodrigo Ohtake’s two additional basin designs draw from the soft, fluid silhouette of the Calla Lily. Working with hand-sculpted models, he allows each shape to evolve intuitively through close material exploration. The resulting pieces feel both contemporary and timeless, offered in a refined palette that includes white, matt white, matt black, onyx, coffee, beige, and a distinctive terracotta finish, exclusive to Brazil and available globally upon request.This philosophy extends to the bathtub, which takes inspiration from the traditional Japanese ofuro — a deep, steep-sided soaking bath associated with relaxation and ritual. Molded in Roca’s proprietary Stonex® material, the compact design integrates a built-in seat that encourages a meditative, upright posture. Accompanying accessories, made from eco-friendly soy resin, include a modular step that doubles as a stool and a side shelf, reinforcing the bath’s role as a restorative centerpiece in the modern home.the basins draw from the soft, fluid silhouette of the Calla Lilythe bathtub takes inspiration from the traditional Japanese ofuroproject info: brand: Roca | @roca_globalcollection: Ohtakedesigner: Rodrigo Ohtake | @__ohtake",
