They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too.  That installation was fairly easy, as each bulb has a spot where you can hang from a nail or screw:  These industrial string lights are heavy, so I recommend removing the bulbs while you install just to be safe.  How to connect patio lights to electricity. At both of our homes we had a wall plug run specifically for the lights. At our first home, we had an electrician run a dedicated outlet and an exterior switch so we could operate the lights from our pergola. When we built our current home, I had a plug installed into our covered patio ceiling. I hung an extension cord along the ceiling of our patio (and covered it because a hate cords) and now you barely notice it: BUT you don't need to have electricity to hang outdoor lights! Thankfully Feit also offers a solar-powered version in the same length. These solar lights would be a great option over a pool or water feature.Hanging lights from trees or structures. We were lucky to have some mature trees in our previous backyard. Keep in mind some trees work better than others because lights are commercial grade -- our river birch trees weren't strong enough for these heavy lights.You want to make sure the tree can withstand the weight of the lights in wind or snow.Also, the key to making sure your strands will stand the test of time is to use guide wires -- using a wire takes the weight off of the light strands and gives them solid support. We got wire and large eye hooks like this for our old pergola: They allow you to tighten the wires by twisting if needed. Even better, this patio light kit comes with everything you could need -- 150 feet of wire, turnbuckles and various hooks. After your wire is secure, attach the light strands with zip ties -- run them through the hole at the top (pictured above) and around the wire. As long as you get them tight the lights won't move anywhere. You can also run the wire through the lights before installing, but that seems like a pain and would make it way harder to move or take them down later on. Here's how the wires and lights look between trees when hung: I find the best, most pleasing string lights layout is to hang them in a zig zag pattern. So for example if it's between the house and trees, start at the house, then out to a tree, back to the house, etc.: At our previous home, we took them back and forth from the pergola to the trees: How to hang patio string lights when you don't have mature trees.There are a lot of tutorials out there for very basic light installations using these extendable light poles. These will work great if you are using lightweight cafe lights (not the industrial type we prefer), only have a short span to cover or you don't get a lot of wind or intense weather. If you don't plan to keep them up year-round, those would be a great option as well. Those light posts would work well for a temporary situation like a wedding reception or outdoor party.You can hang patio lights around the top of a fence or deck railing using these wood-mounted poles that vary in height. If your fence posts are installed well, these would be a great option for a smaller yard with a fence. This lasted for a long time, through storms and crazy snow, until last year when we had tornado level winds that nearly pulled one out of the ground. Because our backyard can be a literal wind tunnel, recently we had posts cemented into the ground: I'll share more about those in an upcoming backyard garden tour. If you don't have extreme winds or weather, our cement/staked planter method will work great!  No matter how you hang them, the work is worth it! The soft light in the evenings is hard to beat:",
