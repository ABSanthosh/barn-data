  "text": "Country Road and Tait — two icons of Australian design — have collaborated on a exciting outdoor furniture range designed and made in Melbourne. Named Saltbush, the collection features a Lounger, Occasional Table, and Side Table and is available from today at Country Road. Ty Symonds, general manager for Country Road Home, says the inspiration for Saltbush was born from the brands’ shared passion for celebrating the Australian lifestyle, particularly outdoor living. ‘We envisioned a collection that harmoniously blended the refined elegance of Country Road with the innovative craftsmanship of Tait, resulting in outdoor pieces that are not only functional, but exude understated luxury,’ says Ty. ‘We have felt in the presence of design royalty working alongside Susan and Gordon [the husband and wife founders of Tait]. The partnership allows for a creative synergy that not only respects each brand’s heritage but also explores new possibilities in design and functionality.’ The Saltbush range is a modern interpretation of nostalgic Australian design, with a nod to the outdoor experience, and the 1970s. The name references the native Australian plant, which bears the same hardy qualities as Tait’s furniture. ‘Tait has been making outdoor furniture for more than 30 years. We work with high-performance materials that will hold their form and finish, especially outside in the Australian climate,’ says Tait co-founder Susan Tait. The company’s Melbourne factory employs 25 craftspeople across welding, powder coating, timber, upholstery and other specialised trades. Pieces in the Saltbush collection feature a triple-coated metal finish for optimal corrosion resistance and a powder-coated UV stable colour. The boucle upholstery cushioning is made from a 100 per cent recycled and high-performance fabric specifically designed for outdoor use. ‘We introduced 70 per cent recycled porcelain with a travertine finish to the Occasional Table, to reflect the warmth and tactility of nature,’ says Susan. ‘The three-piece outdoor setting is nostalgic, stylish and practical, offering great versatility in the garden, by a pool, or even in a living room.’ Products in the Saltbush collection come with Tait’s 5-year structural warranty. The brand also offers a refurbishment service for customers looking to refresh their pieces and extend their life for generations to come. Saltbush by Country Road x Tait is available to view at Country Road’s South Yarra and Chadstone stores, and exclusively to shop online now.",
