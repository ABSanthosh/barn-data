  "description": "When Apple's Smart Folio for iPad came out, it seemed pretty nifty. The tri-fold cover attached magnetically and offered a couple of different viewing positions. However, tech accessories brand MOFT (\"Mobile Office For Travelers\") has designed this Dynamic Folio, which makes Apple's offering look positively primitive. MOFT's origami-based design elevates the tablet to a better height for reading, viewing or drawing.It can also be hooked on your thigh for stability… …and even offers a place to perch a phone, if you're drawing from reference material. In short, it offers a lot more versatility—and it's essentially the same thing as the Smart Folio, just with angled creases rather than straight ones. It's a tiny design change with an outsized impact. As humble as this product is, it ought be studied in design schools, as an example of doing a lot with a little.The MOFT Dynamic Folio has been successfully Kickstarted, with 20 days left to go at press time. Prices start at $39, and they expect to ship in May.",
