  "text": "Dubai-based developer Muraba teamed up with the Pritzker Prize-winning RCR Arquitectes to design the remarkable Muraba Veil. The Muraba Veil is an impressive and downright striking 38-meter skyscraper planned for downtown Dubai. It is a contemporary piece of architecture that captures the 10-year-long collaboration between Muraba and RCR Arquitectes. The skyscraper merges contemporary innovation with traditional components that draw inspiration from local heritage, creating an architectural design that is the best of both worlds. Designer: Muraba x RCR Arquitectes Of course, the skyscraper’s impressive height instantly draws attention, but so does its unusually slender and narrow form. It features a width of 22.5 meters while accommodating around 73 floors and 131 luxury apartments. Each apartment will run through the entire width of the building, ensuring residents have access to panoramic views from all directions. The towering structure will feature a range of premium and high-end amenities such as a spa, art gallery, padel court, restaurant, private cinema, and communal spaces that are inspired by the surrounding desert landscape. The Muraba Veil also showcases a “veil”, as its name signifies. The veil is a porous stainless steel mesh that surrounds the entire structure. It adapts to the light and elevates energy efficiency. The veil is a unique and innovative element showcasing how modern architectural techniques can be combined with traditional regional ideas such as the inner courtyard to create a space that feels novel, refreshing, and yet welcoming. The inner courtyard is incorporated to promote natural ventilation and privacy. Currently, the Muraba Veil is set for completion in December 2028. It will be an exciting and impressive addition to the Dubai skyline, completely redefining and rejuvenating with its one-of-a-kind slender profile, that stands apart from the other skyscrapers on the horizon. The tower’s eco-conscious design also helps set it apart, adding an environment-friendly member to the skyline club. It will be built next to a canal near Dubai’s main transport artery – the Sheikh Zayed Road. This skyscraper is the fifth collaboration between Muraba and RCR Arquitectes.",
