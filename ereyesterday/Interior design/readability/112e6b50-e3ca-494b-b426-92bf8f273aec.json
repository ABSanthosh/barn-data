  "text": "Designed by Modern Tiny Living, this adorable tiny home was designed for a beach resort in Siesta Key, Florida. Siesta Key is the ultimate summer location and this tiny home of the same name attempts to capture the same vibe. Even though it looks quite whimsical and playful, it still packs a punch with functionality. It offers the same comforts as a traditional home but is evidently more mobile and affordable. Designer: Modern Tiny Living The Siesta Key tiny home is spacious and welcoming. It can accommodate six people and features a clever layout with two lofts and a master bedroom on the main floor. The living area can also be converted into a makeshift bedroom if needed, with the help of a comfortable sofa bed. The home features a vibrant blue exterior, while the interior is white with a lovely beach theme. The home is 28 feet in length and also includes a built-in porch. The tiny covered porch is a wonderful addition and gives some access to the outdoors. As you enter the home, you are welcomed by a classic living area with a sofa and a 40″ LED TV on the wall. It also includes a clever staircase design, which offers easy access to each loft. It looks like a specimen of crafted cabinetry and features some lovely built-in storage. It showcases a dual or split design, which does take more space than ladders but is quite convenient and comfortable. The porch and the dual staircase are amplified with the presence of a family-sized kitchen. It is equipped with generous countertops, classic cabinets, and a pretty big sink. These are luxurious amenities that make up for the small appliances such as the mini-fridge. The bathroom is placed opposite the kitchen and concealed beneath a rustic sliding barn door. It includes all the basic amenities and some floating shelves. This space also contains a full-height close offering more storage compartments. The lofts and master bedroom are quite comfortable, too, with cozy beds and windows to allow the daylight to stream in.",
