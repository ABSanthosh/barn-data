  "text": "The Marshmallow apartment is where pink dreams come to life. It’s where every curve, every texture, and every shade whispers elegance. And the design is as soft as it looks! From the blush-toned backsplash to the cloud-like sofa—this apartment is quite like a love letter to modern whimsy. Come on in; let’s explore this pastel paradise. The standout piece in the living room is the curved blush sofa. It has a light base—accentuated with a darker, really feminine print. The cloud-like shape of the sofa is what adds this sense of softness to the ambiance. The mismatched cushions add asymmetry. In front of the couch, we see an organically shaped pink lucite coffee table. Lucite is a design secret to keeping the space feeling open (as the eye can see through it), while the tint of pink keeps the ambiance elegant. The coffee table books and mini sculptures add visual interest. In one corner, there’s a statement pink chair. This blends soft upholstery with metallic accents. The Tokyo flower market art leaning against the wall provides a fresh and modern aesthetic. Finally, a wavy white floor lamp adds a fun and sculptural element. The kitchen features a pink geometric tile backsplash. This sets the tone for a subtly playful ambiance. A sleek stainless steel faucet—with hints of pink—provides functionality but also adds to the beauty of the space. We especially love the ornate wall moldings, infusing Parisian elegance into the space. The soft pink cabinetry blends into the space. And the mosaic flooring introduces texture and movement. For the accessories—subtle elements like a white teapot, glass pitchers, and a marble tray enhance the soft luxury. The sculptural pink dining table joins the kitchen and living room. This is paired with rounded, upholstered chairs with cylindrical backrests, which offer comfort as well as a soft aesthetic. The focal point in this space is the translucent, petal-like chandelier—creating a whimsical feel. Not to forget the decorative ceiling medallion at the top, adding an architectural element. Finally, the sheer white curtains filter light beautifully. Plus, they add an airy and ethereal feeling to the space.",
