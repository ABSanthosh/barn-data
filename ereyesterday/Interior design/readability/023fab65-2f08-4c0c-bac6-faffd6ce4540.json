  "text": "In a city where luxury storefronts and urban heat dominate the pedestrian experience, an unexpected structure quietly shifts the atmosphere, both literally and metaphorically. The Climacool Teahouse, a collaboration between architecture firm line+ studio, adidas, and sustainability lab ZERO, emerges as a striking yet serene installation nestled in Chengdu’s Taikoo Li. Temporary in nature but lasting in impact, the teahouse offers a new way to think about architecture’s relationship with climate, material, and culture. Constructed entirely from bamboo and assembled in just five days, the teahouse is more than a spatial experiment; it’s an environmental gesture. Rooted in the principles of vernacular architecture and adapted through modern techniques, the project proposes a different kind of public space: one that responds to its surroundings with lightness, breathability, and emotional tactility. It’s not built to last forever, but it is built to leave a lasting impression. Designers: line+ studio At the heart of the installation is a circular grove of live bamboo, forming the core of the pavilion. These fresh stalks are bent radially inward and fixed between a lightweight ground anchoring system and a digitally fabricated canopy ring above. The effect is immersive: visitors find themselves stepping into a vertical forest, shaded and gently enclosed, while still surrounded by the vibrancy of the city. Hovering above, an LED ring references the movement of air and atmospheric change, subtly illuminating the space and guiding visitors’ visual focus upward. This design, interestingly, grew from a limitation. The original concept for the pavilion was a suspended, floating structure meant to evoke lightness and air. However, city safety regulations forced a rethinking of the approach, prompting the designers to ground their idea, literally, into something vertical and planted. What resulted is arguably more powerful: a living, growing form that grounds the installation in place, while still playing with notions of suspension and airiness. The architecture itself is composed of two concentric cylinders: an inner core of living bamboo and an outer shell made of woven bamboo strips that form vertical surfaces, seating, and a subtle interface with the surrounding plaza. The material selection is deeply intentional. Bamboo, a renewable and fast-growing resource, is a nod to both regional craftsmanship and ecological responsibility. It is also the project’s main structural and environmental agent, used not just for aesthetic unity, but for its flexibility, ease of assembly, and climatic performance. Cooling is an integral part of the design. Integrated misting systems, dry ice, and underfloor fans work together to generate a perceptible level-5 breeze, offering thermal comfort to those within the pavilion and even to passersby in the surrounding plaza. Beneath the central canopy, mist is released downward; around the perimeter, additional nozzles cool the bench zones. Floor-embedded fans create upward air movement, enhancing the effect and mirroring the high-performance qualities of adidas’s Climacool product line, for which the installation was partially conceived. However, the use of dry ice, while visually dramatic and effective in generating cool air, raises environmental considerations. The release of carbon dioxide may not align with broader sustainability goals, but given the project’s overall low-impact structure and short lifespan, it seems likely the team weighed these factors carefully and minimized their use. The misting and fan systems themselves rely on concealed mechanical and electrical infrastructure, cleverly integrated into the bamboo seating and structure to maintain the installation’s clean, organic aesthetic. Furniture elements, also made entirely of untreated bamboo, reflect Chengdu’s teahouse culture, grounding the futuristic concept in local tradition. Tables and seating are crafted using traditional methods, and these components extend beyond the installation: after the teahouse’s exhibition period, modular benches will be relocated throughout Chengdu, extending the project’s reach into everyday public spaces. In this way, the pavilion’s life continues long after the bamboo walls are disassembled. The real brilliance of the Climacool Teahouse lies in its impermanence. Designed to be assembled quickly and taken down just as efficiently, the structure exemplifies the potential of ephemeral architecture to influence how we experience the city. It isn’t a permanent fixture, but a moment of relief, reflection, and reconnection with nature in a highly commercialized setting. It challenges the notion that impactful design must be monumental or enduring; instead, it celebrates architecture as atmosphere, focusing on microclimatic comfort, sensory engagement, and community interaction.",
