  "text": "OODA recently unveiled the Hora Verticale in Tirana, Albania, and they are back with another banger – Ndarja. Ndarja is a square, high-rise building that will be located in central Tirana. It measures around 355,000 sq ft and will span over 22 floors. The word Ndarja roughly translates to split or separation in Albanian, which does the building justice, since it will be pulled apart to create two visually intriguing towers. One tower will accommodate office spaces on the lower floors and luxurious residences on the upper floors. The second tower will contain a retail space downstairs and a hotel on the upper stories. Designer: OODA The exterior is quite fascinating, and it will be covered with different plants and trees. The vegetation selected will be tough enough to handle the wind and sunlight while offering shade to the residents. The exterior will also include perforated metal sheeting to regulate the sunlight. The ground level will host a square with a reflective pool and more greenery. This space will be integrated between both towers. “A transparent water mirror serves as a portal at its core, drawing natural light underground and linking the exterior to the interior,” said OODA. “This open area integrates the greenery from the surrounding streets, the square, and the balcony gardens, creating a pleasant microclimate for the neighborhood. The square, no longer just a passageway, becomes a true urban oasis.” The facade is earthy-toned, allowing the structure to blend seamlessly with the city. The metal sheets reflect the balconies into the city, thereby mirroring the urban environment and creating an interaction that binds the inside and the surroundings. This forms a harmonious connection between the interior environment and the urban environment. The incredible project is currently in the licensing phase, and Ndarja is expected to be constructed in 2029. This impressive project is a part of a large construction effort in Tirana which includes multiple other impressive buildings such as the Bond Tower and Klan TV HQ by OODA, and other structures by BIG and MVRDV.",
