  "text": "Bali is no stranger to breathtaking villas—but Villa Santina takes it to a whole other level. This tropical retreat is nestled amidst lush greenery. It brings together bohemian charm and modern minimalism, creating a space that’s luxurious. From the sunlit open-plan kitchen to the serene outdoor poolside, Villa Santina embodies the essence of laid-back island living. Let’s walk through this boho retreat, photographed by Danang Seta. The Villa Santina features an open-plan (and airy) living room, dining area, and kitchen. The kitchen features a white central island with four wooden bar stools. The even number adds a traditional touch to the space. The wicker pendant lights create a statement while also illuminating the area. In the center, the dining table is made from natural wood, and topped with another rattan pendant light. The black metallic legs of the table factor in luxury. The table runner is woven and features colors inspired by the seaside: blues, beiges, and golds. Behind the table is a staircase, under which we see an assortment of gravel and tropical plants. A wooden slat partition segregates the dining area from the living room. In the living space, a neutral sectional sofa sits low to the floor. This adds an airy vibe while providing functionality. A bold-colored rug sets just the right bohemian base, while the organic wooden coffee table brings in nature. From every space in the open floor plan, large windows and glass doors give boosting views of the great outdoors. The bedroom in Villa Santina is a bohemian oasis. The bed is minimalist with a slat wooden headboard. It is flanked by natural pendant lights. Large potted plants and a colorful rug bring in a relaxed vibe. The focal point is the freestanding bathtub, offering views of the outdoors as the residents enjoy a soak. We love the workstation with the abstract-realistic artwork. The bathroom is minimalist, featuring a double vanity and matte black hardware. Recessed shelving provides room to store essentials, while the double showerheads make sure everyone gets their own space to shower. A countertop potted plant and wooden elements make the bathroom feel as boho as it gets. Villa Santini is as stunning outdoors as it is indoors. There’s an open and airy vibe, dominated by large tropical plants. A pool is lit by LED lights during the night. Next to it are four chaise lounges, making sure residents can have a comfortable yet enjoyable time outdoors.",
