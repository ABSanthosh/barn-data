  "text": "Saudi Arabia is currently constructing a spectacular skyscraper called the Mukaab! The impressive build will adopt the form of a tall cube. It will stand tall at a height of 1,312 feet in the capital of Riyadh. It will also be as long and wide as it is tall and could fit around 20 Empire State Buildings inside of it, according to the Saudi Government’s Public Investment Fund. Bloomberg says it will be the world’s largest building! How incredible! Designer: AtkinsRéalis \u0026 New Murabba The exterior will be decorative and intricate, drawing inspiration from traditional Islamic architecture. The interior will occupy a floor space of 2 million square meters. The center will include a massive twisting tower, imagine a large box with another large twisting structure within it. It will also feature a holographic system that will showcase underwater and otherworldly scenes within the cuboidal structure. Currently, there aren’t too many details about this feature, but it does sound quite exciting. “New Murabba will also construct a temporary bridge that will serve as a critical enabler, connecting the construction site by crossing King Khalid Road,” said developer New Murabba’s press release. “This connection will facilitate ongoing development and pave the way for the initiation of Mukaab piling in the coming months. The bridge is expected to reduce approximately 800,000 truck movements on public roads for earthworks alone, showcasing a positive impact on the surrounding infrastructure. With around 900 workers on-site daily, work is advancing rapidly, bringing the destination closer.” The excavation work for the Mukaab is almost over, and nearly 350 million cubic feet of earth have been removed. This work needed the usage of 250 excavators every day, and around 400 pieces of equipment to handle all the soil. The construction workers devoted nearly 3 million hours of labor. A bridge is also being built to ensure smooth operation and processes. The Mukaab will complete construction in 2030.",
