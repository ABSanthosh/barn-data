  "text": "Lewis Schulz and Nina Johansen discovered Carlie Fraser of Hygge Design when looking to create a Scandi inspired-house in Victoria’s Macedon Ranges. Nina was born in Norway, and the couple had lived together in Copenhagen for the past nine years, so they were interested in a familiar style of home when returning to Australia. Given the beautiful vista of their Woodend property, Carlie took a ‘less is more’ approach to the project, driven by three key principles: simplicity and functionality; sustainability; and hygge. Carlie describes the hygge concept, ‘It is about an atmosphere and a feeling. It is a daily practice — about being with the people you love, a feeling of home. ‘It is togetherness, warmth, relaxation and the simple pleasures in life – about being in the moment and appreciating the little things in our daily lives.’ The home’s cabin-like interiors — styled with vintage furniture and bookshelves to display cherished pieces — support this practice. ‘Comfortable leather chairs for reading (iconic Norwegian Falcon chairs, a nod to Nina’s heritage), a playful rug from Muuto, and a welcoming Toulouse sofa with sculptural lines from Anaca Studio all make for a cosy, relaxed space to unwind and connect with loved ones,’ says Carlie. In contrast to the black timber-clad facade, and the moody ‘Danish-noir’ kitchen designed with White Pebble Interiors, the living and dining spaces are playful, featuring ample north light and cool-toned blue and green accents. Carlie says the completed home is an expression of Lewis, Nina, and their children that enables a life well lived. ‘We really believe the home reflects Nina and Lewis so well. It tells their unique story and allows them to do more of what they love with ease and simplicity.’",
