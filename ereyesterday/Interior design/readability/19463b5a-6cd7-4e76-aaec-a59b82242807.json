  "text": "sawdust makes up ‘Stuffing’ furniture seriesThe Stuffing Series by designer Junmyung Song metaphorically applies the concept of taxidermy to furniture design. Traditionally, taxidermy preserves the original form of a deceased being, allowing it to be remembered. Drawing inspiration from this process, the stool series explores how an object’s essence can persist through transformations in form and material.The series uses sawdust as its primary material, historically employed in taxidermy as an internal substance to preserve forms. Here, sawdust shifts from its hidden, supportive role to the surface, shaping new forms of furniture. These forms are then cast in metal, blending the organic and artificial. The process contrasts the warm, textured quality of sawdust with the cold, rigid materiality of metal, creating a dialogue between natural and man-made, original and replica.all images courtesy of Junmyung SongJunmyung Song combines sawdust and metalSawdust, in this series, transcends its practical role, symbolizing transformation and reconfiguration. As a byproduct of trees—once-living organisms—it carries traces of decomposition yet gains new significance as a central element. By elevating this secondary material to prominence, Junmyung Song’s work challenges conventional boundaries: interior versus exterior, auxiliary versus central, life versus non-life.The combination of sawdust and metal provokes a deeper question: ‘What defines essence? ‘The contrast between organic material and industrial techniques underscores this inquiry, suggesting that essence and identity extend beyond external appearances.
