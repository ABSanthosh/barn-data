  "text": "Nike seems to be on a roll, innovating beyond the obvious territories. After its collaborative Monopoly Game Set with Hasbro, the Swoosh brand is now teaming up with German shoe company, Zellerfeld, to give its original Air Max a 3D printed makeover in a vibrant red laceless design. Nike Air Max 1 originally designed by Tinker Hatfield has always had a special place in our hearts for the incredible future-forward design. Easily the greatest sneaker, the Air Max is now a revolution, which has come a long way since its inception with continuous air technology innovations with every new release. This time it’s not the sole or regular manufacturing, in fact, it’s the entire thought of the shoe that will rock the show at ComplexCon 2024. Designer: Nike Zellerfeld founded in 2015, is a shoe company that specializes in 3D-printing thoughtful designs. Nike collaborated with the German outfit to delve into Air Max legacy and bring out a 3D-printed re-imagination that would launch at the ComlexCon on November 16 and 17, 2024. The groundbreaking rendition of the iconic Air Max 1, the Nike Air Max 1000, showcases the evolution of air technology along with new manufacturing techniques. This combination of Air and 3D printing creates an engaging underfoot experience that according to the design team produces “the same comfort and responsiveness” of the original silhouette. At the foundation of this new creation of course is Nike’s obsession with cushioning besides that Air band and the mudguard wave make apparent nuances that tag the 3D printed version to the original. The wavy lines forming the mudguard and the air unit in the heel do not make the Air Max 1000 much different, but the sneaker’s laceless design truly propels it into a new fan category – delightfully pleasing in a bright red colorway. The blend of smooth and textured print in the upper half of the AM 1000, goes well with the single Swoosh banding and the carved outsole. There is no word on the price, but I believe, the sneaker is worth whatever it comes for!",
