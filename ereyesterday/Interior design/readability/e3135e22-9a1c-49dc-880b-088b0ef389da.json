  "description": "Cast your mind back to the places you stayed at school camp. They were simple, filled with nostalgia, and most importantly, had enough room to accommodate enormous groups for a week of fun in the outdoors. Well, staying at the South Coast Sandcastles in Jervis Bay, New South Wales is just like that. But the beachside compound’s three cabins have been renovated to include all the  you could dream of.",

  "text": "When Alex Herlihy and his friends bought three very dilapidated cabins on the South Coast of New South Wales, everyone expected them to turn the Jervis Bay site into a development. Instead, the business partners — who also run wedding venue Wildwood Kangaroo Valley — had other plans. ‘I have always loved the idea of running properties that focus on groups of friends being able to get together, enjoy the outdoors and each other’s company,’ Alex says. The quirky and nostalgic property was the perfect place for their next endeavour: a 20-person accommodation dubbed The South Coast Sandcastles, which opened after a major renovation by Studio Williams. ‘When we first inspected them with Alex, they were pretty much uninhabitable with a barely functioning kitchen and bathroom, vinyl and carpet on the floors, and faux timber walls,’ Studio Williams director Adam Williams says. ‘We also wanted to make the three cabins feel as though they were part of a little commune or holiday campsite, so you could hang out with your friends if you wanted to, but also there was enough separation and privacy if required.’ They stripped back some of the more ‘cottage-like’ fake shutters and tired features, in order to channel the charming look of a ’70s Australian beach shack. Fashion designer Isabel Marant’s cottage in the French countryside, and the Salmon Creek Farm retreat in California also served as inspirations for the eclectic cabins. The lofty raked lofty ceilings clad in pine were retained, as new painting and custom signage now highlights the dwelling’s playful names — Seahorse Manor, Shell House, and Porpoise Palace. Each of the getaways features full kitchens, outdoor showers, barbecues, and enough room for between six and eight guests. And the hippy-yet-chic styling is the cherry on top. ‘Staying at The Sandcastles is like going on school camp with all the mod cons,’ Alex says. ‘We love a beach cabin that is designed for sandy feet and quick swims. We are lucky to have local businesses like WEBEGONE [free-diving] who take our guests on adventures, and a buzz in town with restaurants like Bud’s Tavern and Taj Indian just five minutes down the road.’ The cabins are available for individual short stays, or you can book out the full property!
