  "text": "Called the Escapade Silverstone, this incredible new residence offers a view of the iconic British race circuit Silverstone. It is designed by Twelve Architects, and includes around 60 residences. The building was first unveiled in 2020, and the residences have been arranged in three rows with an attractive design that draws inspiration from slipstreaming.  The first row is 40 feet away from the racetrack. Designer: Twelve Architects “The articulation of their form and appearance is inspired by the concept of ‘slipstreaming,’ where a vehicle follows closely behind another, traveling in its slipstream and awaiting an opportunity to overtake,” said the studio. “To capture this, the front-row residences consist of two modules, stacked on top of one another and slightly rotated, so the massing of the upper floors are splayed in plan. “They cantilever outwards from a landscaped bund, towards the track and pedestrian walkway, creating a dramatic and dynamic frontage to the site. Each residence has been carefully positioned at different angles along the front row, creating a sense of movement, as though each building has been swept along in the tailwind of the cars speeding past,” the studio concluded. The other residences have been placed behind the front row, and they offer views of the track and the surrounding country, or only the countryside depending on the location. The homes host between two and four bedrooms, and are quite flexible. They can be separated into smaller suites with the help of sound-insulated, moveable walls. Guests can book some time on the track on non-race days as well, so they can experience the iconic circuit themselves. The property also includes a clubhouse with a restaurant, bar, swimming pool, and a “driver-focused” gym. The homes are designed to provide a boutique hotel experience, and a few of the homes are available for sale. Currently, there is no information about the pricing, but it would be on the heftier side for sure.",
