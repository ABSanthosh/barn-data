Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Rug Source // Bamboo Shades // More dining sources at end Once upon a time, in a very cheerful spring dining room, there lived a puppy named Finnegan. He was the happiest, smiliest pup you‚Äôve ever met‚Äîtail wagging, eyes sparkling, always ready for a good time. One sunny afternoon, Finnegan spotted something extraordinary on the dining table‚Ä¶ A paper towel. It called to him. Whispered his name. Promised adventure. But oh‚Äîwhat Finnegan didn‚Äôt know was that this magical paper towel was secretly the foundation for‚Ä¶ An OPEN CAN OF WHITE PAINT. üò± As Finnegan gently tugged on his prize, gravity took over. Cue slow motion: the paint can tipped‚Ä¶ tilted‚Ä¶ and‚ÄîSPLAT! right across a new RIFLE PAPER CO. RUG that the brand had just sent us. Oh dear! From the other side of the room, my husband witnessed the chaos unfolding. He launched himself into action like an Olympic hurdler, but alas, he was one leap too late. Paint everywhere. Puppy footprints. Panic. And then‚Ä¶ silence.Finnegan stood proudly, now sporting several new stylish white spots. üê∂‚ú® But here‚Äôs the plot twist:THE NEW RIFLE PAPER CO. RUG SURVIVED. üôå Rug Source // Bamboo Shades // More dining sources at end Not only is the rug absolutely gorgeous with its delightful spring colors and floral pattern‚Äîit‚Äôs also puppy-proof and apparently paint-spill-approved. So yes, I am thrilled to help celebrate the launch of the Rifle Paper Co. rug line with Loloi Rugs because if this rug can survive Finnegan, it can survive anything. 10/10 recommend. Finnegan gives it two (paint-speckled) paws up. :) He has a lot to learn about being a rug model, but I am sure his big brother Jack the Goldendoodle (rug model extraordinaire) would be so proud of him.
