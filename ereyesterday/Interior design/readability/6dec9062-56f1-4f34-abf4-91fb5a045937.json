Located in Pudong District, Artyzen New Bund 31 hotel forms part of a larger development called Qiantan, which includes an office tower and a shopping centre. The scalloped details on the entrance facade is to resonate with the arches used in the adjacent performing arts centreThe hotel, which is connected directly to the New Bund Performing Arts Centre, contains a total of 202 guest rooms is a tower above a podium. Alongside the entrance of the hotel on the ground floor, Neri\u0026Hu created a scallop-shaped concrete facade to recall the arches of the performing arts centre. A large circular opening allows natural light into the ground floor lobbyGuests can go to the hotel reception on the fifth floor either directly from this gound ground floor entrance or via a lounge on the third floor that connects to performing arts centre. According to the Shanghai-based Neri\u0026Hu, the hotel was conceived as having been carved from a single monolithic mass. The ground floor lobby features a large circular opening punctuating the ceiling, inviting natural light flooding into the otherwise enclosed space. The hotel is designed to be an \"urban oasis\"The firth floor, which is the top of the podium block, contains all the shared amenities including reception, lounges, restaurants, event spaces, and outdoor gardens. The facilities were placed in pavilions, which were arranged in a stone landscape that acts as a garden-like experience for guests. \"The hotel is envisioned as an urban oasis that takes its guests on a journey of surprise and discovery,\" said Neri\u0026Hu. \"With an abundance of outdoor landscape spaces, Artyzen Qiantan offers a rare experience in an urban hotel, a sense of respite and escape from the bustling city of Shanghai,\" it continued. A series of pavilions containing facilities are located on the fifth floor. Photo by Branston Partnership IncThe colour palette for the guest rooms was informed by traditional Chinese gardens, mindful of the nature theme that is consistent throughout the hotel. Grey stone wraps the entry and bathroom of each room, while wooden bed frames bring a sense of warmth, with bronze metal details adding a touch of luxury. Custom furniture pieces by Neri\u0026Hu create a sense of home and casualness for the guests. Guest rooms were designed to create a home-like experienceNeri\u0026Hu was founded by architects Lyndon Neri and Rossana Hu in Shanghai in 2006. Along with the New Bund Performing Arts Centre, the studio recently completed a residential block in Taiwan. The photography is by Pedro Pegenaute unless otherwise stated.
