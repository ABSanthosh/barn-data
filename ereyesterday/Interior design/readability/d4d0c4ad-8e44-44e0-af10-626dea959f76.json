Inspired by the personal computers from the late 1980s and early 1990s, the concept model contains 2,286 pieces and includes a CRT monitor, a classic keyboard, and a wired mouse. On the side of the CPU, there’s even a functional-looking floppy drive that can be ejected, and it doubles as the container of the swappable pixelated screens. For the model, each of the screens revives the retro interfaces: one is designed as a TV flashing the colorful signal error, another shows a desktop opening a file, one is in a paint program, and the last features a black screen with white lines that depict simulating code. all images courtesy of PovedaBricks via LEGO IdeasDesign of retro personal computer made of LEGO blocksFor the retro personal computer made of LEGO blocks, creator PovedaBricks adds a wired keyboard with circular keys without any printed letters as well as a mouse with a grip. The wires are a nostalgic touch in the age of wireless devices, with the plugs located right behind the monitor of the model. For the CPU, the creator adds air vents on the left side and the buttons on the right part. Here, the blocks are colored, so the users feel that they’re powering up or switching off the model (at the moment, there’s no news yet whether or not they can be pressed).At the back of the retro personal computer made of LEGO blocks, the CPU still features the vents, and the shape of the monitor faithfully captures the style of the devices back then. There’s a wire connecting the monitor and keyboard, and from behind, users can see the rear of the bricks attached to the display. The creator says, ‘I built this set as a tribute to the early days of home computing, and I believe it would make a great display piece for fans of technology, digital history, and, of course, LEGO.’ At the time of publishing, the retro personal computer made of LEGO blocks by creator PovedaBricks is still an idea and not yet an actual set.rear view of the retro personal computer made of LEGO bricksthe concept model comes with wired keyboard and mousethere’s even an ejectable disc driveview of the screen with the paint programthere’s a functional-looking floppy drive on the side of the CPU that can be ejected",
