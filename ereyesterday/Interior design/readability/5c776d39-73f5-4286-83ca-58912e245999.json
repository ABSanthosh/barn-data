  "text": "Designed by WOHA, the Pan Pacific Orchard is located in Singapore, and was recently named the Best Tall Building Worldwide for 2024. The title was bestowed by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH), which is the leading authority on skyscrapers. The structure’s “hotel in nature” concept won it the award, since the design includes a lot of greenery, creating a cool ambiance in tropical Singapore. The Pan Pacific Orchard has a height of 461 feet and a rectangular form. It is equipped with 35 floors and 347 rooms. The front-facing facade showcases massive open-air terraces, which have been populated with plants and trees. Designer: WOHA Each terrace has its unique theme and name. The Forest Terrace on the ground floor features a lovely cascading water plaza and many trees. While, the Beach Terrace includes a beautiful oasis with a lagoon, tall palm groves, and a sandy beachfront. The Garden Terrace is farther up and accommodates the bar and lounge, as well as a lush manicured garden with planter beds and reflection pools. The Cloud Terrace is the highest and includes an events plaza, ballroom, planters, reflection pools, and a function room. The various terrace spaces ar connected with the inside of the hotel, allowing light and ventilation to touch the interiors, creating a comfortable environment in tropical Singapore. “The project departs from conventional tower designs by carving out large open-air atria that not only reduce the building’s environmental footprint but also foster interaction between nature, the city, and its many diverse communities,” said CTBUH. “Its semi-outdoor tropical climate reduces reliance on mechanical cooling systems, while its 45 percent external to 55 percent internal surface area ratio optimizes energy efficiency. These features align with Singapore’s broader sustainability goals and reflect a global push to lower the environmental impact of dense urban environments.” The Pan Pacific Orchard focuses heavily on greenery, nature, and vegetation. It also features solar panels, which reduces the reliance on the grid. It also has facilities for rainwater collection, and food waste is also processed on the property. The skyscraper also won CTBUH’s Best Tall Building 100 – 199 meters Category Award and the Space Within Category Award.",
