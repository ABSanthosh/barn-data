  "text": "Gustav Rosén presents sculptural weather stationSwedish designer and engineer Gustav Rosén, in collaboration with design brand Klong, introduces Skymill, a sculptural weather station that transforms real-time meteorological data into a kinetic home experience. Bringing together Scandinavian design, precision mechanics, and ambient awareness, Skymill translates complex atmospheric changes into tangible motions. Its metal arms and weather symbols shift to reflect conditions like sun, clouds, rain, wind, thunder, and fog, not as numbers on a screen, but as an ever-changing performance of the sky. ‘With Skymill, I wanted to create something that respects the way we used to look at the sky. It doesn’t reduce the weather to numbers on a screen, but lets you reconnect with it,’ says Gustav Rosén.images courtesy of Gustav Rosén and Klongskymill doubles as a mood lamp while tracking air qualityWith its nine weather symbols capable of forming over 35 unique combinations, Skymill acts as a mechanical weather display powered by continuously updated real-time data. A discreet physical button lets users toggle between the current weather and forecasts for 3, 6, 9 hours, or a full day ahead. Once activated, a soft light glows at the top, doubling as a cozy mood lamp.Stockholm-based Gustav Rosén’s design connects to a mobile app, allowing users to monitor weather anywhere — at home, at a vacation spot, or even across the globe. Indoors, a slim diode display reveals precise temperature readings, while an integrated air quality sensor tracks CO₂, dust, and irritants. When indoor air quality dips below recommended levels, a small bird gently flies out of a metal cage, ‘a modern nod to the canaries once used in mines to warn of dangerous gases.’ Skymill is a sculptural weather stationreconnecting with the skyRosén, whose work moves between IT and product design, was inspired by his lifelong fascination with mechanics and nature. The concept behind Skymill grew from a desire to reconnect with the sky in a more tactile way. ‘As our everyday lives become increasingly digital, I felt a longing for something more tangible. People have long built complicated mechanical objects, both for function and for pure entertainment – everything from barometers to cuckoo clocks and music machines.’ he shares.The partnership with Klong was a natural fit. CEO Georg Hedendahl saw the potential of Skymill early on and became an integral part of the project. ‘Our vision is to develop objects where function, material, and form merge into something valuable—objects that last, that people appreciate, and never tire of. Our brand is based on care, from production to delivery—care for both people and nature. We only work with designers who dare to create their own expression without following trends,’ says Klong’s CEO Georg Hedendahl.transforming real-time meteorological data into a kinetic home experienceSkymill translates complex atmospheric changes into tangible motions",
