  "text": "Designed by Yevheniia Nahorna, the Whisperwood Home intertwines serenity and sophistication. There is an intentional blend of minimalism and warmth—something we don’t see often in homes—creating an atmosphere that invites you to slow down, breathe deeply, and savor the beauty of thoughtful design. Stepping inside will give you a better look. The living room is anchored by a plush sectional sofa. The centerpiece, a wooden coffee table, adds natural warmth. This perfectly complements the rich wood-paneled walls that frame the room. Simultaneously, a textured area rug makes the ambiance inviting. A large projector allows residents to curl up in front of their favorite TV show. The houndstooth pattern is the tying element in the open floor plan. We see this used for the cushions as well as the dining table chairs. The dining area also features a large, wooden table. Floor-to-ceiling curtains in creamy beige diffuse natural light throughout the space; this creates a soft, ambient glow during the day. At the far end, the open kitchen has a unique marble backsplash. The cabinetry is sleek—combining hues of beige and wooden elements. There is also shelving to display wine glasses! The master bedroom in the Whisperwood Home sticks to a minimalist bed—allowing wooden panels to act as the headboard. There is a vanity with a round mirror and a houndstooth-patterned chair. You can easily use this as a reading station, too. A wooden console table is paired with a statement, ceramic-framed mirror. This provides extra storage while doubling as decor. In the kids’ room, an illustration of animals incorporates a whimsical touch. The yellow scalloped-edge mirror adds a soft shape to the room. Additionally, the single bed provides ample room for a child to lie down, while the playful nightstand adds color. There’s also a study area with red shelving and a table lamp. The bathrooms in the Whisperwood Home use the same marble patterns we saw in the kitchen. Wooden cabinetry and vanities add warmth to the interior, while shower cubicles segregate functionality. The master bathroom also features a marble-tiled bathtub. And the toilets in both bathrooms are wall-mounted, adding a sleek vibe.",
