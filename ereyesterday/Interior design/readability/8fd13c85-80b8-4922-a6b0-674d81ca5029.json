I am sure you know the saying…. “Baby It’s Cold Outside” right? Well, over the past 9 days I have been saying…. “Baby it’s cold INSIDE”. A few days after Thanksgiving, Ed and I noticed that the house felt chillier than normal, but thought it was just because the weather did get colder outside. Then when we woke up the next morning the indoor temp displayed on the thermostat was 52, we knew the heat pump that heats the first floor of the house was not working. Long story short, we have been without heat since then. The HVAC techs have been here 3 times telling us it is fixed after they left each time. The most recent fix was on Friday and same thing…. still not fixed. Brrrrrr!!! Having the heat not working while at the same time the ceilings are getting redone has taken out a little bit of the cozy feeling I like to create in the house this time of year. The only thing keeping us from freezing is that our house has two zones/heat pumps. The second floor unit is working fine so it is keeping the second floor a bit too warm since it is cranked up and the main floor from getting unbearably cold. That and wearing lots of layers, cozy warm socks while snuggled under a big fur throw as I write this is keeping me warm. I am hoping that by early next week, the HVAC techs can figure out what the real problem is and fix it. Hope you are staying cozy and warm.
