All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.As Apartment Therapy’s Associate Home Editor, I see many incredible, clever spaces. I’m always impressed by how people not only create spaces that reflect their character or desires, but also make the home work for them. For example, they might carve out more storage space in a small apartment or find ways to organize a bedroom without closets. So when I stumbled upon what I thought was solely the office in Gerardo Tiscareño Castro’s contemporary Jersey City apartment, I was blown away by what I continued to discover. At first glance, Gerardo’s office looks like the perfect place to get work done or cozy up with one of the many books on the wallpapered bookshelf. (The French blue color alone instantly makes me feel more relaxed — no wonder it’s Gerardo’s favorite room.) However, Gerardo’s office has a hidden element that appears to those who know how to look for it. The front bookshelves slide open to reveal a gorgeous Murphy bed discreetly hidden behind the bookshelf. Murphy beds aren’t a new concept, but the way Gerardo has disguised his instantly shocked me. I would’ve never guessed that there was a bed hiding behind the shelves. Speaking of the shelves, because the doors slide open, you’re not missing the entirety of the built-in shelving once the bed is down. Guests still have a place to put a water glass or store their phone while sleeping. The Murphy bed gives Gerardo the best of both worlds — what was once a one-bedroom apartment became two, allowing for guests to spend the night. And when it’s just him and his husband, Timothy, it’s a wonderful, spacious office to focus or unwind in. Plus, the slideable, built-in shelving makes the bed look more like a permanent fixture when down (and there’s still room for Gerardo’s desk in the corner). If you don’t have space for a traditional guest bedroom but want to have the option to host overnight stays, consider the sliding doors with bookshelves to disguise a foldable bed. But this isn’t the only gorgeous feature in Gerardo’s apartment. To see more, visit the full home tour.",
