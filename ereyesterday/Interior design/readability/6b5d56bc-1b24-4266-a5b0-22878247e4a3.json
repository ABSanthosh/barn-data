  "description": "Harley-Davidson has pivoted with the times. Once known for producing heavy, gas-powered, ear-splitting hogs, the company released its Livewire electric motorcycle in 2019; it then spun Livewire off as its own electric motorcycle brand. And Livewire is now reaching downmarket to target consumers you'd never associate with H-D: The scooter crowd.\"LiveWire is excited to announce the expansion of our strategic partnership with globally recognized powersports company KYMCO, in creating LiveWire's debut maxi-scooter.\"As you can see, they're planning both an off-road version and a city version. Both will be powered by the company's S2 electric powertrain. And while these are just concept images, the company says \"We intend to enter this category in a way that only LiveWire can, with products that stand apart visually, technically, and experientially.\" The company says these will hit the market in 2026.",
