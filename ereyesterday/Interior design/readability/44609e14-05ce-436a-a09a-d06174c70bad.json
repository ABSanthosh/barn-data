All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Have you ever cooked a big meal, pots and pans piling up, dirty dishes overflowing, no counter space left for you to take a breather? So have I. Now, imagine if you could tuck the mess away, hidden where none of your guests were even aware of it — poof, out of sight, out of mind. That’s exactly what the hottest kitchen design trend of the year does.With a “dirty kitchen,” another room separate from your primary kitchen, you can tuck the day-to-day mess of cooking and cleaning away, leaving the “main kitchen” tidy for entertaining and hosting. It’s a simple concept really, so it’s no surprise it’s at the top of 2025 kitchen design trend lists for this year. But simple isn’t always cheap!What Is a “Dirty Kitchen,” and How Do You Get One?Depending on your home’s floor plan and the space already available to you, adding a “dirty kitchen,” which is similar to a butler’s pantry, but with room for appliances and a stovetop, is typically in the tens of thousands. Adding a second space dedicated to prep, cooking, and cleaning is no doubt a luxury, which makes it unsurprising that the concept of butler’s pantries comes from the need to house valuable heirlooms such as china, crystal, and platters under lock and key back in the late 18th century, according to Bob Bakes, cofounder and head of design at Bakes \u0026 Kropp Fine Cabinetry. They were popular in “formal, luxurious households of that day,” and offered a place to prepare meals and keep extra storage, he says.How Do People Use “Dirty Kitchens” Today?Now, modern homeowners have redefined this extra kitchen space for present-day cooking and entertaining needs. According to Niko Rasides, design director at Nicholas Anthony, the pandemic redefined how people use their homes, with many seeking designs that maximize both efficiency and comfort (not to mention people fleeing cities for larger spaces for less in more suburban or rural settings).“By moving the mess of cooking and preparation to a secondary space, the primary kitchen becomes an inviting, pristine area for socializing and showcasing design elements,” Rasides says. “This separation can also extend the life of countertops and cabinetry in the main kitchen, as they’re exposed to less wear and tear. It’s a practical solution for blending function with form.”Gladys Schanstra, owner of Drury Design in Chicago, recently worked on a project for a client who wanted to build a secondary “dirty kitchen” designed specifically to handle a large variety of spices and ingredients used in traditional Indian cooking. “This ‘spice kitchen’ is a ‘dirty kitchen,’ but that doesn’t mean it’s ugly or commercial-looking with stainless everywhere,” Schanstra says.In fact, because these second kitchens are typically situated between the kitchen and dining spaces, Paul Kropp, cofounder and COO of Bakes \u0026 Kropp, explained that they are design-centric and meant to be seen, “so it’s another space where homeowners can showcase their personalities.”While the “dirty kitchens” you might see in home and design magazines might look more fancy and seem unobtainable, Schanstra explains that the idea is actually pretty simple and common around the world. “In certain countries, a dirty kitchen is still outside. I grew up with one in the Philippines — that’s where you did all your grilling and dirty cooking, then brought the food inside,” Schanstra says. Credit: PhotoMavenStock / ShutterstockWhy Are “Dirty Kitchens” Controversial?All in all, the concept remains the same: A “dirty kitchen” offers a space to cook freely without interference in the space reserved for entertaining and enjoying a meal with guests. Though because it isn’t easily accessible or financially feasible to add to most homes, it remains luxurious and somewhat controversial to be seen as a “trend.”While it can be expensive to carve out the space to create a “dirty kitchen,” ​​Schanstra believes that it doesn’t have to be a massive project. “It doesn’t have to be this big deal. If someone wants to separate the two spaces, you can carve it out through design,” Schanstra says. “Good design can make a dirty kitchen possible in just about any home.”",
