With a commitment to materiality, process, and collaboration, the Amsterdam– and Mumbai-based brand partners with craftspeople across India to create objects that embrace natural imperfections, patinas, and the unique signatures of handmade production. Its approach prioritizes locally sourced and upcycled materials, produced in small batches or made-to-order to minimize waste.In this year’s showcase, the designer duo features sculptural shelving from reclaimed wood, inspired by Channapatna’s woodturning heritage, geometric chairs that honor Indian carpentry, and vibrantly lacquered spice grinders rooted in local artisanal techniques. Built Editions uses reclaimed materials and artisanal processes to create furniture and objects that support handcraft, sustainable production, and cultural narratives—helping Indian craftspeople preserve their traditions and pass them on to future generations.the Square Chair | all images by Sameer Prabhu, courtesy of Built Editions, unless stated otherwiseindian materials and plant-based dyes preserve heritage craftFounded by Anne Geenen and David Schmidt as an extension of their architecture and design studio Site Practice, Built Editions brand employs traditional Indian craftsmanship and materials for their pieces. Rooted in the woodturning crafts of Channapatna, India, the Lac Shelves combine heritage techniques with modern form. Reclaimed teak planks sourced from old buildings are sculpted with smooth curves and supported by lacquered wooden elements. Finished with natural tung oil and edged in white zinc oxide, the design combines rustic warmth with sleek black structural elements. Spherical fasteners, made from a resin commonly used in children’s toys and dyed with plant-based pigments, add color and function, giving the shelving its distinctive character.Crafted from intersecting square timber sections, the Square Chair intertwines precise joinery with a soft, inviting feel. Available in indigo-dyed oak or oiled reclaimed teak, it pays tribute to India’s woodworking traditions while embracing contemporary form. Its semi-circular ends offer ergonomic comfort, and the woven seat, inspired by traditional ‘charpai’ daybeds, ensures breathability, perfect for warmer climates. For even more versatility, an upholstered version is also offered. Hand-turned by artisans in Channapatna, the Spice Grinder embodies India’s rich lacquerware tradition. Available in two sizes, the grinders are covered in natural dyes sourced from turmeric, kumkum, and indigo, giving each piece its bold hues.the Amsterdam– and Mumbai-based brand partners with craftspeople across Indiathe Lac Shelves combine heritage techniques with modern formreclaimed teak planks sourced from old buildings are sculpted with smooth curvescrafted from intersecting square timber sections | image by Vihan Shah",
