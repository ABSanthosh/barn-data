They are also looking at the product as a \"service platform\" and are constantly measuring the business risks and business value of any idea while they are prototyping. If they are an admirable organization, they are looking at the social value of an idea from the inception of a design project all the way through the narratives through which they market the idea.\"Chochinov adds, \"We need designers to have skills and to be comfortable in all of these facets of design because if they don't, they will not be in the meetings where decisions get made.

If you are a designer who does not understand finance, you will for sure not be in the meetings where strategic decisions get made—you will just be 'handed a decision' of what the leadership team has decided to make, and told to 'make it.'
