  "text": "Whether you’re decorating a compact room, or seeking a centrepiece for your apartment, there’s plenty of design scenarios that call for a gorgeous small sofa. Our favourite products in this category tick all the boxes expected of a larger sofa while packing an aesthetic and functionality punch! For design lovers, it’s hard to look past sculptural pieces, such as the Sofacompany Rose Boucle 2.5 Seater Sofa from Life Interiors, or the dramatic Ligne Roset Ploum Settee designed by Ronan \u0026 Erwan Bouroullec from DOMO. Plumper and structured pieces offer a more modern look. We love the Wendelbo Montholon 2.5 Seater Sofa from Trit House, and the 1970s influenced ELLISON STUDIOS Muse 2 Seat Sofa. If you’re living in a smaller home, chances are you need your sofa to do a lot, without taking up extra room. Both the deep-seated Koala Byron Sofa Bed, and the Scandi-inspired Eva Slideaway Sofa Bed allow guests to stay overnight without compromising the look of your interior, and precious living room space. Maybe you’re temporarily living in a smaller home, so the idea of committing to a sofa right now seems tricky. The solution here is a modular sofa, which allows you to easily expand the size or formation of your couch as your home, family, or other needs change. The Fenton \u0026 Fenton Sunday Sofa is a playful option that can expand with your lifestyle, while the King Living Aura Sofa has flexible modular arms that can easily move to the centre or either end. You’ll find all the above sofas and more options to suit homes in all styles in our Design Directory — a curated guide to our favourite home products.",
