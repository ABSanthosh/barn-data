  "description": "This portable Erika 85 table saw, by German manufacturer Mafell, has a number of tricks up its sleeve. First off, it's designed to be easy for one person to set up:One of the feet has an instant height-adjustment feature, making uneven floors quickly dealt with:And while you can push material through the saw, the conventional way……it also performs this magic trick:When crosscutting or cutting miters, rather than pushing the workpiece on a sled, you hold the piece stationary and the saw slides towards you. The company reckons this is easier and more precise than doing it the other way around. It's also easier than sliding chunky workpieces towards the saw:Lastly, a simple but desirable feature. The saw has a built-in light that illuminates exactly where you want to see:I think the pull feature would take some getting used to, because I've never seen a table saw that had this feature. But that's because I'm based in the 'States. Mafell has been producing this design for a whopping 40 years.",
