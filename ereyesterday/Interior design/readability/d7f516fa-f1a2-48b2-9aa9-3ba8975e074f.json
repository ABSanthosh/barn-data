  "description": "The 1970s were a bold time for interior design, where green hues, timber details, and kitschy patterns were all the rage. This house in Melbourne’s southeast — designed by European architect Kurt Popper — is a time capsule from that era, but a thoughtful renovation by Tote Design Studio has lovingly reimagined the modernist home for a modern family.",

  "text": "Before its renovation, almost everything about this 1970s Elwood home needed a refresh. Designed by architect Kurt Popper, the house had been ‘excessively decorated’ by its former residents, somewhat overshadowing its original modernist features, according to Tote Design Studio director Lauren O’Brien. The current owners on the other hand — a family with two sons — engaged Lauren and her team in hopes of reviving its retro character, while also improving the spaces inside for modern-day living. ‘The clients wanted a complete renovation of the existing home, without compromising the original structure or mid-century design features,’ Lauren says. As a result, the project was more of a restoration than renovation. The existing floor plan remained intact, with only minor interventions to the bathrooms and laundry. But every room was still updated in some way, adding new finishes, spotted gum joinery, fixtures and fittings to create a more polished take on the original interior design. Lauren says new hero lighting, like the Louis Poulson Patera Pendant in the living room, had a ‘big’ impact on the resulting house, as original parquetry to the living and dining area was maintained and lovingly restored. The kitchen in particular was reimagined around its nostalgic details, namely a built-in spice rack shelf with circular jars that almost look like a control panel — offering a nod to the era of space-age design. ‘Personally, I think the original spice rack retained in the new kitchen cabinetry is so cool and quirky and a great talking point! The existing kitchen cabinetry white glass sliding panels are Vitrolite (a type of coloured structural glass), popular in Streamline Moderne architecture,’ Lauren adds. The interiors are now a fitting backdrop for the owner’s collection of eclectic furniture and artwork, which has all been curated in homage to their love of mid-century design!",
