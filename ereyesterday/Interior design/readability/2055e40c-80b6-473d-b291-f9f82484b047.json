While personal taste always plays a role in design choices, certain trends stand out as mistakes that homeowners eventually regret. I’ve picked these five design styles as ones that missed the mark for various reasons, whether they were too extreme, too impractical, or they  just didn’t stand the test of time. 1. Victorian Victorian-inspired interiors were once a sign of elegance and sophistication, but I feel they often lean too far into excess. Heavy drapes, ornate wallpaper, elaborate furniture, and excessive knick-knacks made spaces feel cramped and overwhelming. Instead of feeling luxurious, many Victorian-style homes felt cluttered and dark. The emphasis on intricate detailing and maximalism made these spaces difficult to maintain and visually exhausting. While some Victorian elements can add character, fully embracing this style often results in a space that feels more like a museum than a home. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Mint_Images 2. Tuscan At one point, Tuscan-style interiors were the height of luxury. Rich earth tones, heavy drapery, and showy furniture created a sense of Old-World charm. However, the trend quickly became overdone. With too many faux finishes, wrought iron details, and dark wood dominating spaces, it made rooms feel heavy and claustrophobic. The overuse of warm colors and textured walls made spaces feel incredibly dated and sometimes hard to look at. There is such a thing as too much orange, after all, and while some elements of this style can still be beautiful, the overly decorated approach didn’t age well.

Shabby Chic Shabby chic was all about distressed furniture, vintage-inspired decor, and a collection of different pieces that come together to create a truly unique style. The problem? Without a good eye, it’s easy for shabby chic to look more like a collection of thrift store finds rather than a cohesive design. It’s a relatively simple design conceptually, so a lot of people jumped on it thinking they could replicate it only to make their home look busy, cluttered, and, well, just shabby without the chic. This is a style that needs an editorial eye and good design knowledge to be pulled off well. It loses its charm very quickly, riding a fine line between just enough and way, way, way too much.

Homes were stripped of personality, leaving behind stark white walls, cold furniture, and an almost clinical feel. The lack of warmth and texture made spaces feel sterile, not stylish. While the idea was to create a clutter-free environment and promote a lifestyle that’s less tied to consumer goods, it often felt completely lifeless. These days, there’s the warm minimalism movement, which I think does add a lot more comfort to the typical minimalist look, but only time will tell if it’ll go the same way as its early 2000s sibling.

Shiplap-covered walls, barn doors, and distressed furniture were everywhere. Farmhouse was intended to replicate the rustic charm of an actual rural farmhouse, but it quickly lost its authenticity when mass-produced decor took over. Every home started to look the same. Identical white-and-gray color schemes, predictable decor choices (those wooden signs with cursive writing that say something like “The kitchen is the heart of the home” anyone?), and an inauthentic feel that was hard to ignore. It went from cute to uninspired extremely quickly, though its impact was still huge, as farmhouse inspirations are still seen in many homes today. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / wollwerth Every design style has its moment, but not all of them age well. While elements of each of these styles can still be used effectively, committing fully to them often results in regret. The best design choices are the ones that balance personality, function, and longevity. Trends will always come and go, but good design lasts. That all said, if you have your heart set on the Victorian home of your dreams, don’t let me or my opinions stop you. If you think it looks great then who cares what others think?

Farmhouse was intended to replicate the rustic charm of an actual rural farmhouse, but it quickly lost its authenticity when mass-produced decor took over. Every home started to look the same. Identical white-and-gray color schemes, predictable decor choices (those wooden signs with cursive writing that say something like “The kitchen is the heart of the home” anyone?), and an inauthentic feel that was hard to ignore. It went from cute to uninspired extremely quickly, though its impact was still huge, as farmhouse inspirations are still seen in many homes today.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_267306\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267306\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1736\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"New home remodel with new kitchen and diningroom in eclectic style\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1736\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-265x180.jpg 265w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-907x615.jpg 907w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-768x521.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-1536x1041.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-2048x1389.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-2024-12-07-02-38-19-utc-32414-385x261.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267306\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/new-kitchen-and-diningroom-remodel-PFCAE6A\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / wollwerth\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEvery design style has its moment, but not all of them age well. While elements of each of these styles can still be used effectively, committing fully to them often results in regret. The best design choices are the ones that balance personality, function, and longevity. Trends will always come and go, but good design lasts. That all said, if you have your heart set on the Victorian home of your dreams, don’t let me or my opinions stop you. If you think it looks great then who cares what others think?
