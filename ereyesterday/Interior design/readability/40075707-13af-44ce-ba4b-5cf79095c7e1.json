  "text": "Mondobruto turns rigid architecture into a thriving ecosystemOn a moss-covered ledge of brutalism, Mondobruto takes root — a sculptural series by Italian designer Alessio Fava that turns sealed glass terrariums into poetic battlegrounds between concrete and life. Each piece in the ongoing collection explores what happens when nature is not an afterthought in architecture, but a protagonist reclaiming its space.in Mondobruto, glass terrariums turn into poetic battlegrounds between concrete and lifeAlessio Fava captures tension between decay and growthHandcrafted from polystyrene molds and cast in custom concrete blends, Fava’s miniature brutalist structures showcase striking geometric forms — raw, stark, and unapologetically architectural. But once sealed inside humid glass environments inspired by Japanese moss gardening, they begin to erode in meaning. Live mosses and tiny plants slowly colonize the rigid surfaces, climbing through crevices and spilling over sharp lines. What begins as a sculptural object becomes a living system — porous, unpredictable, and alive.‘Nature doesn’t ask for permission,’ says Fava. ‘It grows. Even on concrete. Even inside cracks.’ With Mondobruto, he captures that unstoppable tension between decay and growth, permanence and entropy. In the project, each terrarium is a quiet rebellion — a reminder that even the most uncompromising structures will one day be softened by time, moss, and life.each piece explores what happens when nature reclaims architectural spacethe sculptures are handcrafted from polystyrene molds and cast in a custom concrete blend",
