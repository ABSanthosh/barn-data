  "text": "Removable fabric bathtub ‘bathtope’ at DEISGNART Tokyo 2024At DESIGNART Tokyo 2024, LIXIL Corporation debuts Bathtope, a removable fabric bathtub for the shower room. The design is inspired by origami, as the material is cut from a single sheet of fabric and then folded. Visitors to the design and art event can see the fabric bathtub between October 18th and 27th in World Kita Aoyama, Japan.Users can fill Bathtope with hot or cold water, and once they’re done, they just fold it up and hang it somewhere. It may be ideal for those who want a bathtub in their space but may not have the means or permission to build one, or if the area is too cramped. Because the removable bathtub is made of fabric, it adapts to the size and form of the space it is in. In this way, users can even sit down cross-legged, even if the shower room is tight.all images courtesy of LIXIL Corporation, unless stated otherwisecut from a single sheet of fabric to lessen risk of leaksThe public unveiling of Bathtope takes place at DESIGNART Tokyo 2024. At the event that designboom attended, the product’s description says that the design takes cues from the ‘elegance of kimono’ and origami. The latter unravels through the single sheet of folded fabric, then sewn. The former may arise from the multi-layered fabric that LIXIL Corporation uses to produce the removable bathtub, as well as the lush and singular shades of the object.The corporation adds that they only cut from a single sheet of fabric because it lessens the risk of leaks. If they were to patch parts together, the seams might wear out and tear the fabric apart. For users to hang Bathtope in their shower room, they may need to attach hooks on the walls to suspend the removable fabric bathtub. LIXIL Corporation says it’s launching the removable fabric bathtub starting November 26th, 2024, and the release coincides with the 100th anniversary of its plumbing and tile business.at DESIGNART Tokyo 2024, LIXIL Corporation exhibits Bathtope for the first timethe design takes cues from the ‘elegance of kimono’ and origamiview of the removable fabric bathtub at DESIGNART Tokyo | image © designboomthe users hang it up after use | image © designboomview of the removable fabric bathub at DESIGNART Tokyo 2024 | image © designboom",
