  "text": "Image Credits – Yanko Design Nothing has made a name for itself as a tech disruptor, crafting devices that blend minimalist aesthetics with intuitive usability. Its CMF sub-brand has managed to make waves in the budget category too, bringing game-changing features to an entirely new audience of pocket-conscious consumers. Rumors of three new phones launching in early 2025 have already sparked excitement, with the Nothing Phone (3) taking center stage. The speculations come from Yogesh Brar, a reliable tipster who claims that the new phones will begin rolling out as soon as the first half of 2025. The Nothing Phone (3) is rumored to pack Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 7s Gen 3 processor, a chip designed to offer robust performance without overextending power consumption. If early Geekbench scores are any indication—1,149 for single-core and 2,813 for multi-core—the phone is poised to handle multitasking and gaming with ease, all while running on Android 15. With 8GB of RAM reportedly onboard, it’s not just about raw power but also delivering an efficient, fluid experience for its users. Reflecting on past successes, the Nothing Phone (2a) Plus set the stage for its successor by captivating users with bold design choices, like its glow-in-the-dark Community Edition. This limited release sold out in just 15 minutes, leaving many hopefuls scrambling for the standard version—which still offers the same core experience minus the luminous flair. That phone proved Nothing’s ability to balance eye-catching visuals with reliable day-to-day performance. With three devices in development, Nothing’s plans for 2025 are more ambitious than ever. Will these new models explore further design innovations, like an evolved Glyph interface or even a foldable screen? Or will they focus on expanding accessibility, perhaps through a broader product lineup or more budget-friendly options? Nothing’s silence on specifics only builds intrigue, giving fans room to imagine how the brand will push its design philosophy forward. Aside from the Phone (3), Nothing may even refresh its CMF line with a new phone, or launch the (3a) variant to cater to the mid-range market. The company is also rumored to be focusing on a Pro line, which may come in the form of a Phone (3) Pro variant, or potentially even a foldable, which could absolutely revolutionize the folding market in a way that beats Apple to the punch. 2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for Nothing. As it continues to carve out its niche in the hyper-competitive smartphone market, all eyes are on how it will navigate this next chapter. Whether you’re drawn to its bold design, curious about its performance upgrades, or simply intrigued by what’s next, Nothing’s upcoming phones are worth keeping an eye on.",
