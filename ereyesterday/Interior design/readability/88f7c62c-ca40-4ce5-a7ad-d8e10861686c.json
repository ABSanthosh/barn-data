  "description": "When we last saw this property back in 2018, it was an architecturally gorgeous but somewhat neglected house and garden… until David Miskimmin and interior stylist Holly Miskimmin came along! After the initial sale fell through, Holly and David purchased the Eaglemont house in 2019, kickstarting a restoration of the significant property, which was originally designed in 1962 by modernist architect Charles Duncan. The results are remarkable!",

  "text": "In the original plans of this home, designed in 1962 by modernist architect Charles Duncan, the house is surrounded by four terrace gardens. This element of the mid-century house had been lost over time, but was recently reinstated by David Miskimmin and interior stylist Holly Miskimmin, who began restoring the Eaglemont property in 2020 to serve as their beloved family home. Holly and David initially discovered the Melbourne home via The Design Files, when it was featured in a story penned by columnists Patricia Callan of Pete Bakacs of Modernist Australia. ‘We weren’t in a position to buy it at the time, but luckily for us, the sale fell through and it came back on the market later that year,’ says Holly. ‘Within the space of 12 days, we sold our unlisted, off market property and purchased this one — all the while having recently had our third daughter and very much in the newborn phase.’ Upon taking possession of the property, Holly and David were given many historical documents including original blueprints, engineered drawings, contracts, instruction manuals, and material lists outlining the home’s credentials. By 2019, however, the house and garden were looking a little worse for wear. ‘[It was] in a state that most couldn’t see past,’ says Holly. ‘Thankfully, it was also heritage listed, and therefore no option to knock down… We couldn’t wait to bring it back to its former glory, regardless of the work that was ahead of us.’ In designing the renovation, it was incredibly important to Holly and David to maintain the home’s architectural integrity. ‘It was more of a sympathetic restoration project than renovation,’ explains Holly. ‘What we did change was opening up and redesigning the kitchen and laundry to create a better connected space incorporating timber, green joinery, and beautiful Japanese ceramic tiles, along with a place to display some of our cherished pieces.’ Holly and David updated all the bathrooms; replaced all the damaged floors; repainted the walls; restored all window and door frames; replaced water damaged external eaves; and installed new kitchen joinery from Joinery by CJ. For the landscaping, Holly and David hoped to reinstate Charles Duncan’s original design plan for multiple outdoor terraces to surround the house. The couple had a consultation with landscape designer Lisa Ellis Gardens, who provided valuable advice on plant selections and layout, to be installed by Holly and David. ‘In keeping with the style and organic nature of the home, we chose to select largely Australian native plants, along with a few exotic plants and some interesting sculptural plants to create interest,’ says Holly. ‘We chose predominantly a palette of green and burgundy, which tie in with the green joinery and brickwork. ‘The gardens connect whole heartedly to the home, with many in-built planter boxes transitioning through from the inside out, allowing us to fully connect the spaces.’ David and Holly are self-described homebodies, which is reflected in the love, time, and effort they’ve put into restoring this wonderful house, and maintaining its upkeep. ‘It is a house that allows us to be constantly connected, with every space being used equally and nothing wasted,’ says Holly. ‘The kids appreciate how interesting the spaces are, and it really opens up their creative minds being surrounded by things with such purpose and authenticity.’ If only there were a 1000 more Holly and Davids to restore all of north-east Melbourne’s mid-century gems!",
