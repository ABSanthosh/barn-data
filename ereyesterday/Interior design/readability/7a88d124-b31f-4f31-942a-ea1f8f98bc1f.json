  "text": "For thousands of years, the Pearl River in southern China has been home to the Tanka people – an ancient community whose history stretches back 7,000 years. Known for their unique lifestyle, the Tanka have traditionally lived on small boats, floating on the river’s vast waters and tributaries like tiny eggshells. This unique way of life has earned them the name “Tanka,” and they are considered the ancestors of the Cantonese people. Nestled in the serene inner lake of Zitang Art Town along the Pearl River in Guangzhou is a holiday cottage that pays tribute to this rich cultural heritage. The architectural design is inspired by the Tanka people’s boat-dwelling lifestyle, designed to revive the memory of Guangdong’s Tanka culture. This innovative structure employs subtle design techniques, transforming the concept of a “roll of paper” into a functional residential space. The cottage serves as a harmonious blend of tradition and modernity, capturing the essence of the Tanka heritage while providing a comfortable and contemporary living environment. This architectural wonder draws from the past, providing a unique look into the legacy of the Tanka people and their special connection to the Pearl River. Designer: Shunde Polytechnic The holiday house is nestled in the lake’s woods and features an oval shape that casts a beautiful reflection on the water, creating a natural artistic effect. The building comprises three parts – a courtyard, guest room, and terrace. The entrance is paved with green bricks and surrounded by lush bamboo, forming a poetic inner courtyard. At the courtyard’s center, a stone mill and water tank are thoughtfully arranged, with water flowing from the mill gently cascading onto the water lilies below. This harmonious design seamlessly blends with its natural surroundings, offering a tranquil retreat that echoes the serenity of its environment. The cottage’s elliptical design showcases impressive structural aesthetics and spatial tension, crafted with an oval-shaped reinforced concrete shell that provides support. This innovative structure is further enhanced by a thermal insulation layer, created by climbing plants that adorn the top, blending nature with architecture seamlessly. The building’s facade is elegantly decorated with pineapple gritting. Inside, the layout is ingeniously designed, offering comprehensive living facilities that ensure a warm and comfortable atmosphere, transforming the traditional “Tanka” boat living scene into a modern experience. The circular interior space is cleverly designed to maximize natural light, featuring a skylight on the roof that allows residents to observe the dynamic changes in the external environment. This connection to nature is heightened by the expansive terrace, resembling a bow on the lake. This outdoor space invites residents to engage in a dialogue with the surrounding natural beauty, fostering a sense of openness and tranquility.",
