  "text": "In the peaceful countryside of Zayas de Báscones, Spain, a new winery by Fran Silvestre Arquitectos is quietly emerging. The Bodegas Dominio d’Echauz winery is designed to be more than just a site for making wine. Once finished, it will function as an archive, a research lab, and a sanctuary focused on preserving and studying rare grape varieties. This thoughtful approach blends modern architecture with a mission to protect local wine heritage, making the winery an important space for both production and conservation in the region. Designer: Fran Silvestre Arquitectos Unlike many wineries built for scale, this project takes a more modest, thoughtful approach. The planned curved white structure will follow the natural lines of the surrounding vineyards, making it feel like a seamless part of the landscape. Despite its understated appearance, the building stands out for its innovative use of materials and focus on sustainability. The winery will be built mainly from hempcrete blocks—a mix of hemp fibers, lime, and water—known for being both strong and environmentally friendly. These blocks will form two curved walls, adding both stability and a gentle visual appeal. A single-pitch metal roof will top the structure, while Diathonite, a cork-based insulating mortar, will coat the walls, floors, and ceilings to improve insulation throughout. These materials work together to create a unified, seamless look while delivering strong thermal performance. This helps keep the interior temperature stable, which is essential for wine aging and can reduce or even remove the need for mechanical cooling or heating. The winery’s minimalist white color scheme and natural finishes align with Fran Silvestre’s broader design philosophy. Here, these choices are both practical and beautiful. The white cork render reflects sunlight, helping the building stay cool during Castile’s hot summers. Its low profile keeps the structure discreet, blending it into the landscape. Despite its simplicity, the design leaves a lasting impression. Inside, the space is organized for efficiency. Grapes enter at one end, move through fermentation, and age in oak barrels before bottling. The layout also provides space for tasting, gatherings, research, and storage. These thoughtful design choices highlight the winery’s true mission. Rather than focusing on mass production, the space is dedicated to micro-vinification—small batches that explore the preservation and potential of rare grape varieties. Developed with Vitis Navarra, the project aims to protect grapes at risk of extinction, creating a living genetic archive rather than chasing high output. In the context of shifting climates and changing tastes, these lesser-known varietals could shape the future of winemaking. The first collection, called Basajaun after a Basque forest spirit, symbolizes the winery’s role as a quiet guardian of natural and cultural heritage. When finished, the winery will be more than just a place for wine; it will stand as a living archive of sustainability and stewardship.",
