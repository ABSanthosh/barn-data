  "description": "This OLO Table is by industrial designer Joe Doucet. The material, seen up close, is quite unusual: It's made out of 100% Polygood Oyster material, which manufacturer The Good Plastic Company creates from polystyrene harvested from discarded keyboards, computer mice and refrigerators. The material can be thermoformed, as seen with the table, and in turn is also recyclable. OLO's fluid geometry reflects the closed-loop design philosophy behind the collaboration. Designed to highlight Polygood®'s unique thermoformable qualities—a rarity among recycledsheet materials—the piece features sweeping semi-circular legs and a seamless, monolithic top. Executed with precision CNC joinery and a refined silhouette,OLO bridges sustainability and iconic form in a way that feels both timely and timeless. \"This project is about more than material reuse,\" says Joe Doucet. \"It's about proving that sustainability and high design are not mutually exclusive. In fact, they're essential to one another.\" The OLO Table is a one-off, with no production plans announced.",
