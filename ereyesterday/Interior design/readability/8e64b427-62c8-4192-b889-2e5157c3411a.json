  "text": "At just 8 meters (26 feet) in length, the Kookaburra boasts an efficiently designed interior that comfortably accommodates two people. It features a spacious, light-filled living area, a complete kitchen, and even a home office. Named after a terrestrial kingfisher known for its unique call, the Kookaburra was created by the Australian company Unplgd Tiny Homes. It is built on a triple-axle trailer and finished with wood and metal accents. An optional large wooden deck enhances its appeal, accessible through double glass doors that seamlessly connect the interior with the outdoors. Designer: Unplgd Tiny Homes As you enter the home, you are welcomed into a generously sized and open living room. This area has a large L-shaped sofa, providing ample seating for relaxation and socializing. The high ceiling enhances the sense of space and openness, allowing natural light to flood the room and creating an inviting atmosphere. Adjacent to the living room is the home office area. This space is efficiently designed with a compact desk, making it an ideal setup for those who work from home or require a dedicated area for managing daily tasks. The kitchen is conveniently located nearby and is well-equipped to meet all culinary needs. It includes a sink, oven, microwave, and an electric cooktop. The kitchen also features a refrigerator and a breakfast bar that comfortably seats two, perfect for casual dining or enjoying a morning coffee. There is an ample amount of cabinetry designed to offer storage space for kitchen essentials. On the opposite side of the tiny house, near the office, you’ll find the bathroom. This well-designed space includes a shower, a vanity sink, and a flushing toilet. The bathroom is also designed to accommodate a washer/dryer unit. There is also ample storage space available for toiletries and other necessities, ensuring everything you need is within easy reach. The Kookaburra features a single bedroom that can be accessed via a staircase that doubles as integrated storage. This clever design maximizes space efficiency. The bedroom is a classic tiny house loft, marked by its low ceiling, which gives it a cozy and intimate feel. It also includes a skylight which brings in natural light, while offering a view of the stars at night. It includes a double bed and a little storage space, keeping your essentials within reach. The Kookaburra offers a variety of customization options to suit diverse preferences and needs. You can add a second bedroom if needed, and it can be accessed via a ladder as well. This sleeping space is perfect for housing guests, or creating extra room for a growing family. You can also choose to add a deck area, which serves as a fun outdoor space for entertainment or relaxation. There are plenty of choices regarding the materials and furniture. For those interested in sustainable living, the tiny house can be fully equipped to operate off-the-grid. This includes the installation of solar panels for renewable energy, water tanks, and a composting toilet.",
