  "text": "When designing and building her Brunswick East home, Nicole Van Ross was hoping to conjure up a feeling. In her words, she desired ‘a place where people, both young and young at heart, would want to come back time and time again.’ After years of living in a single-fronted terrace, Nicole was also excited to experience a more generous and open floor plan with potential for residents to come together and retreat as desired. She engaged Empire Interiors to help bring her vision to life, resulting in the two-storey house you see today. Close collaboration with Belarte throughout the construction phase allowed for changes on the fly, such as finessing the extensive joinery to make every day living a breeze. Chris De Stratis, builder from Belarte, explains, ‘The owner had a clear vision and wanted to fine tune details as the project progressed, which required flexibility and adaptability from the entire team. ‘While it presented challenges, it also pushed us to be creative and resourceful, and ultimately, it contributed to a result we’re all very proud of.’ The main interior spaces feature mostly neutral colours but across a variety of materials including timber on the joinery; tiles on the splashback, rangehood, and sunken lounge lining; and blush paint on the kitchen feature wall. White terrazzo flooring flows from the living area out to the pool to bring the outdoors in. A consistent use of curves throughout the interiors — as seen on arched walkways, joinery detailing, and the sunken lounge walls — softens the overall feel of the home. The use of vibrant colour really ramps up in the bathrooms — one peach toned, the other sage green — which showcase clashing tiled surfaces and marble bench tops. ‘Nicole is a creative person and I enjoyed collaborating with her during the selection process. Some bold choices were made, and they all came together beautifully,’ says Chris. ‘I love the experience of visiting each space on completion and how it all feels cohesive.’ The house is styled from top to toe with playful furniture, decor, and art from Fenton \u0026 Fenton that elevates the predominantly neutral base. Plush furniture pieces harmonise with the curving interior accents, while relaxed pool furniture encourages the owners to ‘holiday at home.’ Nicole couldn’t be happier with the result!",
