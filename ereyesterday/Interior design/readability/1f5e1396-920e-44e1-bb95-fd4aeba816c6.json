  "text": "From the mind of the ever-creative David Delahunty, this MS Paint make-up kit is ridiculous in all the right ways. It comes with a canvas that also functions as a mirror, a literal paintbrush, and a few paint swatches that let you brush away on your skin, looking like your best self for a night out. The MS Paint make-up kit, although entirely conceptual, would be perfect for graphic designers! It’s quirky yet functional, and translates one of the most iconic interfaces of our time into a regular daily object in a way that’s brilliantly tongue-in-cheek. This is absolutely the kind of quirky craziness you could expect from Delahunty, given that he’s also given us gems like this Apple beach-ball-themed Wilson tennis ball. Designer: David Delahunty Now I’m no make-up enthusiast, so every bit of appreciation from me is purely for Delahunty’s creativity. The makeup kit comes with a lid featuring a mirror, as well as as a faux toolbar, menu bar, and even those Windows 95-style minimize, maximize, and close program buttons. The words ‘untitled – Paint’ on the top left are a signature part of every new project, and feel like a nice homage here. Move down, however, and you’ve got the actual makeup shades, including 8 light skin-colored swatches, an applicator brush, and a few other fake swatches that look like the default colors you’d see on the bottom of the program. They’re there just as an illusion, obviously, but it would probably be fun if you could use those too, maybe for highlights or as an eyeliner. The MS Paint make-up kit is obviously not real, but I really wish it were, because I know at least 20 designers who would absolutely LOVE to own something as beautifully quirky as this. If you’re reading this, Delahunty, take it as a sign to make a limited set now and watch as the money flows in… before Temu or AliExpress beat you to the punch.",
