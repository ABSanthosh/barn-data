  "text": "At Tigmi, we often say that a space begins from the ground up: a rug is the anchor. It sets the tone for the room, informs the palette, introduces texture, and creates a rhythm for how the space comes together. When styling a space, I’m drawn to contrast. I’m interested in that balance between refinement and ease — interiors should feel elevated yet grounded, intentional but lived-in. The most successful interiors are layered and soulful, where materiality, form, and texture work in harmony to tell a cohesive and personal story. This philosophy is the foundation of our latest in-house rug collections. Each design reinterprets timeless vintage pieces through a modern lens. Crafted by hand using traditional techniques and natural materials, these rugs are made with enduring quality and authenticity in mind. Texture also plays a vital role in shaping how a space feels. I gravitate toward natural, tactile elements like jute, wool, timber, leather, and metal and it’s often in the mix of contrasts where a space finds its energy. For example, I love pairing the textural Tigmi Flacq Rug with the smooth coolness of the Stainless Steel Coffee Table, or offsetting soft boucle upholstery with sculptural ceramics. When it comes to colour, we start with grounding neutrals through key textiles or furniture pieces. From there, layer in tone through artwork, rugs, or sculptural objects. I’m drawn to soulful, earthy hues; soft ochres, deep umbers, and muted blues that echo the natural world and evoke a sense of calm. Furniture should be chosen with purpose, but I also believe in mixing eras and styles to create interest. A mid-century chair might sit beside a modern pendant, or a rustic timber bench beneath a contemporary artwork. Sometimes what connects them is material, tone, or just an instinctive feeling. This kind of considered contrast brings character to a space. And finally, the finishing touches are what truly make a space feel like home. These pieces should be personal, something you’ve found on your travels, a handmade object, or a family piece passed down. I always recommend including something vintage. It’s in these imperfect, meaningful details that the magic really happens. Explore Tigmi’s collection here, and enter the giveaway below to win a voucher for a Tigmi-designed rug! Competition closes July 24 at 11:59pm.",
