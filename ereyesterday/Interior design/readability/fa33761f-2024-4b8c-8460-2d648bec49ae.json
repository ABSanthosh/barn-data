  "text": "At any mall, guests are content to grab a quick bite to eat at a basic fast food eatery, without giving much thought to their surroundings, which are created with grab-and-go utility in mind. At the Studio Aisslinger-designed Le Big TamTam, a new food court in Hamburg, Germany, shoppers enter a culinary hub that delights the senses. “We didn’t want to create a typical marketplace,” says Werner Aisslinger, founder and principal of his eponymous firm. “At Le Big TamTam it’s all about the experience, and the unexpected color combinations.” The food court is located inside Hanseviertel at Große Bleichen, the first heritage-listed mall in the city, which opened in 1980. While most areas of the shopping center still have the same decades-old style, the architects, in collaboration with Tellerrand Consulting, envisioned a vibrant place where guests are encouraged to stay and savor meals. Le BigTamTam forms a contemporary food cosmos, with story-driven elements that bring the surprises that are hallmarks of digital environments to an analog world. It’s a spot that emphasizes fun and discovery. A range of Instagram-worthy nooks attract a clientele of all ages. Custom seating includes booths and banquettes upholstered in alternating solids and fabrics with geometric motifs. Surfaces that are easy to clean are essential in the high-traffic commercial zone. Finishes are mixed and matched to offer subtle texture. Terrazzo and lacquered wood tabletops have a  touch of sheen that complements the matte powder-coated metal stools and light fixtures. Under the expansive dome, the farming tower spirals upward, surrounded by ringed planters that hold greenery and herbs. A stairway leads to the highlight of the space – Hamburg’s smallest bar. Patrons can sit in the capsule-like structure, like a modern crow’s nest, and enjoy libations as they take in the buzz of activity below. “Le Big TamTam has become an event that is just as important as the food itself,” Aisslinger adds. Five top Hamburg restaurateurs offer plenty of delicious fares for every palate, from the Japanese dishes at Momo Ramen to Neapolitan pizza by ÜberQuell. Each station is essentially a unique mini restaurant. A Willy Wonka-esque palette of candy pink, yellow, blue, and green tones enlivens the circular section. Le Big Kiosk is a freestanding pop-up unit for different activations. One moment it is a nail salon, on another day it is transformed into an art gallery. Visitors can take pictures at the attached photo booth as keepsakes of their time at the mall. For more information, visit aisslinger.de.com. Photography by Martin Kunze and Nicolo Lanfranchi.
