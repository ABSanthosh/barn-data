  "text": "divergent phase object illuminates ‘nine stages of decay’ paintingTakuto Ohta’s Divergent Phase Object is a luminous creation that provokes philosophical introspection. Realized as an oversized container-like vessel, the work emanates light that changes intensity as its structure folds. This visual interplay, according to the Japanese designer, reflects deeper conceptual layers rooted in Buddhist teachings — particularly the painting, The Nine Stages of Decay. Each of these stages are then manifested as a collapsible layer of the light’s construction.Notably, the sides of these containers fold outward — a deliberate inversion of the traditional function to underscore the Buddhist philosophy of ‘impermanence’. This inversion also serves as a metaphor for the ephemeral and illusory qualities of emotions and thoughts, as well as the plights of overconsumption.all images courtesy of Takuto Ohtatakuto ohta’s light provokes philosophical introspections‘The work’s glowing aspect is not just aesthetic,’ shares the designer. ‘It symbolizes the gradual dimming and transformation of life.’ A single light bulb within each structure adapts to the folding dynamics, creating an interplay of brightness and shadow that mirrors the concept of decay and renewal.Adding to its poetic resonance, the Divergent Phase Object’s design reflects the cumulative pressure of discarded items, while symbolically embodying the impermanence of life. Takuto Ohta reflects that the stacking and gradual collapse of its sections mirror humanity’s relentless production of waste and its visible impact on the earth’s surface. While the object itself is static, its towering presence, standing taller than an average person, evokes a sense of both awe and introspection.In Japanese culture, rituals of purification and impurity offer another intuitive gateway to understanding this work. Much like the custom of sprinkling salt after funerals to cleanse oneself of spiritual impurities, the object invites viewers to reflect on the transient nature of life and material possessions. Its presence encourages contemplation rather than providing immediate conclusions, fostering a dialogue between observer and object.Takuto Ohta completes Divergent Phase Objectrealized as an oversized container-like vesselthe work emanates light that changes intensity as its structure foldseach of the layers manifests one of the ‘Nine Stages of Decay’ — a Buddhist painting",
