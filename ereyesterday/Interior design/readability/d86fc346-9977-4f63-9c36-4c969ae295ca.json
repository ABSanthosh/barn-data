But luckily, you don’t need a designer budget to get this high-end-looking furniture aesthetic — IKEA has an affordable slipcovered chair that’s so chic, you’d never guess it came from the Swedish retailer.The IKEA BERGMUND is a slipcovered chair that you can pick up in either plain white or a bold black-and-white stripe. The frame comes in black, white, or IKEA’s oak effect finish, but it’s only visible via the legs peeking out from the bottom of the skirt. Similar dining chairs often go for upwards of $400 to $500 at Crate \u0026 Barrel and other higher-end home decor stores, but you can grab the IKEA BERGMUND chair for just $135.This chair goes beyond just looks, too — it’s designed for maximum comfort, thanks to a cozy bowl-shaped seat and a conveniently angled backrest with lumbar support. The slipcover is also made with a breathable polyester that helps regulate your temperature, and it’s machine-washable to hold up against stains or spills.  And as if you needed any more confirmation that the BERMUND is super stylish, chef and cookbook author Dan Pelosi (@grossypelosi) has the black-and-white striped chairs in his dining room. They’re both elevated and playful paired with the bold colors and patterns throughout his space. These don’t have to be limited to the dining room, though, especially if you don’t have a table or eat-in kitchen. You could style a pair in the living room for extra seating that’ll pop nicely against your decor, or even turn one into a desk or vanity chair. “I was ready to spend considerably more money to upgrade my chairs, but after months of looking and trying various chairs, I’ve picked these — you just cannot beat them!” one IKEA shopper wrote in their review. “I have washed and bleached my white cotton covers, and they seem just as high quality as my old [IKEA HENDRIKSON] covers, which were virtually indestructible! …You could even have these white chair covers with small kids — they’re THAT washable and durable!”And another person wrote, “I think these chairs are beautifully simple and elegant. Easy to put together and to cover in their upholstered cover,” with someone else adding, “Beautiful dining chair for a great price! A breeze to assemble and so comfortable and sturdy!”Make your space feel more luxurious, fun, and comfortable with the IKEA BERGMUND slipcovered dining chairs, and put the money you saved toward delicious food for your next dinner party!",
