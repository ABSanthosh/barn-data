  "text": "There’s a difference between cracking open a beer—and actually feeling the day slow down. The Prism Titanium Beer Glass was designed for that moment of pause. Crafted in Japan by Progress Design, it merges aerospace precision with traditional craftsmanship. Inside, a layer of ultra-pure titanium softens bitterness and enhances clarity—in both your drink and your state of mind. Set it down on your desk after a long day, or bring it to the table on a quiet evening. Either way, Prism doesn’t ask for attention. It rewards it. The Glass That Changed My End-of-Day Routine At first, I thought Prism was just beautiful—a minimalist glass with a cool finish. But after a week of using it, I realized it had changed how I unwind. I sip slower, because the flared rim softens the pour I taste more, because the titanium neutralizes metallic aftertastes I notice the light, because the aurora-like finish shifts with every angle It became my Friday night ritual. Then my Tuesday reset. Then my everyday reminder that drinking isn’t just consumption—it’s an invitation to settle. Designed for the Details 99.9% pure titanium lining: Removes off-notes, enhances flavor clarity Flared rim design: Improves mouthfeel, softens texture, lifts aroma Two finishes, two moods: Choose Silver for calm minimalism, or Infinite for an aurora-inspired shimmer Symbolic etched patterns: Carry timeless Japanese meanings of continuity and prosperity Crafted in Shizuoka, Japan: Precision coating meets hand-finished tradition Aerospace-grade durability: Corrosion-resistant, biocompatible, and built to last Prism stands apart in a world crowded with gadgets designed for likes and speed. It wasn’t made for social media. It was made for presence. Why Slowing Down Still Matters We live in a world of fast pours and faster scrolls. But there’s something powerful about choosing to do one thing well—and doing it slowly. In a culture that celebrates multitasking, Prism is an invitation to do just one thing—well. Prism doesn’t shout. It doesn’t chill your beer with a gimmick. It doesn’t light up. Instead, it reframes the experience: making each pour a ceremony, and every sip a return to yourself. Because sometimes, all it takes to mark the end of a long day is a quiet glass and a steady hand. Design That Reflects Stillness Behind the Prism’s glow is a rare craft: a 0.000001mm-thin titanium layer applied with aerospace layering technology. No paint. No pigment. Just refracted light engineered at the molecular level. The Infinite finish moves like ocean light. The 1/f rhythm of its shimmer calms the senses. Every curve, every etching, every reflection was shaped with intention—merging modern science with Japanese restraint. It’s not just functional. It’s grounding. Who It’s For Design-Led Drinkers A glass that matches the clarity of your favorite beer—and your home. Minimalists with Rituals One object, made well, used often. No logos. No trends. Just presence. Gift Givers with Taste The kind of gift that doesn’t shout “gadget”—it quietly becomes a favorite. Where Pour Becomes Presence You don’t pour a beer to party. You pour it to pause. The light hits the surface. The foam rises. The titanium catches the room’s color and shifts it softly. And for a moment, there’s nothing else—just you, your glass, and a bit of quiet earned. Not just a glass. A better way to end your day. The Prism Titanium Beer Glass is available now for $99.",
