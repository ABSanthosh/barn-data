  "text": "Bellaire Court in Beaumaris is a fabulous precinct of mid-century modern houses built by Max Sachs between 1962 and 1969. Taking inspiration from Californian architecture, the designer created the series of flat roof homes with a special focus on interesting floorplans, courtyards, and good site orientation. Fiona Finch and Max Verberne have lived in number 18 on the cul-de-sac for two decades, and say it remains a snapshot of the optimistic ’60s, ‘where everyone lived in a friendly and safe cocoon’. But the couple first fell in love with their four-bedroom house and its enchanting bayside location long before it was even on the market. ‘We were invited by new friends to their beautiful Beaumaris home and were captivated by the amount of light pouring in through the windows in the kitchen and living spaces, as well as the natural flow of the house to the outside,’ Fiona says. ‘As we watched our kids play on the quiet street from the comfort of the living room, we could easily envision the lifestyle our family could have living there. ‘When our friends mentioned they were thinking about selling the home, we couldn’t believe our luck; we made an offer and the next 20 years were spent enjoying the home.’ Since then, the family has made small cosmetic updates to maintain the glory of the original residence, in addition to sympathetically renovating the kitchen with neighbour and designer Fiona Austin. Their son, a qualified landscaper, also worked on the expansive front and back gardens. ‘As the home is so connected to the outside through full walls of windows and doors to the backyard from every bedroom, we wanted the interiors to hero the outside,’ Fiona adds. Timber floors and original wooden panelling add to the home’s nostalgic atmosphere, while the backyard has evolved from being the kid’s haven — featuring a cubby house, soccer pitch and a basketball court at one point — to an entertainer’s dream, having hosted plenty of family barbecues around the fire pit. Now, with Fiona and Max’s kids grown up, the family have decided it’s time to pass the keys onto a new custodian. ‘We will miss the wonderful feeling of being on a beach vacation, all year round. Beaumaris is a wonderful place to live.’ 18 Bellaire Court, Beaumaris, VIC 3193 is for private sale with Christine Henderson from Circa Property Melbourne.",
