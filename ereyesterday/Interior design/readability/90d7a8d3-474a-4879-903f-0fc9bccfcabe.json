  "description": "It’s hard to believe this Barwon Heads family home — on Victoria’s Bellarine Peninsula — was once a small and dark single-storey brick building. That’s because the couple behind K+ARchitects have just transformed the property into their dream home, designed to foster connection between their family, their community, and the coastal surrounds. The renovated house is now shaped around a pool, making every day feel like a holiday.",

  "text": "‘At our first inspection, we honestly struggled to see any redeeming qualities in the house itself,’ Kate Rowe says of her family’s Barwon Heads property. The original 1980s project home was awkwardly positioned and had several significant limitations: low ceilings, small bedrooms, single-glazed windows, and living spaces that lacked any connection to the outdoors. But as the husband-and-wife team behind K+ARchitects, Kate and Andrew Rowe knew the real potential of the site lay in its unique location, backing onto a remnant Moonah forest within Barwon Heads Village Park. With a mission to repurpose as much of the existing structure as possible, the couple have since completely transformed the brick veneer building into a place befitting of its coastal surrounds. ‘We wanted our home to evoke the feeling of being on holiday, which is why the design centres around a light-blue pool,’ Kate says. The floorplan uniquely spills out around this central outdoor space, as the original part of the house was converted into a wing of bedrooms for their three kids. On the opposite side of the pool, Kate and Andrew designed a new two-storey dwelling, housing the open-plan living areas on the ground floor with an office for their architecture practice and their main bedroom upstairs. Now, almost every room captures a glimpse of the inviting body of water at the heart of the home — reminiscent of a resort-style hotel. ‘The house is now a light, bright, and inviting environment, where we can relax, linger, and always look forward to coming home. Living and working here had to feel effortless. With three kids, we also wanted to create ample play and hang-out spaces, ensuring they’d want to bring their friends home for years to come,’ Kate says. The material palette also embodies this calming, beachy energy. White-washed walls, brick accents, and striking curved elements almost nod to Palms Springs-style architecture, reimagined for regional Victoria’s coastal suburbs — complete with an outdoor shower where the family can rise off after a surf or swim at the local beach. And to deliberately blur the line between the interiors and the outdoors, Kate says the large glass corner doors dissapear into timber-clad nibs. ‘Connection is incredibly important to us: connection to family, to the environment, and to our community keeps us grounded,’ she adds. ‘This home provides the space our family needs while fostering a sense of closeness, carefully curating connections between family, landscape, and community.’",
