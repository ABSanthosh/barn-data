  "description": "The build quality on this product looks like a sophomore ID student project, but that hasn't stopped it from being funded on Kickstarter. This Versa Air Sprayer from China is an airbrush that requires no external compressor—and never needs to be cleaned (at an environmental cost). The rechargeable-battery-powered tool can generate up to 30 PSI. It features a somewhat gimmicky laser that shows you where the paint will land. Color changes are achieved by swapping paint bottles.As mentioned earlier, you don't need to clean the nozzles, because \"Instead of washing, we have introduced disposable nozzles in all sizes, so you can just put on a new one next time,\" which may not sit well with some. \"It turns out a new nozzle costs less than the thinner required to wash it,\" the company writes. \"Biodegradable plastic is used to minimize environmental burden.\" Sounds like a suspiciously breezy solution.Four nozzle sizes are offered.While you can buy your own paint, the obvious downside to this tool is that the bottles and nozzles are proprietary, and can only be purchased for the company. So you'd be spending $80 (Kickstarter price) or $140 (retail price) on the tool, then keeping your fingers crossed that the company stays in business long enough to resupply you. As usual, these concerns have not stopped eager backers from reaching the funding target. At press time there were 10 days left to pledge.",
