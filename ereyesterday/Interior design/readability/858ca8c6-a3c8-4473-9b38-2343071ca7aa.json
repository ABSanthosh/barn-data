Today, the tiny homes on the market seem extravagant and luxurious, barely resembling the original micro homes that kickstarted such a beloved and popular movement. But we are still team ‘tiny’ tiny homes, and they’re a more convenient and clever option if you are often on the road. This compact model is called the Shelly, and it features an open, airy, and free-flowing layout packed into one floor. It is also equipped with a solar power setup, that powers the dwelling no matter where it is parked or placed. Designer: Tiny Solar Homes The Shelly is the smallest model offered by Tiny Solar Homes, featuring a usable length of just 7 meters (nearly 23 feet). This size is about half of Wind River’s Cumberland and comparable to Havenwood’s Joely. Built on a triple-axle trailer, it is finished with durable aluminum. The design includes an outdoor shower and tap, with the option to add a deck area. Access to the interior is through large double glass doors, with a layout that is arranged on one floor. The space is entirely open, except for the bathroom, making it perfect for use as a vacation home, though not ideal for family living. Upon entry, you step into the living room area, which features a sofa and a wall-mounted TV. The kitchen is placed adjacent to the cozy living room. It is designed to be a compact yet functional space, amped with a breakfast bar for two, and complemented by elegant stone countertops and ample cabinetry. It is equipped with an oven, a sink, and a two-burner electric cooktop, making it a practical area for meal preparations. There is also room for a washer/dryer and other appliances, and a hidden sound system with speakers discreetly tucked into the cabinets. The Shelly’s bathroom, located next to the kitchen, maximizes space efficiency. It’s equipped with a shower, a sink, and a standard flushing toilet, though there’s an option to upgrade to a composting or incinerating toilet if preferred. On the opposite side of this charming tiny home lies the bedroom. Thanks to its single-story layout, the bedroom offers ample headroom, allowing you to stand up and move around comfortably—a rare luxury in tiny house living. This inviting space is furnished with a double bed and integrated storage solutions. As previously mentioned, the tiny house derives its energy from a solar panel array installed on the roof. This system is connected to a battery unit housed in an exterior storage box. There is also an option to upgrade with additional batteries, ensuring a continuous power supply regardless of weather conditions. The Shelly also offers a range of material upgrades for those interested in customizing the aesthetic and durability of their home. You can also install a second bedroom to accommodate more occupants or guests. It is priced at approximately US$80,000.",
