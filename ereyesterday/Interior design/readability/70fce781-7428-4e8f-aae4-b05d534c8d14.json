  "text": "This year, Milan Design Week signaled a slight shift in interior aesthetics. Cool metal finishes such as chrome, aluminum, and mirrored surfaces emerged as the defining materials, introducing a bit of reflective luxury. Designers explored how these materials interact with light, creating spaces that are both dynamic and introspective.​ I found the mix of metal with all of the sustainable, natural and handmade materials quite well mixed, and I’ll tell you why in a moment. But first, let’s review a few of the highlights from Milan where metals were on display.Gallotti \u0026 Radice's stand at the main fair featured brushed aluminum walls and Studiopepe's Mirage coffee tables. They proved how silver-toned finishes redefine luxury in interiors, offering a minimalist yet opulent aesthetic that reflects the evolving tastes of contemporary design.​ Brushed aluminum walls may seem like something for the luxury market, but you can get a similiar look by added a brushed metal backsplash to your kitchen or a metal cabinet in the living room. Paris-based studio Waiting for Ideas presented Self Reflection, a flat pack chair crafted from polished aluminum and nickel. This isn’t a new chair, its been around for a few years, but its appearance in Milano made a strong statement. The piece, with its sharp lines and mirrored surfaces, serves as both functional furniture and a commentary on introspection and perception, which shows how metal can be molded into forms that challenge and engage the viewer.At Nilufar Depot, founder Nina Yashar (who is just fabulous), in collaboration with Fosbury Architecture, presented Silver Lining to mark the gallery’s 10th anniversary. The installation featured a mirrored aluminum enclosure housing metallic works by designers like Gio Ponti and Supaform, all set upon a rich burgundy shag carpet, a definite nod to 70’s glam. You can see it below. The space played with contrasts: the softness of the carpet against the sleekness of metal, which created an immersive experience that celebrated the duality of strength and delicacy.​ Tokyo-based designer Hiroto Yoshizoe, in collaboration with Arakawa Grip, unveiled ubique, a lighting installation that visualizes the path of light through suspended metal forms. The piece invited viewers to engage with the interplay of light and reflection, embodying the ethereal qualities that metal can bring to interior spaces.These installations and pieces collectively highlight a micro trend towards materials that not only serve functional purposes but also engage with light and space to create transformative experiences. The use of reflective metals in design is not just about aesthetics; it's about crafting environments that resonate on both visual and emotional levels more and more. I saw a lot more from Milano in metal - table bases, accents on sofa arms, silver floors, and was happy to see it making a stronger return for 2025. In my opinion, it feels almost like a rebellion to all of the beige and mineral wall paints and rise of vintage furniture and curvy, soft lines and shapes. I love all of those things, but the metal adds reflection, depth, and a stronger character to a space. If you take an all-beige room and add a reflective metal coffee table atop of a creamy rug, you’ll have an instant touch of glam, edge, and a personality. It says something. Metal reminds me of tech - robots, cars, photos, and somewhat futuristic - as least how we thought of the future back in the 80’s as little kids. Many are currently rebelling against AI, feeling threatened by it and some absolutely hating it with a passion! Maybe that’s the appeal of metal for interiors currently - a little rebellious wink ;) to those who feel we don’t need tech or AI in our lives, we don’t need the shiny, cold, and smooth surfaces… Well, we do. But in moderation. Like everything.The other day, I noticed on Desiree’s lovely blog an apartment with lots of metal and thought it was nice to see metal in action so here are a few photos to show you how a touch of metal can elevate even a very minimalist space. Also, she shared a table with the most gorgeous trestle legs in silver by Lisbon-based design brand THER.",
