  "description": "British packaging company Frugalpac has developed this Frugal Bottle, a paper wine bottle. It's similar to wine-in-a-box, except the packaging is actually shaped like a standard bottle and has the same 750mL capacity. It's designed for recyclability. The outer surface is made from 94% recyclable paperboard. (I'm guessing that remaining 6% is whatever the neck and cap are made out of.) When the bottle's empty, you press on a demarcated spot on the shoulder to split the seam. You then pull the outer apart, revealing the polyethylene pouch within. This too can be recycled, though only at a recycling facility that can handle films. The Frugal Bottle is five times lighter than a glass one, reducing shipping costs. The company reckons it has a carbon footprint \"up to six times lower than a glass bottle.\"",
