Discovered on Threads, these knockoff pair of AirPods Pro (probably available on Temu if you look hard enough) have a feature that even the originals don’t. Visible the instant you unbox the earbuds, these knockoff AirPods Pro come with a touchscreen built into the case, letting you play/pause music, activate or deactivate features like ANC and Spatial Audio, and even mess with the earbuds’ equalizers. It isn’t too different from a pair of JBL Tour PRO 3 earbuds we saw two years ago at CES, except these ones are modeled exactly on Apple’s AirPods Pro. Designer: Choice HYUNDAI It isn’t easy to tell what the brand or model of these earbuds is (although I suspect it’s the Choice HYUNDAI HY-Y11), but it’s certainly a Chinese manufacturer trying to emulate the Apple aesthetic. The case looks almost exactly like the AirPods Pro, albeit with a black touchscreen on the front. You’ve got a USB-C at the bottom, and the interiors of the case look almost exactly like Apple’s own. The earbuds are a resounding copy too. Flip open the case and it automatically wakes up the touchscreen, showing your earbuds status. Take one earbud out and an animation on the screen shows which earbud’s out of its case, providing a pretty nifty visual indication. The screen has touch-to-wake too, allowing you to do things like play/pause music, set a wallpaper on your “AirPods” case, and adjust features like ANC, EQ, and Spatial Audio. On the top, you’ve also got a status bar that tells you each earbud’s battery level, case battery level, Bluetooth connectivity status, and the time. Pop the earbuds in and you can adjust your audio through the case itself without needing to take your phone out. Is it convenient? Sure. Is it necessary? I doubt. This device basically turns the AirPods Pro into an AirPods iPod mashup. It’s cool, but highly unnecessary given that it doesn’t achieve much since you’re still taking a gadget out of your pocket to control playback. At that point, the gadget might as well be your phone. Adding a screen to the case also reduces its overall battery capacity, since the screen now chugs on the battery to remain operational. However, if the idea of an AirPods case with its dedicated screen appeals to you, the internet is probably littered with low-cost versions of this device that you could play with for fun. Don’t expect stunning audio quality, ANC, or Spatial Audio from these shoddily-made knockoffs. Don’t expect a warranty either, since this thing literally costs $7.50 on AliExpress.",
