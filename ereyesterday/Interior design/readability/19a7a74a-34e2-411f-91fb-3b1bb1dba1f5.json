  "text": "Watch as sunlight spills through linen sheers and every detail whispers calm. This Lithuania apartment by Alyona Marmachuk goes big on warm wood tones, clean lines, and the kind of effortless style that feels deeply livable. It is designed with intention and a love for natural materials, proving that minimalism doesn’t have to feel cold—it can feel like home. Whether you’re dreaming up your next project or just here for some serene inspiration, this tour will leave you breathing a little easier. The foyer sets the tone for what’s to come—calm, warm, and intentionally uncluttered. It is framed by soft taupe walls and herringbone wood flooring. A rich walnut console adds grounded warmth. This is styled minimally with a ceramic vase and soft ambient lighting. Built-in storage ensures everything has a place, proving that beauty and function can walk hand in hand—right through the front door. This open-plan space is the heart of the home—where calm mornings begin and cozy evenings end. The seamless transition from kitchen to dining to living is anchored in soft beige tones and natural wood finishes. The kitchen pairs sleek cabinetry with glass-front uppers, while the adjacent dining area centres around a minimalist round table perfect for slow meals and meaningful conversations. In the living zone, layered textures and earthy hues invite you to sink in and stay a while. Everything here feels connected, cohesive, and designed with everyday comfort in mind. The home office feels like a peaceful retreat full of natural light. A sturdy wood desk anchors the space. This is paired with a vintage-inspired swivel chair. Built-in cabinetry and open shelving keep clutter out of sight, while a sculptural pendant and floor lamp layer in gentle light. Whether it’s for deep focus or a moment of pause with a cup of tea, this workspace is designed to support clarity and calm. Soft morning light filters through layered sheers. This casts shadows that move with the breeze, adding understated elegance. The color palette is tones of oat, clay, and warm wood (together, these invite deep rest). A low, upholstered bed paired with fluted sconces creates a cocoon-like atmosphere, while hidden storage behind seamless panels keeps the room calm and uncluttered. In one nook is an accent chair made from rattan, while a compact workstation near the window lets you work with the best views. In the bathroom, soft taupe tiles wrap the space in warmth. Rich wood cabinetry and slatted storage add organic texture. A floating vanity keeps the layout feeling airy, complemented by sleek wall-mounted fixtures and gentle uplighting. Every detail is considered—from the built-in shelving for everyday essentials to the serene artwork above the toilet. It’s a space that invites slow starts, quiet endings, and everything in between.",
