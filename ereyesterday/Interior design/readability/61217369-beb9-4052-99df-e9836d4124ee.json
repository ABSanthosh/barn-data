  "text": "Four Wheel Campers surprised the adventure community earlier this year with the release of CampOut – A pop-up truck camper that evolves with the user’s adventure requirements. The company in fact, marketed it as a “Camper you can build your way.” Pretty bold for a statement if it were from another manufacturer, but for Four Wheel Campers, known for its uncanny moves in the industry, it is just another trick. Four Wheel is now substantiating its stance as one of the leading camping solutions experts with the launch of its first fully self-contained camper for summer camping expeditions. Calling out all off-grid adventurers, is this the moment we’d been waiting for? Designer: Four Wheel Campers The company’s first off-grid-ready slide-in camper, the Hawk+, features a welded aluminum frame, a roof made from a single sheet of aluminum for durability, and amenities such as off-grid electricity, freshwater tanks, and all-season climate control on board. The camper debuted at the recently concluded Overland Expo West, where it was demoed to sit comfortably on a 7-foot flatbed truck. In addition to being the first off-the-grid camper, it is also the biggest, heaviest, and most fully loaded truck camper in Four Wheel’s repertoire. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that the Hawk+ actually deviates from the company’s lightweight and modular camper ideology, emphasized by the CampOut, but it is a reliable option that will let you live out a few additional nights in the woods, cozy and well supplied in the truck bed. Accoutered for nomadic life or overland explorations that demand a camper atop the rugged wheels to be equally durable and capable of sleeping you in comfort for an extended period of time. The Hawk+ looks ready for such demands with off-grid capabilities that start with the larger onboard space well utilized for eating, sleeping, living and still making space for storage. The camper has a nice galley in the middle of the layout with storage extending round to the other side, the kitchen counter on one side and a cassette toilet tucked into the storage on the other side. Alongside is the fresh water 40-liter tank and a 5-gallon for gray water. The kitchen is well stocked with all the necessities for cooking including stove, sink, and fridge. The rear four-person dinette can transform into a bed for two, while the main bedroom in the cab-over area fits a king bed.  The space inside is opened up by the pop-up roof if you choose the option. The power needs of the lights and various power ports onboard, when you are living where the grid doesn’t cater, is taken care of by an 810Ah lithium battery, a 500-watt solar panel, and a 2,000-W inverter. If you wish to work remotely, the Hawk+ is provided with a Starlink connection. Since adventures are limited without your gear, the slide-in camper will be provided with options for a rear Molle rack. And when you return after your sporting activity, you can take a shower outside before jumping into the bed. The new Hawk+ camper starts at $43,995 in base model, which scales up as you add in the self-contained, off-grid functionalities.",
