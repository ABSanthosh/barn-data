Created by King Living, an Australian family-owned furniture company with over 30 showrooms across eight countries, the King Cloud has evolved through several versions to become what they call “the world’s most advanced home cinema seating.” As I renovate my sunroom into an entertainment center, this gorgeous piece from King Living would pair perfectly with the new Hisense 100-inch TV I’m eagerly awaiting. Designer: King Living The Evolution of King Cloud The King Cloud journey started with the Cloud III, which introduced the game-changing TouchGlide® control technology. This smart system lets you adjust the head, seat, and footrests with simple swipes across hidden buttons. King Living later introduced the Cloud V, elevating design and features. Marketed as “the world’s most advanced cinema seating,” its modular design seamlessly fits in spacious living rooms and cozy home theaters. The newest version, King Cloud Premiere, keeps what worked while adding thoughtful upgrades. The TouchGlide® technology now has improved gesture control, and the cushioning feels even more luxurious. Each new model reflects King Living’s dedication to pushing boundaries while responding to what customers actually want. Engineering and Design Excellence At the heart of every King Cloud is an engineered steel frame that’s built to last. King Living backs this with an impressive 25-year warranty – they’re that confident in their engineering. The reclining mechanism is particularly clever. Unlike traditional recliners that need lots of space behind them, the King Cloud can sit right against a wall, thanks to its space-saving design. What really sets it apart is the Postureflex® Seating System, which uses technology similar to that used in luxury European cars. Combined with multi-layer foam seats and backrests, it creates an incredibly comfortable seating experience. The lumbar support naturally follows your spine’s curve, keeping you comfortable even during movie marathons. TouchGlide® Technology and Smart Integration The TouchGlide® Technology makes traditional recliners seem ancient. Four touch-sensitive buttons on each seat’s side give you complete control with just a fingertip. The two front buttons open the footrest or headrest, while the two in the back close them. The gesture control is where it gets really cool – swipe forward across all buttons to move into your favorite pre-programmed position. A double swipe activates a second memory position, so different family members can quickly find their perfect spot. You can save your favorite positions by holding specific button combinations. When you’re done, just swipe backward to return everything to the closed position. Smooth dual motors ensure precise adjustments every time. King Cloud doesn’t stop at movement control. It works with LED reading lights that respond to gestures, wireless charging tables for your devices, and speaker brackets that fit Sonos systems – creating a complete entertainment hub. Customization and Modular Flexibility The King Cloud adapts to your space and needs with multiple configuration options – from single armchairs to 3-seater arrangements. You can add or remove sections as your needs change, making it incredibly versatile. The Smart Pockets™ system adds another layer of customization. These clever storage compartments in the arms hold remotes and tablets while also connecting to various accessories. Newer models feature deeper pockets with more room for headphones, game controllers, and other devices. You can also choose from a wide range of premium fabrics and leathers to match your style. Leather lovers can choose from full-grain and top-grain options from top Italian and German tanneries, while the fabric collection offers colors and textures for any design scheme. The removable covers are especially practical – they can be professionally cleaned or completely changed without replacing the whole piece. The zip-on design and specialized foam inserts ensure everything looks smooth and polished. Smart Accessories Ecosystem King Cloud offers a complete ecosystem of smart seating accessories. The Smart Pockets® act as connection points for various add-ons that enhance your experience, allowing you to easily upgrade as your needs evolve. LED reading lights are among the most popular extras, offering adjustable lighting with touchless controls. For tech lovers, wireless charging tables eliminate cable clutter while keeping your devices powered up. The media console is another brilliant addition. It sits between sofa modules and includes a gas lift mechanism that hides media devices and cables. It can even accommodate subwoofers and audio equipment, so you not only hear but feel the sound through your seat. For serious home cinema fans, King Living offers speaker brackets that work with Sonos systems. These integrate directly with the sofa structure, creating immersive surround sound that complements the physical comfort. Advanced Safety and Durability Features Safety is built into every aspect of the King Cloud, with features like mechanical spring safety, pinch point protection, and an infrared safety system. The infrared sensors are especially clever – they detect objects under the footrest and stop movement immediately, protecting everything from your coffee cup to your curious cat. In newer models, these IR sensors have been moved to fixed positions for even better reliability. This attention to safety shows King Living’s thoughtful approach to design. The King Cloud is built to last, from its steel frame to its high-quality upholstery. The multi-layer foam retains its shape and comfort even after years of use, while the removable covers extend the furniture’s life by allowing for cleaning or replacement. This smart construction means you won’t need to replace the entire piece when styles change or accidents happen. Home Entertainment and Everyday Living Applications While it’s marketed as premium cinema seating, the King Cloud works beautifully in many living situations. Its space-saving design makes it perfect for urban homes where every inch counts. For movie buffs, it’s a dream come true. The integration with audio equipment creates an immersive experience where you can feel the sound through your seat. The TouchGlide® technology lets you find the perfect viewing position, while memory functions ensure you can return to it with a simple gesture. Beyond movies, King Cloud supports everyday relaxation and modern living. Wireless charging keeps your devices ready, LED reading lights make it perfect for curling up with a book, and the Smart Pockets® keep daily essentials within reach. The modular design means your furniture can evolve as your life does. Add sections when you move to a bigger place, reconfigure when you rearrange your room, or change covers when you update your decor. It’s furniture that adapts to you, not the other way around.",
