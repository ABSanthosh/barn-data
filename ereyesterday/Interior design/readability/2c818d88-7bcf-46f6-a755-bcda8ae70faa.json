  "text": "Designer and curator Kirsten Visdal has filled a former smoking room at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris with Norwegian furniture, objects and sculptures. For three days only, Visdal transformed Le Fumoir – a room that is normally closed to the public – into a showcase of Norwegian artists, designers and brands. The exhibition, Et Hjem/Chez Soi, featured work by contemporary designers including Ali Shah Gallefoss and Andreas Engesvik, as well as classics by the likes of Terje Ekstrøm and Hans Brattrud. Furniture from brands including Northern and Fjordfiesta featured in the exhibitionThe project was led by Design and Architecture Norway (DOGA), the Oslo-based design organisation and gallery that is known for staging the Norwegian Presence exhibitions in Milan. According to Cecilie Molvær Jørgensen of DOGA, the aim was to highlight the distinct qualities of Norwegian design, in contrast with other Nordic countries. \"This was a wonderful opportunity to showcase Norwegian design in a brand new way and to create something unexpected,\" she told Dezeen. The former smoking room features ornate wood panelling and a large Persian rug\"Normally Norwegian design is put in the same category as Scandinavian design – blond wood, white, minimalistic, functionalistic – but Le Fumoir gave us the opportunity to show it is so much more than that,\" she continued. \"It can be eclectic, playful, colourful, soft, curvy and maximalistic.\" A sand-casted table by Ali Shah Gallefoss sits alongside Vestre's steel Munch chairsLe Fumoir was originally part of a hotel in the former Gare d'Orsay railway station, which occupied the building in the early 20th century before it was converted into a museum. Visdal created playful contrasts with the room's elaborate decor, which includes ornate wooden wall panelling, heavy curtains, patterned red wallpaper and a large patterned Persian rug. In one arrangement, a sand-casted aluminium table by Gallefoss sits alongside the gridded steel Munch chairs by designers Andreas Engesvik and Jonas Stokke, which are produced by Vestre. Behind it, a classic sideboard displayed experimental ceramics by artist Eyvind Solli and aluminium lamps from manufacturer Hydro. Ment's porcelain dishes were displayed on a dining table behind the 1980s Ekstrem chairIn front of the original fireplace, the Gem sofa from contemporary furniture brand Northern sits alongside Brattrud's 1960s Scandia chairs, produced by heritage brand Fjordfiesta. Other highlights include Ekstrøm's curvy 1980s Ekstrem chair, produced by Varier, which sits in front of a dining table topped with porcelain dishes from manufacturer Ment. Other exhibitors included reclining chair producer Stressless and textile company Fram Oslo\"We wanted to create unexpected combinations and show that Norwegian design is a varied mix of classic mid-century and contemporary,\" said Jørgensen. \"The contrast between the understated elegance of Nordic craftsmanship and the grandeur of this iconic museum creates a unique dialogue, showcasing how simplicity can speak volumes in the most remarkable of settings,\" added Visdal. A sofa by new brand Matre featured alongside an aluminium shelving unit by HydroThe exhibition also included pieces by Matre, a new Norwegian brand that launched in 2024. Other exhibitors included reclining chair producer Stressless, doormat brand Heymat, textile company Fram Oslo and workplace furniture manufacturer Flokk. Ceramics by artist Eyvind Solli were displayed on the fireplaceThe colour palette combined shades of red, burgundy, pink and muted browns. \"The red palette was influenced by the room itself,\" said Jørgensen. \"We mixed burgundy and pink with plums and berries, and finally that fire hydrant-red in the Munch chairs. And of course, a little bit of blond wood to serve as accents rather than the base.\" The photography is by Studio Dreyer+Hensley. Et Hjem/Chez Soi ran from 22 to 24 November at Musée d'Orsay, Paris.
