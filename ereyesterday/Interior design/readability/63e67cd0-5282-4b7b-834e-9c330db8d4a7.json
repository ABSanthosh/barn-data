  "description": "\"Train cars typically have a lifespan of approximately 30-50 years,\" explains Repurposed Materials, a company dedicated to salvaging still-useful castoff materials. \"After this period, they cease to comply with federal regulations and are subsequently taken out of service, undergoing decommissioning, parting out, and ultimately scrapping.\" The company collects the galvanized steel panels—often graffitied—that these decommissioned railcars are clad in. The 12-gauge material is still super-sturdy, and customers have used them to create fencing, planters, protective enclosures and cladding for platforms. The panels are 8' x 3' and weigh 71 pounds each. They're located in Iowa and run $99 a pop. They're willing to ship them if you can't pick up, but you've got to contact them for a quote.",
