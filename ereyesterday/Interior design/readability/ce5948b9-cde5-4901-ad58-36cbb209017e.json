  "text": "Paris Fashion Week will wrap up today, and before it does, Parisian accessories and apparel brand Coperni made sure to leave a lasting impression on the runway. The little-known luxury brand’s Fall Winter 25 show was themed “Digital Community,” featuring models wearing Ray-Ban Meta glasses to record the runway from their perspective. What’s particularly interesting is that these Meta glasses were created in collaboration with Coperni and are strictly limited to only 3,600 examples. According to Meta, Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni glasses, “sport all the same capabilities” as previous Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. So, this pair is not for a tech upgrade per se. You are not getting any additional features that are already available. This collaborative eyewear is basically a blend of tech and “sleek sophisticated style,” which is ready to up your fashion game, or become a prized souvenir in your show window because of its limited availability and exclusivity. Designer: Meta So, if you’re a collector or someone ready to shell out a premium for a special edition eyewear that even Mark Zuckerberg was spotted wearing recently, then you must read on for the details about the Ray-Ban Meta x Coperni glasses. The glasses feature the iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer frames, which have been customized with dual branded transparent black frames and gray mirrored lenses. The transparent version of its smart glasses is not new to Meta. The company recently released a transparent frame limited-edition model for $429. The difference here is the black color, gray lenses, and the Coperni logo on the arms. Other than that, as mentioned, the first-ever fashion collaboration model by Meta, features similar capabilities to any standard Meta Ray-Ban smart eyewear. This includes support for Shazam, which allows users to search and play music on Spotify or Amazon Music with their voice command. The glasses can use Meta AI to help you remember things, have a built-in 12 MP camera to take high-res photos and record videos from your eye’s perspective. Early access users in the US and Canada can also get to try a new translation feature that supports “English and Spanish, French, or Italian” for now. To be sold in a specially designed Ray-Ban leather case, the Meta x Coperni glasses are now available priced at $549. This exclusively numbered pair of glasses (etched with the number on the temple) can be purchased through the Meta website directly in the US, Canada, UK, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and Australia. Customers in other countries like Ireland, Austria, Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden can get a pair through the Ray-Ban and Coperni websites.",
