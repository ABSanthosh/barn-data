  "description": "Millie Savage describes her home as colourful and chaotic, meets comfortable and functional. Located in Gherang, Victoria on the edge of Great Otway National Park, the existing farmhouse on site was transformed over 18 months by the jewellery designer and her husband James Noble, with a dream team of creative collaborators. Almost everything in the home is custom made, from the glass blown lighting pendants to the terrazzo kitchen floors, and arched cubbyholes showcasing Millie’s crystal collection. The landscaping introduces a plumbed outdoor bath, custom glasshouse, and plenty of open space for the couple’s goats, alpacas, dogs, and horses. Millie says, ‘If one of my rings or one of James’ suits was a house, it would be this house!’",

  "text": "The house of jeweller Millie Savage, and Reigner Clothing owner James Noble, is one of the most unique homes we’ve ever seen. Three years ago, when the couple bought the property, it was another story entirely. ‘It was an old farmhouse; very white, with low, flat ceilings and small windows,’ says Millie. ‘All the pitched ceilings had been plastered over and the entire interior was white.’ What the couple did love was the exterior shape of the house (‘It had that old barn feel with a steeply pitched roof,’ Millie says), established trees (the property is a few minutes drive from The Otways), and plenty of land for animals. Millie and James lived in the existing house for a year getting to know the site, before embarking on a major transformation to make it their own. ‘Creativity can be expressed in so many ways, and building our home felt like an extension of what we do every day with our work… It’s as much a creative expression as it is a place to live,’ says Millie. The existing home was gutted, making way for a more generously configured floor plan, huge windows, and a rainbow of ‘outrageous’ colours. Millie explains the vision, ‘We wanted each room to feel completely different from the rest of the house — like stepping into a new experience. ‘It’s gotta feel warm, it’s gotta feel fun, and most importantly, it’s gotta feel like a place you want to party!’ Each room is anchored by one or two key colours, layered with custom detail, starting with the kitchen floors. ‘They are pink terrazzo with different colour stone slabs smashed up and placed in,’ says Millie. ‘I chose stones that are already throughout the house. For example, the green stone on the kitchen bench is one of the same stones on the floor.’ The sky blue feature wall of cubbyholes housing Millie’s crystal collection is another one-of-a-kind detail. ‘The crystal wall was inspired by a visit to the Museum of Natural History in New York where I was blown away by how beautifully the crystals were displayed,’ Millie says. ‘To make the wall, I hand drew the arches before cutting them out, and the plasterers created little cubbyholes for the crystals.’ She adds, ‘Honestly, I’m not sure I buy into the idea of crystals giving you powers (cool if you do, no judgment!), but I do know this wall makes me so happy to look at every day. Crystals are nature’s art pieces, and that says enough, right?’ Another statement piece — and one of Millie’s favourite features of the entire home — is the lavender clawfoot bath occupying its own corner of the main bedroom. ‘I love purple and green together and the green onyx stone with the lavender bathtub is iconic,’ she says. ‘I bathe every day and sometimes even take meetings while I’m in the bath. It’s probably where you will find me if you come over!’ Millie and James weren’t always sure of their daring colour choices, but everything came together with the right furniture and styling. ‘To be honest, we actually were not happy with the colours of the stairs, the green wall, the blue fireplace until we moved the furniture in and lived with it for a bit!’ Millie says. ‘Most people wouldn’t dream of the outrageous palette we’ve gone with, but sticking to just four colors just isn’t us.’ The exterior retains the farmhouse feel of the original house enhanced by recycled, corrugated iron cladding sourced via Facebook Marketplace. The landscaping remains a work in progress, but much has been done to personalise the property to suit the couple and their animals (goats, alpacas, dogs, and horses!) ‘We redid the garden, plumbed in an outdoor bath with hot water, added new sheds, and redid all the plumbing and water systems,’ says Millie. A special shout out to the ‘goat tower’ built by Millie’s dad! ‘It’s absolutely incredible; a concrete culvert with a spiral staircase and a copper roof,’ says Millie. ‘The goats love it, and at night, if you come out with a torch, you’ll see all these tiny little eyes staring back at you from the tower. It’s the best gift ever!’ James and Millie worked with numerous people to make the design and build of their home happen, including two builders (Moon Building Group and Jaros Construction ), a draftsperson (Jordy Fella), designer (Vincent Jarvis Studio, who did the technical drawings), architect (Isabelle Jooste, who designed the green bathroom) and lighting designer (Leisa Wharington, who made all the feature glass lighting), just to name a few! ‘It was a massive team effort. James and I always had a super clear vision of what we wanted, not on paper, just in our heads,’ explains Millie. The renovated house is now thoroughly enjoyed by Millie and James and regular guests who stay in the dedicated bunk room (sleeps eight!). ‘Hosting is a big part of our lives, and we’ve designed the house to be perfect for it,’ says Millie. ‘When our friends come down from Melbourne, we can comfortably sleep a ridiculous number of people, so the party doesn’t have to end!’",
