  "text": "Chinese studio One Plus Partnership used red bricks to create wave-like surfaces inside this cinema lobby in the city of Haikou, China, emerging from the floors and ceilings to form a reception counter, tables and chairs. The setting of Haikou Gaoxingli Insun Cinema in Hainan Island's coastal capital informed the use of shapes that evoke the rippling surface of the sea. One Plus Partnership used red bricks to fit out the lobby of a cinema in Haikou\"We wanted to create something related to the ocean because Haikou is surrounded by the ocean,\" One Plus Partnership said. \"But we also wanted to create something unique.\" \"We didn't want to use the colour blue like the ocean, so we decided to use brick for the theme of our design because bricks are made of sand, which lies on the beach.\" The wave-like surfaces are informed by Haikou's coastal locationThe application of a single material throughout the space contributes to an immersive experience that emphasises the interplay of light, texture and colour on the brick surfaces. Unlike typical cinema interiors, the architects incorporated openings that allow natural light to enter the lobby and cafe area. This results in a dynamic effect of shifting shadows throughout the day. Brick forms rise from the floor to create countertops and seatingsSeveral brick forms rise up from the floor to create countertops and booths with curved profiles, while arched shapes suspended from the ceiling like stalactites help conceal lighting and air vents. Bricks covering the floor and ceiling contain integrated lighting that shines through perforations in their surface at nighttime. Uplighting was also used to introduce soft, indirect illumination to the overhead arches. The various protrusions are arranged to create a layered aesthetic that adds to the dynamism of the space. The reception counter is flanked by bench seating that appears to grow from the surrounding floor. As a safety measure to prevent collisions, the sides of the wave-like forms and some of the overhanging elements are painted grey so they stand out against the otherwise monochrome backdrop. Perforated bricks in the ceiling and floor feature integrated lightingThe cinema's main auditorium is enveloped by curving wooden forms that reference the way the South China Sea wraps around Hainan Island. Integrated lighting enhances the layered composition. One Plus Partnership wanted the cinema to eschew conventions associated with this type of space and provide the sort of memorable and communal experience that cannot be replicated by home viewing. The cinema's main auditorium is framed by curving wooden formsThe Hong Kong-based firm has worked on several similarly bold designs for cinemas in China, including one in Shenzhen where sculptural spotlights produce dramatic lighting effects.
