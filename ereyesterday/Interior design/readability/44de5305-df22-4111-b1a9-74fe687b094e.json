  "text": "Local art collective Xpan has created a multi-purpose creative studio called Xpan.Ep.1 in Mexico City using raw steel, aluminium, and transparent polycarbonate panels for its interior. Located in the Roma Norte neighbourhood of Mexico City, Xpan Espacio Público Uno (Xpan.Ep.1) is a studio and event space founded by the Xpan collective and led by Hadid that showcases rotating installations of clothing, objects, books, design, and other creative projects by designers and artists within the local community. Moisés Sacal Hadid and the Xpan collective have created a multi-purpose creative space in Mexico CityXpan created a sense of \"monotony and monochromaticity\" within the narrow footprint of Xpan.Ep.1 by using a pared-down material palette of transparent polycarbonate panels, aluminium, and steel. The polycarbonate panels were used to line the walls and ceilings of the space, while skeletal central couches, shelving and fixtures are made of metal. It is lined with polycarbonate panels\"The design of Xpan.Ep.1 manifests as a translucent polycarbonate tunnel, defined by its monotony and monochromaticity, producing the illusion of an infinite void,\" Xpan founder Moisés Sacal Hadid told Dezeen. \"The spatial configuration was determined by the imperative of creating a modular and versatile structure, capable of hosting an extensive spectrum of artistic works emerging from the interconnected network of creators within Xpan.\" A row of speakers runs down the centre of the ceilingThe space is further defined by a row of speakers affixed to the ceiling that runs down its centre and concludes in a cascade of wires connected to a metallic deck below. Two larger speakers sit on either side, while small shelves hold flowers or objects above it. As the space is designed to be multipurpose, adjustments can made to accommodate different installations. For instance, straight, metal hooks can be inserted into the walls to display clothing, while shelving can be removed. The space's central couches, one of which is shown draped in a gauzy fabric, can also be removed to open up the space for a music performance or event. A shelving system can be adjusted depending on the installation or eventLighting also runs the length of the walls and ceiling, tucked between the polycarbonate cladding and structural walls. Xpan.Ep.1 was born out of a need for a more permanent space to host events within Hadid's local community. Lighting sits in between the structure and cladding\"Xpan.Ep.1 is our first permanent multipurpose project space open everyday to our community and the general public,\" said Hadid. \"We've been collaborating with around 170 artist in around 40 activations in the last 3 years and an open space like this was a necessary next step both for us and our increasing creative community.\" Elsewhere in Mexico City, local studio Aprdelesp displayed a collection of colourful wall outlets as part of an exploration of the often overlooked design element and Mexican designers considered \"the house of the future\" as part of the city's design week.
