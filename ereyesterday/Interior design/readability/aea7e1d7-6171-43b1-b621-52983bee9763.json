  "text": "It takes someone with a good eye to see a simple grey and white apartment with a shiny green front door as the site of their dream home. When looking to buy an apartment in Melbourne’s inner-north, designer Will Kelly wasn’t focused on these cosmetic (and easily updated) details. He was seeking a property with a sense of character, solidity, and liveable proportions, and he found it in this 1960s Northcote unit. ‘The building itself has a character and a unique kookiness and charm about it that I had not seen previously,’ Will says. The designer purchased the one-bedroom apartment without the intention to renovate (save for removing the old carpet and some ‘cumbersome’ joinery elements), until plumbing issues were uncovered two years later. The apartment soon flooded on multiple occasions, triggering a major renovation to restore its services and transform the interiors from the ground up. ‘The bathroom problem was the push I needed to actually think about the apartment holistically, and address aspects that had begun to frustrate me over the months prior,’ says Will. Within five months, the 40-square-metre apartment was completely gutted and rebuilt. Internal walls were reconfigured, and new kitchen joinery was introduced, including a wall-mounted counter, chosen for its ‘lighter’ appearance compared to a traditional island bench. These changes also opened up the space to allow for a dining table and a more ‘purposeful’ living area. Will explains, ‘Small apartments always seem to prioritise this big cool kitchen, while leaving nowhere to actually “live.”’ Functionality is now optimised through clever storage solutions, including a tall cupboard that conceals the front door-facing oven (deliberately out of sight from the living area), and mirrored cupboard opposite that allows the fridge to disappear into the wall. ‘I enjoy how the mirrored door can be left open at different angles to reflect the trees and view over the balcony, or capture northern light coming through the kitchen window, while always reflecting the entry door colour,’ says Will. A portable induction cooktop is tucked away in the top kitchen drawer when not in use. The combination of marmoleum floors, two-pack grey-green joinery, and an elegant stainless steel bench reflect Will’s overall design philosophy, which values attention to detail and showcasing unexpected materials. ‘It’s objects or pieces that have an honesty to them and feel good,’ explains Will. ‘They’re not overworked, dressy or “pretend,” but hopefully have a kooky side or flair which keeps it interesting and surprising.’ The basic bathroom was also completely overhauled in the renovation to feature sophisticated olive-green tiles, reconfigured fittings, and an integrated laundry. Wall tiles are laid to the bathroom ceiling in an offset pattern to discreetly conceal misaligned corners and flaws on the original walls. The existing front door — which previously looked like a slightly out-of-place 2000s addition — is suddenly right at home in the renovated apartment thanks to Will’s sparing use of bold colour. It’s now his favourite place to be. ‘I’m so pleased, and relieved, with how it’s all come together,’ he says. ‘It’s been remarkable to be now living in a space where simply everything works.’",
