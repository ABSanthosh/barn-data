I have an exciting week ahead! My two grandkiddies are coming for the week with my older daughter and my S-I-L. Zoe is 6 now and is her spring break from school. Dean will be 2 in May. They are getting so big! They got here last night and I kissed them all up and still am today. This Mimi can never plant enough kisses on their adorable cheeks. :-) They live out in Los Angeles so we don’t get to see them on a weekly basis, except for online video chats. Later in the week my younger daughter is coming so we will have a full house. If the weather is anything like last week, some rain, but mostly sunny hot days – 87 degrees, we may even be able to put our feet in the lake. :-) I hope you have a great week. Now onto the links I found for you this week. Post navigation",
