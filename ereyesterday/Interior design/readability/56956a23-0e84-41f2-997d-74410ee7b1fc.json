As the latest addition to the company’s flagship lineup, these earbuds promise high-resolution sound, exceptional call quality, and intuitive features designed for real-world use. From tackling noisy environments during calls to delivering an immersive music experience with tailored EQ settings, the FreeBuds Pro 4 seems ready to take on the challenges of everyday life. Let’s dive into how they perform. PROS: Bone-Conduction Technology for Outstanding Call Quality Dual-Driver True Sound System for Immersive Audio Effective Noise Control Modes Memory Foam Tips for Comfort and Noise Isolation Dual-Device Connection for Multi-Tasking CONS: Battery Life with All Features Enabled Limited Customization Options for EQ RATINGS: SUSTAINABILITY / REPAIRABILITYEDITOR'S QUOTE:FreeBuds Pro 4 redefines clarity and comfort—perfect for immersive listening and crystal-clear calls in any environment. Designer: Huawei Design and Aesthetics Huawei’s FreeBuds Pro 4 comes into a world already saturated by wireless earbuds that promise comfort, clarity, and a stylish form. The design language of these Huawei earbuds should not be ignored, especially considering how many brands forget that we wear these devices as part of our personal style. This isn’t a gaudy attempt at jewelry. Instead, its understated style enhances its appeal, allowing it to complement a wide range of personal aesthetics while remaining functional. The minimalist design ensures that the earbuds feel professional for work calls yet casual enough for everyday use, making them versatile for any scenario. Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 The FreeBuds Pro 4 comes across more like a finely tuned instrument. The materials and finishing radiate a subtle sense of care rather than flamboyance. They feel confident in their presence. While certain earlier earbud models from various brands have been plagued by slippery finishes or cheap-feeling plastic, Huawei took time to produce something that can actually withstand everyday handling without showing scratches the moment you toss them into a bag. I respect that. The subtle branding and finishing details don’t scream for attention, but if you pay attention, you notice the layers of careful craftsmanship. These are refined enough that you can hold them and sense the design decisions that Huawei made. They are small objects that serve multiple roles in a modern lifestyle. Whether it’s transitioning seamlessly from a high-stakes business call to an evening of relaxing music, these earbuds adapt effortlessly. They feel purposeful, combining functional elegance with durability—offering a sense of reliability that makes you proud to use them daily, not as just another disposable gadget. Ergonomics The fit inside my ears is stable and comfortable, thoughtfully crafted to accommodate a wide range of ear shapes. I wore them for hours on end during my flight from Dubai to Dallas, and they remained incredibly comfortable—a testament to Huawei’s ergonomic design. The memory foam ear tips adapt naturally to the ear canal, creating a secure yet unobtrusive seal that minimizes sound leakage while enhancing comfort. This seal plays a vital role in reducing ambient noise, allowing me to immerse myself in music or focus on work without interruption. One of the FreeBuds Pro 4’s most impressive aspects is its lightweight construction. Even after prolonged use, I didn’t feel any strain or pressure on my ears, a crucial feature for long-haul travelers or those wearing them throughout the day. The thoughtful balance of form and function ensures these earbuds feel natural as an extension of your daily routine. The design also fosters a sense of acoustic balance. Whether I was navigating through a bustling airport terminal or seated in a noisy cabin, the FreeBuds Pro 4 delivered a consistent sense of calm. The combination of comfort, practicality, and noise isolation creates an experience that feels uniquely tailored to real-world challenges, making these earbuds more than just another gadget in your bag. Performance The Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 offers a variety of noise control modes that adapt to your environment and personal preferences, enhancing the overall listening experience. The Noise Canceling mode, set to “Ultra,” excels in eliminating background distractions such as bustling terminals or airplane cabins. During my flight from Dubai to Dallas, switching to this mode drowned out the low rumble of the engines and even softened the sharp cries of a nearby baby, making it far easier to focus on music or relax. The Awareness mode is equally practical for situations where you need to stay alert. While waiting for boarding announcements at the airport, I switched to this mode and appreciated how it amplified surrounding sounds just enough to keep me connected to my environment without removing the clarity of my audio. For moments when no active noise cancellation is needed, the Off mode provides a more neutral experience, preserving battery life while still offering the same high-quality audio playback. These modes illustrate Huawei’s thoughtful approach to real-world usability. Moving seamlessly between a quiet office, a busy public space, or even transitioning from one to the other, the earbuds adapt without skipping a beat. What I love most about these transitions is the audible notification that accompanies each mode switch. It’s a simple yet thoughtful addition that ensures I know exactly which setting I’ve selected without needing to glance at the app. This level of intuitive design is rare and makes a noticeable difference in seamless usability. Through its high-end specifications, the Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 offers a refined listening experience. At the heart of its design is the Dual-driver True Sound system combined with retuned Digital Cross-Over technology. This configuration allows precise handling of individual frequency ranges, offering clarity and depth for every track. Supporting this is the powerful 11mm Quad-Magnet Dynamic Driver Unit, ensuring rich and distortion-free sound across different genres. To enhance the audio quality further, Huawei’s proprietary Bluetooth L2HC 4.0 codec enables high-resolution audio transmission at up to 24-bit/48kHz with an impressive 2.3 Mbps speed. These features ensure that music playback remains immersive and true to its original quality, from soft instrumentals to dynamic, bass-heavy tracks. Using the EQ presets provided in the app, I tested various music genres that align with my preferences. Bass Boost: I turned on “Bass Boost” for tracks like Dua Lipa’s Don’t Start Now and Calvin Harris’s Slide. The low-end frequencies gained a deep, rich punch without overpowering the vocals or the treble. The bass remains tight and controlled, adding energy to upbeat tracks. Treble Boost: For acoustic recordings, I switched to “Treble Boost” while listening to John Mayer’s Neon and Fleetwood Mac’s Landslide. The clarity of the plucked strings came through vividly, giving these tracks a lifelike quality that felt intimate and warm. Voices: For podcasts and vocal-heavy tracks like Adele’s Hello or Sam Smith’s Stay With Me, the “Voices” setting isolated the mids perfectly, making every word and note resonate with clarity. Even during noisy environments, the emphasis on vocal frequencies ensured nothing got lost. Hi-Fi Live: Playing Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody in “Hi-Fi Live” mode captured the dynamic shifts in the song beautifully. The balance between the intricate layering of vocals and instruments felt almost like being present at a live performance. Classical: While listening to Yo-Yo Ma’s performance of Bach’s Cello Suite No. 1, the “Classical” preset highlighted the warmth and depth of the cello, enhancing every bow stroke’s detail and emotion. Sitting next to a screaming infant on an airplane prior to takeoff, I placed a call to a colleague. The sharp, piercing cries of the baby, alternating between high-pitched wails and desperate sobs, created an environment that felt chaotic and overwhelming. The FreeBuds Pro 4, equipped with advanced bone-conduction VPU microphone technology and an AI noise reduction algorithm, dulled the high-pitched wails to a manageable hum. This ensured my conversation remained uninterrupted. On the other end of the line, my colleague heard my voice with alarming clarity, reporting that the background noise was virtually eliminated. Even in a breezy outdoor space, the wind did not translate into overwhelming mic distortion. Thanks to this technology, the other side of the line received a well-isolated version of my voice. Meetings, calls, and interviews can proceed naturally, even in less-than-ideal conditions. Each preset feels tailored to amplify the strengths of specific genres without resorting to over-processing. The Dual-driver True Sound system works with the Digital Cross-Over technology to provide a clean, distortion-free experience. When playing back lossless audio files at 24-bit/48kHz, as in Fleet Foxes’ Helplessness Blues, the earbuds reveal an extra layer of tonal richness that’s absent in most competing earbuds. The Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 pushes a real sense of precision in their sound. I know these are not pro-audio-grade studio monitors, but they do not need to be. Instead, they strike a healthy balance between detail and warmth. Value and Conclusion In my ongoing evaluation of audio gear, I place a heavy emphasis on how something works in daily life. Specs, brand names, and press releases can only tell a fraction of the story. The Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 shows the company understands what it means to integrate seamlessly into a user’s world. For example, when moving from a video call on my laptop to playing music on my phone, the Dual Device Connection feature ensures a smooth transition without the need for manual pairing. This functionality, combined with wear detection that pauses and resumes audio automatically, makes the earbuds feel intuitive and effortless to use. The clarity of call quality, the stable performance in streaming high-fidelity audio, and the robust battery life stand out more strongly than any marketing buzz. The brand’s focus on noise cancellation that actually works in varied environments shows care and attention to real-world challenges. The comfort of memory foam ear tips that reduce sound leakage stands out as well. This new Huawei model demonstrates that the company took real-world obstacles into account, from wind noise to inconsistent network conditions. The underlying message from Huawei’s FreeBuds Pro 4 is that refinement and practicality don’t have to sit on opposite ends of the spectrum. High-resolution audio retains its crispness without compromising stable connectivity. The design combines comfort with individuality, avoiding the generic aesthetic that fades into the background. Noise cancellation handles unpredictable environments effectively, not limiting itself to quiet offices. Smart features are thoughtfully implemented to enhance workflows without coming across as gimmicks. All these elements come together in these earbuds and reflect an approach that respects the user’s real-world context. After thorough use, I am impressed with how consistently well these earbuds handle everyday challenges. The Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 is far more than a spec sheet or a flashy launch event. They’re a step toward making wireless earbuds fit into our lives as effortlessly as possible, blending balanced sound reproduction, stable calls, and comfortable ergonomics in a way that rewards those who actually pay attention to what matters.",

The sharp, piercing cries of the baby, alternating between high-pitched wails and desperate sobs, created an environment that felt chaotic and overwhelming. The FreeBuds Pro 4, equipped with advanced bone-conduction VPU microphone technology and an AI noise reduction algorithm, dulled the high-pitched wails to a manageable hum. This ensured my conversation remained uninterrupted. On the other end of the line, my colleague heard my voice with alarming clarity, reporting that the background noise was virtually eliminated. Even in a breezy outdoor space, the wind did not translate into overwhelming mic distortion. Thanks to this technology, the other side of the line received a well-isolated version of my voice.

The Dual-driver True Sound system works with the Digital Cross-Over technology to provide a clean, distortion-free experience. When playing back lossless audio files at 24-bit/48kHz, as in Fleet Foxes’ Helplessness Blues, the earbuds reveal an extra layer of tonal richness that’s absent in most competing earbuds.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 pushes a real sense of precision in their sound.

Specs, brand names, and press releases can only tell a fraction of the story. The Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 shows the company understands what it means to integrate seamlessly into a user’s world. For example, when moving from a video call on my laptop to playing music on my phone, the Dual Device Connection feature ensures a smooth transition without the need for manual pairing. This functionality, combined with wear detection that pauses and resumes audio automatically, makes the earbuds feel intuitive and effortless to use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/12/huawei-freebuds-pro-4/Huawei-FreeBuds-Pro-4-1.jpg\" data-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/12/huawei-freebuds-pro-4/Huawei-FreeBuds-Pro-4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1280\" height=\"960\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"\" data-jpibfi-post-url=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/2024/12/20/huawei-freebuds-pro-4-review-transforming-everyday-listening-with-superior-audio-and-seamless-communication/\" data-jpibfi-post-title=\"Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 Review: Transforming Everyday Listening with Superior Audio and Seamless Communication\" data-jpibfi-src=\"https://www.yankodesign.com/images/design_news/2024/12/huawei-freebuds-pro-4/Huawei-FreeBuds-Pro-4-1.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe clarity of call quality, the stable performance in streaming high-fidelity audio, and the robust battery life stand out more strongly than any marketing buzz. The brand’s focus on noise cancellation that actually works in varied environments shows care and attention to real-world challenges. The comfort of memory foam ear tips that reduce sound leakage stands out as well. This new Huawei model demonstrates that the company took real-world obstacles into account, from wind noise to inconsistent network conditions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe underlying message from Huawei’s FreeBuds Pro 4 is that refinement and practicality don’t have to sit on opposite ends of the spectrum. High-resolution audio retains its crispness without compromising stable connectivity. The design combines comfort with individuality, avoiding the generic aesthetic that fades into the background. Noise cancellation handles unpredictable environments effectively, not limiting itself to quiet offices. Smart features are thoughtfully implemented to enhance workflows without coming across as gimmicks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll these elements come together in these earbuds and reflect an approach that respects the user’s real-world context. After thorough use, I am impressed with how consistently well these earbuds handle everyday challenges. The Huawei FreeBuds Pro 4 is far more than a spec sheet or a flashy launch event. They’re a step toward making wireless earbuds fit into our lives as effortlessly as possible, blending balanced sound reproduction, stable calls, and comfortable ergonomics in a way that rewards those who actually pay attention to what matters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n                                            \u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
