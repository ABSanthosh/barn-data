  "text": "Ukrainian studio Bude Architects has designed a minimalist showroom and salon for cosmetic company Pleka in Kyiv. As the first step in a brand transformation for Pleka, the studio designed the showroom in an early 20th-century building to showcase natural materials with a neutral and inviting colour palette. Bude Architects has taken a minimalist approach to the showroom interiorHistoric yellow bricks made from local clay, which are characteristic of architecture in Kyiv during the 19th and early 20th century, were exposed throughout the interior. The studio showcased the material as it was keen to create a space that resonated with the architecture of the building, with other materials selected to complement this brickwork. Exposed yellow brick has been incorporated as a key feature throughout the interior\"The choice of materials was influenced by the space background,\" Bude Architects co-founder Julia Shataliuk told Dezeen. \"We wanted to showcase the historic yellow brick, so we were looking for good companions for it.\" The multifunctional showroom incorporates a retail space and a beauty salonThe studio combined the brickwork with natural woods, travertine and an earthy shade of decorative plaster, with the aim of creating a warm environment to reflect Pleka's brand identity. \"The brand's core value is a careful and attentive attitude towards its customers,\" Julia Shataliuk explained. \"They manifest the importance of each person taking care of themselves.\" \"It was important for us to create a space that would convey the brand's openness, create a special atmosphere, and improve the customer experience,\" she continued. \"This is reflected in the spatial solutions and materials.\" Pared back, neutral tones have been used throughout the space to create a calming environmentBude Architects designed the space to encourage customers to interact with staff and test the products as well as utilising the beauty services on offer. \"Pleka had a request to give customers more attention and an individual approach,\" said Julia Shataliuk. \"The result of the cooperation is a hybrid space where they comfortably unite a store and an express beauty salon in a small area.\" Designated seating areas were incorporated into the scheme to create a comfortable customer experienceSet in a sunken ground floor, the showroom's entrance space has a large reception desk, a client meeting area and a large, feature shelving unit. The studio designed the space to draw people in from the busy street. \"It was crucial for us to use the shape of the room and its content to attract the attention of passers-by from the street through the windows,\" explained co-founder Denys Shataliuk. A large dining table adds a homely element to the interiorThe shelving unit on the far wall functions as a focal point within the space to highlight the retail products – made from aluminium and mounted onto a mirrored surface, the unit was intended to contrast with the earthy tones of the interior. This section also contains a large meeting table, which acts as a designated area for clients to meet with staff and emphasises Pleka's aim of building lasting customer relationships. \"When we researched the brand to reflect its identity in the interior, we learned that the company establishes warm and long-term relationships with its customers,\" said Denys Shataliuk. \"It was important to express this friendliness through the space by creating an atmosphere of trust and comfort.\" The large shelving unit acts as a focal point to showcase Pleka’s cosmetic productsAt the rear of the showroom, the second room has a more private atmosphere, with \"a functional double-sided island with a built-in-sink\" utilised for product testing and Pleka's beauty salon services. Small hearts have also been incorporated throughout the interior scheme to reflect the brand identity, featured on custom clothing hooks and metal inlays in the worktops. The double-sided island is used for product testing and beauty salon servicesBude Architects was founded by Ukrainian couple, Denys and Julia Shataliuk. Originally from Kharkiv, the architects were forced to relocate to Kyiv due to the ongoing conflict. Other recently completed projects in Kyiv include a Nastia Mirzoyan's renovation of a Stalinist-era flat and a colourful industrial-style interior created by design studio Dihome.
