  "text": "The concept of heritage covers a varied range of historical eras and building types, including Victorian, Edwardian, Californian Bungalow, Arts and Crafts and Art Deco. I love using colour and a balance of iconic and contemporary designs to bring out the nostalgia and whimsy of these homes. For those wanting to re-create the look, here’s how: Colour. I find colour is very useful in highlighting the detail in older homes — the ins and outs of architraves and cornices, for instance. For heritage homes, I like to work with deep or softly muted tones. I often choose one or two colours and vary their hues to highlight features and details — blue and green (should always be seen) — and then inject small amounts of contrast — like deep burgundy or rosy pink. Material and texture. Hard surfaces with flecks of detail — natural stone and terrazzo — or those that have the potential to patina over time — like stainless steel — are perfect for this look. Texture is important, but secondary to colour. Look, therefore, for fabrics with simple textures — like leather or linen — to allow the colour in the overall scheme to be the hero. Irrespective of mood, you should always have functionality and durability in mind. Furniture and styling. When selecting furniture, look for relaxed, round and casual pieces in low-lying forms. It’s all about soft edges and curved forms — nothing too bulky or bold. For decorative pieces, be selective with retro or vintage finds. An old toaster or coffee machine look great in the kitchen with antique vases, ceramics and glassware, for instance.
