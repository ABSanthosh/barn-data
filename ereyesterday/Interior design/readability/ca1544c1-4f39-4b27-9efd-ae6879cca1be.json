  "description": "The vision for this 1900s North Hobart home renovation was to create the sense of being overseas on holiday, while still feeling unmistakably like home. Working with the classical features of the house, interior designers This Vacant Space achieved this brief with thoughtful interventions applied to the existing footprint. It’s now a house that inspires relaxation, with custom details that enhance the everyday experience.",

  "text": "The client of this recent home renovation leads a busy life with a demanding career. She engaged interior designers This Vacant Space with a brief to escape the stresses of day-to-day life and reset in her 1900s North Hobart house. ‘Somewhere that gave the feeling you could be overseas on holiday, while still feeling unmistakably like home’ was the aim, explains Kate Moss, creative co-director at This Vacant Space. The existing house provided a rich foundation complete with high ceilings, leadlight windows, hallway arches, and plasterwork detail that the designers had no intention of touching. Their goal was to honour the home’s heritage while seamlessly integrating a considered, modern fit out. The renovation introduced a reconfiguration of the existing footprint, moving the bathroom from the rear to the centre of the home, and adding a small en suite. ‘Rather than expanding for the sake of space, the renovation focused on working within the existing footprint to enhance functionality and flow, says Kate. ‘A second bathroom was added, but the true transformation came from refining the layout, creating a home that feels more considered, functional and effortless to live in.’ Materials and finishes were selected to evoke the idea of ‘relax, recharge, reset.’ Raw textural elements ground the design, while soft curves and natural stone invite warmth, fluidity and a strong sense of comfort. Dressed head to toe in pink microcement and a custom stone basin, the new en suite is perhaps the most beloved room of the home. The home showcases a balance of serenity and vibrancy living up to its nickname, ‘Tranquil House.’",
