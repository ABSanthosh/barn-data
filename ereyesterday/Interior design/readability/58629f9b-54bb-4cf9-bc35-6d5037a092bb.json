  "description": "Located on a sprawling olive grove in Western Australia, this country homestead has been designed to be ‘used and loved’. Interior designer Megan Myers renovated the 40-year-old building to make it the perfect holiday house for a young Perth family, with all their friends and family in tow. Every inch of the property has been updated with natural materials that will only get better with age, ensuring nothing about the refreshed home feels too perfect.",

This was the case when it came to the renovation of this homestead in Eagle Bay, Western Australia. The owners bought the rural property in 2021, before seeking help from interior designer Megan Myers to turn it into a calming retreat that felt distinctly different to their usual home in Perth. ‘Their home in the city is very bright and contemporary, so they were looking to break away from that with a true country home that had charm and character, and felt nestled into its surroundings,’ interior designer Megan says. Located on a 70-hectare olive grove, the old home was built more than 40 years ago and paid homage to the Australian cottages built in the southwest region with a yellow and blue colour palette. ‘The home was filled with agricultural artefacts when the clients purchased it, all the original furniture remained, and the interior was unkept and needed an update,’ Megan says. The owners’ brief was heavily centred around entertaining and creating memories with friends and family — naturally, listing both indoor and outdoor dining spaces as must-have features. At the same time, the renovation had to feel seamless, like it had ‘always’ been that way. And once they started opening up the building to make room for more family-friendly spaces, Megan quickly realised they would have to ‘touch every inch of it, to ensure we had consistency’. ‘The original jarrah windows and doors throughout were sanded and painted bright white to enliven the spaces and help frame the views,’ Megan says. ‘We knew we wanted a warm and welcoming interior, so timber became the backdrop for this project. We selected an American oak then looked to detail the cabinetry slightly different for each space. ‘The clients loved the idea that nothing in the home would be perfect — everything would age with them as they shared memories in the spaces.’ This led to a selection of authentic and tactile materials: natural limestones, quartzites, timber veneers, and aged bronze metal accents. The expanded kitchen — which now forms the heart of the home — finally has enough room for eight stools to gather around the island bench. And the windows capture sweeping views out to the hill and dam on the property. It’s all the little details though that maintain the house’s vintage country feel. Original stone walls have been retained and refinished, whilst soft linen curtains and timber-lined ceilings nod to the home’s earlier iteration. ‘It’s a home designed to be used, and loved,’ Megan adds.",
