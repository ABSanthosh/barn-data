  "text": "Artists Guido Maestri and Sally Anderson are both represented by some of Australia’s leading galleries, so it’s no surprise their family home is an idyllic, art-filled sanctuary. Guido and Sally first came across 39 Neville Street, Marrickville about seven years ago in their hunt for a property closer to their studios, with a sunny backyard, and more living space. ‘Since I was pregnant at the time, we also wanted a space with a studio or garage where I could work from home,’ Sally says. ‘It took a few visits to fully see the potential of this place, but it checked so many of our boxes.’ While the circa 1890s home had retained some of its ceiling rosettes and archways, the kitchen and living room were sporting more pared-back renovations — making it a perfect backdrop for Guido and Sally to inject their own creative flair. ‘We undertook various renovations and restored many of the property’s original features,’ Sally adds. They reintroduced leadlight windows for more heritage flair, art deco light shades, and installed recycled Tasmanian oak floorboards. A marble benchtop and Moroccan tiles now fill the expanded kitchen with character, as the white walls turned out to be the perfect backdrop for the family’s incredible art collection. There’s even a playroom, which has been a great addition for their son Augie, and the studio at the back of the 411-square-metre block is a convenient workspace, with views across the lush backyard. ‘We also created an outdoor living and BBQ area, planted native gardens in both the front and backyards, and established a veggie garden,’ Sally says. She notes the outdoor areas have been a highlight from their time in the home, in addition to the ‘exceptional’ location close to schools, parks and the Sunday morning Marrickville Market — something they’ll miss when they hand the keys over to a new owner! 39 Neville Street, Marrickville, NSW is for sale with Rhonda Yim and Shannan Whitney from Bresic Whitney and will go to auction Saturday February 15 at 3:45pm.",
