  "text": "Choosing furniture often comes with the hope that it’ll stick around for years, maybe even decades. Yet, life changes, parts break, and our needs evolve, so it’s no surprise that pieces we once adored can end up replaced or tossed aside. A simple swap may seem harmless, but too often, we’re discarding good furniture because of one damaged part or a shift in function, not because the whole thing’s reached its end. That’s where the Multum furniture collection steps in, flipping the script on planned obsolescence. Instead of resigning yourself to a throwaway culture, Multum’s modular design invites you to reimagine and refresh your furniture as life demands. Crafted from sturdy oak, each desk, seat, and shelf in the collection is designed to last, and adapt, thanks to clever mounting points built right into their frames. Designer: Dominic Montante \u0026 Eugenio Schiano (Amuni) Multum’s secret sauce is its embrace of 3D printing and digital creativity. Each piece sports thoughtfully placed holes at the corners and edges, letting you pop in a wild array of custom accessories whenever you want. Need a tray for coffee mugs, a clip for your headphones, or a lamp that’s always within reach? Download a ready-made design, whip up something in your favorite modeling app, or let Multum’s AI-powered Generator help you dream up the perfect addition. Assembly is refreshingly tool-free, so you can swap accessories in and out on a whim. Desk This flexibility doesn’t just stop at accessories. A simple stool can morph into a side table, a multi-tier shelf, or even a modern coat rack, limited only by your imagination and what your 3D printer can handle. The ability to remodel a piece keeps things fresh and means you’re less likely to send it off to the landfill. Shelf The approach also makes every Multum piece feel uniquely personal. As your hobbies shift or your space changes, the furniture is right there with you, ready to be reconfigured. Stable oak frames anchor these transformations, providing a solid, elegant foundation that doesn’t go out of style. Meanwhile, digital design and 3D printing keep you in control, whether you’re picking from an ever-expanding library or inventing something new. Seat By focusing on reconfiguration over replacement, Multum encourages a more sustainable, thoughtful way of furnishing your home or workspace. It’s less about buying the next new thing and more about making what you have work better for you. Furniture becomes a bit like a platform: a stable partner in your creative life, ready to evolve as you do, one 3D-printed idea at a time.",
