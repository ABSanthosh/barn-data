  "description": "Scout is a retreat in Wānaka, a resort ski town in New Zealand’s South Island. It’s been a passion project for Strutt Studios managing director Sophie Bowers and her husband Josh Climpson, who stumbled across the property when it was an empty site in 2019. The Sydney couple’s resulting home-away-from-home is somehow equal parts humble and spectacular; rustic yet refined. And the mountain views are unbelievable!",

  "text": "It was pure luck that Sophie Bowers and Josh Climpson ended up as the owners of this incredible alpine retreat in New Zealand’s South Island. The story began when the couple took a ‘serendipitous road trip’ across Central Otago in 2019, and stumbled across an off-market property in a paddock with unobstructed views of Lake Wānaka and the surrounding peaks. ‘The site was a pristine, untouched section of grass — a blank canvas surrounded by Wānaka’s striking alpine terrain,’ says Sophie, managing director of Sydney-based design firm Strutt Studios. Immediately after visiting the site, they imagined building a unique holiday home there, even sketching out an initial concept for their dream build on the back of a napkin at dinner that evening. They bought the property, and as they say, the rest is history. While the build didn’t start until November 2023, Sophie and Josh stayed true to the simple forms they envisioned on their first day at the property. The resulting home, known as Scout, combines a tall, pitched-roof barn for communal living spaces; a central hub connecting entry and utility; and a shorter square dwelling for private rooms. ‘From the outset, we envisioned a contemporary interpretation of alpine tramping huts and wool sheds,’ Sophie says. ‘As there was no existing structure, we were free to design from scratch.’ She looked to the older part of Wānaka town for key architectural references, drawing inspiration from the restrained street facades with minimal openings and modernist alpine lodges. The exterior is bold yet utilitarian, clad entirely in corrugated iron — painted in a subtle, aged green hue — as another nod to New Zealand’s barn-style typography. ‘Like these rural buildings, Scout is designed to appear grounded and “bunkered down” into the landscape, revealing its true scale and volume only once you’re inside,’ Sophie says. ‘The greatest influence, however, was the seasonal colour palette of the surrounding landscape.’ A uniform backdrop of OSB chipboard lines the interior walls, allowing for accents of rich browns, iron reds, and moss tones. The polished concrete floors, walnut joinery, and handcrafted Japanese tiles also add to the calming atmosphere — enhanced by carefully placed windows and sliding doors revealing the truly spectacular mountain views. Sophie says Scout is a complete sanctuary that carefully balances private and public spaces, with luxurious additions like an outdoor bath, a 1970s-inspired conversation pit lounge room, and a rooftop balcony overlooking the lake. ‘We’re proud of how every element — from the intimate mezzanine lounge to the large picture window — seamlessly integrates into the landscape, making the home feel like a natural extension of its environment,’ Sophie says.",
