Of course it’s probably the most secure one that you can have to make sure that the bottles are protected and that the branding is pretty obvious. There have been a lot of innovations when it comes to packaging but most are still in the traditional box form or something similar to that. Korean perfume brand Sukhino commissioned design company with BKID co to create something different for their special collaboration with the Onyang Folk Museum which showcases the traditional life and culture of rural Koreans. Designer: BKID co The special perfume collaboration was for a fall exhibition at the museum and let users experience the smell of books. This is a come on for book lovers who love to sniff both old and new books. The perfume itself uses plant ingredients. So with those elements in play, it’s interesting to see what packaging it will come in, aside from the actual bottle. BKID co proposed using the traditional zip-pul craft which is used to store eggs and other fragile materials, but with a more modern and sophisticated approach. Using traditional Korean straw, the packaging encases the perfume just like it would other fragile materials. The back part of the perfume is the one that is encased while the front part has two lines of straw on top and at the bottom so that the branding is still seen. There some straws bunched together as well at the top and the bottom while a holder ties everything together. This way you can carry the perfume around, hopefully, securely. There are several variations to the packaging like the normal version, a uni strap option, and a tied strap variant which seems to be the most secure based on the renders. The modern addition to the traditional straw is that there are more colorful options to match the different scents or to just add a splash of color to the perfume. Having a straw packaging to support the bottle means you can also easily carry the bottle in your bag more securely, without the bulkiness of regular boxes. It would also be interesting to see how this kind of packaging would look like with other bottles and other fragile materials that would need some Korean straw to support it.",
