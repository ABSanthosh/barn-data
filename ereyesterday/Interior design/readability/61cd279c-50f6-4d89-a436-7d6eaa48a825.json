  "description": "Believe it or not, this orange thing… …is actually a bicycle frame. This wild-looking RCYL bike, by German plastics manufacturer Igus, is made primarily out of plastic and recycled plastic. The frame and fork, which are entirely plastic, are made from 50% recycled fishing nets. The company is billing it as a highly sustainable alternative to regular bicycles, and will take the bike back at the end of its life in order to recycle it into a new bike. It weighs 17kg (37.5 lbs), and the manufacturer bills it as a low-maintenance ride:\"Lightweight and lubrication-free high-performance plastics from Igus are used everywhere on the bicycle – from ball bearings in the wheel to bearings in the brake levers and pedals. All components have integrated solid lubricants and ensure low-friction dry running – without a single drop of lubricating oil.\" \"Owners can leave the bike outdoors in all weathers without hesitation and clean it in seconds with a garden hose. The bike, which is suitable for everyday use, does not rust and is virtually maintenance-free.\" It's said to be particularly well-suited for salty seaside climes, as corrosion is not an issue. The bike is available for order in Europe, and goes for €1,243 (USD $1,315). If you return the bike to them for recycling, they'll give you a €50 (USD $53) credit towards the purchase of a new bike.",
