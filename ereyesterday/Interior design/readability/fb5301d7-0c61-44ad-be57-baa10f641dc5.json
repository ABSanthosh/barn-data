  "description": "A crumbling 184-year-old post office might seem like an unlikely place for a holiday, but this one on the banks of the Carlton River in Tasmania has been given new life as a dreamy accommodation. Built in 1841, the property had endured periods of neglect and abandonment when the owners purchased the eclectic cottage with possums living in the roof a few years ago. They’ve since completely restored it to create Post House, which is now open for bookings!",

  "text": "Post House has lived many lives since it was first built back in 1841 in Carlton River, less than an hour’s drive from Hobart. After serving as the post office and Postmaster’s residence for more than 100 years until around 1949, the humble cottage was a local’s bachelor pad, before falling into extreme dilapidation in the late 1900s. Safe to say, the old home was in dire need of a renovation when general practitioner Dr Hannah Chapman and her husband came across it a few years ago, with a vision to create a holiday home they could also open up to guests. ‘What we purchased was an extremely eclectic little cottage, with lots of charm and eccentricity. It was draughty, with an outdoor long-drop toilet, no real bathroom, a makeshift kitchen, and possums living in the roof,’ Hannah says. ‘Everything was handmade, being pre-industrial era, and you can tell that the old nails are made by hand — no two are the same.’ Looking back on how dilapidated it was, Hannah admits she’s surprised they even took the building on. But its picturesque location on the banks of the river, combined with some other successful Georgian restoration projects in Tasmania like Bozen’s Cottage and Hollow Tree House served as major sources of inspiration. ‘From early on, we knew we wanted to highlight the heritage features of the property that were so unique and juxtapose this with some elevated pieces,’ Hannah says. Securing a grant from the Built Heritage Activations scheme — offered by Heritage Tasmania — allowed them to enlist a team of specialised professionals for the six-month renovation, including heritage architect Genevieve Lilley, builders Lawless Wagner and draftsman Ben Valentine. Sarah Andrews, who created the world-famous accommodation Captains Rest, also helped guide Hannah through the design process; initially with a formal consultation and her course The Hosting Masterclass, before the two became close friends. They even painted one of the textured walls together and travelled to France to source vintage gems at the famous flea markets. And once the house was complete, Sarah styled the finishing touches. ‘She strongly encouraged us to let the house shine and to avoid cluttering or over-styling it,’ Hannah adds. The new-and-improved kitchen features soft pink lime washed walls, a sleek brass bench with matching splashback, and views out towards the enchanting gardens. Embracing the cottage’s history and textural quality, they kept the 184-year-old hand-cut ceiling shingles exposed, while a wood fireplace adds ambience to the living room. ‘So much wisdom, skill and love have been poured into these walls,’ Hannah says. ‘I love that you can lie back in the bath or the bed and see the starry skies through the new bedroom windows.’ Everything has been carefully considered, so visitors can enjoy a true getaway to another space and time from the moment they step inside the riverside cottage.
