  "text": "nik bentel \u0026 kortney hinden unviel tea for two collectionNik Bentel and Kortney Hinden present Tea for Two, a collection of objects where everything is designed to be just a little different. A surrealist tea party designed for two (or more), the collection includes: a giant key fashioned into a handbag, a double-spouted teapot sized perfectly to fill a set of two slanted teacups with mutated teaspoons, and a warped deck of cards. As the artistic duo questions how to reimagine the mundane into something more exciting, something that can elevate the shared experience, each object is designed with the rule of using one twist: a shift in scale, a duplication, or a melting. Much like Bentel’s previous Picnic Collection, there remains a central idea of whimsy, joy, and sharing.For the campaign photoshoot, the designers collaborated with their friend, artist and writer Mackenzie Thomas, whose humor and sense of whimsy bring the collection’s surreal essence to life. Drawing from the world of surrealist storytelling, the imagery evokes the idea of a Mad Hatter-esque tea party, where every element is subtly off-kilter.all images courtesy of Nik Bentela tea set \u0026 playing cards elevate shared experiences with whimsyNik Bentel and Kortney Hinden are a couple based in New York City who design things together. ‘We share a tiny apartment in New York City,’ shares the duo. ‘We have routines and a fairly normal and relatable existence that we are constantly trying to reimagine and to bring magic into… In everything we do and make together we like to imagine how one thing can multiply into two or more.’The two’s creative partnership is rooted in these shared routines and rituals. They first met at a teahouse called Floating Mountain on 72nd Street and Broadway, a setting that became a significant source of inspiration for the project. Over time, they have amassed a collection of objects that relate to the act of sharing — one of which is the espresso maker for two people by Gemini Express. This piece directly informed the design of their double-spouted teapot, crafted to pour perfectly into the matching slanted teacups at same time. The limited Tea for Two collection will officially launch on January 29th and is currently available for preorder at the designer’s website.Nik Bentel and Kortney Hinden present Tea for Twoa collection of objects where everything is designed to be just a little differenta warped deck of cardsa giant key fashioned into a handbagthe duo questions how to reimagine the mundane into something more excitingmuch like Bentel’s previous Picnic Collection, there remains a central idea of whimsy, joy, and sharingca double-spouted teapot sized perfectly to fill a set of two slanted teacups with mutated teaspoonsproject info:name: The Tea For Two Collection designer: Nik Bentel, Kortney Hinden | @nikbentelstudiodesignboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here.edited by: ravail khan | designboom",
