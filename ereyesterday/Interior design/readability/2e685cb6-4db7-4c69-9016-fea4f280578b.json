His ability to mix and match textures, colors, and old and new decor pieces really shines in his kitchen makeovers. And now he wants to help you embark on your own remodel by sharing a few key pieces of wisdom before you break ground.“I’ve designed a lot of kitchens … Here are YOUR kitchen questions answered,” Berkus captioned a recent Instagram post. His advice on where to splurge and where to save might surprise you.“You can save by shopping for deals on quality appliances,” Berkus wrote, adding, “Look online for the best price possible.” And after saving some money on your appliances, you can reinvest it into your countertops.“Stone countertops are worth the splurge,” Berkus shared. And you probably saw that one coming based on his love of interesting marble in both kitchens and bathrooms.And while you’re investing in a stone countertop, Berkus suggests paying extra close attention to your backsplash as well. If you don’t want to continue the stone up the wall with a seamless backsplash, you can instead opt for hand-glazed tiles, which is a “design element that can’t be missed,” according to the designer.Berkus even suggests just tiling the range hood to turn the feature into a centerpiece rather than something you’re trying to disguise.Another kitchen tip Berkus shares is a way to maximize your space, even if you’re dealing with a tight floor plan. “Bring the cabinetry up to the ceiling, if you can, to maximize your storage,” he suggests, adding that using a vintage armoire as a pantry is a cool way to store away your items without skimping on style.Nate Berkus knows best!
