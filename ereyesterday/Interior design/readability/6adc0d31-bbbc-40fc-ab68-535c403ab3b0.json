Located on the prestigious Rue Saint-Honoré near the Louvre museum in central Paris, the store has \"a unique monochromatic design DNA\". Cybex has opened a flagship store in central ParisThe 359-square-metre store, which is spread across two floors, was finished in various muted beige, cream and taupe tones, with cement-finished walls. Within the space Cybex's various child-focused products are arranged on back-lit shelving and low-level plinths. The store showcases the brand's product range, encompassing strollers, car seats, baby carriers, among other related baby-related home products and accessories. The store's interior represents the brand's DNA\"This flagship reflects the luxury design aesthetic of our brand values in one unified sophisticated space,\" said Cybex senior director of corporate architecture, Andreas Skotnik. \"The muted tones, soft architectural shapes and intimate ambience are designed to reduce any sense of contrast and be the most complimentary in highlighting our products.\" The store is the brand's first physical location in Paris and follows openings in Prague, Tokyo and Amsterdam as it continues to expand with flagship stores. The Paris store follows openings in Prague, Tokyo and Amsterdam\"Paris was a natural next step,\" said Cybex founder Martin Pos. \"The French capital is one of the most elegant and dynamic cities in the world, with a target demographic and industry maturity and sophistication which are perfect for us,\" he continued. \"Parents and families in Paris are extremely cultured, elevated, and attentive to the highest quality products that can perfectly fit into their lifestyle, which is something I am proud to say we can deliver at best.\" The Paris store is part of the brands expansion into physical storesFounded by Pos in 2005, the German brand aims to produce comfortable and safe products for the juvenile market. With its move into retail, it is aiming to give its customers an experience aligned with more traditional luxury brands. Parenting should be the most emotionally luxurious experience in life,\" said Pos. \"And we want to give parents the opportunity to experience this with us in a space which not only represents the brand vision, but heightens the sense of luxury and service we provide.\" \"Our mission is to give parents a one-stop solution and be the best concierge possible for them to maintain their lifestyle without compromises,\" he continued. \"We do not want to be perceived simply as a juvenile brand and that is also why each store location and most specifically in Paris in in Rue Saint-Honoré, we are part of the ecosystem of the most of the luxurious brands on earth.\" The photography is by Ivan Mathie.
