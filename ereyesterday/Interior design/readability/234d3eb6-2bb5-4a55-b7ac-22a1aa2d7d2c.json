  "text": "Water holds memory, with modern representations steeped in human traditions surrounding the element. Purification, reflection, and even jubilation. The Kyiv, Ukraine, flagship showroom for fashion retailer One by One is mindfully crafted to tap into this phenomenon recalling the child-like spirit of joy and whimsy, which flows through a collective consciousness sharing the same fondness for a summer’s day poolside. Completed by world renowned architecture and interior design studio Between the Walls (BTW), this space unites a community burdened by war and uncertainty. What’s more, the aquatic theme not only influences the spatial concept but also the client’s marketing and branding strategy. “I asked myself, ‘what do I truly miss in life right now?’ The answer was lightness, air, and the feeling of being by the water. This project was a personal reception of the opposing emotions I’ve been feeling due to the ongoing war in Ukraine,” says the lead designer and BTW co-founder Victoria Karieva. “Through the concept of the interactive pool and playful design elements, we wanted to offer an escape – a place where people could experience joy, ease, and a sense of distraction, even if just for a short while.” Guests are fully immersed in the evocative interior architecture upon entry. The roughly 2,100-square-foot space comprises a main showroom floor with large niches for display and an adjoining dressing room lined with private changing booths. This more intimate area is akin to high fashion’s traditional salon typology where shopping and styling potential purchases is also an elevated social ritual. Leaning into this, the design blends beautiful displays with various interactive moments peppered throughout the store to create Instagrammable vignettes – something crucial for visibility and subsequently business in the digital age. Each fitting room is expertly staged to offer a sleek, modern aesthetic, with more white tiles, round metallic stools, and perfectly placed mirrors. Customers are invited to share their visits online, which expands the showroom’s reach and audience. The entire floor plan is flooded with soft, ambient light emanating from thoughtfully placed panels to avoid harsh glares. Anchoring the main area is a small ball pit – a recreational-style pool filled with cerulean orbs – where people can ‘splash’ for a photo opportunity against white tiles with red grout that provide the perfect backdrop. Another photo-worthy fixture is the cluster of custom 3D-printed pendants hanging just above it. And special niches punctuated within the walls are awash in the same expressive hue first introduced by the spheres. The modern, minimalist surroundings feel expansive as the scale of tiles shifts to something larger while striated wall treatments help draw the eyes upward. Many of the furnishings even echo the grid established by grout lines. White surfaces elsewhere provide a clean backdrop for the curated clothing displays, which also feature stainless steel rods that resemble the chrome handlebars often found in public pools. The varying heights, textures, and orientations of visual elements create a unique sense of undulation across the room. All the furniture was custom-designed by the BTW team and fabricated locally, with every piece customized to go with the flow. Here, the Ukrainian spirit boasts its ability to adapt and thrive amid adversity. This project reflects a mutual commitment, by businesses and creatives alike, to innovation and excellence in spite of the most difficult circumstances. “The client’s reactions were positive,” adds Karieva. “A ‘let’s keep moving forward’ attitude.” Co-founders Victoria Karieva and Andrii Anisimov To see the firm’s award-winning portfolio, visit betweenthewalls.com.ua.
