  "text": "DecoratingBy RoomBedroomsWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Bedrooms are highly personal spaces, so it’s no surprise when people dedicate a lot of time and effort into making sure the decor is perfect for their needs. I moved into a new apartment last month and have spent the past few weeks tweaking my styling, trying out different layouts, and rearranging just about everything.The only constant? The plush, geometric rug that sits under my bed. It was actually the first thing I purchased for my new room, and I absolutely love having something soft underfoot when I get out of bed in the morning. But when I started browsing for the perfect rug, I kind of had no idea what size would look right under my bed. The nuLOOM rug I fell in love with comes in six different sizes, and even though I measured everything out before deciding on the 5×8-foot option, it wasn’t until I placed the physical rug under my bed that I really understood what it would look like.So to make it a little easier on all of us, I came up with these handy visual guides so you can see what three of the most common area rug sizes will look like under the four standard bed sizes — twin, full, queen, and king — as well as various placement options.Credit: Design: Apartment TherapyTwin Bed Rug PlacementTwin beds measure 38 inches wide and 75 inches long, making them by far the smallest of the common bed sizes. So pairing a single twin bed with a 5’x8′ rug is always a safe bet. But if the room is on the bigger side, an 8’x10′ rug can work, too, especially if the rest of the furniture is on the sizable side. Going with a 9’x12′ option might be a little bit of a stretch, unless the rug extends to all four walls, almost mimicking the look of carpet.Credit: Design: Apartment TherapyFull Bed Rug PlacementSimilar to twin beds, fulls are 75″ long, but have a much more substantial 54″ in width. If your bedroom is on the smaller side (like mine, thanks NYC) a 5’x8′ rug will work just fine, but if you’ve got the space, going for one of the larger sizes will make a bigger visual impact.Credit: Design: Apartment TherapyQueen Bed Rug PlacementOn the larger side of the spectrum, queen beds measure 60″ wide and 80″ long. This means a smaller rug, like the 5’x8′ option, is almost visually lost. The 8’x10′ option or even going all the way up to 9’x12′ gives the rug more breathing room.Credit: Design: Apartment TherapyKing Bed Rug PlacementIf you’re lucky enough to come home to a 76″x80″ king bed, 1) I am incredibly jealous, but 2) There’s no real need to even consider a 5’x8′ rug, as it will barely peek out from under your bedding. Bigger is better in this case, and I love the look of a substantial 9’x12′ rug paired with a king, but an 8’x10′ option works as well.Credit: Design: Apartment TherapyBedroom Rug Placement IdeasNot every rug has to be perfectly centered beneath your bed. In fact, if you have tight bedroom space constraints or a strict decor budget, your rug doesn’t have to go under the bed at all — you can opt for a smaller, more affordable 2’x3′ or 3’x5′ option to fill out the empty floor space parallel to the side, giving you something cozy to step on first thing in the morning.For larger rooms, though, you can choose whether to partially float the bed on top of an area rug, or have the bed styled completely over it. There’s no right or wrong choice here — it’s entirely up to you and your rug size/bedroom layout. For the latter, just make sure the rug is wide enough to fit any surrounding side tables or nightstands to fully ground the bedside area.",
