Hello and happy Sunday from the shores of Lake Murray where the spring weather has been pretty much perfect. I have been enjoying open windows and balmy, off-the-lake breezes blowing through the house all week… bliss. :-) I have intentionally filled my calendar with lots of white space to enjoy living in slow mode lately. I haven’t been a total slacker though, but have been taking my time getting a few projects done. One is almost finished and I will share that with you this week. The other has me excited to begin DIY’ing. Right now I am sourcing supplies to get it done. It is for a very functional update in the kitchen. I have it visualed in my mind, now I have to make it come to life and share it with you. Now onto the links I found to share with you this week. Oh… So Stylish Finds As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases. This 7-piece outdoor dining set is quite the deal and it even comes with cushions. (open in same tab) I love this and would like it by my bed, but it is pricey, even at half off. (open in same tab) These comfy and cool summer pj’s come in a few colors. (open in same tab). And if you like a sleeping in luxe pj’s, these you can get monogrammed. (open in same tab) I am thinking about this comforter to put on my bed for the summer. I only wish that the sizes of comforters and duvet covers would catch up with the newer heights of mattresses. I have a King bed and there are not any larger sizes of comforters to buy to put on it to cover and hide the side of the mattress when it is on. Does anyone know of a brand/company that makes larger King size comforters/duvet covers? (open in same tab) If you enjoy these posts – You can find past Style Scouting posts here.
