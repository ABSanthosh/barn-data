From the striped beach umbrellas that line Italy’s beaches, to Greece’s iconic white-and-blue villas, these Mediterranean destinations are known for their picture-perfect landscapes, and slow, relaxed lifestyle. Mediterranean outdoor spaces are often designed specifically for R\u0026R. This is exactly the vibe we’re trying to emulate in our own outdoor spaces this year! Envision simple styling, with minimalistic silhouettes that invite you to linger in the sun all day — while wearing sufficient sunscreen, of course. In our moodboard above, we’ve paired Tait’s Billy Sunlounge in a Grecian-inspired colour combination with a range of low-profile pieces like the Fermob Salsa Side Table by Trit House. While many backyards in Australia often revolve around an outdoor dining setting, bringing that holiday-style atmosphere to your home is all about having areas for lounging. The Fritz Hanson Riveria Lounge from Cult is another great pick, as the timber piece can be converted to serve as a chair and table, or kept flat as a sunbed. Or, something like King Living’s Plateau Outdoor Sofa and Sun Lounge would be a luxurious and comfortable centrepiece for a courtyard or deck for hosting friends and family. Calming colours like white, blue, and green are obvious choices for this Mediterranean-inspired palette, but we also love grounding the look with brown accents in your accessories. The Jardin Patio Umbrella by Basil Bangs features a terracotta stripe that will make you feel like you’re at an Italian beach club, in addition to providing some much-needed shade. Dress up your lounges with a matching striped cushion or a patterned towel from Baina, and you’ve got yourself a perfect stylish space to enjoy the warmer months! Additional moodboard credits: Boucle Stripe Chocolate Pouffe floor cushion by Bonnie \u0026 Neil. Roman Pool Towel by Baina. Amber Goblet by Maison Balzac. Need more home inspiration?
