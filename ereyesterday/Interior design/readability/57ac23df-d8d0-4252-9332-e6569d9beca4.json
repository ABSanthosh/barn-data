  "text": "High above Miami’s bustling Brickell  financial district, a newly reimagined lower penthouse on the 60th floor of the prestigious Brickell Flatiron building offers an immersive fusion of contemporary artistry and urban vibrancy. Designed by the visionary duo of Nicholas Gennari and Roberto Racy from Nar Design Studio, this 1,830-square-foot residence reflects the city’s dynamic character, presenting a sophisticated yet bold aesthetic that embodies minimalism with an artistic approach. Commissioned by a prominent attorney with a deep appreciation for electronic music and modern pop art, the renovation sought to craft a second home that resonates with Miami’s pulsating energy while maintaining a refined and minimalist atmosphere. To achieve this, the designers stripped away previous finishes, opting for crisp white walls that enhance spatial openness and create a gallery-like ambiance. The thoughtful reconfiguration of lighting and ceiling elements further refined the overall aesthetic, ensuring a seamless integration of functionality and design. A key inspiration for the space stemmed from the rhythmic fluidity of electronic music, which influenced both the selection of artworks and the interplay of lighting. Neon accents, abstract compositions, and a bold spectrum of colors interact dynamically throughout the residence, reflecting the constant motion of the city’s nightlife. Custom murals and wallpapers introduce tropical elements, enriching the visual narrative while complementing the sleek, modern furniture that defines the home’s interiors. Each element within the penthouse has been meticulously curated to align with the project’s contemporary vision. The living area showcases an array of iconic design pieces, including the modular B\u0026B Italia Camaleonda sofa by Mario Bellini, the sculptural Ligne Roset Togo sofa by Michel Ducaroy, and the striking red B\u0026B Italia Grande Papilio lounge chair by Naoto Fukasawa. These statement furnishings are anchored by a shimmering Glas Italia coffee table by Patricia Urquiola and illuminated by the sculptural Flos Noctambule lamp by Konstantin Grcic, setting an artful yet inviting tone for the space. Artistic expression extends beyond the living room into the private quarters, where a carefully orchestrated lighting scheme enhances the intimate ambiance of the primary bedroom. Here, the Vega LED chandelier by Kuzco Lighting casts a warm glow over the space, complemented by the sleek design of the B\u0026B Italia Flair O’ Chair by Monica Armani and the timeless Snoopy Table Lamp by Achille and Pier Giacomo Castiglioni for Flos. Rich textures and soft, indirect lighting envelop the room, creating an atmosphere that is both tranquil and visually captivating. Materiality played a crucial role in defining the residence’s overall feel, with an emphasis on tactile comfort and understated luxury. Plush textiles, iridescent glass, and intricate custom rugs contribute to a layered aesthetic that shifts in response to light and movement. The result is a living environment that evolves throughout the day, mirroring the rhythm of its surroundings. For more information on Nar Design Studio, visit nardesignstudio.com.
