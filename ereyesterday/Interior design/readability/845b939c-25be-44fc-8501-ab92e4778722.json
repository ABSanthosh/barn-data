First previewed in Milan during the 2024 fashion week, the sneakers have finally made it to the market, still true to the finger shoes that the fashion house may be known for. This time, Adidas joins the missing-toe movement with the AVAVAV and its creative director Beate Karlsson for the Superstar sneakers.The base of the shoes is none other than the Adidas Originals, which is also the home of the Stan Smiths and Gazelles. AVAVAV steps in by designing a pair of removable rubber shell toes inspired by their previous finger shoes. The fashion house crafts these gloves for shoes using full-grain leather with a rubber midsole, outsole, and shell toes. Each Superstar sneaker gets a rubber toe. These detachable accessories are adjustable too, using the belts on the side complete with stoppers.all images courtesy of AVAVAV and AdidasRubber toes that can also be used as pursesFans who acquire the AVAVAV and Adidas Superstar sneakers receive both the shoes and the rubber toes. In this way, the users can choose when to wear their sneakers with the appendage, aka they’re not forced to put them on when they don’t feel like it. Because the rubber toes are detachable, they can also plug these four-toed accessories into the other shoes they own. Thanks to the adjustable industrial straps, it may be easy to find their right fitting. On another plus side, if the users don’t want to use the rubber toes as additional designs in their Adidas Superstar sneakers, they can just put their stuff in them and hold them as purses. Looking at their sizes, large objects may not fit so well, but because the accessories are made of rubber, they might be flexible and stretchy enough to accommodate some. Since there are four toe-shaped pits, stick-figured objects can fit well, including lipsticks, eyeliners, or cigars and cigarettes. During their fashion show in Milan, the model wearing the AVAVAV Adidas Superstar sneakers ran in the track, which set the stage for the collection. That may be the confirmation that should the user plan to run with the rubber toes on, it’s more than possible. The Adidas by AVAVAV Superfinger Superstar sneakers and the rest of the collection are available on the brand’s and fashion house’s sites starting November 21st, 2024.AVAVAV uses the Adidas Superstar sneakers as the base of the ‘Superfinger’ shoesthese gloves are made of full-grain leather with a rubber midsole, outsole, and shell toesthe brand and fashion house’s names are engraved at the rear of the straps and sneakerson the sides, there are adjustable straps to make sure the rubber toes fit welleach Superstar sneaker gets a removable rubber-toe accessory",
