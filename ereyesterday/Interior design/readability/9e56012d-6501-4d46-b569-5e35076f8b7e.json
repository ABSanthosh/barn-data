  "description": "From a design perspective, Latvia is in an interesting geographic position. In addition to having a local tradition of craftsmanship, the Baltic state has been touched by Scandinavian influences from its west and Soviet-era Modernism (which to me always had a paradoxical touch of gaudiness) from its east. We have yet to see a distinct Latvian design aesthetic emerging on the world stage, but this Bar Cabinet Eclipse from Riga-based furniture brand Kanttari is certainly eye-catching. Aimed at the luxury market, the cabinet is finished in bronze that has been sanded in two directions. The interior is walnut-veneered, the drawers felt-lined, the counter marble. There is a bit of showiness in both the dual bi-level carousels and the elaborate tracks for hanging the glassware, but the LED lighting is at least subdued. The €22,000 (USD $24,724) asking price is high for us mere mortals, but is really at the lower end of the luxury market; something similar from say, Italy would be a multiple of that figure. But the Eclipse has gained international attention, having scored an A' Design Award, and other luxury manufacturers in the market have surely taken note.",
