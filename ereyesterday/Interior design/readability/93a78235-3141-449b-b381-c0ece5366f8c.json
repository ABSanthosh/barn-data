  "description": "When Claire Lloyd and Matthew Usmar Lauder visited Captains Rest — one of Tasmania’s most beloved Airbnbs — in 2018, they immediately fell in love with the simple charms of Lettes Bay. So much so, they decided to purchase their own run-down waterfront cottage, which they lovingly transformed into a similarly popular getaway known as Bushy Summers. Now they’re putting their unique shack up for sale!",

  "text": "The historical village of Lettes Bay on the west coast of Tasmania is famous for its charming and humble waterfront cottages. And one of these endearing abodes, Bushy Summers, has just hit the market. Designer, photographer and author Claire Lloyd and her partner Matthew Usmar Lauder took a trip to stay at the renown Captains Rest in 2018 when they realised the magical appeal of the area. ‘Before we even put the key in the door we had fallen in love with the bay and the surrounding area,’ Claire says. ‘Standing on the waters, edge I found myself asking Matthew: “What do we have to do to get a place here?”’ It wasn’t long before they got chatting with a local who had a run-down shack to sell. The property required a full refurb, so the couple moved into an old caravan for the duration of the project. Claire got to work designing the interiors — ‘I have designed houses and apartments in London, Greece and Sydney’ — as Matthew embarked on the construction with guidance from a local builder. ‘It was both a challenge and an adventure living in a caravan with no water or heating in very cold, wet and windy weather,’ she adds. ‘But the journey was fab, we loved the process and really loved working together. It is a shack made with love.’ All the floors and windows were replaced, while the original pressed-tin ceilings in the sitting room and kitchen were retained, inspiring the rest of the rustic and cosy renovation. ‘The front stable door is a great feature,’ Claire says. ‘When the top is open it’s like gazing out at a beautifully framed moving landscape. Another favourite is the view from the restored, old clawfoot bath. From there you can lay back and soak, watching the treetops as they sway across the sky, it’s just so peaceful.’ The couple have used Bushy Summers as their own personal escape, in addition to turning it into a successful Airbnb, which is one of the site’s most-loved accomodations, having earned hundreds of positive reviews. But with new projects on the horizon, now the one-bedroom sanctuary is for sale. ‘The shack itself, although small, is the perfect place to escape the stresses of the outside world,’ Claire adds. Bushy Summers is for private sale through the vendors. Contact office@clairelloyd.com with any enquiries.",
