  "text": "Military-grade durability and off-grid living options give modern-day RVs that extra popularity amid adventurers demanding luxury and ruggedness without compromise. There are names like the EarthRoamer at the top of the ladder, but one builder in the western USA, Nevada-based Hunter RMV, is soon catching up. By delivering 6×6 chassis mobile homes that check all the boxes, the company assures comprehensive luxury and convenience at a significantly lesser cost than what the other top-tier names happen to roll out RVs for. The latest in action from the house of Hunter RMV is the Sherpa XLE that combines demanded luxury with military-grade chassis, converting the latter into an ultimate adventure ride for extreme adventures. Six-wheel drive Sherpa XLE is based on the Steward and Stevenson M1089A1 that has been part of the US Military’s Medium Tactile Vehicle fleet for about a decade from the mid-nineties to about 2006. Designed with off-grid living in mind, the RV has military hardware and amenities of a modern RV, which we detail below. Designer: Hunter RMV Based on the M1089A1 is a 22-foot tiny living abode made from composite panels. It on the inside, 18-foot of this is occupied by living space comprising a transforming dinette and kitchen. You get an electric lift bed that becomes a cozy queen bed for your retiring hours and lifts back off to leave you with a leather dinette area to spend your meal times and a few small get-togethers. The space is completed with a TV panel on the wall and a Bluetooth sound system to take care of the audio. The kitchen here comprises an induction cooktop, microwave oven, an air fryer, two refrigerators, and a Treager BBQ for an external barbeque setup. When you’re not eating, sleeping or barbequing, you can head out for a shower, or maybe cleanup inside in the little washup zone also comprising a washer, drier, and a cassette toilet. What really springs the Sherpa XLE in the desirable off-roading companion is the storage it makes for the gear. With some handy options on the exterior, it happens to create a dedicated section for your gear in the rare of the vehicle. It has space for storing two bicycles and comes with a motorcycle lift to the garage. Desirous of taking you on journeys over the most extreme roads, to locations that you didn’t think were possible in an RV is powered by a Caterpillar six turbo diesel offering 330 horsepower and 860 pound-feet of torque, the Sherpa XLE comes with 120 gallons of fresh water tank, 1,000 watts of solar panels on the roof, and 800 a/h batteries on board to keep you in the wilderness for as long as you desire. There is no word on the pricing of the Sherpa XLE. Hunter RMV will be building it to order only, so the price may vary according to customization.",
