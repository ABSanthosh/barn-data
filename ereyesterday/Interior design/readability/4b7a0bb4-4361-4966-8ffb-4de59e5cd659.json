  "text": "Indikator by Anders Hellsten Nissen and Can Touch This StudioIndikator is a modular, mobile installation designed to convert human touch into sound, enhancing public space interactions. Developed through extensive research and experimentation on interactive sound benches, the project integrates tactile engagement with urban design.This iteration of Indikator results from a collaboration between Can Touch This Studio and designer Anders Hellsten Nissen, known for his work with Studio Olafur Eliasson. Since 2019, Can Touch This Studio has explored interactive seating, and the Indikator Sonic Bench builds upon these studies. The installation is designed for adaptability, making it suitable for various environments and events. The project is based on Playtronica’s TouchMe device, introduced in 2018, which enables touch-sensitive sound generation.all images courtesy of Can Touch This Studio and Anders Hellsten NissenExploring the intersection of sound, space, and technologyThe design merges urban aesthetics with interactive functionality. The seating structure references the grid-like geometry of Berlin’s bus stops, while the speaker casing draws inspiration from CERN’s Globe of Science and Innovation in Geneva, reflecting a connection between technology and exploration. Named after a character from the animated sci-fi film ‘The Mystery of the Third Planet,’ Indikator responds to touch by generating dynamic soundscapes, creating an interactive experience that varies with user engagement. Whether in a park, a plaza, or an exhibition space, the Indikator Sonic Bench invites curiosity and participation.Can Touch This, a studio project of Playtronica collective, explores the intersection of sound, technology, and public space through interactive installations designed to encourage sensory engagement and social interaction. Specializing in interactive and architectural projects, designer Anders Hellsten Nissen’s work focuses on material research and spatial interventions that influence perception and experience.Indikator is a modular installation that transforms touch into soundthe design is inspired by Berlin’s bus stop geometry and CERN’s Globe of Science",
