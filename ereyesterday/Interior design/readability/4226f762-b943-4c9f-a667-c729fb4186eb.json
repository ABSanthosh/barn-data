  "text": "Witness a fascinating convergence of traditional Japanese porcelain craftsmanship and contemporary 3D printing technology with the Corcelain collection. Designer Kosuke Takahashi has collaborated with 224 Porcelain, a ceramics studio rooted in Ureshino City’s rich Hizen-Yoshidayaki tradition, to create the world’s first modular porcelain system. Each cup serves as a foundation for customizable attachments, transforming static vessels into dynamic, user-defined objects. The collaboration bridges centuries of ceramic knowledge with modern digital fabrication, creating pieces that honor heritage while embracing innovation. These cups function as both functional vessels and design platforms, inviting users to participate in the creation process. The modular system centers on beautifully crafted porcelain cups that accept various 3D-printed components through an ingenious mounting system. Users can attach feet, handles, lids, and decorative elements, creating personalized configurations that suit individual preferences and occasions. The 3D-printed attachments use precision-engineered screws and mounting points that integrate seamlessly with the ceramic surfaces. Designer: Kosuke Takahashi x 224 Porcelain 224 Porcelain brings some worthy expertise to this innovative partnership, drawing from the renowned Hizen-Yoshidayaki ceramic tradition of Saga Prefecture. Founded by ceramist Satoshi Tsuji in 2012, the studio operates in Ureshino City, a region celebrated for its tea culture and hot springs. The studio offers versatile craftsmanship that enriches daily life through thoughtful design. Their porcelain work builds on techniques cultivated over generations, yet remains open to contemporary interpretations. Takahashi’s role as inventor and designer delivers digital fabrication expertise to the traditional ceramic process. His background in creating products that merge heritage craftsmanship with modern technology makes him an ideal collaborator for this groundbreaking project. He focuses on creating systems rather than individual objects, encouraging user participation in the design process. The 3D-printed components are designed with precision and attention to detail that matches the quality of the ceramic foundations. The Corcelain project has generated quite some interest within the design community since its early 2025 launch. MakerWorld even features downloadable 3D models that allow users to create their own attachments, fostering a community of makers and customizers. So, you could create some adorable Corcelain cups for your personal use! The collection encourages the evolution of traditional crafts through integration with digital technologies. It preserves and celebrates Japanese ceramic heritage while opening new possibilities for user engagement and customization. You can create unique combinations to reflect your styles, forming cups that are a canvas for your expression. The modular system supports sustainable consumption by enabling users to refresh and modify their vessels without replacement.",
