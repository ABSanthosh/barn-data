  "text": "BUDDE and nando studio’s rug doubles as a sculptural daybedAt the intersection of art, design, and cultural storytelling, BUDDE’s latest collectible piece, DUNE, reimagines the humble rug as a multifunctional design object—not just to be walked on, but lounged upon. On view at Galleria Rossana Orlandi, DUNE presents a new typology in interior design as a hybrid between a chaise lounge and a textile landscape. Created in collaboration with Nando Studio in Cologne, the piece is gun-tufted in merino wool and structurally supported by a removable bent aluminum frame that allows for customizable configurations within any space.all images by Saskia Kinastrippling pattern mirrors wind-sculpted sand dunesDrawing inspiration from the deep-rooted traditions of floor seating in nomadic desert cultures, Cologne-based BUDDE and Nando Studio team blend ancestral references with the tactile softness and ergonomic awareness of European comfort. The result is a sculptural form that invites interaction, whether sitting cross-legged in a communal setting or reclining solo on its elevated, dune-like contours. The name is no coincidence. The rug’s rippling pattern mirrors wind-sculpted sand dunes, rendered in a warm, gradient palette that evokes the ephemeral hues of desert sunlight.DUNE’s aluminum frame, concealed beneath the wool surface, can be detached and repositioned beneath either side of the rug, allowing the lounge to adapt to different spatial orientations. Measuring 300 x 175 x 42 centimeters, the rug stands as a centerpiece and conversation starter, elevating the floor into a site of comfort.BUDDE’s latest collectible piece, DUNE, reimagines the humble rug as a multifunctional design objectDUNE presents a new typology in interior design as a hybrid between a chaise lounge and a textile landscapethe gradient palette evokes the ephemeral hues of desert sunlightcreated in collaboration with Nando Studio in Colognehe piece is gun-tufted in merino wool and structurally supported by a removable bent aluminum frame",
