Beauty finds Let's start with a bit of beauty, specifically nails! I prefer to do my own -- I used to get gel or dip nails before a vacation or big event, but it's rare that I do that anymore.Â  I've found a few items that make my nails look great and thought I would share them.Â  This post may containÂ affiliate links for yourÂ convenience. I may earn a small commission whenÂ you make a purchase through links.Â  Do you use a nail buffer? My mom always used one so I started as a teen. I've had this Onsen nail buffer for years now and it works so well:Â  You \"buff\" your nails with each side of the block, starting with one that smooths out any imperfections, and ending with the white side that gives your nails a beautiful shine.Â  It makes them look so healthy and clean, and makes it appear as though you have a clear coat of polish on: I like this Onsen product so much because you keep the block and just apply new buffing pads as they wear out. My nails look and feel so great after using this!Â  **These Londontown nail polishes are my absolute favorite! They give your nails a beautiful wash of color, but let them \"breathe\" at the same time:Â  I start with the Ridge Filler (on the left) before I paint my nails -- it fills in any inconsistencies on the nail, but I feel like it also keeps the polish on longer.Â  The pink and white concealers on the middle and right are my go-to polishes for day to day. I prefer the pink most days, but the white is what I wear all summer long.Â  They give a light coverage and make your nails look so healthy. The best part is that these concealer polishes stay on forever...I can go up to two weeks most times.Â  When I want more color, my absolute favorite nail polish is the Essie gel line. I use this for all of my color, and they last a loooong time.Â  By far the best staying power of any nail polish I've tried:Â  These are called \"gel\" -- but you don't use anything special to apply it. No special lights or application needed. I also use the Essie gel top coat.Â  I know I'm not alone when I say as I've gotten older, my sleep has been affected. It happens to SO many women and is super frustrating.Â  Thankfully I have a doctor who has helped tremendously. One item I found that has helped is this Dream Whip lavender magnesium lotion I've used for a couple of years:Â  You apply to your legs, feet, arms, wherever! Not only does it smell wonderful, but it's a lovely cream that is easy to apply and feels great on.Â  This cream one hundred percent helps with my sleep. If forget to put it on, I definitely notice a difference.Â  It helps me drift off to sleep and stay asleep!Â  I've tried a few lip tints over the years and have found my favorites! This Etude lip Water Tint is an affordable version that gives great color:Â  **And these Peripera glowy tint glosses are sooooo moisturizing and pretty on the lips. They are so comfortable to wear and the colors are beautiful:Â  I have #19 (left) and #13 (right).Â  These have great staying power as well...you'll be left with a light stain that looks great with a chapstick over it.Â  I get compliments every time I wear these glosses! It is such a soft, fresh and relaxing scent. I will literally go into my closet throughout the day to spray it on myself, just so I can smell it. I've sprayed it on before bed as well...it relaxes me and smells so good.Â  This version is the body and fabric spray and doesn't stay on super long. I'm asking for the perfume version for Christmas. ;)Â  Fashion faves Now for the fashion favorites! I wouldn't call myself a big fashion person -- I much prefer to get things for our home and not ME. But there are a few I've found this year that I really love, so I thought I'd share.Â  They come in a TON of colors (I love their muted, jewel-toned options) and are so buttery soft. I'm tall so I love that they offer two inseam options -- 25 and 28 inches.Â  I have not worn them out on a super cold day and I don't think they'd offer much warmth. But they are SO comfy and great for a work out.Â  More of these soft leggings are on my list this Christmas as well!Â  This is more of a warm weather find, but I found this green smocked midi dress over the summer and ended up wearing it multiple times:Â  I'm not even a dress girl, but I felt great in it and it's so soft and comfortable. Also, incredibly flattering! I love that you can wear a bra with it no problem.Â  That one comes in a few color options as well.Â  It runs larger, so is comfy as can be, but also pretty cute on as well. This is the perfect set to cuddle up in on these colder winter days.Â  I've washed it a few times (delicate cycle and low heat in the dryer) and so far so good. Last I checked there were nearly 20 color options available!Â  I've fallen in love with the Pavoi jewelry on Amazon. I've bought a few items over the years, and these cute huggie earrings are my most recent finds:Â  Both the double hoop (left) and the chunky scalloped hoop (right) are 14K gold plated and hold up beautifully. I wear these constantly and there is absolutely no wear at all, even after swimming. They are the perfect understated everyday earrings.Â  And my final and favorite fashion find...my readers. ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘µ I never thought the day would come when my tortoise shell reading glasses would be considered \"fashion,\" but here we are!Â  Let me tell you...I've never gotten more compliments on anything (clothing, jewelry, makeup) than on these glasses.Â  I get a double take and compliments every time I wear them. These reading glasses are the biggest ego booster ever, haha! Even if you don't need readers yet, just get them in the lowest strength and try them out. ðŸ˜„ I just noticed they have these in sunglasses as well...that just went into my cart!Â  Home decor favoritesÂ  And finally, my favorite...the home decor items! I've shared a few of these before, but they are so great I'm sharing again.Â  Over the years I've stopped using one-use soap dispensers. This foaming hand soap dispenser looks great and works so well:Â  We've had it in our powder room, so it's used more than any other dispenser in the house. The finish on the top has held up wonderfully.Â  I love that I can still switch out my hand soap scents seasonally if want, but I'm not tossing the plastic containers every few months.Â  **The Loloi brand offers rugs that I just adore...they hold up so well and the designs and colors are my favorites.Â  I tried out a couple others for my office makeover, but ended up using this exact on in there too. I LOVE green, so it pulls a room with that color together so well.Â  We have the olive/charcoal color rug in our family room and kitchen...it has combines all the warm tones in here so beautifully:Â  This rug is very soft, but very thin. (I've even thrown the kitchen runner into the wash!) So if you like a thick, plush rug, this one may not be for you.Â  I love how well they hold up and how easy they are to clean.Â  **A few years I bought some smaller LED light strands at Halloween, and ended up loving them. We have them in orange and green.Â  When I started pulling out our traditional Christmas light strands a few weeks ago, I was SO frustrated. I spent hours fixing them last year, only to have half of each strand not work again. (Or not work at all.) So we bit the bullet and bought a few strands of these outdoor LED fairy lights for our bushes and trees:Â  The tiny bulbs are misleading...the color is SO bright and beautiful. You get so many more bulbs for the price too -- 200 lights on an 82 foot strand.Â  You can see them from far away, and they are so pretty because there are so many more points of light:Â  These lights come in a bunch of colors, have a timer option and have a ton of lighting possibilities. There's a \"dancing\" option where they turn on and off quickly or fade away softly, and plenty more. We keep ours on all the time.Â  The best part is they take up a fraction of the storage space, are tons lighter in weight and don't get tangled as easily. (They still get tangled...but nothing like traditional bulb light strands.) I LOVE these lights and don't think I'll ever go back to the regular versions, at least for outside.Â  These come in a pack of 20 and come with clips to secure the to tree branches. You could also stand them up on a window sill.Â  The tree candles can work on a timer, so you just set them once. You can also change the brightness and how they flicker. These are SO gorgeous on a Christmas tree!Â  **This candle version can be used outside...I was just thinking how pretty these would be on a pine tree! Let's talk lamps! This is the season for softer light around the house. The darker, shorter days are perfect for lamp light.Â  It's the perfect size for a shelf or on a countertop, and that scalloped linen shade is so sweet. I just love it! I turn on this lamp first thing every morning and it's the last one I turn off at night.Â  It has an elegant look and comes with an actual light bulb, so it looks more like a traditional lamp.Â  This skinny lamp has three light settings and the charge lasts forever! I use it next to our bedroom chair and the it's lovely low light.Â  My last two home decor faves are in that photo as well. The scalloped rattan trayÂ would be a beautiful addition to any room in the house:Â  It's a more unique find and adds some great texture to a space.Â  And that fabric tissue box cover is definitely one of those, you really don't need it but when you get it you love it, kind of items. ;)Â  The linen goes with anything and looks high end. And the bottom is magnetized so it's super easy to open up and switch out boxes.Â  I love these and want them all over our house!Â  Do you have any of these products? They would all make great gifts, or to treat yoself. We've used every item and I personally recommend them all.Â  I hope you had a wonderful Thanksgiving and stuffed yourself with great food! I am so thankful for all of you that take the time to read my blog posts.",
