  "text": "You’ll often hear that a bathroom should be restful — a place to retreat to. And whilst beautiful towels, soft lighting and luxurious soaps can help to set the scene, what completely transforms a space into a sanctuary, is colour. Green is one of the best hues for the job, whether it’s soft mint, moody sage or warm olive. To envelop your space with these verdant, nature-inspired tones, take your tiles from the floor to the ceiling and wrap them around the entire room (paint can also have the same effect). Bring in texture through a benchtop made from concrete, terrazzo or natural stone with a beautiful vein. Add some subtle contrast to the space with metal fixtures and  tapware. Green is surprisingly versatile and pairs well with classic bright silver tapware, brushed gunmetal or a warmer brass or bronze finish. Wall lights are the perfect accent and finishing touch in a moody, colour drenched bathroom space – choose a circular sconce (or two!) in either ceramic or glass. Green also pairs beautifully with timber, which is a great option for your vanity. Texture is everything with this serene, colour-drenched look, bring it into the space with finishing touches like handmade ceramics and soft, luxurious towels.
