  "description": "The owners of this Sydney terrace met with Josephine Hurley Architecture on the very same day they moved into the circa-1890s residence. They were eager to extend the life of the old elegant home, which had been neglected after years as a rental property. It took a few years to realise their vision, but now the character of Dragon Tree Terrace has been sensitively restored and updated, with a sleek brick addition hidden at the rear.",

  "text": "Newtown in Sydney’s inner west is known for its late Victorian architecture, and Dragon Tree Terrace is one of these enduring homes that has stood for more than a century. ‘Originally constructed as working-class housing, the home has seen various modifications over the decades,’ architect Josephine Hurley says. By the time Josephine’s clients — a young professional couple — purchased the property in June 2020, it had suffered from years of deferred maintenance after being used as a long-term rental. ‘The structure was physically degraded, with significant wear and tear, outdated amenities, and poor thermal performance. The lower ground level was dark, cold, and damp in winter, while the upper level often overheated in summer,’ Josephine adds. Despite these challenges, the 1890s abode had ‘great potential’, a charming street presence with a mature dragon tree in the front garden, and a compact yet adaptable footprint. The vision was to honour the homes heritage, while also introducing modern updates to enhance liveability. ‘A key inspiration was the existing architectural language of the home, particularly its use of arches in the verandah, fanlight, and boundary wall,’ Josephine says. ‘This motif was carried through to the interiors, creating a cohesive aesthetic.’ The works began with a sensitive restoration of the front rooms, before reconfiguring the rear with a new brick addition that opens to the inviting courtyard garden. Making the most of the natural slope of the site, the existing upper level was raised slightly to increase the lower ground level’s ceiling height, improving the sense of space in the kitchen, living and dining room. Now, the 120-square-metre floor plan places ‘quieter functions’ such as sleeping and working on the upper level, while cooking, dining, and living take place on the lower ground — fostering a stronger indoor-outdoor connection. Some savvy storage solutions have also helped transform the terrace. In the new split-level hallway to the bedrooms upstairs, drawers are hidden with the steps, as mirrors and carefully placed sky lights create the ‘illusion’ of more room. Reclaimed blackbutt parquetry was chosen for the floors, bringing richness and character back to the space along with timber veneer joinery. In the kitchen and bathrooms, Verde Guatemala marble and green kit-kat tiles complement the visible greenery throughout the home. ‘It’s a home that not only looks beautiful but also serves as a sanctuary,’ Josephine says. The clients say they love how their small footprint home ‘gradually reveals itself’ as you step inside the period facade. But the best part for them is knowing they’ve played a part in extending the life of the old terrace: ‘We hope this home continues to bring joy and comfort for generations to come.’",
