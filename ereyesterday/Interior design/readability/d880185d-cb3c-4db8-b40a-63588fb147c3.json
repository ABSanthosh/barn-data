But that also makes us just as curious about which of our recommendations you liked the most – both because we simply find it interesting to see what the most popular sofa of 2024 was and to use that knowledge for our future tips and recommendations.And funnily enough, the sofa you (and I) apparently liked and clicked on the most over the past year is the highest rated design in our best sofa buying guide, the John Lewis Draper sofa, having attracted exactly 3501 clicks in 2024. We’ve got our ways of finding out these stats and we’ve put them to good use. And I’m glad to see you like it as much as I do, having crowned it the best of the best on the market in the round-up.The most popular sofa of 2024 – John Lewis Draper Sofa(Image credit: John Lewis)Coincidentally enough, I visited a John Lewis store just a couple of weeks ago - as that’s one of the best places where to buy a sofa - and sat on the Draper sofa once again after some time – and I was still very happy with the decision of naming it the best sofa overall. It just simply ticks all the necessary boxes – it’s comfortable, sleek and stylish with narrow legs elevating it off the ground for an airy and light look, it’s available in over 80 fabrics and 14 leather options, while also not costing a fortune.The price point starts at £1199 for a 2-seater option with the possibility to update to a recliner sofa style. The backrest is also decently high (but not too much) to provide enough support, while the seat and back cushions are removable for easy maintenance. It’s a real all-rounder which is why it’s earned the top spot as both the best sofa and the most popular style. John Lewis \u0026 Partners Draper Sofa Featuring an elegant, mid-century modern-inspired design, this angular style with pintucked cushions fits any interior style, whether it's modern or traditional. But the John Lewis Draper sofa wasn’t the only sofa design you were loving this year – in fact, these are the three close runner-ups in your list of favourites. And if you haven’t invested in a new sofa yet but have been meaning to, then now would be the time as Boxing Day sales are live with many of the best sofas and best sofa beds available at discounted prices. Is your top-rated one on the list?Bestselling sofa 2024 runner-upsAnd as we’re heading into the new year, I’m sure these picks will still hold up in 2025.
