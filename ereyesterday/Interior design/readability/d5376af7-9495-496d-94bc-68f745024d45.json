Not only can you see what you have, but you also realize how insane it is that you have multiples of one random item.Â I actually kept most of the glass decor pictured above. The inexpensive glass vases can be used SO many ways, especially during the holidays.Â But when it came to items like candles, I realized how ridiculous the stash was:Â This brings me to a big organization tip I've discovered over the years...I've learned (at least for me) that I tend to ignore items in opaque containers.Â I had all of these candles in white storage bins that I couldn't see into unless I pulled it off the shelf and pulled the lid off. And they were all stacked on top of each other inside.Â When I switched all of our Christmas decor storage to clear bins years ago, I realized how much I like them.Â I'm a visual learner/person anyway, so I don't know why this surprised me. If I can see it, I pay more attention to it!Â I went through each type of decor -- glass items, candles, vases/vessels, trays and baskets, etc. We keep a good amount of Christmas decor down there (mostly our Christmas village), and I purged a ton of that as well.Â After numerous donation trips, I felt SO much better!Simple built in wood shelving.It was then that I went ahead with some built in shelves I've wanted to add since we moved in. I called our contractor guys who help me out with some projects and they were able to knock out wood shelving in less than a day.Â They are very basic...built with 2x4's and plywood, but I am in looooove. Having everything easily accessible and on display has already been so wonderful!:We had to work around the utility panels on the back wall, so the right side is about 15 inches deep and the left is 24 inches. I wanted to be able to slide the bins underneath, so the size is perfect!I go all out with Halloween and Christmas in our basement, all of the holiday decor was previously in big storage bins:Â The actual home decor pieces don't even take up two shelves now.Â Crazy considering all of the stuff on the floor to ceiling shelving was decor before:Â And all of those giant bins are gone! (I reused a few of them in our garage.)Those stick on labels are awesome! I use them ALL over the house.Â One extra step made a big difference -- the guys also installed drywall behind the wood shelving. No tape or mud, just the drywall. This prevents the little bits of insulation from falling on everything!It feels so great to walk into this area now. It really does bring me JOY. ;) My serotonin goes up when I walk in there.This storage area decrapification has spurred on more projects. I just finished up purging my closet and making it function even better with a few tweaks. I'll be sure to share those updates soon!",
