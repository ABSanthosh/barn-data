The circular glass home rotates continuously at a full 360 degrees, allowing the residents to enjoy the sunlight. It also offers access to a view that alternates between a lush landscape and a sunny beachfront. The Lighthouse (aka 179 Maraetai Drive) is located next to Maraetai Beach on the Pohutukawa Coast in Auckland, New Zealand. Designer: Don Dunick The home was originally designed by the current owner, Don Dunick, in the 1990s. The structure took a couple of years to be constructed and was a true labor of love. The design had to deal with all kinds of issues, such as working out the plumbing and electricity in a rotating house. The house is elevated on a platform, and it can rotate at the flick of a switch when needed. The spinning system is sedate and, on standard setting, takes 33 minutes to complete one revolution. On high speed, it takes around 15 minutes, so you won’t feel uncomfortable with the speed. The interior of the house includes two floors with a spiral staircase at its center. This arrangement makes the most of the glazed walls. The ground floor features an open-plan layout with a stainless steel kitchen, a dining area, a cozy living room, and a bathroom. The home also includes a large master bedroom upstairs, as well as two other bedrooms. Each floor is equipped with a balcony area. The Lighthouse is currently on the market and being sold by Carolyn Hanson of Sotheby’s International Realty. It is valued at over US$600,000, and the house is easy to relocate even if you’re not local.",
