  "text": "Boxabl recently designed a tiny home called Baby Box that can be constructed in 60 minutes. And they’re back with another banger called the Casita! The Casita is another tiny home is more square footage, and it will be ready to move in within a day. Boxabl’s ingenious, foldable designs truly seem to be redefining the tiny home market. These homes can be built in a matter of hours, and they can be shipped directly to any destination. The Casita measures 19 ft long by 8 ft 6 in wide and 12 ft 4 in tall (5.8 x 2.6 x 3.8 m). Once the house has been unfolded, it measures around 19 ft by 19 ft with a 10 ft 9-in rooftop (5.8 x 5.8 x 3.3 m). The interior includes a spacious 9.5-ft (2.9-m) ceiling. Designer: Boxabl The Casita comes with fully pre-installed wiring and plumbing from the factory, making the installation process for this 13,000-lb (5,897-kg) home incredibly straightforward and hassle-free. In terms of convenience, it is even more convenient than travel trailers. Despite being a folding house, Boxabl claims the Casita is constructed to a higher code standard than many traditional manufactured homes. There are two versions of the Casita available to accommodate various zoning requirements. The modular version is built in accordance with residential building codes. It is fully equipped with full-size electric appliances, including a refrigerator, microwave, stovetop, and HVAC. It is also equipped with two entry/exit doors and is linked to the grid with a 100-amp service. The modular Casita can be stacked, or connected side by side, if and when your family grows. Boxabl also offers another version of the Casita – the park model RV option. This model is constructed to meet RV specifications, following the standard ANSI A119.5 RV code. Unlike traditional homes, it is permanently affixed to a rolling chassis, similar to a travel trailer. Some unique features include having only one entry/exit door and the option for a propane-fueled stove. It requires a 50-amp or 100-amp service, much like larger RVs do. However, both the Casita models share key features, such as energy-efficient insulation, LED lighting, a 30-gallon (113-L) electric water heater, a full bathroom, and pre-installed utility hookups (water, sewage, electricity), enabling homeowners to settle into their tiny homes immediately. The Casita is the Boxabl’s first model, and it was released in September 2020. The company made its first delivery in 2020, by providing 156 Casitas for Camp Justice at Guantanamo Bay to house juries and lawyers. Casita has been utilized for humanitarian relief efforts – ranging from housing a copper mine workforce in Arizona to creating a commercial Airbnb community in Stillwater, Oklahoma.",
