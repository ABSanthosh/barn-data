There are plenty of other directions to take natural decor that can elevate any space even further. Not to mention that using real, natural materials can make a home feel more grounded and peaceful, a zen sort of feeling that permeates throughout the home. Here are some ways you can continue to bring the outdoors in. Raw Wood Rather than polished wood furniture, try pieces that show their natural shape and texture. A coffee table made from a thick tree slab, stools carved from logs, or a countertop made from live-edge planks bring an organic, earthy feel to any room. Even something as simple as some driftwood placed on a shelf can act as both sculpture and a connection to the outdoors. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / statuslapa Stones and Pebbles Smooth river stones or rough-cut slate can add a natural element to your shelves. Use larger stones as bookends, doorstops, or accents on a side table. Stone sculptures also offer that same rougher feel but with an artistic flare, and the same goes for any decorative crystals or geodes. The cool, solid texture of stone brings a sense of balance to a lot of decor, especially when paired with brighter colors or softer textures.

Sure, they lose most of their color, but that muted palette looks wonderful among many kinds of decor. Dried flowers are truly timeless, bringing an earthy, rustic vibe to any room or gallery wall you hang them in. You can even do this with a sentimental bouquet to create meaningful decor that will last ages! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / webbrennan Woven Fibers Natural textiles like rattan or jute bring a wonderfully warm and organic feel to a space. A woven basket, jute rug, or wicker wall hanging creates a connection to natural materials while still keeping things functional and/or beautiful. They’re often kept in their natural brown tones which means they compliment a wide variety of color palettes, too. These fibers feel soft, inviting, and relaxed, making a home feel so much cozier.

Handmade pottery, with its slight imperfections, adds a lot character, while other raw clay pieces are often beacons of warmth, especially in larger rooms. Even a collection of small, artisan-made sculptures on a shelf can create a natural, earthy focal point. You can extend this to dishware too, buying both beautiful and functional ceramic pieces from artists you love. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / RK1919 Natural Fabrics Natural fabrics like cotton, linen, and wool make a space feel soft, comforting, and breathable. Swap out synthetic materials for linen curtains, wool throws, or cotton cushion covers. If you’re aiming for a natural feel, try to stick to neutral or earth colors like off-whites, grays, or browns, maybe greens or oranges if you’re looking for a bit of color. These materials not only feel better but also age beautifully, becoming softer over time. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / valeriygoncharukphoto Branches of All Sizes Simple branches can be used in very creative ways to bring an outdoorsy feel to a room, from placing a large, sculptural one in a tall vase to even hanging some on your wall amid framed art or photos. Bundle a collection of sticks together for a unique (and low maintenance) decor piece you can pop anywhere. Birch branches, twisted driftwood, even fallen twigs can add a quiet, rustic charm to a room. Their natural shapes and textures bring in a taste of the wild. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Sonyachny Pressed Flowers and Leaves Pressed flowers, ferns, or leaves framed in simple glass panels make for beautiful wall art. You can also preserve nature in resin, like small pinecones, wildflowers, or seashells, to create long-lasting, natural accent pieces. Dried flowers never look out of place, and while you can create a design out of them, you can also press them in a more natural pose so to speak, so they’re very flexible in their presentation. Not to mention that they’re easy to make yourself if you’re patient! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Sonyachny Bringing nature into your home doesn’t have to be complicated. Simple, natural materials like wood, stone, fibers, and plants can create a beautiful space without a ton of effort. By using raw, organic elements, your home can feel more connected to the outdoors in a way that never fails to be beautiful.

You can extend this to dishware too, buying both beautiful and functional ceramic pieces from artists you love.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure id=\"attachment_267161\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-267161\"\u003e            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-scaled.jpg?width=480\" media=\"(max-width: 481px)\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\"/\u003e \u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Clay pots and charcoal on old wood.\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-270x180.jpg 270w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-923x615.jpg 923w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-768x513.jpg 768w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://cdn.decoist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/clay-pots-on-old-wood-2024-10-24-23-36-09-utc-70713-385x257.jpg 385w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\n                \n                \n            \u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigcaption id=\"caption-attachment-267161\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://elements.envato.com/clay-pots-on-old-wood-P2PWK43\"\u003ePhoto Credit: Envato Elements / RK1919\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\u003ch2 data-start=\"2113\" data-end=\"2154\"\u003eNatural Fabrics\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp data-start=\"2155\" data-end=\"2418\"\u003eNatural fabrics like cotton, linen, and wool make a space feel soft, comforting, and breathable.
