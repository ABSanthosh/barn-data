  "text": "Rimowa and Vitra have made names for themselves in their respective fields, namely luggage and furniture. Those two rarely come together and yet we’re getting an unexpected collaboration between the two, transforming a luggage specialist’s ethos into a striking piece of limited edition masterpiece of a furniture. The Rimowa x Vitra Aluminum Stool is able to bring together the best of their worlds, blending mobility, storage, and sustainability into one sculptural form. It is crafted from Rimowa’s signature anodized, grooved aluminum—the same armor-like shell that has defined the brand’s suitcases since the 1930s. Underneath the cushioned lid lies 59 liters of interior space, lined with Vitra’s eco‑friendly Laser RE fabric, complete with optional modular leather dividers to organize your essentials. Designers: Rimowa x Vitra This stool is also equipped with Rimowa’s four-direction Multiwheel® system, a signature feature originally designed for effortless luggage mobility. Here, it has been cleverly adapted to suit a home environment, allowing the stool to glide smoothly in any direction with minimal effort. This innovative design choice embodies the seamless fusion of rugged travel utility and refined domestic design, bringing the best of both worlds into a single, functional piece. Whether you’re repositioning it in your living room, studio, or office, the stool moves gracefully across various surfaces without scratching or resistance. And for moments when stability is essential, such as using it for extra seating or as a side table, the integrated wheel locks ensure it stays firmly in place. With its cube-like proportions, pastel-cushioned top, and grooved aluminum sheen, the stool fits beautifully in modernist and Brutalist interiors or what they call a “future design classic”. Meanwhile, Vitra’s Laser RE upholstery, made from recycled fibers, ensures both durability and environmental responsibility. This is actually Rimowa’s first widely available entry into the home-furniture arena so if you’re a fan of the brand, then you will probably want to have one. However, there will only be 1,000 units of this stool available worldwide. And with a price tag of $2,700, it will indeed be a rare gem for those who have spare change and the opportunity to get this. The Aluminum Stool is more than a stylish footnote—it represents a compelling case of cross-category innovation. Rimowa leverages its hallmark structural technology to pioneer a new chapter in home interiors, while Vitra injects sustainability and furniture expertise. The result? A conversation-starting object that’s equally at home in a Milan showroom or a chic Berlin loft. It reimagines what a piece of furniture can be and bridges the gap between travel and home, art and utility, luxury and responsibility.",
