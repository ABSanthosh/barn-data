It was a spot that bugged me since we moved in: I started some mud room updates last year and added the shiplap wall, no sew cushion and long pillow. It made a huge difference in here and I LOVE this half of the room! The only part that bugged me were the baskets underneath the bench. I used what we had when we moved in, but they drove me absolutely crazy. They shed everywhere and didn't hold their shape.Â I knew I'd build something eventually to replace them.

Well, two boxes.Â You'll notice I used inexpensive, low quality plywood for most of this build -- because it holds shoes. Dirty shoes. I don't need the inside to be pretty. :) Once you get the measurements figured out, building one is super easy. It's figuring out the exact dimensions that takes the longest.Â  I had my wood cut down at Lowe's and that made this go super quick. My shoe boxes are 14 inches tall and 20 inches wide, but of course if you try this out you'll want to make them to fit your space.Â  I didn't use jigs or anything -- just nailed it together with my nail gun and it's super sturdy. I laid the bottom piece on the ground, then surrounded it with the sides. (You can see how I constructed it if you look at that pic above.)I made the front and back pieces wider (20 inches) so they cover up the rough edges on the front.Â  I used a nicer, paint grade plywood for the front panels so it would paint up nicely. After a few coats I put them in place and realized they definitely needed a little something:Â  They were functional but super boring. :)Â  My thin lattice trim molding to the rescue! I painted some scrap that I had in the garage and did a simple frame around the front. Be sure to check out all the ways I've used that lattice trim over the years!Â  After that I added a long, heavy duty handle to the front of each shoe box...and they were done!:Â  I wanted them to look as built in as possible, so instead of wheels I put a fewÂ large felt pads on the bottom:Â  They slide in and out super easy because our tile is so smooth. (I tested that out before building them -- if you use wheels remember you'll have to adjust the height of your boxes!) At first I was worried they wouldn't hold as many shoes, because we could stuff so much in the baskets. Turns out these are HUGE and hold plenty!:Â  No, I didn't paint the inside. We're the only ones that will see in there. Pick your battles my friends! :) They turned out even better than I had envisioned! And they are SO super functional, I'm so happy to have those baskets out of here!:Â  The handles actually work great, because nine times out of ten I'm using my feet to pull them open and closed. ðŸ˜‚ If you would do the same, make sure to get long hardware for the front.Â  SO. much. cleaner.
