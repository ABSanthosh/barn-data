  "description": "This Federation-era home in the Sunshine Coast has a 100-year history behind it, and now, it’s ready for a new custodian. The renovated Queenslander once formed part of a significant manor built in 1910 on the Southport foreshore; during WWII, it served as a place of refuge for returning soldiers; before it was eventually relocated to the Noosa Hinterland where it remains today. See inside the renovated residence (and its breathtaking views!) below.",

  "text": "The owners of this Sunshine Coast home came across the grand Queenslander by chance a few years ago. ‘From the moment we saw the timber verandahs framed by tall gums and that beautiful view to Cooroy Mountain, we were drawn in,’ Kristy says — who purchased the four-bedroom home with her husband Justin. ‘There was a calmness about it, a kind of quiet dignity. We felt it the moment we stepped onto the porch.’ Beside the spectacular hillside position and captivating views, the house itself had a fascinating history. Originally built in 1910 as just one wing of a manor called Seabank in the Gold Coast, the home served as sanctuary for soldiers returning from WWII. ‘Over the decades, the original residence was respectfully divided and relocated, and this particular wing eventually made its way to the Noosa Hinterland, where it was carefully reassembled and restored,’ Justin explains. When the couple took ownership, the old weatherboard abode had already been ‘beautifully renovated’, preserving the integrity of the French doors, high ceilings, and VJ walls. But the most recent ‘caretakers’ have made a few thoughtful updates of their own, including adding a driveway and transforming the outdoor areas for entertaining — including establishing the new firepit zone and poolside area. ‘We’ve also done some clearing and landscaping to improve access and create nature walks around the property, carefully balancing usability with a respect for the natural environment,’ Kristy adds. ‘We only made enhancements to improve the way the home functions day to day. It was never about changing the home, just evolving it.’ The kitchen and plunge pool both offer especially ‘breathtaking’ views of the undulating landscape, which is filled with local wildlife. There’s also a creek at the boundary of the property, a gym in the undercroft, and a 10kW solar system. Kristy and Justin say the location has been an idyllic place for their young family in this chapter of their lives, but have made the bittersweet choice to list the home for sale. ‘You feel completely tucked away, yet Eumundi is just minutes down the road, and Noosa and the Sunshine Coast Airport are a short drive away,’ Kristy says. ‘Living here has been a privilege, and we feel grateful to have played a small part in its ongoing journey.’ 57 Whispering Gum Avenue, Eumundi, QLD is listed for private sale with Krause Property.",
