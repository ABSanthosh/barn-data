One of her aims was to create a simple and robust system that could be used worldwide, even with limited resources. Currently, formwork for non-standard concrete shapes typically requires digital fabrication. \"This creates barriers for sustainable concrete construction in developing countries, where the need for new buildings is especially high,\" she says. The formwork can be produced cheaply. \"The only things needed in addition to the materials are a template for the shape and a stapler,\" adds Scheder-Bieschin. The materials for the prototype cost only 650 Swiss francs in total. The individual components are light and compact enough to transport easily. Scheder-Bieschin demonstrated the system's simplicity by assembling it herself during her pregnancy. \"I wanted to ensure my design was simple enough for anyone to build, regardless of their circumstances,\" she says.Thus far two structures have been built using the Unfold Form, one at ETH Zurich, the other in South Africa. Once Scheder-Bieschin has gained her doctorate later this year, she plans to bring the product to market.",
