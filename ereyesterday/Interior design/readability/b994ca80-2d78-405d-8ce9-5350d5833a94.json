  "text": "I’m used to wearing a smartwatch the past few years but even before that, I wasn’t really much of an expensive watch person. Probably the most expensive one I owned was a Baby G, and that isn’t even considered a luxury watch. But I can appreciate the workmanship that goes into those high-end timepieces even though I probably would never own a pair (unless someone generously gives me one). And if it’s a very limited edition kind of watch, then you know that there is something special in its material or in its featured and that it will cost a ton. The Ressence Type 9 S75 is a strikingly original limited-edition timepiece, created to mark the 75th anniversary of Ahmed Seddiqi \u0026 Sons, a leading UAE-based watch retailer. This watch is not only a celebration of horological innovation but also a beautiful tribute to the landscape and culture of the United Arab Emirates. At first glance, the Ressence Type 9 S75 stands out for its minimalist, seamless silhouette which is a hallmark of Ressence’s design philosophy. The 39mm Grade 5 titanium case is polished and sleek, weighing just 40 grams, making it one of the lightest luxury watches you’ll find. There’s no crown, which preserves its fluid lines; instead, the watch is wound and set via a two-direction rotating caseback mechanism, another signature Ressence feature. Design: Ressence What truly sets the Type 9 S75 apart is its dial. Ressence and Seddiqi have taken storytelling to a new level by integrating real sand from each of the seven Emirates directly into the dial. These sand grains are bonded to the rotating titanium discs, creating a tangible, earthy connection to the UAE’s desert heritage. The effect is both luxurious and deeply meaningful, giving you a physical piece of the region on your wrist. Beneath the sandy dial, the Ressence Type 9 S75 is powered by the reliable ETA 2892A2 automatic movement, combined with Ressence’s in-house ROCS (Ressence Orbital Convex System) module. This patented system displays time in a unique way: the entire dial and its sub-dials rotate in a fluid, orbiting motion, offering an intuitive and captivating reading experience. The movement beats at 28,800 vibrations per hour and provides a power reserve of 36 hours. The hour indices and minute markers are engraved into the sand-textured dial and filled with green Grade A Super-LumiNova, ensuring good nighttime visibility. The watch is splash-resistant and protected by a domed sapphire crystal with an anti-reflective coating, enhancing its legibility and durability. Completing the desert-inspired design is a genuine camel leather strap in a light tan finish—a thoughtful touch that honors regional heritage. The strap is secured with a polished titanium ardillon buckle that matches the case. If exclusivity is your passion, the Ressence Type 9 S75 delivers: only 20 pieces will be produced. Each watch is available through Ahmed Seddiqi boutiques, priced at $24,000 (excluding VAT). This ensures the it will remain a unique collector’s item, especially appealing to both watch aficionados and those who appreciate objects with a strong sense of place. It’s a wearable piece of art that encapsulates place, heritage, and modern horological mastery.",
