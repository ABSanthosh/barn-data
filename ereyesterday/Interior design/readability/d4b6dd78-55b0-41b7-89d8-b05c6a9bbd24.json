The dining table has a light wood tabletop as well, and the room just needed something.  Over the years my home decor style has morphed to a more traditional look, and this piece was feeling a little shabby chic -- but I still really liked the bones and knew I could update it somehow.  This is where the \"This will be so easy and fast!\" part comes in. I decided to paint it with a dark paint color that would give it a bit more presence.  I was determined to use paint we have in our stash -- the color is called Rojo Marron from Sherwin-Williams and I used it to paint my husband's office last year.  The piece is very basic really, no detailed trim or anything, and the door handles are built in so there wasn't much hardware to take off.  I figured I could get the whole thing painted in a couple hours (not including dry time). I was so confident I started this project later in the evening, thinking I could do the finishing touch ups the next morning.  Do you sense the foreboding?  I shared an easy way to paint furniture (with no primer) last year -- but this time I didn't even use my normal degreasing spray because I thought there was no protective finish on the wood. (Liquids would sometimes stain it easily.)  That would come back to bite me in the butt.  I could tell after the first coat had dried that something had been used on the surface. I always sand in between coats of paint for a super smooth finish:  And I noticed it was taking off more than it should have, especially for such a light sanding. That was problem number one, more on that in a bit.  I ended up taking the doors off to paint them, and the cane fronts proved to be WAY more difficult to paint than I thought. Even with a small fluffy roller and a paint brush, I just couldn't get into the little crevices.  So I picked up a couple of these small paint pads and they worked great:  I really like those for painting trim, but they also worked well for the cane because I could really smoosh it in around to get better coverage.  My plan all along was to not paint the inside of the doors or the interior. But when I put the doors back on, the lighter wood on the doors (because you could see through the cane) was making it all look unfinished.  So I went through the whole process on the inside as well:  As I was working, I noticed all kinds of little issues I had never noticed on this furniture before.  Both left side doors were not hanging evenly, so I tried adding adjusting the hinges a bit. It helped on one side, but not the other:  I was learning very quickly that this piece was made to look a little worn and shabby on purpose. Or maybe it was just crappy craftsmanship, who knows. ;)  Painting the inside of the doors made everything look so much better, but I was bothered by the lighter wood I could see around the edges:  So I taped off the interior areas with painter's tape and did a couple coats so the color was seamless on the front.  As you can see, the part where the cane meets the door frames was looking awful as well.  So on DAY THREE of this project, I went to the hardware store and grabbed some skinny detailed trim, painted it and cut it down to size with my handy handheld miter shears. I nailed them in around the cane to give it a more finished look:  On day four I realized it would look even better with some caulk and filled in around the trim as well:  I recommend using a darker tinted caulk when painting with a deep color.  Look how much better the door on the left looks with the trim!:  I never noticed all of these little issues before! Painting sure brought out all of the problem areas.  Remember my concern about the paint not sticking very well? I used the semi gloss finish in this same color (we had both semi and eggshell) for the additional coats. Semi gloss just holds up better in general.  I also did two coats of this wipe on polyurethane on the entire sideboard after the paint to give it even more protection against wear and tear. Usually I don't use poly on my furniture projects (I find semi gloss paint holds up just fine on its own after curing).  While I was add it, I grabbed my Rub n Buff and touched up the metal hinges as well:  It took four days and countless hours, but the final result WAS worth it! I'm thrilled with the deep, rich color and am so glad I made this change:  It turned out just gorgeous!! We love it.  Oh, bonus problem I ran into -- the darker color was making it much easier to see what was inside. The original finish allowed me to just pile things inside, but no longer. 😁  SO I ended up pulling out every single thing:  Told you this holds a lot of stuff!  It turned out to be a good thing, because we definitely don't need it all. I kept about half and moved a few items to other spots in the kitchen.  Now even the inside looks pretty!:  I really love the lighter wood inside -- it gives it some dimension.  The color is just beautiful! So rich and looks fantastic against the lighter walls:  This deep burgundy also pulls some color out of the rug as well.  Overall this project, that I thought would take a few hours, ended up taking a few hours a day over four days. I thought it would never end.  The contrast adds so much warmth and character to this room, I'm thrilled with it:  Hopefully this will help if you run into the same issues while giving furniture a makeover. Don't give up!! Haha!",
