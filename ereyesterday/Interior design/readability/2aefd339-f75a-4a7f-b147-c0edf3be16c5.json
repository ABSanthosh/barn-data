  "text": "Two Halves, One Complete JourneyThe official medals for the upcoming 2026 Olympic Winter Games and Paralympic Winter Games were revealed in Venice at Palazzo Balbi. Designed by the Istituto Poligrafico e Zecca dello Stato (IPZS), the medals embody a metaphor that celebrates both the athletes’ journeys and the collective spirit that supports them. The unveiling was notably attended by two Italian sporting legends, Federica Pellegrini and Francesca Porcellato, who helped present the medals that embody the essence of Italy’s creativity and commitment to the values of sport.The design concept of the medals reflects the unity of two cities, Milano and Cortina, fused through the Olympic and Paralympic ideals. Each medal is divided into two distinct halves, symbolizing the connection between the athlete and the support system that contributes to their success. This design allows the medals to serve as physical representations of sacrifice, teamwork, and the pursuit of excellence. The contrasting surface textures of each medal highlight the dichotomy between the Olympic and Paralympic worlds, with one half speaking to the triumph of the individual, and the other to the collective effort that makes such triumphs possible.images © Fondazione Milano Cortina 2026Crafting a Symbol of the Italian SpiritProduced by IPZS, a leader in secure printing and coin minting, the Milano Cortina 2026 medals are crafted with sustainability in mind. The eco-friendly design features a recyclable, non-toxic finish, and the energy used in production comes from renewable sources. Paolo Perrone, President of IPZS, emphasized that these medals embody both craftsmanship and technological innovation, reinforcing the universal appeal of sport and its connection to the enduring values of effort and perseverance.Raffaella Paniè, the Brand and Identity Director for Milano Cortina 2026, described the medals as a tribute to Italian avant-garde design. The medals’ refined simplicity invites admiration through both their tactile quality and their visual appeal. The bold combination of two distinct textures, one symbolizing purity and the other strength, offers a nuanced take on the Olympic and Paralympic values. The design, which places the athlete at its center, is a reminder that every victory is a shared experience, marked by the personal and collective stories that define the Games.the Milano Cortina 2026 medals were unveiled at Palazzo Balbi in VeniceSymbolizing Victory Beyond the PodiumThe Milano Cortina 2026 medals are a statement about Italy’s commitment to sporting excellence. Giovanni Malagò, President of Fondazione Milano Cortina 2026, called them a ‘living fragment of the Italian spirit.’ These medals represent the deep-rooted culture of passion, determination, and teamwork that has shaped Italy’s sporting history.
