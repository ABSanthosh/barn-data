  "text": "Soft lighting, rounded forms and neutral colours create a welcoming atmosphere inside this sex shop in Kyiv by Ukrainian designers Sofiia Hupalovska and Nataliya Stukonog, with playful details including a phallic pouf. Hupalovska and Stukonog, who worked together at architecture and interiors studio Balbek Bureau before Hupalovska set up her own firm in 2021, wanted to create an inclusive and attractive interior that stands apart from the gaudy style of most adult stores. Sofiia Hupalovska and Nataliya Stukonog have completed a sex shop in Kyiv\"The concept behind Inside was to create a sex shop experience that defies the typical, cliche aesthetics associated with such spaces,\" Hupalovska explained. \"Instead of the usual neon lights and stereotypical symbols like strawberries, Inside was designed to offer a subtle, sophisticated environment.\" Metallic finishes were used for the wall panelling and accentsTo achieve this objective, the designers used a muted palette comprising shades of cream and grey that allow the products to stand out. Metallic finishes help to brighten the space by reflecting light while contributing to the modern aesthetic. These surfaces, mainly used for wall panelling and accents, also contrast with softer details such as curtains and upholstered furniture. A curved sofa in the reception area is characterised by its depiction of a female bodyThe shop is set in a basement without any natural light, so the designers decided to incorporate a backlit ceiling panel that provides a soft, even glow similar to daylight. Visitors are welcomed by a reception desk, positioned in front of a metallic backdrop to create a bright and inviting space with a semi-private feel. The integrated shelves have curved edges that echo the contours of the buildingIn the reception area, a curvaceous sofa is decorated with the stylised outline of a female body. Here, customers can relax while browsing products or awaiting assistance. The main retail space provides a simple and neutral setting for presenting products on built-in shelves. A central counter with rounded edges provides a surface for staff to assist customers with product enquiries. \"The soft edges of the counter reduce visual harshness, promoting a feeling of approachability,\" said Hupalovska. \"Its central location might encourage a flow of movement around the space, guiding visitors naturally toward various sections and product displays.\" A soft-edged counter provides a space for product demonstrationsThe shelves were designed to combat another issue arising from the store's basement setting. The existing walls lacked straight surfaces, making it complicated to install standalone shelving units, so built-in storage provided a practical and more streamlined solution. The integrated shelves contribute to the clean-lined look of the interior, with curved edges on the upper niches mirroring the contours used throughout the space. The shop's furniture and fixtures were mostly custom-made by Ukrainian contractors, with many pieces designed using rounded, organic shapes. Examples include a playful pouf in the fitting room that resembles a penis. A penis-shaped pouffe is among the custom-made furnishingsThe fitting room also features curtains that can be drawn for privacy and a curving light wall that provides uniform lighting for customers trying on items. A sink in the main display area was designed as a monolithic element with a concrete finish that complements the shop's raw, industrial theme, alongside the exposed pipes and ducting. Overall, the shop's interior seeks to balance functionality and a minimalist aesthetic with softer touches to contribute to a discreet and enjoyable shopping experience. The concrete sink complements the store's industrial theme\"The space strikes a balance between sophistication and playfulness, achieved through carefully selected materials, colours and shapes that feel luxurious yet accessible,\" Hupalovska said. During her time at Kyiv-based Balbek Bureau, Hupalovska worked on projects including an interior for a gender-neutral salon and cocktail bar with concrete surfaces and gold accents. Other projects from the studio include a modern restaurant that incorporates classic Ukrainian forms and a house that reinterprets the traditional log cabin using stainless steel and concrete.
