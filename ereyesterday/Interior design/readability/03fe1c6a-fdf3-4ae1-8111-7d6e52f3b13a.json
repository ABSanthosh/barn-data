  "text": "A lucky buyer has the chance to move into one of Fitzroy’s oldest homes, sporting a rare renovation by Flack Studio. The current owners bought the double-fronted Victorian at 57 St David Street in 2016 after seeing the immediate potential in the large block, located in the heart of the inner-city neighbourhood. ‘Having lived in Fitzroy since 2006, and both working in property, we’ve always been on the lookout for homes that offer the best combination of location, land size, and orientation,’ the vendors say. ‘We knew this home was something special.’ The couple engaged a dream team to unlock the house’s untapped potential inside and out, with help from David Flack’s now-famous Flack Studio, Black Door Building, Vivid Green Landscapes, and Laguna Pools. The residence was ‘completely gutted and rebuilt’, retaining only the internal brick walls. From there, Flack Studio created fresh yet elegant interiors revealing hints of trademark flair: marbled stone finishes, brass details, and eclectic pops of colour and pattern. The main bedroom is especially luxurious, thanks to an ensuite and walk-in wardrobe with custom, blue-stained joinery. The living spaces flow out into the north-facing backyard, featuring a bluestone-paved alfresco area, vine-laden pergola, leafy gardens and a solar-heated pool. ‘It feels peaceful and private, with gorgeous garden views adding to the sense of calm,’ the vendors add. They also say the location is ‘the best spot’ in Fitzroy. ‘Everything is within walking distance: beautiful parklands, the city, Victoria Market, the MCG, Meatsmith, and three tram lines. Our neighbourhood is as welcoming as it gets — we often catch up with our friendly neighbours for drinks. There’s a real sense of good old fashioned community here.’ 57 St David Street, Fitzroy, VIC 3065 is for sale with Charlie Barham and Peter Stephens from Nelson Alexander Fitzroy and will go to auction on Thursday February 27 at 7pm.",
