This is especially useful for high-traffic areas like staircases, patios, and garage floors, where slippery surfaces can pose a safety hazard. The added texture provides grip, reducing the risk of slips and falls. Photo Credit: Canva Pro 2. Hides Imperfections If your walls have minor dings, dents, or uneven textures, sand-mixed paint can help disguise these flaws. The rougher texture diffuses light differently than a smooth surface, making blemishes less noticeable and giving walls a more finished look. Photo Credit: Canva Pro 3. Adds Durability Paint with sand added is more resistant to wear and tear, making it a great choice for areas prone to scuff marks and scratches. This technique works well for outdoor fences, basement floors, and children’s play areas where extra durability is needed. Photo Credit: Canva Pro 4.
