  "text": "The Lady Bird offers a striking combination of vibrant exterior colors and a thoughtfully designed interior. Although it is relatively compact, it efficiently accommodates a master bedroom on the ground floor, a cozy loft, a versatile living room/home office area, and a fully equipped kitchen. Designed by Decathlon Tiny Homes, the Lady Bird is built on a triple-axle trailer, measuring 32 ft (9.75 m) in length. The exterior features smart siding painted in bright teal and white, complemented by a sleek metal roof. Designer: Decathlon Tiny Homes Upon entering the home through the front door, guests are welcomed into the living room, which also serves as an office space. This versatile area is designed with a large window and high ceiling, perfect for both work and relaxation since this model is primarily intended as a workspace and guesthouse. A “fandelier,” which is a combination of a fan and lighting fixture, along with a mini-split air-conditioning unit, ensures a comfortable climate. Adjacent to this space is the kitchen, thoughtfully scaled for a home of this size. It boasts ample cabinetry, a full-size fridge/freezer, an electric cooktop, a sink with a cutting board insert, and a combination microwave/convection oven and air fryer. A stacked washing machine and dryer are conveniently located nearby. The kitchen leads to The Lady Bird’s bathroom, which is equipped with a shower, a vanity sink, and an upscale toilet featuring a bidet and other advanced functions. As previously mentioned, the Lady Bird features two bedrooms, offering comfortable sleeping arrangements for its occupants. The master bedroom is thoughtfully located on the opposite side of the home from the living room. It is accessible through the bathroom, creating a seamless flow throughout the home’s layout. One of the impressive features of the master bedroom is its generous headroom, allowing occupants to stand upright, a luxury not always found in tiny houses. This additional vertical space enhances the feeling of openness and ease. The room is designed to accommodate a double bed comfortably, with ample space to move around. It also includes two built-in wardrobes, ensuring that the space remains clutter-free and organized. The secondary bedroom is accessed via a cleverly designed staircase that integrates storage, maximizing efficiency in the use of space. This room adopts a more classic loft-style design, typical of many tiny houses. It features a lower ceiling, but still provides a cozy and intimate atmosphere, comfortably accommodating a double bed and making it a perfect space for relaxation or welcoming guests. As for the cost, there isn’t specific pricing mentioned for the Lady Bird model itself. But, it is built on the framework of Decathlon Tiny Homes’ Poseidon model, which gives us an indication of the price range. The Poseidon model starts at approximately US$112,750, so you may have to make a similar investment for the Lady Bird.",
