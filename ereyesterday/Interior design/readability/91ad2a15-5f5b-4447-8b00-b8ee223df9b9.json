The design blends earthy materials, subtle textures, and thoughtful elements to reflect the owner's love for nature and spiritual sensibilities. \"The result is a tactile haven that whispers tranquillity, inviting its inhabitants to slow down and cultivate a deeper connection with their inner selves and nature,\" said the studio Read more about A Bamboo Sanctuary › Photo by Light String StudioWorkplace interior of the year: Sanj Haus by Sanj Design Studio The studio transformed a historic arcade building into a design studio that includes a coffee shop, preserving the architectural features of the original structure to honour local history and culture. \"The design hopes to revitalise the space and participate in recording and inheriting the history of old Xiamen with the indigenous people,\" said the studio. \"For this shophouse, we consciously tried to express what was old and what was new in terms of the design language and how the material is applied.\" Read more about Sanj Haus by Sanj Design Studio › Photo by Yumeng ZhuExhibition design of the year: Exhibition Installations and Permanent Historical Exhibition at Hong'en Temple by Wonder Architects The architecture studio developed an exhibition that showcases the temple's over 700-year history, reflecting the transformation of Beijing's old city. The exhibition installations draw inspiration from traditional temple furniture, designed to be easily disassembled and reassembled to adapt to varying needs. \"The information presented in the exhibition can ferment through the interaction between people and objects and between people and space, creating a novel experience,\" said Wonder Architects. \"This becomes a documentary reconstruction of the historical site, which does not even rely on the space with historical information itself.\" Read more about Sanj Haus by Sanj Design Studio › Photo by Steven KoHealth and wellbeing interior of the year: Gym Town by M.R. Studio The founder of Myron Kwan Studio created a futuristic space with Mars-inspired elements that help visitors detach from their busy urban lives and focus on their health goals. Occupying an entire floor within the On Hing Building in Hong Kong, the 550-square-metre gym provides a luxurious fitness space that includes a \"celestial\" common area, changing rooms with executive lockers, a designated area for weight training, high-end cardio equipment and a professional combat and boxing zone.

Studio › Photo by LIA Interior DesignHotel and short-stay interior project of the year: Citadines Yazhou Bay Sanya by Lia Interior Design Situated in the tower of a shopping mall complex, the hotel's design facilitates pedestrian flow and adapts to the limited architectural space. The designer incorporated elements of traditional Chinese aesthetics, local architecture and coastal vacation style into the hotel for business travellers. \"The basic demand of customers is to create a high-quality business travel hotel experience in the coastal resort city of Sanya,\" said Lia Interior Design. \"At the same time, they value Rio Design's aesthetic fusion of humanities, fashion and locality, thus giving birth to the hotel.\" Read more about Citadines Yazhou Bay Sanya by LIA Interior Design › Photo by HuaweiRetail interior of the year: Huawei TKL Flagship Store by UNStudio The store, which was inspired by nature and Huawei's Harmony operating system, features biophilic forms that create a smooth transition between the indoors and outdoors. The store's exterior facade features the spiralling \"Tree of Harmony\" elements integrated with interactive experiences through AR. The studio utilised a colour palette of warm and soothing tones for the store's interior, facilitating the connection between the store's multifunctional spaces across both floors. \"Our design for the flagship store blends interactive experiences, technology and community creation,\" said UNStudio. \"The store provides a contemporary venue as inviting environments for consumers and visitors to meet, share and innovate.\" Read more about Huawei TKL Flagship Store by UNStudio › Photo by Half Half PhotographyRestaurant and bar interior of the year: Da Niao Yakitori Interior Design by Atelier Tuo The studio crafted a home-like restaurant with a deep, narrow entrance and integrated the contemporary design into an irregular site framed by historical buildings from various eras. The restaurant's interior features a bamboo ceiling that appears to float above the counter, defining the centre of the space while discreetly concealing the ventilation and air-conditioning systems.
