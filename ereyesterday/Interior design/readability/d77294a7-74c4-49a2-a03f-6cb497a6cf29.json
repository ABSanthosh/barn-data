  "text": "There’s a certain expectation that chairs will always be an elevated platform to rest our bodies above the ground. While that’s generally true almost everywhere, there are some cultures that also adopt a different style of sitting. Some, for example, sit cross-legged, often on the floor, and take that position in a variety of circumstances, whether it’s when meditating, eating, or even just lounging around. Unfortunately, the majority of chair designs don’t accommodate this sitting style, leaving people to settle for cushions and pillows. These can shield their bodies from the hardness of the floor and keep their clothes clean, but they have nothing to offer in terms of comfort, stability, and enjoyment. This concept design tries to address that glaring absence to make cross-legged seating just as good as sitting up on a chair. Designer: Ila Rani Admittedly, sitting cross-legged, whether on the floor or even a bed or couch, isn’t exactly an easy task for some people. But even those used to such a position often experience discomfort and inconvenience over a short period of time. It’s almost ironic that it’s one of the positions often associated with meditation and calmness despite how it makes most people uncomfortable. Part of that problem, however, is simply due to the lack of proper support for the sitting style. The Sway chair concept aims to help promote this sitting position and lifestyle with a piece of furniture that brings the convenience and security of regular chairs to the floor. The most important detail of this design is actually the backrest that lets people lean back and relax with confidence, encouraging a lounging posture even when sitting cross-legged. The bottom of the chair is curved rather than flat, allowing the user to gently rock themselves as well. Interestingly, Sway has two armrests with different heights. The higher one acts as your typical armrest to place your elbow when sitting back and lounging. The lower one, however, has a notch near the front for gripping when rocking the chair or shifting position. The design delivers the stability and security that simple pillows and cushions lack. In terms of aesthetics, Sway adopts a more nature-inspired design using wood materials and earthy tones. It does use a steel rod to provide the skeleton that joins these pieces together, but it almost disappears into the background due to its plain and unassuming appearance. It’s a design that immediately evokes calmness and oneness with nature, images that are immediately associated with the cross-legged sitting position.",
