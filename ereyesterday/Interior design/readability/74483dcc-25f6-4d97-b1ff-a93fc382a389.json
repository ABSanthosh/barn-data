In the field of technology, where innovation often comes with an environmental price tag, finding ways to balance progress with planetary health is a complex challenge. Samsung, a global leader in consumer electronics, is addressing this head-on through its ambitious Galaxy for the Planet initiative, a strategy that combines innovation, collaboration, and community-driven action. A Commitment to Sustainable Practices Launched in 2021, the Galaxy for the Planet initiative signals Samsung’s dedication to embedding sustainability into its operations. By reimagining material use and production processes, the company has achieved significant milestones. One of the most notable achievements is the integration of over 150 tons of discarded fishing nets into its products since 2022—a volume equivalent to approximately 15 million plastic water bottles. These discarded nets, known for their detrimental impact on marine life, are transformed into high-performance polyamide resin used in Galaxy devices, including the Galaxy S25 series. Samsung: Daniel Araujo Daniel Araujo, Vice President of Samsung’s MX Sustainability Office, emphasizes the company’s forward-thinking approach: “Each device of the S25 series includes at least 50% recycled cobalt in its batteries, sourced from previously used Galaxy smartphones. This circular battery supply chain represents our commitment to reducing waste and creating a more sustainable future.” Yanko Design views this as a pivotal step in reimagining how the tech industry can seamlessly integrate environmental responsibility into advanced functionality. It underscores the critical need for innovation to align with sustainability, setting a precedent for the broader industry. Building on this momentum, Samsung’s initiative also incorporates recycled glass and various metals into device components, ensuring sustainability permeates every phase of the product lifecycle. The company’s goal is clear: by 2030, recycled materials will be integrated into every module of every Galaxy device. Partnerships That Drive Impact While internal initiatives set the foundation, Samsung’s partnerships amplify its impact. Collaborations with Seatrees, a nonprofit focused on restoring coastal ecosystems, and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography highlight the transformative power of community-driven conservation. Tamara Gondo, CEO of Liberty Society (left), and Michael Stewart, Co-Founder of Seatrees (right) Michael Stewart, co-founder of Seatrees, notes, “We partnered with Samsung because of our shared commitment to innovation and collaboration. Mobile technology has the ability to make science more accessible, connect individuals and groups, and drive meaningful action in coral reef restoration.” Samsung’s role in these partnerships extends beyond funding. By equipping local communities with Galaxy devices optimized for underwater photography, the company is enabling more precise data collection. The resulting 3D models are essential for restoring marine ecosystems and tracking progress over time. A Closer Look at the Galaxy S25 Ultra Central to these efforts is the Galaxy S25 Ultra, a device that exemplifies Samsung’s commitment to blending technology with environmental stewardship. The smartphone features an “ocean mode”—a custom camera setting designed specifically for underwater photography. Traditional underwater photos often suffer from poor color accuracy due to light distortion. Samsung’s engineers addressed this by creating a custom white balance that corrects for the blue tint of underwater environments, ensuring images are vivid and lifelike. Additionally, the Galaxy S25 Ultra allows divers to set faster shutter speeds, compensating for the low-light conditions often encountered underwater. Another innovative feature is the interval shooting mode, which captures consistent images at set intervals, enabling researchers to create accurate, repeatable data sets. These technological advancements streamline the process of capturing and analyzing coral reef health, making it easier for local communities and scientists to work collaboratively. Circular Economy and Material Innovation The Galaxy for the Planet initiative isn’t limited to visible changes. Behind the scenes, Samsung’s Circular Battery Supply Chain showcases how closed-loop systems can redefine sustainability in tech. By reclaiming cobalt from previously used Galaxy devices and integrating it into new batteries, the company is reducing its reliance on virgin materials while minimizing electronic waste. This circular approach extends to other components as well. For instance, Samsung has repurposed over 30 tons of semiconductor waste, transforming it into durable plastic components. These practices exemplify how innovation can coexist with environmental responsibility, setting a precedent for the broader industry. Empowering Communities Through Technology Beyond material innovation, Samsung is empowering communities to take action. The Generation17 initiative, in partnership with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), amplifies the voices of young leaders working toward the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). One such leader, Tamara Gondo, CEO of Liberty Society, has transformed waste into economic value by upcycling materials into corporate merchandise. Gondo’s work highlights the interconnectedness of environmental and social sustainability. “We believe waste is just misplaced value,” she explains. “By training marginalized women in Indonesia to upcycle waste into products, we’ve not only reduced environmental impact but also increased their incomes by 300%, helping break the cycle of poverty.” Samsung’s collaboration with Generation17 extends to providing resources and technology, enabling leaders like Gondo to scale their impact. Through programs like these, the company is fostering a new generation of changemakers equipped to address global challenges. Technology as a Catalyst for Conservation Dr. Stuart Sandin, a marine ecologist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, underscores the importance of technology in environmental conservation. “Imagery and data are vital for understanding and managing underwater ecosystems,” he notes. “With advancements in mobile technology, we can create detailed 3D models of coral reefs, enabling us to track changes and implement targeted restoration efforts.” Stuart Sandin: Scripps Institute Of Oceanography (far left) Sandin’s team has leveraged the Galaxy S25 Ultra’s capabilities to map coral reefs in locations such as Fiji, Bali, and the Florida Keys. The resulting data not only informs conservation strategies but also engages local communities, fostering a sense of ownership and accountability. Real-World Impact: Coral Reef Restoration The impact of these efforts is tangible. In partnership with Seatrees, Samsung has supported coral restoration projects across three distinct ecosystems. By planting corals in these areas, the initiative is helping to rebuild habitats, protect coastal communities, and restore biodiversity. Stewart highlights the importance of local involvement: “Our work wouldn’t be possible without the communities on the ground. Samsung’s technology empowers these groups, making their work more efficient and effective.” This collaboration demonstrates how technology, when combined with local knowledge, can drive meaningful change. By providing the tools needed to monitor and restore ecosystems, Samsung is ensuring that conservation efforts are both scalable and sustainable. Looking Ahead Samsung’s approach to sustainability serves as a blueprint for the tech industry. By prioritizing material innovation, fostering global partnerships, and empowering communities, the company is proving that technology can be a force for good. The Galaxy S25 Ultra exemplifies this vision, highlighting how thoughtful design and cutting-edge technology can work together to achieve environmental stewardship vision, showcasing how design and functionality can align with environmental stewardship. Cassie Smith, Moderator, Samsung As the world grapples with pressing environmental challenges, Samsung’s initiatives remind us that progress is possible when innovation is guided by purpose. By leveraging its global reach and technological expertise, the company addresses today’s challenges but also paving the way for a more sustainable future—one where people and the planet thrive together.",
