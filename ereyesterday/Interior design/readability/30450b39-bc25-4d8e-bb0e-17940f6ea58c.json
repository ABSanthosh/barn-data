On June 18th, 2025, starting at 10am Pacific Time in Los Angeles, the David Lynch collection auction event by Julien’s Auctions and Turner Classic Movies takes place. It is part of the auction company’s and network’s Hollywood Legends series of archival collections from the industry’s revered figures. For the David Lynch collection auction, the event presents over 450 items that come directly from the filmmaker’s home and personal possessions. The sale hopes to offer a look at his creative life through the personal artifacts he used to use and work with in his everyday and cinematic life.  The items originate from his film projects, his personal woodshop, and his art studio, so much so that they include props, art supplies, furniture he designed and built, and equipment from his music recording studio. In fact, the handmade coffee table, one-of-one conference table, and homemade wheeled cabinet the filmmaker designed are in the auction event. Other items connect to his other films and personal interests, such as a set of four prop menus from the Winkie’s diner location in the film Mulholland Drive. There is also a boomerang-style sofa of the same model seen in the 1997 film Lost Highway.Twin Peaks – The Return Screen-Matched Nuclear Bomb Framed Photo from Gordon Cole’s Office behind David Lynch | all images courtesy of Julien’s AuctionsFrom film prints to custom director’s chairSeveral items in the David Lynch collection auction relate directly to the filmmaker, artist, and musician’s work as a director. One lot features his very own custom director’s chair he used during productions (it even has his name on the back). Another item is David Lynch’s personal 35mm film print of his first feature film, Eraserhead. This print of the 1977 film is significant because Eraserhead launched his career.It achieved a cult status, playing as a midnight movie for years in cities and establishing his signature filmmaking style. The auction also includes many items connected to his series Twin Peaks. One lot contains a red curtain and a black-and-white zig-zag rug from Lynch’s home. These pieces match the design of the Black Lodge, an important and otherworldly location in the show. Another item is a large, framed photograph of a nuclear bomb explosion.
