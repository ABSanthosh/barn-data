  "text": "Glass bottles are quite difficult to pack in a way that leaves a lasting impression. After all, you have to make sure it’s well protected from bumps and scratches, so most use a typical box with lots of support or padding material in the end. That’s definitely safe but also boring, and it wouldn’t match a bottle that’s designed to be outrageously eccentric and unconventional. For that, you need to think outside the box, and what better way to do that than with a box that will make you feel like some treasure hunter solving a puzzle. The Belvedere 10 bottle itself is unlike a regular bottle, looking more like a mysterious ten-level tower with each floor shaped like a chiseled diamond. It evokes a sense of mystery and adventure, and this packaging tries to match that by having just as many hexagonal segments that you turn around until you get the proper combination, unlocking the hidden treasure inside. Designer: Love Creative How much patience can you spare for opening a wine bottle box? If you’re in the middle of a busy social gathering, probably not much. You’d want to be pouring out drinks as fast as you can to keep your guests happy. Not this box, though. This box is meant to be shown off, not just because of its unusual geometric shape but also because of the work you need to do to open it. At least until you’ve memorized the code. Trying to match not just the odd nature of the bottle itself but also the action-packed launch film directed by Taika Waititi, this equally odd packaging adopts not your typical box or cylinder but 10 stacks of hexagonal shapes. The hexagons have golden outlines of “mudras” or hand gestures printed on some of their sides, hand signs that might tickle the fancy of Naruto fans. The hand signs are actually a secret handshake used in the promotional video, and like any secret handshake, there’s a very specific pattern you have to follow to be acknowledged by the other party or vice-versa. The bottle packaging replicates that by making you turn each level of the box until the right signs are lined up, and only then will you be able to slide off the top hexagon and release the bottle inside. Admittedly, it’s a very complicated design, one that will only appeal to people who show off limited-edition items. Unsurprisingly, this kind of packaging is reserved for influencers and the press, but it’s definitely an intriguing way to package a bottle that involves a bit of excitement and fun, at least until the novelty wears off.",
