All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Sundry Photography / ShutterstockIf you rely only on your favorite home decor stores for aesthetic finds, you could be missing out on some gems. Take The Home Depot, for example — the next time you take a trip to the home improvement store for DIY supplies, be on the lookout for unexpected home finds. As it turns out, The Home Depot is actually filled with stylish — and affordable — decor that’s interior designer-approved.“I enjoy shopping at Home Depot because I often get inspired by the DIY projects, unique hardware, lighting fixtures, and other design accents that can add character to my home and/or my client projects,” says Elana Mendelson, founder, CEO, and principal designer of Elana Designs.You know Home Depot is the place to grab things like paint supplies, organizational tools, and hardware to refresh your spaces, but Mendelson emphasizes that people should think of it as a decor destination as well — shopping in-store or online.“Home Depot really is a great place for sourcing interior design items, as it combines affordability with a wide range of stylish, quality products,” she says. “There is such a variety of items allowing you to complete an entire space without overspending.”Mendelson shopped with a $60 budget at The Home Depot to demonstrate how you can find designer-worthy home accents at the same place you get your paint mixed. Below, she shares which items she chose that can make a big difference for not a lot of money.Lighting can get expensive in a hurry, which makes this farmhouse-style sconce a steal. Featuring a vintage-meets-industrial look that’s ideal for an Edison bulb, this wall-mounted sconce provides a “quick lighting update with a sleek, industrial look, complementing both a modern and rustic aesthetic,” Mendelson says. Since you usually use multiple sconces to create a lighting scheme, she suggests buying at least two. “It’s budget-friendly yet impactful, perfect for accent lighting in hallways, bathrooms, or bedrooms,” Mendelson adds.This all-natural cotton throw features a gorgeous tufted design and is machine washable, making this stylish and practical option, according to Mendelson. With a neutral cream color and fringe on the end, this blanket will add visual interest wherever you put it. “It’s an easy way to add texture and warmth, and [it’s] perfect for layering on a sofa or bed,” Mendelson says. She adds that a throw “can refresh a room’s decor and serve as a functional piece for chilly evenings — all without a big spend.”",
