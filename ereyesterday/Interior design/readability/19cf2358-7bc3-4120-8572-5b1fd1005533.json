Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here “Winter is the time for comfort, for good food and warmth, for the touch of a friendly hand and for a talk beside the fire: it is the time for home.” Edith Sitwell Here are five ways to welcome a season of wintering at home: 1. Embrace the Quiet Embrace simple ways to slow down and enjoy your home in this quieter season. Include your favorite winter senses! Crackling fires in the fireplace, candles flickering, winter scents, soothing music, more meaningful conversations, less social noise, more rest, less hustle. What inspires you to feel at peace in your home? Do more of that! 2. Lean into Cozy Comfort + Joy Lean into all the cozy comforts and joys of winter at home. Even though the Christmas season will be behind us, don’t leave behind the light, greenery and cozy textures. These elements make your home feel alive and welcoming even in a dreary winter season. Savor comforting winter rituals like making soup and sipping afternoon tea. Make time for winter experiences such as reading a favorite book sitting by the fire under a soft blanket. Read my book A Lovely Life for more inspiration on the simple joys in every season. 3. Refresh +Clean Make a fresh and clean start to the year in your winter home. Take advantage of this winter season to refresh your home while you’re inside anyway! Go room by room. What needs to go? What could you live without? What needs a deep clean? How could you reorganize or refresh what you have? Do you have inspiring home rhythms for keeping up with cleaning? I teach my methods in HomeBody Gathering Place. 4. Nourish \u0026 Nest Start a winter home healing journey. Invest in what is healthy and good for you and remove what isn’t. Think through all experiences of home: cleaning, entertainment, clutter, food, movement, social media, community, spending, decorating, etc. What changes could you make at home to better nourish yourself in these areas this year? Read my book Dwelling for more inspiration. Find all of my books here. 5. Set Seasonal Home Goals Set home goals for this season and the whole year. There is no rush to set goals by January 1. Use the first weeks of the year to settle into a new year rhythm. Consider what you need to work on in your home this winter and in the upcoming year. What rooms need your attention? What projects need to get done this year? What decisions could you make at home that would allow you to enjoy your environment (and life!) more? Take notes and set attainable goals for your home. Pick a room to work on in January! It can be such a dreary. month but having a specific goal project or space to work on will be inspiring.
