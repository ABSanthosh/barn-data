  "text": "Original mosaic floors and decorative mouldings have been restored in this early 20th-century Barcelona apartment renovation by local practice Sigla Studio. Located in the city's Eixample district, the 150-square-metre apartment sits within a residential building constructed in 1904 called Casa Salvador Viladevall III. Sigla Studio renovated a Barcelona apartment to celebrate its original featuresAfter visiting several apartments within the building, the studio found that many had previously been renovated without much consideration for the original features. By contrast, Sigla Studio looked to incorporate as many of the building's early 20th-century characteristics as possible while introducing some contemporary touches to improve functionality and comfort. Mosaic floor tiles, ceiling mouldings and wooden doors were preserved and restored\"Casa Salvador Viladecal III is a prime example of Catalan modernism, with its intricate hydraulic mosaics, high plaster-moulded ceilings and solid wooden doors,\" Sigla Studio co-founder Bernat Riera told Dezeen. \"These features, emblematic of the period, were meticulously preserved and restored\". A wooden table designed by the studio is the centrepiece of the dining spaceColourful mosaic floor tiles run throughout most of the apartment, including the open-plan living and dining room. \"The hydraulic floors, identified as creations by Teotim Fortuny, were carefully rehabilitated and missing tiles were sourced to maintain their integrity,\" explained Riera. \"Fortuny, a prominent manufacturer of hydraulic mosaics in Catalonia, founded his company in 1895 and was characterised by his intricate designs that reflected both modernist influences and traditional Catalan elements,\" he stated. The open-plan dining and living area leads out to an internal patioAt the centre of the dining space sits a large table designed by the studio, comprised of a marine plywood structure and a Roman travertine marble top. Above the table, a silver pendant lamp hangs down, fitted to a ceiling rose that forms one part of the decorative plaster mouldings adorning the ceilings. A speckled black sofa marks the divide between the dining and living spaces, where the mosaic tile pattern also changes. Original doors and windows were restored and updated with double-glazingSolid pine doors lead out to an internal patio, with exposed brick walls, mosaic flooring and a row of large windows allowing natural light into the space. All the original doors and windows were restored and updated with double glazing, which the studio said improved energy efficiency without compromising on the level of texture and detailing. Steel kitchen cabinets contrast against warm red marble floorsStructurally, one of the most significant interventions made by Sigla Studio was opening up the kitchen to the hallway. This change, as well as an internal window that was cut between the kitchen and living room, was designed to improve the flow and natural light levels in the centre of the apartment. Other additions include the vaulted kitchen ceiling and the warm red Alicante marble floors, which contrast with the cool steel kitchen cabinets. A natural, pared-back scheme was used for the bedroomsIn the bedrooms, the studio opted for a simple, pared-back colour palette. \"The palette carefully balances the vibrancy of the restored floors with softer, natural tones, ensuring a seamless integration of historical and modern features,\" said Riera. Responding to the client's request for an additional bedroom, the studio divided the main bedroom into two with a custom built-in dressing room. \"A fourth room was added by splitting the main bedroom using a custom furniture piece, avoiding any alterations to the original mosaic floors or ceiling mouldings,\" Riera added. \"This adaptive design respects the original layout while accommodating the needs of a modern family.\" The apartment's main bedroom was divided in two using a custom-made furniture pieceDesigned to blend in with the wider scheme, the bathrooms were finished with custom-made red marble sinks and detailing. \"Red Alicante marble in the bathrooms and kitchen adds depth and complements the historic hydraulic tiles, emphasising the connection between old and new,\" said Riera. Red marble was used for the bathroom finishes to complement the wider interior scheme\"The bathrooms are designed to visually integrate with the rest of the apartment, moving away from the traditional idea of hermetic and isolated spaces,\" Riera said. \"When not in use, the doors remain open, contributing to a greater sense of spaciousness and improving overall lighting.\" Other Spanish apartment renovations recently featured on Dezeen include a 19th-century Madrid apartment decorated with colourful furniture by Lucas y Hernandez Gil and a Barcelona apartment divided with a gold-leaf wall by Raúl Sánchez Architects.
