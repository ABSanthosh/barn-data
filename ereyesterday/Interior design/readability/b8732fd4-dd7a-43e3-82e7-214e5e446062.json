Even if life is generally good, it can still be quite challenging to figure out how to juggle all the things we need to do AND balance that with our desire to create the peaceful environment we crave for our holiday home. My passion is to teach others how to create a peaceful and welcoming sanctuary in every season. In HomeBody Gathering Place we treat the subject of taking care of our home like a weekly therapy session. Everything feels better when we make home care a more therapeutic experience in every season — including the holiday season. For the next two months in our HomeBody community I’m teaching an all new series on my four Room Recipe ingredients for a peaceful holiday home. This recipe is a calming framework to create a nurturing environment. Our home should be our sanctuary. We must make it a priority to create a peaceful home for ourselves and the people we share our home with. Click here for above sources I’ve taught many home care principles in my books and I love to bring them to life for our HomeBody members! I also love to share the behind the scenes progress I make in my own home along with fresh ideas for our HomeBody priorities in every season. In the HGP, we bring these transformative principles and truths to our every day lives and homes. Every season we do a deep dive into the activities and mindsets that matter so we can all create the environment we want for our home! You are invited to join us in the HGP right now for the holiday season and then stay to begin the new year of more peace, comfort and joy in your home. Plates, Napkins, Wood Bowl // Cafe Curtains + Rod + Rings Think of HomeBody Gathering Place as a quiet place away from the noise. There’s a private dashboard (no ads and no social media required!) where you can enjoy a new weekly lesson, plus a large vault of mini-courses, videos, inspiration and ideas you can browse at your leisure. Plus we also have an optional Facebook group where you can ask decorating questions, get advice, and share your home and encouragement with our HomeBody community. The HGP really is a special community, so if you haven’t yet joined us or are ready to get your home in order for the new year, I hope you will be a part of this with us. We will help you make your home everything you want it to be! Learn more and join us!",
