  "text": "THE RETURN OF KARL LAGERFELD’S FULL-ON MEMPHIS APARTMENTUnder the title ‘Francesco Vezzoli presents: KARL GOES TO MEMPHIS. Tribute to an Historic Encounter in Monte Carlo,’ Almine Rech Monaco hosts the artist’s third solo exhibition with the gallery, on view from March 20 to May 24, 2025. As faithfully as possible, Vezzoli recreates Karl Lagerfeld’s iconic Monte Carlo apartment, originally furnished entirely with pieces from Memphis – a design collective, born from a cultural movement initiated by Ettore Sottsass. Besides celebrating the collective’s lasting legacy, the exhibition transports visitors into a world where vivid colors, geometric shapes, and playful forms honor Lagerfeld’s eclectic taste and fearless approach to aesthetics.all images courtesy of the Francesco Vezzoli, Memphis and Almine Rech, unless stated otherwise | image © Jacques SchumacherLAGERFELD’S INTERIOR LOVE AFFAIR WITH THE MEMPHIS MOVEMENTLagerfeld was captivated by the humor and rebellious spirit of Memphis. For him, ‘it was love at first sight,’ when he saw the first Memphis show in September ‘81 in Milan. Founded by Ettore Sottsass in 1980, the movement, named after the capital of Ancient Egypt and Elvis Presley’s hometown, was a revolutionary force in design, characterized by its vibrant palette, angular forms, and playful disregard for traditional conventions. Acquired in 2022 by the Italian Radical Design group, Memphis continues to influence the public’s taste in the fashion industry, as well as in cinema and television.As Paloma Picasso reflects in her statement to Francesco Vezzoli’s ‘KARL GOES TO MEMPHIS’ exhibition, Karl Lagerfeld’s embrace of Memphis design was part of a larger creative evolution. In the early 1980s, as the fashion designer settled into his new residence in Monte Carlo, he made a radical shift from his opulent interior style, adopting a disruptive aesthetic between kitsch and elegance. To him, Memphis represented a modern-day Art Deco, perfectly fitting the Mediterranean environment with its vivid hues and jolly forms. This led him to furnish his entire apartment with Memphis pieces, turning his home into a living reflection of the cutting-edge style that defined the early 80s.Karl Lagerfeld in his full-on Memphis-furnished apartment | image © Jacques SchumacherFRANCESCO VEZZOLI’S HOMAGE AT ALMINE RECH MONACOAll of the pieces that originally furnished Lagerfeld’s Monte Carlo residence are included in Francesco Vezzoli’s ‘KARL GOES TO MEMPHIS’ exhibition at Almine Rech Monaco, providing a window into the private world of one of fashion’s most iconic figures. Vezzoli has carefully curated the space to create an immersive experience that captures both the essence of Memphis and Lagerfeld’s creative persona.‘It is nearly impossible to find, in the history of 20th-century art and architecture, a creative collision as all-encompassing and intoxicating as the one that exploded in 1981, when Karl Lagerfeld entrusted Memphis with the aesthetic vision for his living space in Monte Carlo,’ reflects Francesco Vezzoli. Elaborating on his intention, the artist continues, ‘this exhibition seeks to celebrate that utopian and surreal union—an exhilarating, unrepeatable marriage of avant-garde creativity and uncompromising vision. By revisiting this extraordinary moment, we aim to honor the boldness and imagination that reshaped not only a space but also the very boundaries of art, fashion and interior design.’installation view of ‘Francesco Vezzoli presents KARL GOES TO MEMPHIS Tribute to a historic encounter in Monte Carlo’ | image © Nicolas BrasseurIn addition to the original Memphis pieces, Vezzoli has created eight artworks for the occasion. These include embroidered portraits of Lagerfeld in baroque frames, which stand in stark contrast to the modernity of the interior, creating a dynamic tension between opulence and modernity. The artist, known for his provocative blend of classical references and contemporary culture, evokes a sense of nostalgia with his pieces while simultaneously introducing a fresh narrative to the exhibition, mirroring Lagerfeld’s own ability to merge contrasting styles in fashion and design.To further enrich the exhibition experience, a catalog designed by the renowned graphic duo Mathias Augustyniak and Michael Amzalag of M/M (Paris) accompanies the show. Their involvement adds another layer of artistry to the showcase, making it an essential element of the exhibition’s storytelling by offering deeper insight into the significance of the furniture and home decor pieces.KARL GOES TO MEMPHIS (I FEEL JUST LIKE A CHILD), 2025 by Francesco Vezzoli | courtesy of the artist and Almine Rech",
