  "description": "Though Philips is no longer the consumer electronics giant they once were—they've shifted into health technology—they still manufacture some personal care items, like electric shavers and hair dryers. Now, somewhat bizarrely, they're dipping their foot into the DIY repair movement to support those products. The company has partnered with Prusa, the Czech company that has become one of the world's largest manufacturers of 3D printers, to launch this new Philips Fixables initiative.The idea is that Philips will provide 3D files for replacement parts for their products. Consumers will be able to download these files and print the parts themselves, or through a supplier. For now the selection is quite sparse—the only downloadable file available is for a trimmer comb—but the initiative has only launched this month, and the company says more parts are to come. (And hopefully more languages, too; at present the Fixables website is only presented in Czech.)",
