A Parking Lot Becomes a Colorful School for Early Childhood Education In Vitória, Espírito Santo, Brazil, Estúdio Protobox converted an underused parking garage into the playful Children’s Studio at Colégio Salesiano, a dynamic, flexible space dedicated to early childhood education, embodying principles from the Montessori method and the guidelines of the National Common Core Curriculum (BNCC). The primary goal of the project was to create an environment that fosters autonomy, collaboration, and interactive learning among children. 9. Noovo Plus: A Modern Camper Van With a Super High Interior Ceiling If you’ve ever been inside a camper van or watched someone else in one, you know that typically one has to slouch or bend over due to their low ceiling heights. Then Noovo Plus set out to change that. Built on the Super High Roof platform, this innovative vehicle offers unparalleled comfort, versatility, and off-grid capabilities, making it an ideal choice for adventurers and remote workers alike. 8. The Astell\u0026Kern P1 Is Built for the Audiophile on the Go Astell\u0026Kern, for its high-end portable music players, came out with a slightly different take. The Astell\u0026Kern P1 is just as premium as its previous models, but unlike previous devices, this one is built for those with a more active lifestyle. 7. Bang \u0026 Olufsen Beolab 8 Speakers: Ultimate Fusion of Design + Sound In a market flooded with inexpensive wireless speakers designed for mass purchase, finding meticulously crafted, high-quality speakers is increasingly rare. Though such products still exist, they’re becoming more niche with each passing year. Bang \u0026 Olufsen, however, continues to champion wireless connectivity while maintaining its tradition of iconic speaker design – exemplified perfectly by the Bang \u0026 Olufsen Beolab 8 speakers. 6. New KEF Q Series Speakers Feature “Acoustic Black Hole” Tech KEF is renowned for its high-quality speakers that deliver excellent sound while enhancing the aesthetics of any space. With the release of its Q Series speakers, KEF is bringing its cutting-edge Metamaterial Absorption Technology (MAT) to a more accessible price point. 5. IKEA Reimagines Iconic Pieces From the 60s + 70s in Nytillverkad Collection Global Swedish brand IKEA took us all back in time with the third release of it’s iconic Nytillverkad collection. This latest edition pays homage to the carefree and creative spirit of the 1960s and early 1970s. Reviving timeless designs by influential IKEA designers Karin Mobring and Gillis Lundgren, the Nytillverkad collection offers a modern reinterpretation of the era’s relaxed and playful aesthetic. 4. FiiO Gives Portable CD + Cassette Players a Modern Spin FiiO is taking the technology of yesteryear and bringing it into the modern era. The Chinese audio gear company launched the FiiO DM13 portable CD player, alongside a refresh of the FiiO CP13 portable cassette player. Both have instantly classic designs and modern features, plus they allow you to dig out that CD and cassette collection that you’ve been storing in the garage to enjoy once again. 3. The Mid-Century Lark House Embraces Modernity While Preserving History In scenic West Seattle, Washington, perched atop a cliff with panoramic views of Vashon Island, the Olympic Mountains, and the Puget Sound, stands the Lark House. Originally designed in 1958 by esteemed architect Al Bumgardner, this mid-century gem underwent a transformative renovation, reimagining its space to better align with its present owners while honoring its legacy. The project, led by SHED Architecture \u0026 Design, breathes new life into the home by delicately balancing innovation with preservation. 2. Portland Airport Grows With Expansive Mass Timber Roof Canopy As an alternative to concrete and other conventional composites, wood has re-emerged as a popular building material. Long thought of as too fragile and prone to damage, this natural resource has been re-engineered into a suite of fortified structural elements known as mass timber: glued, nailed doweled panels and beams able to shore-up everything from large residences to full-scale skyscrapers. The massive canopy of the expanded main terminal at Portland Airport (PDX), designed by ZGF, might be its most impressive application yet. And the top post of 2024 is… 1. SHED Revives a Mid-Century House in Portland With Japanese Minimalism SHED Architecture \u0026 Design had three modern homes in the Top 10 Architecture Posts of 2024, so it’s no surprise that they came out on top overall with the Mori House. In a forested area of Portland, Oregon, this dreamy, mid-century modern home, originally designed by Saul Zaik in 1963, was thoughtfully reimagined to meet the aesthetic and functional needs of its new owners: a young family with a passion for design. Framed by towering trees, the peaceful retreat prioritizes connection with the natural environment. As always, thank you for reading Design Milk in 2024 and beyond!
