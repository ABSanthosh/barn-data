  "text": "Do you leave a trail of orange fingerprints on your phone screen when scrolling mid-snack, or have to deliberately turn book pages with the Pinky, avoiding Cheetos-dusted fingers from leaving that orange patch on paper? Cheetos Pants could be the answer to the problem you never thought existed, because washing your hands is so last season. Just wipe your hands on the trousers and get going. The idea is a massive hit, proven by the fact that the pants sold out faster than you can finish a packet of Cheetos. Designed to enhance your snackability, the orange Cheetos pants are made with a special towel-like patch over the pockets on either side, where you can wipe your fingertips without leaving a trace. The pant is so truly matched with the color of these corn-cheese puffs that you can easily dunk your fingers in the bag of Cheetos, eat, wipe the dust on your thighs, and continue binge-watching the reels – all without leaving an orange trail on the phone. If you have some left over in the bag, you can fold and deposit it into a special side pocket made especially for it. Designer: Cheetos Launched on April 7, a week after the Fool’s Day, to avoid being mistaken for a prank, the Cheetos Pants sold out within days. But there’s still an option for you and me, if we want to take it (more on that later). Designed for Cheetos fans without easy access to tissues or a faucet (or simply lacking the urge to get up and clean their hands), the pants offer a solution: wipe those fingertips with cheesy crumbs directly on them so that you can save your couch cushions and game controllers from orange stains. As mentioned, the peculiarity is that the pant is so perfectly matched to the exact shade of iconic orange Cheetos dust that no matter how much you wipe, no one will ever know. This is possible with the towel-like material patch on a pair of cotton pants: A perfect rubaway for your Cheetle-covered fingertips. Released with the motto “Pants stand out, Cheetos blends in,” it is made by Frito-Lay in collaboration with Impact BBDO in the Middle East and New York, with pockets to accommodate small and larger bags of Cheetos so you know where to eat from when you feel the need. Cheetospants.com – from where the pants (in sizes XXS-3XL) were available – show the pants designed to wipe Cheetle-covered fingers are currently out of stock – no wonder. Fans having lost the first opportunity to scoop a pair can access a global collection of all near-exact orange pants from shoppable internet that the brand has selected and made available. Look up, find your favorite orange pants from an array of silhouettes and you have your pair – will that have the cleaning patch, we are guessing no!",
