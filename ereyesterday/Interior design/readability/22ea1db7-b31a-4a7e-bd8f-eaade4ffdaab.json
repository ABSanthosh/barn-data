  "text": "One of the favorite places that I go to whenever I fly to Singapore is Holland Village. It represents a territory of mixed cultures, a village open to world travelers who, for a time or forever, have stopped in this Southeast Asian country. Each visitor imports a fragment of diversity that contributes to an eclectic and harmonious identity in perpetual evolution, whose Peranakan roots find contemporary expression through thoughtful design interventions like this new furniture collection. Tommy Cheong’s Sampan furniture collection beautifully captures the essence of traditional Asian watercraft and transforms it into contemporary urban seating designed specifically for Holland Village. This innovative design concept draws inspiration from the iconic sampan boats that have navigated Asian waters for centuries, creating a stunning fusion of cultural heritage and modern functionality that celebrates Singapore’s multicultural identity. Designer: Tommy Cheong The Sampan benches serve as a tribute to this spirit of welcome, to the emulation felt by all travelers discovering a culture that they will end up making their own. Like boats approaching a new land, these benches participate in the dynamics of the place and the flow of passersby. They create an invitation to rest for a moment, enjoy the urban landscape, discuss and exchange perspectives from different cultural backgrounds. They are able to translate the essential characteristics of traditional boats into functional furniture that speaks to the country’s maritime heritage. Cut from slatted blocks of Tembusu wood, their oiled surface recalls the decks of the first boats that docked on the shores of Singapore. This material choice is particularly meaningful, as Tembusu is a native Southeast Asian hardwood known for its durability and beautiful grain patterns. The construction process showcases meticulous attention to detail, with each piece carefully shaped using traditional woodworking techniques. The wooden tops celebrate the natural beauty of the material, while the colorful lacquered sides available in rich terracotta red and deep ocean blue express the diversity of origins that make up the local culture. Each wooden surface is carefully sanded and finished to achieve the perfect curve that defines the sampan’s distinctive profile. The benches come in three different sizes, allowing for flexible arrangements that can respond to various spatial needs. Arranged in the form of a swarm, both organized and chaotic, they adapt to the nature of the place, in greater or lesser concentration depending on the environment and its requirements. The modular design allows for creative configurations that can transform public spaces into dynamic social environments. Whether clustered together to create intimate conversation areas or spread out to provide individual contemplation spots, the benches invite people to sit, rest, and connect with others while experiencing the multicultural tapestry of Holland Village.",
