  "text": "During days when it’s too hot to drink hot coffee (although oftentimes that doesn’t really stop me), cold brew coffee is my coffee of choice. There are a lot of tools out there to do this kind of drink on your own if you don’t want to buy from the nearest coffee shop. Cold brewing tea is also a good way to drink the other caffeinated favorite. It brings out different flavor profiles compared to hot brewing. However, there are fewer options for cold brewing tea and more often than not, some people resort to just using empty bottles or coffee cold brewers. Designer: Pratt Institute The Pendulum Brew is a cold brew tea maker that brings a fresh perspective on brewing our favorite leafy beverage in terms of design and functionality. The inspiration comes from the traditional tea ceremonies of China and Japan and also the visualization comes from the passage of time. They wanted to create a visually appealing tool that does its job (which is basically to brew tea) so that the long waiting time and monotonous experience will be lessened as you look at the brewer. The asymmetrical design also adds to the aesthetic, giving it a “dynamic, diving sensation”. As its name says, this brewer has a pendulum effect with a transparent container so you can see the entire brewing process. There is also an ice container so you can place cubes and when they melt, the ice water drips into the tea chamber below since there are small holes in it. This is useful for when you don’t want to refrigerate it so you can just add ice any time to cool the tea. This last step of adding ice is for when you have time to observe the entire brewing process and to swing the pendulum, so to speak. But if you don’t have time, you can just stick to adding the tea leaves and water then refrigerate it. The Pendulum Brew by Pratt Institute offers a compelling alternative to conventional cold brew methods, ingeniously blending the art of tea ceremony with the science of infusion. Its captivating pendulum mechanism and integrated ice container not only promise a visually engaging brewing experience but also a practical solution for enjoying perfectly chilled tea. Whether you have the leisure to observe the hypnotic swing or need a quick set-up for refrigeration, this tea maker appears to cater to different lifestyles, solidifying its position as an innovative and aesthetically pleasing tool for any tea enthusiast seeking to explore the refreshing world of cold brew.",
