  "text": "Rolls-Royce Motor Cars introduced two bespoke Phantom Dragon editions, marking the close of the lunar Year of the Dragon and the beginning of the Phantom’s 100th year. These exclusive commissions combine cultural symbolism with the detailed craftsmanship of Rolls-Royce’s Bespoke Collective, creating a design narrative that honors Chinese traditions within a global luxury framework. Designer: Rolls-Royce A Contemporary Interpretation of the Dragon The Phantom Dragon editions represent a modern reimagining of one of the most powerful symbols in Chinese culture. The dragon, emblematic of strength, prosperity, and wisdom, is intricately integrated into the design language of these vehicles. This integration extends across interior elements, exterior aesthetics, and bespoke details, creating a seamless fusion of tradition and modernity. Phantom Dragon – United States Edition The United States edition, available exclusively through Rolls-Royce Motor Cars Orange County, exudes subtle sophistication. The dragon motif is skillfully embroidered onto all four headrests using Phoenix Red stitching, contrasting beautifully with the available Black or White leather upholstery. Each dragon requires precise alignment of 5,449 individual stitches, taking over 20 hours to complete. This intricate process reflects the painstaking attention to detail that defines Rolls-Royce’s approach to bespoke design. The vehicle’s rear Piano Black picnic tables feature a minimalist stainless steel inlay of the Chinese zodiac calendar. The Bespoke Starlight Headliner, a hallmark of Rolls-Royce, depicts an abstract dragon motif created with 677 individually placed fiber-optic lights. This artistic ceiling feature took artisans over three months to develop, adding an ethereal touch to the cabin’s ambiance. On the exterior, a Phoenix Red coachline incorporating a subtle dragon motif runs along the vehicle’s side, oriented to face East—symbolizing the direction of the rising sun. The dynamic Cherry Red and Crystal finish color palette further accentuates the car’s elegant silhouette, underscoring its bespoke identity. Phantom Dragon – China Edition For the China-exclusive edition, Rolls-Royce draws inspiration from the ancient legend of two dragons safeguarding a pearl. This cultural motif is reflected in the design elements, weaving a narrative of protection and prosperity. The rear picnic tables feature a stainless steel inlay of the Chinese zodiac calendar, with the dragon highlighted in gold. Traditional Chinese calligraphy further enriches the design, marking each year’s corresponding animal. The centerpiece of this edition’s interior is the Gallery, an intricate marquetry composition crafted from 297 individual pieces of wood. It depicts two dragons amidst swirling clouds guarding a pearl. This elaborate work required three months of dedicated craftsmanship, underscoring Rolls-Royce’s mastery of detail. The Starlight Headliner in the China edition features 768 red and 576 white fiber-optic lights, creating a luminous abstract of two dragons intertwined. Complemented by 24 shooting stars, this celestial display celebrates heritage and is a testament to Rolls-Royce’s innovative design capabilities. Honoring the Centenary of Phantom These bespoke commissions mark a milestone in Rolls-Royce’s storied history, showcasing the dragon’s artistry and symbolism. The Phantom Dragon editions embody the artistry, heritage, and forward-thinking vision that define the Phantom’s legacy. By combining traditional motifs with cutting-edge craftsmanship, Rolls-Royce invites its discerning clientele to experience a piece of automotive history imbued with cultural depth. Rebecca Davies, Bespoke Designer at Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, explains, “Our goal was to create a modern interpretation capturing the dragon’s essence as a symbol of power. The design conveys motion and energy, expressing the dragon as a driving force with depth and complexity reflecting its commanding presence.” As Rolls-Royce begins its centenary celebrations, the Phantom Dragon editions stand as an extraordinary testament to the brand’s unwavering dedication to craftsmanship and cultural storytelling. These vehicles not only honor the past but also set a bold precedent for the next chapter of Phantom’s illustrious journey.",
