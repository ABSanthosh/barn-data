  "text": "Every square inch of the Amber Apartment—designed by Marta Terekh—radiates warmth and elegance. This studio apartment transforms compact living into an art form. You can find golden hues, sleek modern finishes, and cozy corners that will basically feel like an embrace. This golden retreat offers the best of modern living! The Amber Apartment smartly segregates spaces—even while keeping them all together. The bedroom is partitioned with an opaque amber curtain, which provides optimal privacy. On the other end is a cozy white bed, comfy enough to spend the night in. The entertainment complex in the living room is incredibly compact and sleek. Right next to it, the same light oakwood continues into the workstation. After all, work and entertainment do go side by side!  The coffee table next to the amber sofa is unique. It provides room to store two extra seats, in case you’re expecting guests and need to pull them out. Behind the sofa is the kitchen island. This uses glass blocks—and houses a tinted vase—so easily doubles as a decorative partition. The kitchen in the Amber Apartment features a classic grid backsplash. This is minimal, but makes sure to keep the visual interest intact. The cabinetry is smooth and sleek, and appliances are built into their designated spots. The amber bar stools make sure to keep the decor around the apartment cohesive. Right next to the entryway is some built-in storage. You can hang your coat on the hook or use the closed drawer to toss in your shoes. Above the drawer is a cushion—so you can have a quick seat while tying those laces. The Amber Apartment shows us how even the smallest spaces can offer all types of functionality, and with style! Finally, the bathroom. This uses classic grid tiles, a wall-mounted toilet, and a compact golden vanity. The ring light illuminates the space well for makeup sessions.",
