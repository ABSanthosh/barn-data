  "description": "This folding Z-Down chair is by 20th-century Danish furniture designer Erik Magnussen. Magnussen ingeniously figured out how to create the form using just two pieces of bent tubing and two connectors, with the leather seat and backrest slung between them. It is the leather that holds the chair together; sitting in puts the leather in tension and creates a bit of springiness, as you can see in the video below. Shortly after its design in 1968, the chair went into production by Danish manufacturer Torben Ørskov. It continued to sell throughout the 1970s before eventually being discontinued. Today they fetch a pretty penny on secondhand sites.",
