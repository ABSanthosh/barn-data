  "text": "Designed by Rover Tiny Homes, the Cortes is a spacious and comfortable full-time residence with two downstairs bedrooms and a large living room. It measures around 38 feet in length and is equipped with three slide-out sections, which expand the already impressive floor space. The home is based on a triple-axle trailer, and weighs around 20,000 lb, making it quite a hefty tiny home. It will have to be delivered and isn’t the best fit for regular towing. The tiny house is finished in hardwearing metal siding and is topped off with a metal roof. Designer: Rover Tiny Homes The Cortes tiny home features three manually operated slide-out sections, also known as bump-outs, as mentioned before. To extend these sections, a hand crank is used to push them out. Since the house isn’t supposed to be moved around a lot, this manual operation won’t be much of an inconvenience. Once the sections have been expanded, the total floor space increases quite a bit – from 304 square feet to 374 square feet. This expanded space benefits the living room and bedrooms. The living room is filled with natural light thanks to some generous glazing. It includes a comfortable sofa and additional seating, making it a welcoming area for relaxation or entertaining guests. The bedrooms are located on the ground floor, and they offer ample headroom, allowing residents to stand comfortably. The master bedroom features a double bed, while the second bedroom is equipped with a single bed, making it suitable for guests or children. Thr bedrooms are thoughtfully designed with built-in storage space, maximizing the functionality and organization within the limited area. These clever and nifty features make the tiny home a practical and comfortable residence, providing ample living space and storage. The kitchen is located next to the living room, and it is quite well-designed and stocked with an oven and stove, a fridge/freezer, washer/dryer, a dishwasher, and a breakfast bar for two. The space is also equipped with loads of cabinetry and storage space, making it a thoughtfully-designed and well-furnished room. The bathroom is also nearby, and it is furnished with a shower/bath, which isn’t commonly seen in a tiny home. It also includes a flushing toilet and a vanity sink. Besides the main living areas and the two ground-floor bedrooms, the tiny house also includes a third, smaller bedroom, which offers additional flexibility in its use. This room is intended to be a typical loft space with a low ceiling, which creates a cozy and intimate atmosphere. The loft is accessible via a sturdy ladder located conveniently in the kitchen area, allowing for easy access without taking up much floor space. The Cortes is currently priced at around US$125,000.",
