  "text": "DSLR cameras have evolved from their bulky forms into compact versions, that are now superseded by mirrorless versions that are more consumer-oriented. If you are someone who is a social butterfly, chances are you need high-resolution photo and video shooting equipment handy at all times. Sure, smartphones are the best bet when it comes to quick reels or IG-worthy stories, still they cannot match the details of DSLR or mirrorless shooters. Traditionally both these versions have an optical viewfinder to shoot the subject in the frame. Now, a designer has taken a completely different approach to what a camera should be like. Designer: Yasuaki Matsuura This is the Eye to Eye camera that takes a completely radical approach to digital photography both in form and function. Right where you would find the viewfinder and the lens of the digital camera, this one has a flush hollow part that lets the shooter see the subject without anything in between. This creates a direct eye-to-eye between the photographer and the subject right at the moment of capture. More than a mere gimmick, the digital camera actually shoots photographs. According to Yasuaki, the idea is to create a deeper connection between the two individuals and also let them be more aware of their visual surroundings. Since the subject knows the human eye instead of a lens looking straight him/her in the eye, the final shot has a more engaging emotion to it. Itâ€™s beyond just the digital recording or picture shooting moment, staying as a cherished memory. This interesting gadget is a part of his art series, and a limited edition artwork that we are sure will have more interesting things to follow. The in-person interaction of this interesting digital camera can be a bit too much for shy individuals, however, more confident people can take advantage of this unique proposition.",
