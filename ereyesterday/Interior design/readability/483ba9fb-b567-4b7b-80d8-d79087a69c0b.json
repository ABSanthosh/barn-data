  "description": "At first glance, this appears to be some sort of vintage display case. In fact, it's a window-mounted birdhouse. You install it like a window A/C and load it with feed, and then you've got something like an aquarium for birds.I like the end result that they're selling—you get to check out birds up close, binoculars-free—but am puzzled that the unit doesn't seal from the outside. That access hole is permanently open. It does open wider so you can more easily clean the thing out (from the outside of your house). The only interface on the interior is the lid up top, which covers the refill hole. With no way to keep rain out of this thing, I can't imagine it would last long. Nevertheless, manufacturer Coveside Conservation Products, which makes wildlife feeders and habitats, has mass distribution; this item is sold at Lowe's, for $165.",
