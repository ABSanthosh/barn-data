  "description": "Some luxury automakers, like Lexus, offer built-in sun shades that you can slide up to cover the side windows. For those with cars lacking this feature, the only option has been to deal with janky aftermarket offerings that rely on suction cups. From Australia, a country well familiar with sun-baked car interiors, comes these SnapShades. These are model-specific and feature metal frames with integrated neodymium magnets; they not only fit your car perfectly, but simply magnetically cling to your car's existing windowframes. They're made of thin \"memory steel\" and can be folded away when not in use. Perfect fit, easy installation, can even roll the windows down They also make opaque windshield models for when you're parked. The company offers units that will fit over 200 different car, SUV and truck models across 69 automakers. You can check for your vehicle on their website. Prices obviously vary by model, but start around USD $36 per window and $52 per pair. The windshield versions start around USD $105.",
