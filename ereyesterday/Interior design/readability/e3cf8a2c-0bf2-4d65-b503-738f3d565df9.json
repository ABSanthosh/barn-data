  "description": "In the U.S., approximately 30-40% of the food supply is wasted. This translates to about 133 billion pounds of food each year, with fruits and vegetables accounting for around 40% of that waste. The phrase \"One bad apple spoils the whole bunch\" literally refers to the fact that a single rotting apple can quickly contaminate other apples in a group. This is not due to any morally bankrupt behavior on the part of the apples, but rather that rotting apples produce ethylene gas, which hastens the ripening and decay of nearby apples. Storing fruits in a bowl can trap ethylene gas, which can lead to over ripening and spoiling of a whole bowl of fruit. Designer Agota Jonas wanted to create a better fruit bowl, to try to solve this problem. She literally turned the bowl inside out, and created the Fruitbridge. Most fruits are round, and like trees, the Fruitbridge gently holds them with minimum contact, keeping fruit apart from each other and allowing air to circulate freely.These fruit stands are made of food-grade stainless steel, using low-energy fabricating methods: laser cutting, cold rolling, and hand finishing. Material is not wasted. Leftover pieces are reused for other small products such as tealight holders and keychains.Sold in variations holding two or three rows of fruit, the Fruitbridge is avaialble directly from the Lucky Round Avocado website.",
