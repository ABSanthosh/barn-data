All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: John Keeble / Getty ImagesThe kitchen is the heart of the home, and it’s essential to keep it looking (and, more importantly, functioning) at its best. However, each year — and practically every season — brings new design trends that grab the attention of homeowners, contractors, and interior designers alike. But as trends come and go, it’s important to know which ones are on their way in and which are on their way out.To get the latest insights, I asked experienced carpenters and contractors who revealed which kitchen cabinet design trends are losing steam this year. From excessive embellishments to cold, sterile color schemes, their insights will help you steer clear of outdated styles during your next kitchen renovation. Even better, they’ve offered some timeless alternative design ideas, ensuring your kitchen stays stylish and functional for years to come.5 Outdated Kitchen Cabinet Design TrendsCredit: Artazum / Shutterstock1. Arched Cabinet DoorsMinimalist aesthetics continue to grow in popularity, and while arched cabinet doors used to add a touch of classic elegance, they now look a bit over the top, especially compared with today’s streamlined interiors. “Consumers are looking for easy-to-clean, functional, modern cabinets that will stand the test of time,” says Cathleen Ryan, interior designer and design manager at Country Kitchens. “Arches are difficult to clean and tend to remind you more of medieval castles than a home in the 21st century. Going for simpler patterns like shaker doors or recessed designs can help to keep things looking and feeling neat and clean.” Credit: fcafotodigital / Getty Images2. Cabinets Without Built-in Accessories Homeowners are prioritizing functionality and organization when it comes to all aspects of kitchen design, the experts say. Traditional cabinets without features like pull-out shelves, built-in spice racks, or integrated dividers can make spaces feel cluttered, messy, or just flat-out unorganized. “Features like a built-in trash pull-out, an EZ-lift for your mixer, or pull-out assemblies under the sink make the kitchen much more functional, compared with basic interiors with just shelves,” explains Jordan Guthrie, owner of Stroub Construction. Built-in accessories not only maximize storage potential (yes, please!) but also create a more seamless design overall.Credit: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock3. All-Gray Kitchens“Single-color designs are on their way out as the recent uprise in all-gray (and all-white for that matter) spaces has people craving color, texture, and more joy-filled looks in their homes to contrast the dark moodiness of gray,” Ryan says. While this hue was formerly a hallmark of sleek, modern design, homeowners now feel entirely gray kitchens can be a bit cold and drab. “If you already went all-in on the gray trend, consider updating it by changing your paint color (think bright, contrasting hues), adding a statement backsplash, bringing in pops of colors with your appliances and accessories like lighting, decorative items, etc., and brightening the space with new flooring,” she suggests. Credit: chandlerphoto / Getty Images4. Oak Cabinets with Golden or Honey Wood TonesUnfortunately, oak cabinets — specifically with golden or honey finishes — can make a kitchen look dated. “It was a hot trend in the 1980s and 1990s, however, today this look feels old and heavy,” says Yaeir Moinzadeh, contractor and owner of Blue Rise Baltimore Roofing. “Oak cabinets can be refinished with a much lighter and neutral shade to give them a more updated look.” The experts suggest opting for ones that feature cleaner lines, sleek finishes, and neutral or white hues. However, if you want to stick with warm wood, choose something with chestnut, walnut, or smoky undertones instead.Credit: TerryJ / Getty Images5. Carved Details and Moldings on Cabinet DoorsI’m so sorry to say, but cabinets with intricate designs aren’t as hip as they once were. Yes, they can add a decorative touch, but the designs are just too dated (and hard to clean!). “Nowadays, cleaner lines are preferred over those heavily embellished cabinet fronts that have been ruled as fussy and old-fashioned,” Moinzadeh explains. “In fact, simplifying cabinet fronts can make kitchens feel larger and more modern.” 4 Timeless Kitchen Cabinet Design TrendsNow that the pros have covered which designs are out, here’s what’s in.1. Integrated AppliancesThe idea of integrated appliances lies in the concept that less is more. Concealing appliances like refrigerators, dishwashers, and ovens behind custom cabinet panels will give any kitchen an uncluttered appearance. Essentially, this approach allows the cabinetry to take center stage while still emphasizing practicality. For an even more seamless look, Moinzadeh suggests adding under-cabinet lighting for a modern touch.2. Shaker-Style Cabinet Doors According to Costell and Ryan, shaker-style cabinet doors are still very popular among homeowners. Characterized by a flat center panel and square edges, these doors offer a minimalist look that suits both traditional and modern kitchens. Plus, this versatility lets them blend with tons of design elements, from rustic wood finishes to sleek, painted surfaces. The best part? Shaker-style cabinets are super durable and easy to maintain.3. Conversion Varnish Finish with Brush StrokesLooking for something with more character? “One trend I’m seeing is using a conversion varnish finish with brush strokes after spray application,” Guthrie explains. “This allows for easy in-the-field touch-ups over the years, keeping your cabinetry looking as fresh as it did on day one of your renovation.” This finish is ideal for homeowners who want a bit more of a traditional or custom look since it’s able to really highlight the craftsmanship behind the cabinetry. It’s worth noting that while brushstrokes might show off the wood grain better, they’re less suited for more modern designs. However, it’s all up to personal preferences.4. Natural Wood Tones and Simple HuesAt the end of the day, simplicity is key. Natural wood tones and simple hues are truly timeless. Natural wood cabinets are authentic and cozy, whether they’re in a rustic farmhouse or a more modern, minimalist space. What’s more, the neutral palette of simple hues (think whites, grays, and soft earth tones) can complement the natural grain of the wood. These colors and finishes also offer great design flexibility, making it easy to update or refresh the space. “The most important factor here is to stay true to yourself and your likes and dislikes because at the end of the day, this is going to be in your home for you to enjoy, and should be a space that makes you feel happy and comfortable,” Ryan adds.Do any of these incoming or outgoing kitchen cabinet trends surprise you?
