For years, we’ve been forced to choose between ridiculously priced Apple Watches with their walled garden or budget options that feel like Fisher-Price toys strapped to our wrists. Then along comes Nothing, Carl Pei’s rebellious tech outfit, with their CMF sub-brand that’s been quietly redefining what “budget” should mean. Their latest offering, the CMF Watch Pro 3, might just be the sweet spot many of us have been waiting for, a $79 smartwatch that doesn’t look or feel like a compromise, undercutting even our expectations of what a sub-$100 wearable can deliver. The CMF Watch Pro 3 represents Nothing’s design philosophy distilled into wearable form: simplicity with personality, functionality without unnecessary frills, and quality materials that belie the price point. Nothing has always understood that good design isn’t about cramming in features or mimicking competitors; it’s about making intentional choices that enhance the user experience. This watch embodies that ethos perfectly, bringing substantial upgrades over its predecessor while maintaining an accessible price point that makes premium smartwatch features available to the masses. Designer: CMF by Nothing The first thing you’ll notice about the Watch Pro 3 is its gorgeous 1.43-inch AMOLED display with a crisp 466 x 466 resolution. While the 675 nits of brightness might struggle slightly in direct sunlight, it’s more than adequate for most daily situations. Nothing has opted for a cleaner approach this time around, with a metal case featuring flat frames available in light gray, dark gray, or the signature Nothing-esque orange accents that stand out in a sea of boring black wearables. The IP68 water resistance rating means you’re protected against splashes and rain, though Nothing doesn’t officially recommend taking it swimming. The minimalist aesthetic carries through the UI as well, with clean typography and a library of over 120 watch faces to personalize your experience. Battery life has always been the Achilles heel of smartwatches, forcing users into nightly charging rituals that feel like technological handcuffs. The CMF Watch Pro 3 breaks those chains with up to 13 days of battery life under normal use, and an astounding 60 days when power-saving mode is activated. This performance comes courtesy of a 350 mAh battery that punches well above its weight class. For context, that’s roughly three times what you’d get from an Apple Watch or Galaxy Watch under normal use. The extended battery life fundamentally changes how you interact with a smartwatch, transforming it from another device that demands daily attention to something that quietly serves you without constant maintenance. Under the hood, Nothing has equipped the Watch Pro 3 with a heart rate monitor and SpO2 sensor for basic health tracking. While not as comprehensive as some premium offerings, these sensors cover the essentials that most users actually care about. The watch supports 131 sports modes with automatic recognition for popular activities like running and cycling. The integrated GPS module is particularly impressive at this price point, providing route tracking without needing to carry your phone. This feature alone typically adds $50+ to the price of competing smartwatches, making its inclusion here remarkable. The watch also counts steps, monitors calories burned, and can be set to provide hydration and wake-up reminders to keep you on track throughout your day. What truly separates Nothing’s approach from other budget wearables is the attention to software experience and cross-platform compatibility. The CMF Watch Pro 3 works with both Android and iOS devices, a flexibility that many competitors lack. The inclusion of speakers and microphones for Bluetooth calling functionality allows you to take calls directly from your wrist when your phone is nearby. The companion app is clean, intuitive, and refreshingly free of the subscription paywalls that have infected much of the wearable ecosystem. Nothing has built a reputation for consistent firmware updates that actually improve functionality over time, suggesting the Watch Pro 3 will get better with age rather than becoming obsolete shortly after purchase. At just $79, the CMF Watch Pro 3 represents an almost unreasonable value proposition in today’s market. It outperforms competitors at twice the price while maintaining the distinctive design language that has made Nothing a darling of the tech design community. Carl Pei’s vision of creating products that challenge industry norms without bankrupting consumers continues to materialize in meaningful ways. The Watch Pro 3 isn’t trying to be an Apple Watch killer; it’s carving its own path by focusing on what actually matters to users: battery life, display quality, fitness tracking, and thoughtful design. For anyone seeking a capable smartwatch without the premium price tag, the CMF Watch Pro 3 isn’t merely a viable option; it’s rapidly becoming the obvious choice in a crowded market of overpriced alternatives.",
