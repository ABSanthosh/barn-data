While we’re waiting on our new rug and the final living room pieces (can’t wait to share that with you soon!), I took a little time this week to putter and play with some cottage-style pillow pairings and a cozy new throw—just in time for spring and summer. It’s amazing how a few new pillows can totally refresh a space! Today I’m sharing how I mix and match colors and charming patterns for a fresh seasonal look, featuring a few new finds from Pottery Barn.  Sources: Sofa // Throw Blanket in Cool Multi Color // Pillow middle of sofa I’m loving our new sofa! I’ve been so excited to start styling it in this space, so it was such a treat to finally play around a bit (I can’t wait to see everything come together once the rest arrives!). Sources: Pillow far left of sofa // Pillow middle of sofa // Pillow far right of sofa // Throw Blanket in Cool Multi Color The classic stripe makes it so easy to mix and match—there are endless ways to pair colors and patterns with it to create a fresh mood for each season. I’m already dreaming up combos for fall and winter too! Sources: Pillow middle of sofa // Throw Blanket in Cool Multi Color Pottery Barn always has so many really beautiful pillows and throws. They make it easy to gather a collection you’ll love mixing and matching with for years to come! I couldn’t resist trying out a few florals for my striped sofa. Pillows on bench: Linen Piped Pillow (Flax/Chambray/Ivory color) // Floral Reversible Pillow // Teal Embroidered Pillow Each of these are so pretty on their own–and every combination is so charming together. Several of them are reversible, too, which offers even more options! You know how much I love easy opportunities to refresh a room. Even if you have a smaller space like I do, you can have fun with decorating in every season. Pillows on bench: Linen Piped Pillow (Flax/Chambray/Ivory color) // Floral Reversible Pillow // Teal Embroidered Pillow Sticking to a cohesive color palette while adding a few different scales for your patterns really makes it easy to mix and match. You can also add in some solids too so you can have different looks all season long and into the next season, too! Pattern Mixing Design Tip I love the beautiful linen pillow on the built in bench in the living room that has a soft white on one side and a taupe on the other. Don’t you just love seeing the pattern peeking out from the back of a pillow and the reverse of the throw blanket, too? SOOOO cute! Pattern on the backside of a pillow is a special design detail I always love. It definitely adds character to the room. Plus if you have pets, a husband or kids who may toss pillows on the floor or move them around, with a reversible pillow they will always look nice no matter which way they put them :). Pillow Above (reversible) Pillow Above (reversible) I also recently bought the pretty red floral pillow (and darling stripe on the reverse!) you can see in the background on the bench in my dining room. Now that we have two built in benches we have lots of spots for pillows! I sense more pillow pairings in my future. Happy spring decorating!
