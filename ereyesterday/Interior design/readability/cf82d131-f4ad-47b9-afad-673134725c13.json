Some people welcome spring the moment Christmas decorations come down, while others wait for the first warm day to confirm that yes, spring is actually here. There’s no need to rush when swapping seasonal items of course, but there’s also no harm in starting early. The key is recognizing when your surroundings, and your mindset, begin to shift, so here are some things to consider when deciding if you think it’s time to break out the brighter decor. When the Light Changes Spring starts slowly. The days stretch longer, and the light has a different quality—softer, warmer, more inviting. You might notice golden hues in the afternoon or how the sun lingers a little later each evening. That’s a natural cue to bring in lighter fabrics, open up the curtains, and introduce colors that better complement this type of lighting. Even swapping out heavy blankets for thinner ones can shift the mood toward greener days. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Satura_ When You Feel Restless Winter has a way of making people feel a little stuck. The cold, snow, and lack of greenery leave us less motivated to go out and do things, so we often end up spending more hours indoors during winter months. If you find yourself itching for a change, be it rearranging furniture, cleaning out closets, or craving fresh air, you’re probably ready for spring. Follow those urges, let yourself experiment. Refreshing your space is the perfect way to welcome the season of renewal. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Satura_ When Nature Gives the First Sign Even if the calendar says it’s still winter, nature knows better. The first green shoots, birds returning, or even the smell of damp earth after a rain—these are all signs that the season is shifting. Pay attention to them. Bringing in houseplants, opening windows, or using floral-scented candles can connect your home to what’s happening outside. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Shaiith When Spring Clothes Start Calling One of the most overlooked signs? Your closet. When you start reaching for lighter jackets, softer colors, or sneakers instead of boots, your brain is already in spring mode. The same instinct that has you putting away thick sweaters can guide you in your decorating. Lighter fabrics, floral prints, and natural textures in your home will feel just as refreshing as the call of spring outside. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / leungchopan When The Mood Needs Shifting Sometimes, the need for a seasonal change has nothing to do with the weather. If life feels stagnant or overwhelming (no matter the season, really), a change in your environment can help. This feeling of stagnation just so happens to be often felt during the last few throes of winter. Spring decorating is just as much about energy as it is about aesthetics, so if you’re feeling dreary, don’t be afraid to pull out the brighter decor a few weeks early. If it’ll boost your mood, it’s worth it. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Sonyachny There’s no “right” time to decorate for spring, or any season for that matter, only the right time for you. Whether you start as soon as the holiday decorations come down or wait until the first real warm day, just trust your instincts and you’ll be alright. Spring will come regardless, so whether you decorate while we’re still firmly in winter or wait until all the snow has melted, you and your home will be ready for it.
