  "text": "Elif Bulut’s modern vintage alarm clock and wristwatchElif Bulut conceptualizes a modern vintage alarm clock and wristwatch that uses orbs rolling around the dials to tell time. It’s a minimalist accessory, with mainly steel and plastic as the primary parts. The soft-squared dial is forged from metal, carved with deep lines that follow the form of the timepiece to create the sense of infinity and for time-telling. This design approach is similar to the style of the raked patterns found in Japanese Zen gardens.In this case, the orbs that spin around the dial proceed with their rounds, still following the 12-o’clock forms of the conventional, analog alarm clocks and wristwatches. To distinguish which orb tells the hour and the minutes, they’re positioned on top of the other: the sphere in the first line from the center is the hour, while the orb in the second line informs the minutes. The industrial designer hasn’t shared yet how the user can adjust the time, but there’s a large knob on the side of the wristwatch to set the hours and minutes. It gives the impression then that the orbs may either be magnetic or have a mechanism that pins them down to the dial, so they can move around.all images courtesy of Elif BulutBrushed metal bodies and rolling orbs for the concept watchesAfter the brushed metal frame and casing of the modern vintage alarm clock and wristwatch, the plastic material emerges as the bands of the timepiece. However, they resemble more of a silicone than plastic, which can make it more elastic and skin-friendly to the wearer. For the alarm clock, there are no straps available. Not even a chain there is, but in case the designer plans to add it, users then can wear it like a necklace or treat it like a pocket watch. The modern vintage alarm clock shares the same design features as its wristwatch sibling. They both have brushed metal casings and bodies, as well as orbs that roam around the dial, but the alarm clock has two semi-squared bells on top. Between these sits a small metal hammer that rings the two bells when the time is up. These small gongs may double as the alarm and time adjustment because the designer has yet to place any buttons or levers behind the accessory. , and so far, Elif Bulut’s modern vintage alarm clock and wristwatch are still a concept.the wristwatch have straps made of ‘plastic’ or silicone-looking materialthe rolling orbs are used to tell timethe ‘hour’ orb spins around the first line from the center of the wristwatchthe straps may also be interchangeableso far, these accessories are still a concept",
