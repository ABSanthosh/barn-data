  "description": "Summer's almost here. Bote, a company that makes \"water lifestyle products,\" has a line of floating furniture for when you want to hang out in the drink. Each feature their \"Magnepod\" system, whereby you can magnetically attach the company's drinkware to the furniture. And because they're all inflatable, they break down for storage, making them easy to toss into car trunks and backpacks. Their Sling Chair seats one: Their Hangout Couch can seat three, and can be attached to create a floating conversation dock: And their circular Hammock series can seat a variable number. They come in 7', 10' and 15' diameters: Sure you can use these in a pool, but these look more at home in a proper body of water. Meaning yeah, you'll need that boat. The real move is to simply know someone who owns one. I hear the best two days of owning a boat, are the day you buy it, and the day you sell it.",
