  "text": "Designed by Heatherwick Studio, the Hatai reimagines a vital corner of Bangkok through the poetry of architecture and tradition. Rising from the site of the original Narai Hotel, this development will introduce two hotels—Six Senses and Narai Hotel—within a 10,500-square-metre composition. Here, lantern-like towers emerge as sculptural icons, their softly stacked forms referencing the warmth of classic Thai craftsmanship. The silhouette, undeniably bold yet gentle, offers an antidote to the severity of Bangkok’s more anonymous towers, promising a softer skyline and a new sense of public belonging. At the ground level, Hatai unfolds as a public village: plazas shaded by the lanterns above, native plantings, a shrine, and an open-air market coexist with a restored canal. This network of walkways and communal spaces isn’t just a gesture—it’s a vibrant invitation for the city to gather, linger, and reconnect. By restoring the canal and carving out public thoroughfares, Heatherwick Studio infuses the site with the fluidity and openness at the heart of Thai urban life, giving the city back a piece of itself in the process. Designer: Heatherwick Studio The design’s most memorable move is its explicit homage to traditional Thai lanterns. These towers aren’t ordinary buildings—they are luminous markers, each layer echoing the delicacy of paper and bamboo, the glow of celebration. The intention is clear: to build in a way that honors local heritage, while also stitching new stories and public experiences into the city’s fabric. The rounded, stacked forms do more than catch the light; they invite participation and create moments of shelter, shade, and surprise. For Heatherwick Studio, Hatai is more than a debut in Thailand. It’s a statement on the future of urban hospitality and placemaking. By integrating commerce, community, and landscape within a single, expressive form, the project aspires to dissolve boundaries between inside and out, guest and local, old and new. The plaza, with its open-air market and event spaces, will be a hub for both travelers and Bangkok residents—a space animated by daily life and tradition, not just hotel guests. The Hatai’s ambition extends beyond aesthetics. Hatai aims to restore detail, emotion, and narrative to a city too often shaped by the blankness of modern development. Thomas Heatherwick’s vision is to reconnect the built environment with the richness of Thai culture, creating not just a destination but a story that belongs to Bangkok. By referencing the country’s heritage in every gesture—from the lantern motif to the canal’s return—Hatai offers a new model for how global design can root itself in local meaning. When it opens in 2027, Hatai will stand as an example of design as a cultural bridge and urban catalyst. It brings warmth, memory, and community back to the city’s core, proving that the best architecture is both a reflection and a celebration of its place.",
