  "text": "For us, a good home should always have some colour. It doesn’t have to be floor to ceiling — it’s about quality over quantity. This is something that unites many of the homes and places we put together for Issue 02 of The Design Files Magazine! Take our cover story, a designer’s 40-square-metre Melbourne apartment that shows how to live large in a small space, with bold accents and a glossy chartreuse front door. We visit plenty of other incredible homes across Australia too, including the idyllic Byron home of graphic designer Holly McCauley and filmmaker Nich Zalmstra; a charming yellow Sydney terrace; and Cungelella artist Glenda McCulloch’s sentimental family home in outback Queensland! Plus, see an elegant Edwardian reimagined by the incredible Flack Studio, and a special feature exploring the fight to save Victoria’s public housing towers. Issue 02 has even more pages than the last (192 to be exact), so there’s plenty more interiors, architecture, gardens, styled shoots, and creatives to read about inside. You can now pre-order the magazine here to get your hands on it before anyone else! Or, Issue 02 will be available in stockists nationwide from April 14.
