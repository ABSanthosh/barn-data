While a very small detail, a kitchen towel (sometimes called a tea towel) is the sort of element that can take a ho-hum room to one that feels warm, welcoming, and complete. But while I could extol the virtues of the humble tea towel all day, I admit I don’t think very much about how they are displayed. I’m a hang-it-over-the-oven-door-handle kind of person. And while that’s a tried-and-true, simple way to display your favorite cooking textile, it’s come to my attention quite recently that it’s not the only way. And I think this new way is going to be the only way I hang my kitchen towels from now on!Wendy Lau, also known as @thekwendyhome on Instagram and TikTok, has just posted a video that is going to forever change my towel-displaying techniques. Her quick video shows how to fold two kitchen towels in such a way that it creates the cutest little bow that you can balance on your oven door handle. Her bow-folding method does require two of the same towel pattern if you want a cohesive look (what a wonderful excuse to get another towel in your favorite print), but I don’t see why you couldn’t do two different colors or patterns for an energetic and contrasting mix. While she went with a very cute miniature Christmas tree pattern, I could see this method working for a number of different types of towels — even some more simple and classic.And while it is undeniably perfect for the festive holiday season, I don’t see why this couldn’t be the perfect way to display kitchen towels all year round!
