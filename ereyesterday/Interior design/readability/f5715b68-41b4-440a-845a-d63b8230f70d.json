  "text": "Bana Gear Studios is one DIYer who pushes the envelope of LEGO Technic creations beyond the grasp of the average LEGO fan. Most of his builds are works of complicated gear-building techniques that materialize after much hit and trial. While most of us would give up at the seemingly unscalable hurdle, the passionate DIYer stops at nothing. His latest creation highlights his love for omnidirectional treadmills, and the first thing that comes to mind is the Disney Holotile. While the former employs disks tilting at different angles, the latter rotates them instead. That’s what makes this unique LEGO Technic different. Designer: Banana Gear Studios His first-ever DIY came through a year ago, and even though it was very complex and large, the community of passionate builders loved it. Between that time and the creation of this intricate build, he has put together some interesting LEGO creations. The unique design of tilting rotating discs really took his attention and he wanted to make one in his style. The initial hurdle was that the design could only move around large objects (that too not with maximum precision) supported by large discs. After a lot of tinkering and brainstorming, the DIYer improved on the initial design when a light bulb moment happened as one of the channel’s dedicated followers suggested a fix. On the way through implementing the donor idea of using LEGO net to secure the long gears in place and for their synchronized moment, the final design came through as a marvel of engineering in its rights. The YouTuber presses on the fact that the LEGO treadmill has some similarities to the Holotile but in no way is an emulation of the design. Fundamentally the creation has a very different working principle, and I totally agree. It uses discs that can be titled at an angle whereas the Holotile has fixed angle tiles with a base that rotates. Anyway, I just loved the amount of thinking put into this LEGO treadmill’s build.",
