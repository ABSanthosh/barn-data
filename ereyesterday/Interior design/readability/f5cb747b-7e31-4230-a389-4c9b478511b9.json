To decorate the dwelling, Sebban and his team used the vibrant colours and generous shapes that have become synonymous with his studio. Interior accents range from a bright orange kitchen wall adorned with shimmering disco-ball tiles to a multicoloured poured resin floor that spans the apartment.

The renovation included a kitchen characterised by primary colours in the form of blue and yellow cabinets and bright-red bar stools. \"The overall aim was to create a kitchen that doesn't scream 'kitchen', avoiding cold and shiny surfaces and making it into a comfortable space that the family spends most of their time in,\" explained the architects.

The pair renovated a 1920s villa, which was once a farmhouse on the outskirts of Valencia, to form their hybrid home and studio. The project includes a minty green kitchen dressed with fabric-wrapped stools, triangular alcoves and a wiggly salmon-pink room divider.

The studio sought to make the existing kitchen more suitable for entertaining by creating an open-plan food preparation space with purple and lilac cabinetry. Bright hues also define the rest of the home, including a lime green bedroom that was constructed next to the colourful kitchen.

The kitchen also features stripy, two-tone green flooring and slim blue tiles arranged into a herringbone-patterned splashback. \"A lot of the way I described the project as I was developing it was through taste and references to cooking and food, so that the colour scheme became a matter of choosing ingredients for a beautifully calibrated visual feast,\" Furman told Dezeen.
