Instead of two chairs on each end, I placed two under the large picture window to open things up a bit: My favorite part is that I just have to deflate them at the end of the season and they take up hardly any storage space. We had an outlet installed at the patio ceiling when we built the house, and we hung a TV up there a couple years after moving in. The guy who set up our AV equipment recommended buying a regular inexpensive TV instead of one made for outside -- because ours is covered he said it will most likely last just as long. He was right! We spent less than $200 on this one and it's still kicking! (We cover it for the winter months but otherwise it stays uncovered.)I'd love to find a television mount that we can raise and lower, but I haven't been able to find something that has a pole (since it's so high up). I may have to rig something up to raise and lower it. :)Usually we have music playing through the speakers in the ceiling. Best decision to have those installed!: The chairs came from Menards 14 (!!) years ago. They have a little bit of rust here and there, but otherwise they've held up really well. I applied it again this year and it really does help to restore the metal and make it look new again. It's such a little thing, but we didn't have a screen door at our old house, and it's been wonderful to open it up when the weather is nice. The cats are stationed there every minute it's open: I love the little detailed trim on the ceiling -- it's a nice little touch. I was going to paint the ceiling \"haint\" blue but we rarely have bugs nesting up there.By the way, the fan helps tremendously with bugs when we sit out at night. Mosquitos LOVE ME and I'm happy to find anything that helps.  I love our big wall of windows in our family room -- they're so pretty inside but make a big impact out here too: We spend way more time on this covered patio than we did on the deck or patio at our last house. (And we used those a lot!) Having the shade is BLISS. We get a lovely breeze through here too so it makes it so comfortable even on a hot day.This area sits four, but we often end up with neighbors and friends pulling up the dining chairs from the table on our big patio. We've had ten or more people gathered around the fire some nights!The fire pit is used most often on cooler spring and fall evenings:Those plants and trees have grown so much in the past couple of years, I really need to do another backyard tour! Stay tuned for that this summer. We are so fortunate to have these beautiful outdoor spaces! The weather this spring has been amazing, we just haven't had a chance to spend much time out there so far this year. I'm looking forward to more fun nights on our patio this season! Do you have an outdoor area at your house -- covered or not? I always thought a screened porch would be lovely too. We've considered adding the rolling screens around our covered patio, but they are SO expensive, yikes! Here's a list of the items with sources on our porch: Chair cushions are from Lowe'sBlack metal lanterns were from Costco last year",
