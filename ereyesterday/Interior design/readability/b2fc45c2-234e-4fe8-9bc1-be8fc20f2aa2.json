I studied Media Studies at UVa and Journalism at Columbia and have worked in media for more than a decade. I love homes, heels, the history of art, and hockey — but not necessarily in that order.published yesterdayWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Grove, Soocas, DreameI love a home-focused trade show, whether it’s devoted to kitchen and bath products, designer textiles, or something else entirely. They’re amazing for learning about a new talented maker or a company that’s doing something cool for homes, or just spotting the biggest decor trends. The first show of the year that’s on my radar? The Consumer Electronics Show (CES), which is all about techy gadgets that run the gamut from large home appliances to smaller personal care items, app-enabled devices, and much, much more. Apartment Therapy searched high and low for the best new products coming out of CES this year, which was held this week in Las Vegas. Here’s what earned Apartment Therapy’s “Best In Show” seal — and what you should keep your eye out for coming to market this year (if not available already).Credit: Lutron1. Lutron Caséta Smart ShadesIf you’ve ever wished you had the automated James Bond-esque window coverings you find in fancy hotels, then Lutron’s Caséta Smart Shades are for you. The brand has expanded its popular Caséta line to window coverings. So now, with the push of a button, the sound of your voice, or a quick tap in an app, you can open and close your shades on demand or to a set schedule. The shades are battery-powered, so you don’t have to worry about messy wires. Installation can easily be DIYed in minutes, and the line works with many smart home platforms, including Amazon Alexa, Apple Home, Google Home, and others.The icing on the cake here, though, is the price. Though automated shades are a luxe product, prices start at a very competitive $399 for all shades up to 48 inches wide by 80 inches high, dimensions that most standard residential windows fall under. Choose from white or gray colorways, roller or honeycomb styles, and light filtering or blackout fabric (the latter is a $30 upcharge). Larger sizes are available at an additional cost.Buy: Lutron Caséta Smart Shades, Starts at $399 per window (and begin shipping in February)Credit: Eufy2. eufy 3-in-1 E20 Talk about a triple threat! The eufy 3-in-1 E20 will save you time, space, and potentially even money. That’s because it’s a powerful robovac that can also transform into a stick and a handheld vacuum cleaner for smaller, harder-to-vacuum messes (think Cheerios on a countertop, pet hair on a sofa) or tight areas where it’s hard for a robot to reach. That’s all thanks to its unique design, which involves removing a unit that holds the machine’s motor, battery, and dustbin and then attaching it to the chosen cleaning base. Though the units haven’t started shipping yet, they appear to provide powerful suction no matter what mode they’re in. Even better for small-space dwellers? The E20 dock is fairly streamlined, and you don’t have to store the larger cleaning accessories, like the stick wand, for example, with the rest of the unit.Buy: eufy 3-in-1 E20, $549.99 (Available for preorder until February 9)Credit: Soocas3. Soocas NEOS ll 2-in-1 Electric Toothbrush with Water FlosserAnother smart space saver, the Soocas NEOS ll 2-in-1 Electric Toothbrush with Water Flosser will truly earn its keep in your medicine cabinet or on your bathroom counter. That’s because it’s the world’s first brushing and flossing twofer, since it combines both a battery-powered brushing head and water flosser into one compact device. And it does this without compromising on performance, either, all in a lightweight, travel-friendly design. Fight plaque — and whiten and brighten your smile — by using the two cleaning modes, Deep Clean and Quick Floss, and alternating between three adjustable intensity levels depending on your level of sensitivity. Dare I say the NEOS II makes brushing and flossing actually fun? You’ll just have to find out for yourself. Buy: Soocas NEOS ll 2-in-1 Electric Toothbrush with Water Flosser, $169.99 from AmazonCredit: Pawport4.  Pawport Smart Pet DoorThe thing I love most about Pawport’s Smart Pet Door is that, at its simplest, it can be a retrofit solution that’ll make your life — and your pup’s — easier. Mounting the unit onto your existing pet door takes just seconds, and with that, you get a more secure, safer way for your pet to enter and exit your home — and to make sure no other unwanted animal visitors are coming into your space.How does it work? The door(s) connect to a smart collar tag that works with your pet’s movement when they’re wearing it. The system is app-enabled, so you can even give your pets an outdoor curfew or schedule blocks of time that encourage outdoor exercise. New for this year is an outer door component and tunnel system for even more protection. Pawport is taking preorders now, and you can find out more on the brand’s website. Credit: Dreame5. Dreame X50 Ultra Maybe you remember the Dreame L40 Ultra from Apartment Therapy’s Best in Show IFA Berlin roundup, which earned its spot on our list, thanks to its five suction levels, four-level mopping plan, and ability to get into the tightest of spots. Well, the China-based brand is back with another sophisticated robotvac, and this one is also doing the most — it can climb over small obstructions and slight changes in incline to keep its suction power going on all sorts of surfaces. This is one small step, though, toward robovacs becoming all the more efficient in whole house cleaning, and for that, I applaud it.Buy: Dreame X50 Ultra, $1,699.99 (Available at a discount for preorder until February 13)Credit: LG6. LG Signature Smart Instaview Over-the-Range Microwave Microwaves have been overshadowed by smaller appliances like air fryers and multicookers recently. But the LG Signature Smart Instaview Over-the-Range Microwave just might change that, if it goes into production in 2026 according to the company’s plan.Right now, the Instaview Microwave is just a concept, but it’s a cool one. Outfitted with a sizable screen on its front, powerful sensors inside, and cameras galore (the interior of the microware, above the range, and facing toward the rest of the kitchen itself), this smart cooker will not only help you get just-right results when it comes to your recipes, but it can also capture food content from all angles. Maybe it’s time to start your YouTube cooking channel after all?Credit: Anker7. Anker Solix Solar Beach UmbrellaImaging going to the ocean and juicing up your phone with your beach umbrella. That’s exactly what the Anker Solix Solar Beach Umbrella will be capable of doing, via flexible solar panels on its canopy and a USB-C port. Like other outdoor umbrellas, this model should also be built to withstand sun, sand, wind, and heat — and be lightweight enough to tote around fairly comfortably. Anker hasn’t released pricing info just yet, but this feels like an invention that’ll make summer 2025 that much more efficient and enjoyable, especially if you’re in the market for a beach umbrella upgrade.Credit: Govee8. Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBLNostalgic for your lava lamp of yesteryears but wish it had a bit more to offer than just mesmerizing blobs? Then the Govee Table Lamp 2 Pro x Sound by JBL is for you. Pairing the colorful LED lighting scenes Govee is known for with the crisp, high-quality sound of a JBL speaker, you’ll love the way this lamp can sync its vibrant visuals to the beat of your favorite song. It’s portable and rechargeable, too, so it can literally bring the vibes to any space in your home. Credit: Elvie9. Elvie RiseFirst in category innovations always catch my eye, and the Elvie Rise has that in spades. It’s an app-operated, smart baby bouncer that transforms into a bassinet seamlessly — all without moving (and fingers crossed waking) baby as they drift off to sleep.Though I’m not a parent, I can imagine the game-changing effect something like this could have in a baby’s daily play-to-sleep transition. And anything that gives sleep-deprived new parents back a little bit of time — and lets the baby rest easily — feels like a win-win in my book.Buy: Elvie Rise, $799.99 (Available for preorder and ships by mid-March)Credit: Hisense10.  Hisense 116-inch TriChroma LED TVYour streaming sessions just got a lot bolder and brighter, thanks to the Hisense 116-inch TriChroma LED TV. This big screen model is the only consumer design to use Hisense’s transformative RGB Local Dimming Technology, which means the picture is much more precise than others in terms of color and vibrancy. You’ll feel like your favorite characters and sports personalities are right there in the room with you, and the Dolby Atmos-integrated surround sound system makes watching more immersive, too. Pricing and availability are to come.",

Mounting the unit onto your existing pet door takes just seconds, and with that, you get a more secure, safer way for your pet to enter and exit your home — and to make sure no other unwanted animal visitors are coming into your space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow does it work? The door(s) connect to a smart collar tag that works with your pet’s movement when they’re wearing it. The system is app-enabled, so you can even give your pets an outdoor curfew or schedule blocks of time that encourage outdoor exercise. New for this year is an outer door component and tunnel system for even more protection.
