  "text": "Benedict Radcliffe is an established name in the European design circles attributing to his off-beat 3D geometric wireframe sculptures. The designer has crafted life-sized versions of iconic vehicles and his acclaimed creations that transform the environment around them. His latest creation caught my eye, because you already know I’m a Porsche fan. Yes, this is the Porsche 959 recreated in a scaled version with a neon green glowing steel finish. This revered model from the German automaker is celebrating its 40th anniversary in 2025, and Benedict has got his timing right on point. Motorheads who can’t get their hands on the real thing can sport this intricate sculpture on their work desk or living room shelf with pride. Designer: Benedict Radcliffe and Studio INK This desktop-worthy sculpture is made out of composite resin and has a cool glow to it that will make you stick to your office chair for longer than usual. The 1:15 scale model is limited to just 15 pieces, and can be purchased from the artist’s official website for 2500 GBP. The wireframe model grows on the success of the already popular interpretations of the Ferrari F40, Porsche 934, and the classic London taxi that got exposure at Heathrow Airport in 2014. The London-based artist has put together the Porsche 959 and collaborated with studio INK who have made an animated teaser of this glowing steel tube sculpture in the digital world. Interested Porsche fans can view the car in a 360-degree world, since the studio has taken 3D scans of the designer’s creation. The captivating animation shows the assembly process and then heads to the final form of the fluorescent sculpture. Coming onto the history of the Porsche 959, well, the car debuted in 1985 and quickly grabbed all the attention for being the world’s fastest street-legal production car at that time. The sportscar could toggle the torque between the rear and front wheels in any kind of weather conditions.",
