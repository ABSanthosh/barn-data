  "text": "Enough plastic and metal – give me a wooden keyboard. Bringing a furniture-like art-deco-level classiness to a world saturated by either minimalism, technofuturism, or hyper-ergonomics, this little wooden keyboard from Epomaker and Feker comes with a split layout, wooden armrests, and a separate numpad. Dubbed Alice, it sports a 60-key layout (not including the numpad), designed like your average mechanical keyboard complete with SA-style keycaps that clack with a unique audio signature, thanks to the wooden construction. At first glance, you might dismiss a wooden keyboard as a novelty. But then you touch it. The grain under your fingertips, the muted depth of every keystroke, the way it seems to breathe character into every letter you type—this is more than a tool. It’s an encounter with design that feels personal, almost intimate, as if someone built it with your desk in mind. Designers: Epomaker \u0026 Feker The appeal of wood in a keyboard isn’t solely about looks, though. The material choice enhances the acoustic properties of the device, producing a pleasingly muted clack with every keystroke. Think of it like a concert hall engineered to amplify and refine sound; here, the wooden frame dampens noise while creating a satisfying tactile experience. It’s the kind of detail you notice the moment you start typing, and it’s hard to go back once you’ve felt it. The ergonomic design is another feature that sets the Alice 60 apart. Split keyboards have long been hailed for their ability to reduce strain and improve typing posture, but this model takes things further. The magnetic attachment allows users to adjust the keyboard to suit their personal comfort, whether that’s aligning it with desk space or tailoring it for shared workstations. It’s an approach that prioritizes adaptability without compromising the aesthetics or performance of the device. Typing on the Alice 60 feels intuitive, thanks to its 67-key layout and gasket mount structure. The gasket mount absorbs vibrations, making the typing experience smoother and quieter. The inclusion of hot-swappable switches is a dream for keyboard enthusiasts, allowing for endless customization. Whether you’re a gamer, a writer, or someone who simply appreciates the finer things in life, the Alice 60 caters to your preferences with an impressive degree of flexibility. Connectivity options are as diverse as the keyboard’s audience. With support for wired Type-C, Bluetooth, and 2.4GHz wireless, you’re covered no matter how or where you work. It’s a detail that highlights the thoughtfulness behind this product—it’s designed to fit into your life rather than forcing you to adapt to it. The robust battery ensures extended use, so you won’t find yourself tethered to a power source during critical tasks. The detachable numpad is a subtle yet impactful feature. For those who rely on numerical inputs or shortcuts, it’s a game-changer. The numpad isn’t just an accessory; it’s a fully programmable tool that can be tailored to suit workflows. Whether you’re crunching numbers or executing complex commands, the numpad’s flexibility transforms it from a “nice-to-have” into a “need-to-have.” While the Alice 60 clearly caters to a discerning audience, it doesn’t alienate newcomers. The approachable manual and intuitive setup make it easy for anyone to dive in and enjoy. The hot-swappable feature, for instance, simplifies the process of experimenting with different switches, letting you discover the exact feel and sound that match your style. It’s a gateway to the world of mechanical keyboards, but it’s also a destination in itself for seasoned enthusiasts. The practicality of the Alice 60 is matched by its sense of nostalgia. The retro design elements are a nod to the past, reimagined for the modern era. There’s something inherently comforting about its aesthetic—it’s as if the keyboard belongs to a workspace where creativity and productivity thrive side by side. That balance between the old and the new is what makes it feel timeless.",
