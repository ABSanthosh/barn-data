Designer: Huawei Unveiled on May 19, this groundbreaking device introduces the world’s first 18-inch foldable display in a laptop form factor. But calling it merely a laptop feels almost reductive. When unfolded, you’re looking at a stunning 18-inch canvas that somehow weighs less than many 13-inch ultrabooks. When folded, it transforms into a compact 13-inch device that slides effortlessly into a bag. What makes this design achievement particularly impressive isn’t just the folding display itself. It’s how Huawei solved the countless engineering challenges that have prevented others from creating something this ambitious. The innovation extends beyond mere technical specifications. Huawei has reimagined the fundamental relationship between users and their computing devices, creating something that adapts to various workflows rather than forcing users to adapt to rigid form factors. Engineering Marvel: The Hinge The hinge deserves special attention. Stretching 285mm across the device, Huawei calls it the “world’s largest basalt water drop hinge.” This isn’t marketing hyperbole. The three-stage shaft with mortise and tenon structure delivers a 400% increase in hovering torque compared to standard designs. What does this mean for users? Exceptional stability at viewing angles between 30° and 150°, while maintaining smooth operation at shallow angles between 0-20 degrees. When unfolded, the MateBook measures a mere 7.3mm thick. For perspective, that’s thinner than many smartphones. Even when folded, it maintains a relatively svelte 14.9mm profile while weighing just 1.16kg. The exterior combines premium leather and metal elements, available in Black, Blue, and White colorways. The integrated kickstand on the rear panel adds another dimension of versatility. Position the device in landscape or portrait orientation at various angles for different use cases. Present to clients, watch content, sketch ideas, or type documents. The physical form adapts to your needs rather than forcing you to adapt to it. This level of engineering precision didn’t happen overnight. Huawei claims thousands of prototypes were tested before arriving at this final design, with particular attention paid to the durability of the folding mechanism. The company promises the hinge will maintain structural integrity through thousands of folding cycles. Display Technology But the true star is undoubtedly the display itself. The dual-layer LTPO OLED panel delivers an immersive visual experience with a 92% screen-to-body ratio. When fully expanded, you’re looking at an 18-inch canvas with 4:3 aspect ratio and 3.3K resolution (3296 × 2472 pixels). Fold it, and you have a more conventional 13-inch display with 3:2 aspect ratio (2472 × 1648 pixels). This isn’t just any OLED panel. Huawei implemented the first commercial laptop application of LTPO (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide) technology, reducing power consumption by 30% while enabling adaptive refresh rates. The 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio ensures deep blacks and vibrant colors across the P3 wide color gamut, while peak brightness reaches an impressive 1600 nits. For those concerned about eye strain during extended use, the screen incorporates 1440Hz high-frequency PWM dimming and carries TÜV Rheinland Eye Comfort 3.0 certification. Color accuracy hasn’t been overlooked either. Huawei claims each display is factory calibrated to achieve a Delta E of less than 1, making it suitable for professional creative work. The anti-reflective coating helps maintain visibility even in challenging lighting conditions. Thermal Innovation The revolutionary design extends beyond the visible elements. Cooling such powerful components in an ultra-thin chassis required innovative solutions. Huawei engineered diamond aluminum dual fans and an ultra-thin antigravity vapor chamber heat sink. The copper-steel composite 3D vapor chamber and distributed component layout optimize thermal performance without excessive fan noise. Traditional cooling systems simply wouldn’t work in a device this thin. Huawei’s approach involves separating heat-generating components across the chassis to prevent hotspots. The vapor chamber technology efficiently transfers heat away from critical components to maintain performance during intensive tasks. Fan noise has been carefully tuned to remain below 28dB during typical usage scenarios. This makes the MateBook Fold Ultimate suitable for quiet environments like libraries and meeting rooms where traditional laptop fans might prove distracting. Performance and Connectivity Despite its slim profile, performance hasn’t been compromised. The MateBook Fold Ultimate comes equipped with 32GB of RAM and storage options of either 1TB or 2TB SSD. While Huawei hasn’t explicitly confirmed the processor in all materials, some sources indicate it uses their own Kirin X90 chipset, a fully Chinese-manufactured ARM processor. A 74.69Wh battery powers the device, with support for fast charging through the included 140W USB-C charger. Connectivity includes strategically placed USB-C ports, one on top and one on the side, along with dual-band Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2. The decision to position USB-C ports on different edges of the device shows thoughtful design consideration. This arrangement allows for convenient charging regardless of how the device is positioned or folded. The absence of legacy ports might disappoint some users, but reflects the forward-looking design philosophy behind the entire product. Audio-Visual Experience The audio experience matches the visual excellence with six speakers in total. Three 2W speakers work alongside three 1W speakers, enhanced by Huawei Sound technology. For video conferencing, an 8MP front-facing camera works alongside four microphones to ensure clear communication. Speaker placement has been carefully considered to maintain audio quality regardless of the device’s orientation. Whether used as a tablet, laptop, or in presentation mode, the sound remains clear and directional. The multi-microphone array uses AI-powered noise cancellation to isolate voices from background noise during calls. The camera quality represents a significant upgrade from typical laptop webcams. The 8MP sensor captures more detail than the standard 720p cameras found in most laptops, while the wide-angle lens ensures you stay in frame even when moving during calls. HarmonyOS 5: A New Computing Paradigm Perhaps the most intriguing aspect beyond the hardware is the software. The MateBook Fold Ultimate runs HarmonyOS 5, marking the first time this operating system appears on a Huawei laptop. This represents a significant departure from Windows, offering users a third major OS option alongside Windows and macOS. HarmonyOS 5 is designed specifically for this unique form factor. Intuitive gestures include three-finger swipes to move windows across screens and five-finger spreads to maximize applications. When positioned at a 90-degree angle like a traditional laptop, the bottom half can function as a virtual keyboard with customizable skins, adjustable key spacing, and haptic feedback through a linear motor. The operating system adapts intelligently to different usage scenarios. When folded, it automatically adjusts the interface for a more traditional laptop experience. When fully opened, it transforms into a tablet-like environment optimized for touch interaction. This contextual awareness extends to connected peripherals as well, with the interface changing based on whether the physical keyboard is attached. Input Options For those who prefer physical keys, Huawei includes an ultra-thin 5mm wireless keyboard weighing just 290g. This keyboard features 1.5mm key travel, lasts up to 24 days on a single charge, and magnetically attaches to the back of the device when not in use. The keyboard design deserves special mention. Despite its ultra-thin profile, Huawei has managed to deliver a surprisingly satisfying typing experience. The keys offer tactile feedback that rivals much thicker keyboards, while the full-size layout prevents the cramped feeling often associated with portable keyboards. Touch input has been optimized as well. The display supports 10-point multi-touch with pressure sensitivity, making it suitable for digital art and note-taking. Palm rejection technology works remarkably well, allowing users to rest their hand on the screen while writing or drawing without causing unwanted input. Versatility and Use Cases The versatility of the MateBook Fold Ultimate is perhaps its greatest strength. It transitions seamlessly between tablet mode, laptop configuration, and presentation setup. The built-in kickstand allows positioning at various angles in both portrait and landscape orientations. Creative professionals will appreciate the large canvas for digital art and design work. The 18-inch display provides ample space for complex projects, while the foldable nature means you can still take this capability on the road. Business users can leverage the presentation mode for client meetings, with the large screen eliminating the need for external displays in many scenarios. Students might find the combination of note-taking capabilities and full-size keyboard particularly appealing. The ability to fold the device partially creates a natural reading angle for digital textbooks, while the performance specifications handle research and productivity applications with ease. Market Position Priced at CNY 23,999 (approximately $3,300) for the 1TB model and CNY 26,999 (roughly $3,700) for the 2TB variant, the MateBook Fold Ultimate Design positions itself firmly in the premium market. It will initially launch in China on June 6, with international availability planned for later dates. While foldable laptops aren’t entirely new, Lenovo pioneered the concept years ago, Huawei’s implementation represents a significant leap forward. The larger screen, thinner profile, innovative hinge mechanism, and comprehensive ecosystem integration through HarmonyOS demonstrate what’s possible when design and engineering excellence converge. The pricing strategy places this device in competition with high-end laptops and creative workstations rather than mainstream consumer devices. Huawei is clearly targeting professionals and enthusiasts who value cutting-edge technology and are willing to invest in unique capabilities not found elsewhere. Future Implications The MateBook Fold Ultimate Design doesn’t just represent another iterative step in laptop evolution. It reimagines what portable computing can be. Whether this specific implementation becomes the new standard remains to be seen, but Huawei has undoubtedly expanded our understanding of what’s possible in mobile computing design. As with most breakthrough technologies, we can expect the concepts pioneered here to eventually trickle down to more affordable devices. The engineering solutions developed for this premium device will likely inform future products across various price points, potentially making foldable displays a common feature in laptops within the next few years. The introduction of HarmonyOS to the laptop form factor also signals Huawei’s ambitions beyond smartphones and tablets. Creating a cohesive ecosystem across all computing devices could position the company as a more comprehensive alternative to established players in the personal computing space.",
