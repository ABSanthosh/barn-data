  "text": "Style: Scandinavian Minimalism with Organic Elements Color Combination: warm cream, light wood, olive green, terracotta accents Who is it for: Anyone seeking a calm living space that emphasizes natural materials and clean lines. Budget: $$ Scandinavian Ambience Living Room Shopping List Below we present a curated list of products presented on the board: Tips and suggestions Colors That Work Together: Creamy white sofa creates a bright base, while natural wood tones make us grounded. Olive green pillows and terracotta throw are good additions to provide earthy pops of color and mood in contrast to the neutral backdrop. Wall Details: Modern geometric artwork in neutral tones adds visual interest while maintaining serenity. The trio of prints creates rhythm without overwhelming the space. This is the space to go full speed ahead with your creativity and find the art that works for you personally. Furniture Picks: Clean-lined sofa and console balanced with sculptural side tables. Natural wood shelving and storage pieces reflect traditional Scandinavian craftsmanship. Lighting: Layered approach with drum pendant and tripod floor lamp. Natural materials and cream shades maintain cohesion. Storage Solutions: Open shelving and console provide display space while maintaining the feeling of air and openness. Minimalist design keeps clutter at bay. More Considerations: Mix textures: bouclé, linen, knits for depth Maintain 60% light neutrals, 30% wood tones, 10% accent colors Use plants for organic shapes and movement Keep decor minimal yet meaningful Choose multi-functional furniture pieces if space is of an essence Focus on quality materials that age beautifully The Final Note: Clean lines, cozy vibes, and just enough personality to keep things interesting. This room shows that Scandinavian design is all about living beautifully with less. Tag us in your Scandinavian-inspired spaces! We’d love to see your take on this inviting style.",
