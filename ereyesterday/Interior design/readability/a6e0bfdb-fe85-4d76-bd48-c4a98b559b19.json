  "description": "This month Starbucks is opening their first 3D-printed storefront. Sited in Brownsville, Texas, the structure is by German 3D printing construction company Peri 3D. As with a lot of 3D-printed construction projects we've seen lately, this seems to be more about novelty than the cost-savings that was once promised for 3D-printed construction. The building was erected at an estimated cost of $1.1 million. That said, it was built quickly; the shell was printed in under a week. The strange part is, no customer will ever get to set foot inside of it. The 1,400-square-foot building was designed as a drive-thru and also has a walk-up window, but there's no interior seating. It's due to open on April 28th.",
