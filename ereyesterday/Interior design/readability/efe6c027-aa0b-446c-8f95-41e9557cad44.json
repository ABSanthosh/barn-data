  "text": "A striking new skyscraper is being constructed in Miami, Florida. This residential tower will be distinguished by its sculpted exterior and will incorporate solar-panel-integrated windows to help minimize reliance on grid-based energy. Dubbed the Residences at 1428 Brickell, the building’s interior has been designed by Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel (ACPV Architects), while the local firm Arquitectonica is responsible for the exterior design, with development by Ytech. Located on Miami’s prestigious Brickell Avenue, the skyscraper’s exact height has not been disclosed, but it will feature 70 stories, marking it as an impressive structure. The unique sculpted exterior takes its inspiration from the wind rather than the nearby sea, as might be expected, and it will be anchored by a sturdy base that incorporates abundant greenery. Designer: Arquitectonica x ACPV Architects Although constructing a large glass tower in Miami doesn’t align with notions of sustainability, the building’s exterior will incorporate a substantial number of solar panels within the glazing of its west-facing facade. This design choice aims to decrease its reliance on grid-based energy. “Since the solar cells are integrated into the glass, the effective lifespan of the panels can match the window itself,” said ACPV Architects “The property will feature 500 photovoltaic-integrated windows along the west-facing facade, creating a ‘Solar Backbone’ comprising nearly 20,000 square feet [roughly 1,850 sq m] of energy-producing glass. With this orientation and permanently installed generating capacity, the system is capable of producing up to 170,000 kilowatts, or 170 megawatts, of clean energy per year.” The interior of the skyscraper is designed to accommodate 189 luxury residences, each thoughtfully designed to provide an exceptional living experience. Every residence will feature its private foyer, and residents will enjoy expansive terrace areas, ideal for outdoor relaxation or entertaining guests, as well as summer kitchens that enhance the alfresco dining experience. High ceilings will add to the sense of spaciousness, while the Italian kitchens will be outfitted with premium finishes and top-of-the-line appliances. While specific pricing details for these residences have not been disclosed, reports from Florida YIMBY indicate that the two-to-four-bedroom units are expected to range from $3 million to $7 million. The luxurious penthouse suite is priced at an impressive $60 million. Considering the hefty price tag, the building will naturally offer an extensive array of amenities. Residents will have access to a stunning rooftop pool,  and multiple lounges will offer comfortable spaces for socializing and unwinding, while dedicated office spaces will cater to those who work from home. A state-of-the-art cinema and a fully-equipped gym are also included.",
