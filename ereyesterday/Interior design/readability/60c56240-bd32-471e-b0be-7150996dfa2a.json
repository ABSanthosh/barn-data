This means there are plants that can enhance seasonal decor, including holiday decor, making your home feel even more like a winter wonderland. Here are a few options that will fit right in with the spirit of the season. They’re all pet safe, too! 1. Christmas Cactus The Christmas Cactus, with its fitting name and vibrant blooms in shades of pink, red, and white, is a low-maintenance plant that adds a splash of color to your holiday decor. Unlike the prickly cactus you might imagine, this plant features smooth, flat leaves and cascading flowers. It thrives indoors with moderate light and occasional watering.  It can bloom for years to come with proper care, so this one’s a gift that’ll keep on giving.

Frosty Ferns love high humidity and indirect light, making them perfect for bathrooms, kitchens, or fitting in among another close collection of plants. They offer a soft, lacy texture that complements other holiday decorations like pinecones or candles. During the rest of the year, they’re a unique, striking point of interest plant that will wow your guests. Photo Credit: Wikimedia Commons / Chhe 3. Parlor Palm For a touch of tropical holiday flair, the Parlor Palm is an excellent choice. Its lush, feathery fronds create a natural, evergreen look that pairs well with fairy lights or small ornaments. It’s large and sprawling, looking like it was lifted from a beach into your home, but its leaves still dazzle among colder-themed decor and bring a big pop of green to balance out the Christmas reds. It thrives in low to moderate light, making it a versatile option for any room. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / filiaolga 4. Holly Fern If you love the look of holly but need a safer option for your pets, the Holly Fern is a fantastic substitute. Its glossy, spiky-edged fronds mimic the festive feel of traditional holly, albeit without the berries. It still fits perfectly among other holly-laden decor items and among holiday motifs in general. Place it in a decorative pot for a polished winter look, and keep it in moderate to low light with occasional misting. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Sandsun 5. Norfolk Island Pine The Norfolk Island Pine is a miniature pine tree that brings all the charm of a Christmas tree in a pint-sized package. It won’t grow nearly the size of a Christmas tree, and will look more sparse in its branches, but the soft spines will still evoke that evergreen feel. Decorate it with lightweight ornaments or small strings of lights for a cozy, festive touch. Norfolk Island Pines thrive in bright, indirect light and only need occasional watering, making them a low-maintenance holiday favorite. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / wirestock 6. Peperomia ‘Frost’ The silvery, frosted leaves of the Peperomia ‘Frost’ variation make it a perfect winter-themed addition to your holiday decor. Their leaves always look as if they were freshly snowed on, making for a cute, stylish addition to other winter-themed items. Compact and easy to care for, this plant thrives in low to medium light. Pair it with some fairy lights or a festive pot for a holiday display that feels modern and chic.
