  "text": "Josewong recreates appleâ€™s running shoe emoji as sneakersItâ€™s not everyday that an emoji like Appleâ€™s running shoe becomes real-life sneakers, but Josewong sees and grabs the chance, so now weâ€™re here. The designer and creative unveils ðŸ‘Ÿ as sneakers that people can wear. Named Shoe 1, they look plushy and comfortable enough for everyday use. The outsole also contains 5 percent recycled rubber, which adds to the stretchiness. From the color palette to the reflective details, itâ€™s safe to say that the recreation is faithful. Thereâ€™s no need to zoom in because the lifesize Apple running shoe emoji is now physically tangible.all images courtesy of JosewongPrinted a5 processor image inside the solesThe sneaker versions of the Apple running shoe emoji have a full-grain nubuck and mesh upper. They contain lightweight foam cushioning in the midsole and heel to protect the wearers as they jog or run. When taken apart, Apple enthusiasts might appreciate that Josewong plants the companyâ€™s A5 processor inside the soles (yes, theyâ€™re printed). So, whenever the wearers run, they can imagine themselves being powered with the recent processing unit. Even the midsole cushioning is made of lightweight foam with polyurethane rim. This material can fully support the feet and prevent them from feeling the pavement.True to the Apple running shoe emoji, the designerâ€™s real-life sneakers come with lace-up closure. Itâ€™s because thatâ€™s the design of the emoji, and it can also secure the feet during jogging or running. To top these all, the sneakers are delivered in a â€˜crazy big box that comes with everything.â€™ US shoe sizes range between 5 and 12, and shipping begins one week after purchase. Josewong and his team say that all sales are final, meaning no refunds are allowed. The designer also feels the ensemble isnâ€™t complete without the Apple sock and hat emojis, even the pleading face one. He has already recreated those, so now the wearers can put on a complete emoji outfit.Josewong unveils ðŸ‘Ÿ as sneakers that people can wearthe sneaker version of the Apple running shoe emoji has a full-grain nubuck and mesh upperJosewong with his Apple running-shoe-emoji sneakers and a Steve Jobs wax figuredetailed view of the real life Apple running shoe emojie sneakersthey have lightweight foam cushioning in the midsole and heel to protect the wearersâ€™ feet",
