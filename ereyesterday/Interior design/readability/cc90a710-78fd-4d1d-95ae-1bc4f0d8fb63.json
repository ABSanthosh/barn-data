We can't live without this stuff now!Â This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. ðŸ˜‚Â I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me. Â  Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!Â  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:Â  This post may containÂ affiliate links for yourÂ convenience.I may earn a small commission whenÂ you make a purchase through links.Â  About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews.Â It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it!Â You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain.Â We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.Â  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything!Â This was just a few hours later: By the next day it will be gone!Â  It works on everything animal related. We haven't had to use it for #2 thank goodness, but our kitties do vomit occasionally.Â Tip: I've learned to let the vomit dry, then vacuum up any dry bits and spray. It's much easier to clean up.Â  This was puke one of them left us on the carpet the other day: See! I told you these are the BEST photos ever. ðŸ˜‚ I had already cleaned up any of the solid stuff. Again, just saturate the stain really well: As you can see, it immediately starts working on the stain. (The carpet color looks different, I know -- these were taken at different times and with lights on and off.)This is after a full 24 hours, and I'll spray again to get the little bit of discoloration that remains: That's pretty impressive for such a dark stain! And this is standing right up on it -- when you walk in the room you already have to look for where it was.Â It doesn't contain any harsh chemicals or dyes (and is scent-free). They describe the formula as a form of stabilized oxygen that breaks down and vaporizes bacteria that causes the stains and smells.I don't recommend using any other cleaning solutions before or in combination with Furry Freshness, as it won't work quite as well. (It will take more applications.) In my nearly fiveÂ decades of \"owning\" animals, I've never found a pet stain remover that works as well.Â You can get Furry FreshnessÂ hereÂ if you want to get it quickly: It's worth it to order the gallon sizeÂ on their site.Â  This product is not cheap, but it WORKS. We get the gallon size and refill the spray bottle as we go. You can use it on hard surfaces as well, as it kind of melts everything and makes it easier to clean up.Â A gallon lasts us at least six months, even with four animals. The extra cost is worth saving our carpet and rugs.Â  They do say that the solution can cause a smell while it cleans, but it goes away. It just smells \"clean\" to me, so we've never had an issue with that. Have any of you tried this solution? We LOVE it! Can't recommend it enough!",
