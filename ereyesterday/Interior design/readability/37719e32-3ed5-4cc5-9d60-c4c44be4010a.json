At my local Walmart they use hot water and steam—you can feel both the temperature of the cart and the dampness when they've come fresh out of the sanitization station.

In those cases they can outsource the cleaning. A company called HealthyCart operates mobile trailers where they show up to the site, get the carts into their trailer and blast them clean. Over in Europe, Germany's ShopBox Group also produces mobile shopping cart washing systems. Those latter two solutions are fine for suburbs where there's room to get the truck ins, but such solutions are a no-go for space-tight urban areas.
