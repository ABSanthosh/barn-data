  "text": "Designed by Baluchon, the Eden tiny home is an oasis of calm ingenuity, showcasing an artful use of space. This compact French dwelling is set atop a double-axle trailer and finished in red cedar, and proves that small-scale living can be both practical and quietly elegant. At just 20 feet (6 meters) in length, Eden was crafted with a dual purpose in mind: to serve as a full-time residence and a home office for its owner in Normandy. When you enter the home, you’re met with an interior that feels intentional in every detail. The Eden’s main living area is open and airy, thanks to large windows that invite the outdoors in and a floor plan designed for ease of movement. But this living area serves as a quaint home office instead of a typical living room, equipped with a desk and a chair. The kitchen is modest in scale, but features quality cabinetry and enough preparation space for daily meals. A small dining table seats two, making it ideal for intimate dinners or focused work sessions. Designer: Baluchon One of Eden’s key design features is its storage-integrated staircase. This clever solution maximizes vertical space, tucking away essentials without clutter or compromise. The stairs lead up to the bedroom loft, a classic tiny house move, where a low ceiling creates a cozy sleeping nook. Even here, Baluchon has added discreet storage, ensuring residents have room for clothes, books, and personal items. While the bedroom’s ceiling height might feel restrictive to some, the payoff is a sense of privacy and retreat that’s rare in such a small footprint. The Eden offers interior efficiency while also extending the living space outdoors with a 107-square-foot (10-square-meter) terrace, seamlessly connecting the home to its rural surroundings. This terrace becomes a second living room in good weather—a place for morning coffee, evening relaxation, or even alfresco work. The transition between inside and out is effortless, making the most of the home’s Normandy location. Throughout Eden, natural materials and minimalist sensibilities dominate. The red cedar exterior ages beautifully, while the metal roof adds a touch of industrial resilience. The palette within the home remains restrained: wood, neutral colors, and clean lines foster a sense of tranquility and order. This design choice feels both modern and timeless, perfectly suited to those who value calm and clarity in their environment. The layout of the home supports both daily living and remote work, with ample light and connectivity built in. While some compromises are inevitable—the bedroom’s low ceiling, the compact kitchen—Baluchon’s design language ensures the home feels generous for one or two people. There’s a sense of purpose here, a belief that good design can make small living possible and also deeply satisfying.",
