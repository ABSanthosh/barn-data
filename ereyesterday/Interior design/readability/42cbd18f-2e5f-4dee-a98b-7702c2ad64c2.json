But as a busy business owner, I’ve learned that in order to really enjoy being home, I have to be intentional with how I spend my time. Otherwise, I get a little frazzled—juggling tasks, feeling scattered, or just feel overwhelmed by busyness. And that’s not at all the cozy, peaceful home mood I want. I remember reading a time management tip years ago that really stuck with me: Focus on the things only you can do. It’s a simple idea, but it can be life-changing. That said, while I’d love to hire help so we could focus exclusively on what only we can do… the truth is, we still do most things ourselves to save money. Around here, we’re the chefs, the cleaners, the painters, the dog walkers, and the yard crew. :) Still, I’ve found ways to apply this idea that don’t require hiring anyone—and they do save us time, money, and stress. Over the years, I’ve picked up a few little practices that help us stay on top of things. Here are some that have made a big difference: 1. Grocery Pick-Up We started using local grocery pick-up regularly back in 2020, and honestly, we’ve never looked back. Even though shopping is easy where we live—and my husband actually enjoys it—we realized that ordering some of our regular groceries online and picking them up saves a ton of time. And surprisingly? It saves money too. Fewer impulse buys (on things we don’t need), better planning, and easier meal prep. A couple of our local grocery stores don’t charge extra for this service so it’s a no brainer! Sometimes we do Amazon Whole Foods orders, too. We still run into the store now and then, but 95% of the time we just order through the store’s app and swing by the parking lot for pickup. It’s been such a simple switch, but it frees up hours every month. Young Living // Cafe Curtain Details and How I Hang Them 2. Subscriptions + Memberships Another change that’s really helped us simplify life is setting up subscriptions for things we order and use often. Once you know what you like or use regularly, you can automate the entire process from delivery date and frequency. You can often save more money, too, by bundling items into one shipment or becoming a member to get free shipping or other member perks.am Whether it’s household essentials or personal care, having items arrive on a schedule means fewer decisions for me to make. That frees up so much mental energy—the kind I’d rather put toward creativity, decorating, or simply enjoying life at home. I also enjoy subscriptions to services or communities that benefit our life, too (I even have a “home” membership/subscription you can join: HomeBody Gathering Place! It’s a really lovely way to help you focus on what contributes to your home and life and to weed out some of the online noise). We put various home services on repeat so we don’t forget about when or who to call (like we have seasonal sprinkler maintenance). A few memberships/subscriptions we love for the service, quality or convenience are Costco, Young Living, Amazon Prime, Audible, Spotify, Grove Collaborative and more! 3. Shopping from Curated Shops Even if I don’t need to put items on a subscription, I like to purchase from companies that hold higher standards for their products—especially as part of my health journey. It took a little research upfront, but now that I’ve found a few trusted sources, I don’t have to constantly rethink or second-guess what I’m buying. It’s one less thing to overthink—or procrastinate. Another unexpected benefit? Curated shops (this applies to online and local shops) make shopping so much easier. When you’re not sifting through tons of low-quality options, you are more likely to find things you actually love. We have a few local shops that I go to for gifts, plants, clothing and more because I always know I’ll find a gem. I love to support a local business owner — especially when they intentionally curate what is in their shop as that makes my life easier and the experience better. Swedish dish cloths // Lamp Similarly when I shop online, I need to trust that I will enjoy the experience and the products. Case in point, I recently placed a big online order from Grove Collaborative (I’ve been a longtime customer). I restocked a few basics (and grabbed a few items for my daughter and her family) and discovered some new favorites, too! Some of the items in my box: reusable paper towels (wave print and farmer’s market print), striped dish towels, Swedish dish cloths, a bamboo cutting board, a market bag for produce (perfect for farmer’s market days!), and some reusable silicone food savers. All quality items and some fun ones, too. I love using them all and I can simply reorder any when it’s time. Easy peasy! Reusable paper towels in wave print Shopping from curated shops feels more efficient, often makes our home healthier, and brings more joy to everyday life at home. None of these shopping habits are revolutionary, but they have made a meaningful difference in our home and in my schedule. I hope this gave you a few helpful ideas for your own home routines and time management! If you have a tip you love that helps you save time, money or mental space at home, I’d love to hear it! And if you have any questions, I’m happy to answer in the comments (or a follow up post!).",
