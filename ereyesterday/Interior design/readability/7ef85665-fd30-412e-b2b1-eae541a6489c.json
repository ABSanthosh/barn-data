  "text": "Swatt + Partners, a prominent local architecture studio, has masterfully designed a home office that seems to float above the natural landscape. This effect is achieved by supporting a “wood-framed glass box” with two vertical concrete slabs, creating a striking architectural feature that both blends with and stands out from its surroundings. Called Moss Rock, this innovative project is situated on a sprawling nine-acre (3.6-hectare) rural property in Healdsburg, a charming town located in the heart of northern California’s renowned wine country. Nestled in Dry Creek Valley, the site is enveloped by a lush forest, rich with Douglas fir, madrone, and oak trees, providing a serene and picturesque backdrop. The property, originally designed by Swatt + Partners in 2008, includes a two-story house in Emeryville, Bay Area. The owners wanted to expand their space with a distinct home office separate from the main house. Swatt + Partners rose to the challenge, designing a sleek rectangular structure positioned to the west of the main residence. This new addition is thoughtfully crafted to minimize environmental impact, showcasing the firm’s initiative to create a sustainable and harmonious design. Designer: Swatt + Partners The building’s design is both functional and elegant, with a portion of the structure gracefully hovering over a narrow, flat pad while another section extends over a steep slope. This enhances the property’s aesthetic appeal and also respects the natural contours of the land. It is supported by two vertical, cast-in-place concrete cores, and uses Western red cedar boards for the floor and roof, consistent with the main house’s design. Its glazed walls offer expansive views of the surrounding nature. Inside, the space comprises a single room characterized by exposed concrete, wooden casework, and modern decor. The project extended beyond the building itself, incorporating enhancements to the overall property. These upgrades include a new infinity-edge pool, terraces, and rustic water features, all designed to harmonize with the existing natural landscape, providing both aesthetic appeal and functional outdoor living spaces. “The new structure is a crisp, wood-framed glass box that hovers just above the flat portion while it soars above the down-sloping topography on the southwest corner of the building,” said the team. The new additions aim to create “an idyllic compound of beautiful architecture, set in a spectacular garden environment in northern California wine country,” according to the team. Swatt + Partners, established in 2024, was co-founded by architect Robert Swatt, who previously founded Swatt Miers and began his architectural career in 1975. The firm is currently led by Swatt alongside partners Miya Muraki and Phoebe Wong-Oliveros. Their collaborative approach focuses on integrating architecture with the natural landscape, enhancing the property’s aesthetic and functional appeal while maintaining harmony with its surrounding environment.",
