  "text": "Ample was commissioned to design a lovely tiny home for the Australian tourism and events company Visit Victoria. They came up with a charming and quaint house called Stella the Stargazer. The name sounds pretty poetic, and the off-grid dwelling is quite cute too. It has a rather rustic and raw aesthetic, bringing to mind the image of a rural farm shack. But the interior is really quite comfortable, with a bed that can be pulled out to let you sleep under the stars! It is based on a triple-axle trailer and features a length of 32 feet and a width of 7.8 feet. Old sections of steel were sourced from an abandoned farm shack in rural Penshurst, Victoria and they were used to build the home. Reclaimed corrugated iron and hardwood from the same site were utilized as well, giving the tiny home a shed-like aesthetic. Designer: Ample “To break away from the trailer footprint, we have incorporated fold-up corrugated eaves, large steel framed East-orientated glazing, and an operable gas strut window,” said Ample. “Through this primary aperture, our bed platform rolls out and cantilevers from the trailer base. This treehouse-like element is covered from above by the Kundig-esque window and protected from bugs by a mosquito net hung at points from the window frame.” What makes the tiny home truly stand out is the wonderful stargazing bed! Visitors can raise the glazed wall, and pull out the bed manually, to create the most comfortable and mesmerizing under-the-stars experience. If the weather isn’t right, they can simply push the bed and stay inside. As you enter the home through sliding glass doors and a deck area, you are welcomed into the kitchen. The kitchen includes a wood-burning stove that also serves as a hotplate, as well as a propane-powered stove, fridge, sink, and some shelving. Reclaimed hardwood and porthole-style windows were incorporated throughout the home, to add some interesting personality and character. An operable window offers access to the deck area, allowing you to serve food and drinks. The tiny home also includes a dining table and a living room area with a sofa. A bathroom is placed behind the kitchen, and it also showcases a shed-inspired look. It features burnished steel, copper, and brass plumbing fittings. The tiny home can run off the grid using a solar panel system and batteries. It also includes a generator that will work when needed. A rainwater collection system has also been integrated, as well as tanks to hold greywater and waste. Stella the Stargazer can be booked for around US$210 and moves around in different locations.",
