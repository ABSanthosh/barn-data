Continue reading to find potential presents that can be appreciated all year round… and snag something for yourself! Chelsea Bottle Stopper + Pair Short Crystal Glasses by Reflections Copenhagen \\\\\\ $152 + $367 Ordered à la carte or purchased as a pairing, this crystal drinkware is made to dazzle any tabletop with its gem faceted element. Both options are members of the Chelsea family, with the bottle stopper cut to correspond with the form featured on the glasses’ base. The fine hand cut crystal comes in a commemorative, luxury gift box with its own dust cloth for cleaning and polishing. The Brut Lamp by Wooj \\\\\\ $145 This luminaire’s harsh geometry is tempered by its warm glow showcasing Brutalism’s softer side through three color combinations – one more ethereal than the next. Its body and shade are 3D printed from recycled PLA with the appearance of extruded planes to create a textural form. What’s more, the composition is a slight nod to Italian architect Carlo Scarpa’s influential work in concrete and extreme attention to detail. Portable Stainless Steel Cutlery Set by Prada \\\\\\ $480 Prada’s portable cutlery set highlights another extension of the Italian fashion house into lifestyle accessories, one that is sure to satisfy the fashion forward and sustainable-minded. The trio of utensils is stored in a container that comes in a Re-Nylon dust bag pouch – an innovative material produced from purified, recycled ocean plastic – accentuated with an enameled logo. This is just one of many enviable picnic accouterments. Cara Pillar Vase by Franca \\\\\\ From $118 The flirty, free-flowing curves painted across this versatile vessel’s surface are emblematic of beauty and grace. From utensil organization to showcasing floral arrangements, this artistic object comes in four sizes to accommodate a variety of interior design needs. Display the slightly sculptural work on its own to fill a nook, within a cluster of similar pieces for a greater tablescape, or in contrast with darker forms to pull focus. Black Baluster Candle Holder by French Designer Sam Baron for Diptyque \\\\\\ $125 Textural wood grain, the striking black finish, and a series of bulbous forms conspire to capture nature’s raw beauty in the Sam Baron-designed baluster for Diptyque. This l’objet d’art serves to elevate everything from decorative jars, an intimate interior ambiance, and self care rituals enhanced by candlelight. And with a variety of sizes, there’s plenty to choose from for expanded gifting. SongBook Max by Tivoli Audio \\\\\\ $600 In an homage to the classic boombox, the SongBook Max fuses style with sound, nostalgia with premium technology. The device also delivers impressive volume, well-balanced frequencies, and substantial bass. Equipped with analog elements, users can derive great pleasure from tactility turning knobs and pushing sliders for a traditional sense of control. It’s a portable companion poised to play your favorite tunes almost anywhere. Drinking Set No. 257 – Commodore Wine Decanter by Oswald Haerdtl for Lobmeyr \\\\\\ $614 Lobmeyr is situated within the upper echelon of crystal makers, centuries old and synonymous with handcraft, epitomizing luxury. This collection by Austrian architect Oswald Haerdtl is a prime example of enduring modern design – plucked from the 1950s. The Commodore Decanter pulls focus with its clean lines, perfect clarity, and sexy silhouette. It’s the ideal gift for fans of architecturally adjacent home furnishings as well as crystal collectors. Glass Colorblock Serving Spoon Set by DOT for East Fork \\\\\\ $118 East Fork taps Florida-based glass art studio DOT for a colorful collaboration that is a saccharine treat. The makers behind this handcrafted serving spoon pairing fused glass with contrasting finishes, matte against glossy, and play with cool colors that add a graphic element to tabletops when in use. It’s perfect for those who like to entertain or even just elevate their everyday dining experience. Sonia Cobalt Knit Throw Blanket by Unison \\\\\\ $165 Like canvas, textiles provide a rich medium for artistic expression. This throw blanket takes inspiration from the bold, graphic designs of French artist Sonia Delaunay and translates those elements into a geometric color-blocked pattern. The double-knit construction, comprising 75% upcycled cotton as well as 5% recycled plastics, gives this piece a substantial weight in addition to a new life for discarded materials. Coordinating throw pillow covers provide additional opportunities for decor. Color Wheel Sculpture by Vetro Vero \\\\\\ $3,600 These colorful rondelles are show stopping, luminous sculptural statement pieces not for the faint of heart. Available in a dozen shades, each object is mounted within a linear pedestal – height may be customized according to needs – in celebration of pure geometry, flawless glass, and vivid hues. Every component, the stand and disc, are completely fabricated by hand for an inimitable work of art. Follow along so you don’t miss any of our 2024 Gift Guides this year!
