To address this, Pelican produces this Re-Set foam protection system, which is endlessly reconfigurable and reusable; there's no cutting required. The system consists of a series of plastic grids and high-density foam pegs. The pegs fit into each square and are held in place by friction. To create a cavity above the grid, you simply push the peg downwards. If the pegs compress over time and lose their grip on the grid, you simply rotate them 45 degrees to refresh their \"bite.\" Here's how it works:The Re-Set kits are available for Pelican's 1700, 1720 and 1750 Protector Long Cases.While Pelican's lawyers won't be pleased, I can almost guarantee we'll see Etsy sellers knocking these off with 3D-printed grids and foam ordered from McMaster.",
