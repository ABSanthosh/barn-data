  "text": "Electric cars and digital features are becoming standard in new vehicles, but few models successfully combine these elements with genuinely thoughtful design. Mercedes-Benz’s all-new CLA does exactly that—merging cutting-edge technology with practical, user-focused design choices that enhance the everyday driving experience. Designer: Mercedes-Benz Clean, Purposeful Exterior Design The new CLA is slightly larger than before – 185.9 inches long with a wheelbase extended by 2.4 inches to 109.8 inches. This growth maintains compact proportions while creating more interior space. The clean design approach catches the eye – sculpted surfaces with fewer lines and precise joints. The front features a distinctive shark-nose design with an illuminated Mercedes-Benz pattern in the grille. This modern take includes 142 chrome-effect stars and the Mercedes logo, with lighting that activates when greeting or saying goodbye to the driver. The frameless doors with chrome trim highlight the car’s sporty character, and every CLA comes with a panoramic roof standard. Optional flush door handles improve aerodynamics, helping the vehicle achieve an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.21. At the back, the star-shaped taillights connect with a light band that also features welcome animations. The rear license plate sits in the bumper – a detail typically found on Mercedes’ sportier models. A high-gloss black rear diffuser completes the look while improving airflow. For those who appreciate color beyond the typical silver and black options, Mercedes offers two exclusive new paint finishes: Liquid Crystal Green and Sky Blue Metallic. These distinctive hues complement the CLA’s sculpted body and help it break away from automotive sameness. Practical Interior Focused on Technology Inside, Mercedes has taken a minimalist approach that highlights key technology features. The optional floating MBUX Superscreen makes a bold statement, spanning the entire dashboard width and combining a 10.25-inch driver display, a 14-inch central display, and an additional 14-inch passenger display behind a single glass panel. Even without the optional Superscreen, the interior impresses with a floating center console design and distinctive door panels. Round climate vents at the ends of the dashboard and a flat central vent with a high-tech look replace traditional louvers. The interior is more spacious than before, with increased headroom (up 0.6 inches front, 1.1 inches rear) and slightly more legroom up front (+0.4 inches). The standard panoramic roof enhances this feeling of space while bringing in natural light. Material choices elevate the interior experience beyond what you’d expect in this segment. Trim options include open-pore wood, brushed aluminum, and a striking Gold Anthracite anodized finish. Perhaps most interesting is a unique decorative paper surface – a first in automotive design – that brings an unexpected textural element to the cabin. The ambient lighting system transforms the interior mood with 64 available colors, 10 pre-configured color themes, 20 brightness levels, and three distinct brightness zones. This customizable lighting appears in three key areas: the Superscreen edges, center console, and door panels, creating a cohesive visual experience that can be tailored to your preference. For those seeking a sportier feel, the AMG Line adds distinctive touches like 18-inch alloy wheels (with 19-inch options available), a unique front bumper with air intakes and chrome splitters, and an animated star pattern light projection when the door opens. Inside, you’ll find sports seats wrapped in MB-Tex/microfiber upholstery with eye-catching red contrast stitching on the door panels. Smart Technology That Learns and Updates The CLA is the first Mercedes to fully run on the company’s new in-house operating system (MB.OS). This AI-enhanced system represents a significant leap forward in automotive computing power, with each vehicle equipped with a supercomputer connected to the Mercedes-Benz Intelligent Cloud. This powerful hardware-software combination enables regular over-the-air updates for all vehicle functions – including driver assistance systems for the first time. Like your smartphone receiving new apps and extended functions, the CLA stays current with the latest features and improvements without requiring dealer visits. The fourth-generation MBUX infotainment system offers a hyper-personalized experience that learns from your habits and preferences. It features a more natural voice assistant that can handle complex, multi-step commands, such as setting navigation while adjusting climate control settings. Mercedes has collaborated with tech giants like Google and Microsoft to enhance the system’s capabilities while maintaining its distinctive user interface. The system also features improved energy efficiency, with over-the-air updates consuming significantly less power than previous generations—an important consideration for electric vehicles where every bit of range matters. For audiophiles, the CLA offers an optional Burmester 3D Surround Sound System with Dolby Atmos technology. The system features 16 speakers and an 850-watt amplifier, with silver chrome covers for the tweeters and midrange speakers enhancing the interior’s visual appeal. Mercedes has also developed a holistic “SoundExperience” with various sound worlds for a customized acoustic setup. These include existing options like “Silver Waves,” “Vivid Flux,” “Serene Breeze,” and “Roaring Pulse,” plus two new sound worlds: “Fractal Fusion” (combining nostalgic 80s arcade game sounds with modern synth textures) and “Granular Fuzz” (featuring guitar sounds, orchestral elements, and electronic effects). Powerful Electric and Hybrid Options The CLA launches with two electric versions: the CLA 250+ with EQ Technology (268 hp) and the CLA 350 4MATIC with EQ Technology (349 hp). The top model accelerates from 0-60 mph in just 4.8 seconds. Both electric models feature advanced 800-volt electrical architecture for faster charging. Up to 325 kilometers (about 202 miles) of range can be added in just 10 minutes at DC fast-charging stations. The total range reaches up to 792 kilometers (492 miles) on the WLTP cycle. The electric drivetrain itself is an impressive engineering achievement, achieving 93% efficiency from battery to wheels. The motor uses magnets arranged in a double-V shape and features almost zero heavy rare earth elements compared to previous generations. Power electronics employ silicon carbide (SiC) inverter technology, the same advanced technology used in Mercedes’ groundbreaking VISION EQXX concept. For those not ready to go fully electric, Mercedes will also offer hybrid versions with 48-volt technology and an electric motor integrated into the transmission. These hybrids will be capable of all-electric driving in city conditions. Climate Innovation for Extended Range The CLA introduces a clever solution to the range-sapping problem of climate control in electric vehicles: it’s the first Mercedes to feature an air-to-air heat pump. This multi-source system can simultaneously draw heat from three sources – waste heat from the electric drivetrain, the battery, and ambient air. By harvesting “free” heat that would otherwise be wasted, the system requires only one-third of the energy a traditional auxiliary heater would need for the same output. This directly translates to extended driving range, especially in colder conditions when electric vehicles typically suffer from reduced efficiency. Practical Storage Solutions Reimagined The electric CLA brings back a feature not seen in a Mercedes since the 1930s—the “frunk” (front trunk). This isn’t just a nostalgic nod to the brand’s history but a genuinely useful addition that addresses a common complaint about modern cars: a lack of practical storage. The frunk provides approximately 2.5 cubic feet of additional cargo space, perfect for storing charging cables, emergency kits, or small bags without taking up valuable main trunk space. This front storage compartment is particularly useful for items you want quick access to without opening the main trunk. Meanwhile, the rear trunk offers a generous 14.3 cubic feet of cargo space, giving the CLA real-world practicality that many compact electric vehicles lack. The thoughtful division of storage areas means you can organize your belongings more efficiently – keeping frequently used items in the frunk while reserving the larger rear trunk for bigger items or luggage. Inside the cabin, the floating center console design isn’t just visually appealing and creates additional storage opportunities. The console features an integrated double cup holder and optional wireless smartphone charging cradle, keeping essential items within easy reach while maintaining the clean, uncluttered aesthetic. Sustainable Materials Mercedes has focused on sustainability throughout the CLA. The interior features recycled materials, including microfiber upholstery from 100% recycled PET bottles and carpets from 100% recycled yarn. The new Mercedes-Benz CLA combines practical improvements with genuine technological innovation in a clean, modern design. With both electric and hybrid options available, it offers flexibility for different driving needs while meaningfully pushing Mercedes’ design and technology forward.",
