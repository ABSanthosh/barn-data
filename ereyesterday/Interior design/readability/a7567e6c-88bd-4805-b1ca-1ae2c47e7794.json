Not just selecting the pieces you want to incorporate, but the logistics of it too, as well as the potential cost. Thankfully, a team with a ton of interior design know-how has created a rule that can help you both save money and give you some inspiration as to where to start your search. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / FollowTheFlowStudio Decor Drawbacks The rule begins with the acknowledgment that decorating can be expensive, especially if you’re looking to introduce or replace larger pieces in your home. Not only that, but buying a whole lot of new things to fill a room is a generally more wasteful practice, especially again if you’re replacing things that aren’t at all broken. How can we go about solving both of those problems while still decorating how we want? Photo Credit: Canva Pro The Rule’s Sollution The 50/50 rule, created by Orgean interior design firm Light and Dwell, is simple. It states that, when decorating a new room, 50% of the items can be new, but the other 50% should be used, secondhand, or vintage. The main goal of this rule is sustainability. When you get a large chunk of your decor from secondhand sources, you’re helping cut back on unnecessary manufacturing and thus the environmental pollution that comes with it. You’re also helping keep a lot of items out of landfills by giving it a new life in your home. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / Andy_Dean_Photog The Personal Benefit But it does have the added benefit of being cheaper, too. Buying secondhand is often far less expensive than buying brand new. You might have to hunt for a particular piece you want, and you may have to put in some extra legwork to get it home, but that’s all part of the journey of decorating your space! Photo Credit: Envato Elements / FollowTheFlowStudio Not to mention that it’s simply stylish. Many vintage items, especially mid-century modern pieces, are really popular right now. They have a timeless quality to them that’s also extremely flexible, so you’ll be able to use it then reuse it again and again against a multitude of backdrops. What Of Which? But how do you know which items you should be buying new and which can be found secondhand, and which should you shop for first? Molly Kidd, principal designer at Light and Dwell, says that it’s best to start with the new items, as they’re more likely to be your focal points. She suggests that upholstry, rugs, and other textiles are often best purchased new and should be the primary focus. Photo Credit: Canva Pro Meanwhile, smaller items can often be found secondhand. This means smaller furniture pieces like side tables and lamps, but also decor items like mirrors, artwork, and dishware. Don’t just go looking for things that are in pristine condition either, don’t be afraid to fall for something that looks worn or lived in. That’s where all the character is! Ultimately, how you do your 50/50 split is up to you. Start big then work small, and enjoy the series of treasure hunts you’ll get to go on along the way!
