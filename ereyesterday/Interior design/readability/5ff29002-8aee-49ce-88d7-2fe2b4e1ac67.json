  "text": "In the heart of Palm Desert, one of California’s celebrated architectural landmarks has been reborn with renewed vibrancy and purpose. The Miles C. Bates “Wave House,” famed for its signature sweeping roofline and avant-garde design, gives nod to the past while transforming into a dynamic space to be lived in, thanks to a groundbreaking partnership between Design Within Reach (DWR) and vacation rental platform Boutique. This isn’t your average rental home. The newly unveiled DWR x Boutique Rental Home invites guests to experience the intersection of architecture, furniture, and fashion in an intimate, immersive setting. It marks the first time that DWR has launched an experiential rental home – an innovative step that brings modern design to life in a tangible, livable way. The Wave House, originally constructed in 1955 by architect Walter S. White, is a striking example of organic modernism. Its curved roof – an architectural gesture mirroring the San Jacinto Mountains – sets it apart from the many mid-century homes scattered across the Coachella Valley. Initially created as both a residence and a creative studio for artist Miles C. Bates, the home quickly became a cultural escape for artists and thinkers of the era. After a meticulous restoration by Stayner Architects, the house was reopened to the public in 2020, reclaiming its place as a Palm Desert landmark. Today, it stands not only on the National Register of Historic Places but also as a city-designated historical site. With the latest transformation, it enters a new chapter – one where guests can step directly into a curated environment where the lines between home, gallery, and showroom blur. The project coincides with the launch of DWR Presents: The Paul Smith Collection, a vibrant fusion of iconic modern furniture and the renowned British designer’s playfully sophisticated textile designs, created in collaboration with Maharam. This exclusive collection introduces limited-edition versions of mid-century classics – such as Eames Molded Plastic Chairs and Saarinen Womb Chairs – reupholstered in whimsical, richly colored fabrics that celebrate pattern, contrast, and personality. From bold plaids and textured stripes to energetic polka dots, Paul Smith’s signature aesthetic is on full display, giving the home a distinctive character that reflects both its heritage and its evolution. The result is a dialogue between two design eras, brought together by a shared commitment to craft, quality, and storytelling. “Our goal was not just to furnish a space, but to create a complete experience,” says Omar Nobil, Senior Vice President Creative Director at DWR. “The Wave House, with its daring architecture and expressive form, provides the perfect canvas for a collection that’s all about unexpected harmony – between color, material, and design legacy.” By teaming up with Boutique – a vacation rental platform known for its design-centric properties around the globe – DWR ensures that this vision extends beyond aesthetics. Guests are not just observers; they are participants in a fully designed experience. Each room, each piece of furniture, each accent has been chosen not just to look beautiful, but to feel meaningful in use. For Boutique, whose global portfolio includes over 1,500 architecturally significant homes, the collaboration is a natural extension of their mission to elevate travel through great design. “We’ve always believed that where you stay should be as inspiring as where you go,” says Marc Blazer, CEO and Co-Founder of Boutique. “Partnering with DWR, who shares our passion for thoughtful, expressive design, allows us to create a space where travelers can connect with creativity on a deeper level.” The interior of the Wave House showcases the synergy between comfort and curation. Outdoors, sleek furnishings are set against the sculptural desert landscape, enhancing the property’s harmony with nature. Inside, bedrooms are wrapped in soft, layered textiles, offering tactile comfort alongside visual delight. Every detail – down to the placement of objects and the integration of color – has been considered to reflect the ethos of both brands. This initiative signals a shift in how brands like DWR think about customer engagement. Rather than limit interactions to retail environments, they’re offering design lovers a chance to live with the pieces, to understand their proportions, materials, and moods in the context of daily life. It’s about putting modern design within reach – quite literally. Whether you’re an architecture enthusiast, a design professional, or simply a traveler looking for inspiration, this one-of-a-kind destination offers a glimpse into the possibilities of modern living – rooted in history, redefined by creativity. Bookings for the DWR x Boutique rental are now open until August 31, 2025, and all furnishings featured in the space are available for purchase at dwr.com. Photography courtesy of DWR.
