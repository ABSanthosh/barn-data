  "description": "Much like the beloved homewares and apparel label Kip\u0026Co that she co-founded in 2012, the family home of Hayley Pannekoecke is all kinds of wonderful. Hayley and her husband James Pannekoecke purchased the 1990s Barwon Heads home in 2021, kickstarting a major renovation designed and built by the couple. Almost everything was replaced in the process, making way for an American oak timber canvas, layered with Hayley’s signature use of fun fabrics and playful colour.",

  "text": "Kip\u0026Co co-founder Hayley Pannekoecke and her husband James Pannekoecke weren’t even looking to move when this Barwon Heads home came up for sale. The couple and their three children were already living nearby, yet they ‘couldn’t resist’ this property, located close to the sea and with views of the river. Built in the 1990s, the house was screaming for some love, but Hayley and James could see its potential. ‘We were the right people for the job,’ Hayley says. Hayley designed a major overhaul of the house, requiring the family to move into a new studio on site during the construction phase. ‘The standout memory would have to be living in the little studio during the build,’ says Hayley. ‘The kids were a bit younger and it was genuinely such a memorable time as we were literally living on top of each other. Lots of fun and frustration, chats in bed at night, and lots of laughs.’ James built the main house renovation, gutting the house back to its floor, joists, and staircase in the process. ‘We replaced everything,’ says Hayley. ‘James spent 12 months working full time on the property with a great team of carpenters and tradesmen. We envisioned a cedar shingled coastal home built with plenty of texture, natural light, and colour.’ The style of the home is ‘Scandinavian design with a Mediterranean edge’ featuring a warm base of American oak applied liberally across the flooring, ceiling, and kitchen joinery. Hayley says the use of colour is ‘quite restrained’ by her standards, although there are plans for more pastel tones and wallpaper to be added into the predominantly soft pink, green, mustard, and blue interior palette. The pink main bathroom is a highlight with its green onyx vanity, microcement walls, and terrazzo tile floors. ‘It’s feminine and feels a little like a bathroom in an Italian villa,’ Hayley says. ‘Just enough colour and French gold trims!’ Hayley and James have renovated multiple houses together over the years, but this project holds a special place in their heart. Every corner has been designed and custom built by the couple specifically with their three children Chloe (17), Baye (15) and Floyd (14) in mind, supporting the ‘simple life’ they love so much on Victoria’s Bellarine Peninsula. ‘It’s our home — it’s not just a renovation or a new build,’ says Hayley. ‘We designed and built it ourselves so it’s extra special.’",
