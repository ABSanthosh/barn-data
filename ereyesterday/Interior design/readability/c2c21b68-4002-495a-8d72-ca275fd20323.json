  "description": "The owners of this inner-city Melbourne townhouse have lived in the 1990s property for over 20 years. Their original house had minimal insulation, ineffective ventilation, and was poorly constructed, so by 2021, it was time for a complete rebuild. Field Office Architecture went back to the drawing board, literally rebuilding the house from the ground up to overcome its structural issues and lack of privacy, while navigating the 5.5-metre wide side (with high neighbouring properties and no northern aspect). The new Burnley home balances stillness and retreat, creating a home that feels expansive yet intimate, and light-filled yet deeply grounded.",

  "text": "By 2021, the 1990s townhouse (one of two identical side-by-side properties) on this Burnley, Melbourne site was suffering issues far beyond its age. The current owners knew firsthand, having living property for over 20 years with their three now teenage children. ‘The home suffered from extreme temperature fluctuations, feeling freezing in winter and very hot in summer,’ says Chris Barnes, director of Field Office Architecture. ‘There were also significant maintenance issues. Rising damp had begun to take hold in several rooms, and the bathrooms — poorly ventilated and cheaply finished — had deteriorated, with tiles peeling from the walls.’ The social nature of the family owners was also not catered for in the original design. Chris explains, ‘They envisioned a home where friends could drop in and feel instantly comfortable. A space that could effortlessly accommodate gatherings, whether it was a casual weeknight dinner or a larger get together. ‘As their children grew older, they wanted the house to be a place where their teenagers felt encouraged to bring friends over — a warm, inviting environment that fostered connection, rather than a space they wanted to escape from.’ The owners engaged Field Office Architecture who designed a complete rebuild to address these issues and ultimately create a more light-filled and generous feeling home. Their most significant challenge was designing a functional and spacious family townhouse within the constraints of a 5.5 metre-wide site (169 square metres total) oriented east-west and flanked by high neighbouring properties. These parameters limited the home’s proximity to natural light, and posed privacy concerns. Field Office Architecture’s design responds to these constraints by carving out pockets of light, using an open staircase that doubles as a lightwell from the rooftop deck, as well as a smaller lightwell and strategically placed skylights to filter daylight throughout the interiors. The use of full-height glazing in key locations, combined with layered screening elements, helps frame views and create a sense of openness without direct exposure to neighbouring properties. A rooftop deck adds to this experience, giving the family outdoor space to take in the city beyond. Chris describes the core of the project as a balance of stillness and retreat — ‘a home that feels expansive yet intimate, light-filled yet deeply grounded.’ A warm, understated material palette of timber joinery and ceilings, textured recycled brick walls, and polished concrete floors reinforces these tactile, grounded qualities. Externally, the home is wrapped in stained black timber cladding that enhances privacy and depth, while semi-transparent screening elements allow for filtered light and layered views. ‘The overall colour palette is earthy and restrained, allowing the interplay of light, shadow, and texture to bring depth and atmosphere,’ says Chris. The rebuild has significantly improved the energy efficiency of the home. With double glazing, passive solar design, and high insulation levels, the house relies minimally on mechanical heating and cooling, and achieves a 7.5 star NatHERS rating. There’s also a greywater recycling system, and a 6.6kW solar array on the rooftop deck. Chris says the home is now a natural hub for social connection that will support the owners’ children as they transition from teens to adults.",
