  "description": "After 20 years of residence, the owners of this Malvern home were seeking a renovation to mark their new phase of life post children moving out. The Federation house needed some functional upgrades in the ‘90s extension, and a new material palette created the opportunity for surprise. Aiming for the feel of a chic Milanese apartment, the renovation by Studio Ceravolo introduces an interesting use of soft colour across the interior design and styling. Almost every room features tiles on the floor, fireplace, joinery or walls, amounting to over 60,000 individual tiles!",

  "text": "In renovating their Malvern family home of two decades, the owners were seeking a more calming and luxurious space. Their architect, Studio Ceravolo, felt strongly that the material selection reflect this. ‘A material representation of a new stage of life for the owners, and for the house itself,’ as Rosanna Ceravolo, director of Studio Ceravolo, describes it. Both the structurally sound original section of the Federation house, and reworked rear, were cosmetically renovated. From a materiality perspective, Studio Ceravolo were keen to eschew the ‘archetypal timber flooring’ and create a ‘carpet’ of small format stone pavers as a consistent and grounding feature throughout all spaces, including the exterior. ‘We wanted the owners to experience a sensory journey throughout the home each day and surmised the flooring was the best way to do this,’ says Rosanna. ‘The pavers would do in plan what the full height and breadth glazing would do in elevation – create an expansive and energising effect.’ The use of small format tiles continues across feature joinery, fireplaces, and in both bathrooms, exploring subtle colour blocking and textural layering to great effect. ‘I’m estimating around 60,000-65,000 floor tiles were used throughout… that’s a lot!’ says Rosanna. ‘In early conversations with the client, we discussed the home evoking a chic Milanese apartment feeling and I think we kind of achieved that.’ Structural changes to the layout were made to support a more leisurely way of life, and connect to both the front and rear gardens. ‘We configured the garden-interfacing living zones to create an optimised layout that takes full advantage of the space and garden aspect,’ says Rosanna. ‘We introduced a series of defined, self contained zones which form part of a larger cohesive space.’ Small moments inspire joy in daily rituals, such as a dedicated bar area for a whisky, a serene front room for entertaining friends, and a generous en suite for the main downstairs bedroom. ‘The joinery throughout the kitchen and lounge areas is highly considered, and packed with utility, however it was important that these areas retained a sense of ease and a casual quality whilst being suggestive of function,’ says Rosanna. The biggest challenge of the project was for the tiler and builder, ensuring thousands of small format tiles could be set out within the parameters of a 100-year-old building. It was all worth it, with the outcome surpassing the clients’ expectations. ‘They really love it… and they are constantly discovering new things they love about it,’ says Rosanna. ‘I think that is the best compliment you can get as an architect.’",
