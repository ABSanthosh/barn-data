  "text": "I can hardly believe the day is finally here! After months of dreaming, designing, and pouring so much heart into each detail, I‚Äôm so excited to finally introduce you to my newest launch ‚Äî the Cozy Cottage by Liz Marie collection, now available on QVC! This collection was truly inspired by everything I love most ‚Äî pieces that bring comfort, charm, and a little sprinkle of nostalgia to your home. I designed each item to feel like a warm hug, a slow morning, or a quiet afternoon spent in a cozy corner ‚Äî the moments that make home home. Whether you‚Äôre styling your kitchen for spring, refreshing your front porch, or looking for timeless pieces to treasure year-round, I hope you fall in love with these cottage-inspired finds just as much as I have. Let me walk you through each of the pieces in the collection ‚Äî and I‚Äôll share a few ways I‚Äôve already started using them around our farmhouse!Part One: For the Heart of the Home Our homes tell a story, and I wanted to create pieces that add whimsy and warmth to the spaces where we gather most. This little collection is packed with vintage-inspired charm that will make any room feel extra cozy.The Teapot Vase: This sweet ceramic piece was made for fresh blooms and wildflower cuttings, but it‚Äôs just as beautiful styled on a shelf or used as a centerpiece. It‚Äôs like a little garden party in vase form. The Cabbage Teapot + Cabbage Sugar Bowl \u0026 Creamer Set: These are pure joy. A nod to classic English cottage style, they bring so much charm to tea time ‚Äî or just your everyday coffee ritual. I styled mine on a kitchen tray with a few vintage spoons and a candle‚Ä¶ instant cozy. Set of 4 Cabbage Teacups: I couldn‚Äôt launch a tea set without including these! Delicate, detailed, and perfect for sipping something warm while curled up with a book. Bonus: they make the cutest display on open shelves. Set of 4 Napkins: Soft, simple, and just the right amount of detail. These linen-blend napkins add a sweet cottage touch to your dining table, whether it‚Äôs a quiet breakfast or Sunday dinner with the family.Part Two: For Your Cozy Corners üåøWhether you‚Äôre setting up a sunny nook or adding charm to your entryway, these next pieces were made to bring form and function together in the dreamiest way.Vintage Woven Wood Picnic Basket: This might be my favorite piece of the entire collection! Inspired by vintage flea market finds, it‚Äôs perfect for spring picnics, blanket storage, or even styled as a decorative piece under a console table. I love layering it with books and a throw for that collected-over-time look. Foldable Bench + Bench Cushion: We designed this bench to be versatile, cozy, and beautiful ‚Äî all at once. Use it at the foot of the bed, in your mudroom, or even out on the porch. The matching cushion adds a layer of comfort and softness that just feels like home. Double Ball Topiary with Pot: Faux greenery is a forever favorite of mine ‚Äî and this topiary adds a classic, polished touch without any of the upkeep. I love how it frames a front door or brings life to a mantel or bookshelf.This launch is more than just a product line ‚Äî it‚Äôs a little extension of my heart. Every piece in the Cozy Cottage collection was thoughtfully designed to bring timeless charm into your home. It‚Äôs all about layering beauty with function, and creating that ‚Äúahhh, I‚Äôm home‚Äù feeling we all crave.So grab a teacup, light a candle, and come browse the full collection now over on QVC!
