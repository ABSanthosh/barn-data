  "text": "Palm Springs presents itself as the perfect place where residential architecture may dare to defy convention with steel expanses juxtaposed against natural stone, angular planes, and volumetric spaces that embrace their vistas. And it boasts a significant inventory of mid-century modern gems waiting to be appreciated by current audiences. Through careful intervention, interior designer Stephanie Brown makes contemporary this idyllic Indian Wells Vacation Home just outside the city proper. With a refreshed structure, subtle treatments, and surfaces awash in desert hues, it stuns as it once did in a bygone era. A series of piecemeal renovations left the property feeling dated: ceramic flooring that had to go; defunct fireplaces; poor space planning; and an inefficient kitchen layout. The reimagined home is a sizable project for the area, a sprawling 2,200 square feet spread across one level with tendrils extending into the landscape, which meld seamlessly into the adjacent golf course grounds. Exterior features enhancing the experience include an entry courtyard that pulls focus up to the sky, generous patios, and a pool in the rear with an amorphous edge like a pond. The main interior programming comprises an open living, dining, and kitchen space situated around a central core element that houses a wood-burning fireplace and media accoutrement. The more private spaces include three bedrooms and three bathrooms that enjoy the same luxuries as their public counterparts. Access to light, sight lines, and fresh air are prioritized at the turn of every corner. Poorly used space is consolidated, built-in millwork now occupies a few former fireplaces, and the reworked kitchen accommodates proper entertaining. Guests may gather around a long island, stop by the coffee station, or unwind at the bar located between the dining and living rooms. “We wanted the interior to feel warm, calming, and clean. Discovering similar mid-century interiors boasting an all-neutral palette proved to be an exciting endeavor,” Brown shares. “At first, I scoured Palm Springs for design inspiration, but the bright colors and kitschy styles didn’t align with our vision.” A vision lovingly referred to as “Casa Sand Dune.” Instead, the team referenced contemporary design in Mexico and Australia, which share a modern ethos and showcase monochromatic palettes paired with simple, natural materials such as textural stone and warm woods. The new walls are bathed in sunlight, breathing life into soft parchment tones that grace the primary surfaces – walls, floors, and countertops. The muted palette and finely tailored finishing details allow for a layering of expressive materials through home furnishings that invite warmth in a rebuke of sterility often associated with minimalism. Given the hot climate and nature living al fresco, Brown used large-format porcelain tile throughout the home, which feels cool underfoot and is extremely durable. Subtle shifts in other wet areas are marked with the introduction of soft terrazzo marble and a textural wall of zellige terracotta. She also chose melamine walnut cabinetry throughout, due to its resistance to weathering from extreme heat and sunshine. The fireplace is celebrated as a focal point wrapped entirely in walnut paneling with a hearth articulated by fluted concrete tiles. While the completed dwelling adds to the storied architectural history of Palm Springs, Brown leaves her mark on a rich tradition of mid-century modern design with a fresh interpretation of this timeless sensibility.
