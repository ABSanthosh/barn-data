After all, we’re definitely more interested in the taste of our drink, unaware that the material our glass or cup is made of can actually have an adverse effect on the very taste we’re so fixated on. And that glass you’re drinking from? It might not even be pure glass but mixed with some metals to reinforce the material, metals that also affect the taste or, worse, affect our bodies. If you’re searching for the perfect glassware, you don’t have to look far because we have just the perfect design for this very purpose. Stunningly beautiful and faithful to your flavors, this small piece of glassware is able to recreate the magnificent Aurora lights right in your hand, turning every sip into a memorable experience.

Drinking glasses are a common sight in many households, whether they’re for “regular” beverages or alcoholic drinks. Clear as they might appear, some of these are mixed with some metals to produce certain colors or effects. And while these metals aren’t so dangerous to our health, they do have negative effects on the taste of the drink. It is almost as if you can’t combine beauty and taste in a glass, but that theory has been proven false with PROGRESS’ Rex Rock glassware. Skilled craftsmen from Shizuoka, Japan harness the same technologies and processes used in making space-grade equipment like satellites to process titanium of the highest purity to reinforce the glass and coat its inner surface. This rare form of pure titanium doesn’t release metal ions that mess with the flavor of the drink inside. In fact, it actually works to enhance the taste by breaking down unpleasant flavors. Pure titanium is also regarded to be the most human-friendly and safest kind of metal because it rarely changes over time. That means no staining, no odors, and completely hygienic. Pure titanium alone, as impressive as it already might be, isn’t enough to create an unforgettable drinking experience. This drinking glass takes the design even further by reproducing the mesmerizing colors of the rainbow and of the majestic Aurora lights. This feat is made possible by making extremely precise cuts and changes to the glass’ thickness down to nano levels. Pouring drink into the glass results in a shimmering effect that’s comparable to the soothing glow of the aurora, a bonfire, or a murmuring stream, imagery that calms the heart and soothes the soul. Stop worrying about the safety and taste of your drink and start enjoying the flavors and the dazzling visuals offered by this pure titanium-reinforced glassware. Whether it’s liquor, soda, or even just ice-cold water, this stunning drinking glass will turn the activity into a joyful and reinvigorating experience, rich in flavor and color.
