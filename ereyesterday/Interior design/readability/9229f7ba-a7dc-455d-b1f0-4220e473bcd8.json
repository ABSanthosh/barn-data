  "text": "Planned to ascend in Vlore, along Albania’s picturesque Riviera, The Leaves by Davide Macullo Architects is designed as an extension of its striking natural environment. This tower embodies an organic representation of nature, light, and its location, effortlessly blending into the landscape. Its form is attuned to the rolling contours of the land and the rising treetops. Composed of two interlocking volumes, the building rotates to present reflective surfaces that capture the Mediterranean light. A three-dimensional, hieratic facade featuring geometric planters allows vibrant greenery to flourish within its architecture. The use of prefabricated concrete panels, shaded in five tones to mimic the natural palette of the surrounding landscape across the four seasons, further integrates the structure into its setting. Designer: David Macullo Architects Situated in a unique location between the sea and mountains and oriented towards the sunset, the site’s geological formations significantly influence the architectural approach. The design by Davide Macullo Architects draws inspiration from the natural forces that have sculpted the landscape, such as its elevated ridges and carved valleys. This reflects a philosophy of construction in harmony with the environment rather than imposing on it. The Leaves features rotating volumes that create reflective surfaces that interact dynamically with the ever-shifting daylight. This design approach ensures that the building adapts to its surroundings throughout the day. The facade’s protruding elements also serve to deconstruct the volume, rendering it both permeable and lightweight. These projections mimic the leaves of the surrounding treetops, capturing the play of light and shadow. They provide sun protection during the hot summer months while permitting sunlight to filter into the interiors during the winter, enhancing the building’s energy efficiency and occupant comfort. To maintain a genuine connection with the Genius Loci, or the unique spirit of the place, the design consciously avoids relying on technological interventions. Instead, it achieves a focus on sustainability solely through architectural elements. This approach ensures that the building remains true to its environment and context. The floor plan is meticulously designed in a perfectly square grid, which highlights the building’s central significance and its harmonious relationship with the natural undulations of the land. This geometric precision serves as a visual and structural anchor, emphasizing the building’s role as a focal point within the landscape. The square functions as a pivotal element around which both the context and the building’s projections revolve. This clever design evokes the fluid motion of a spiral or helix, suggesting movement and dynamism. Such a configuration enhances the architectural aesthetic and reinforces the building’s integration into its surroundings, allowing it to echo the natural rhythms and forms of the landscape in which it resides.",
