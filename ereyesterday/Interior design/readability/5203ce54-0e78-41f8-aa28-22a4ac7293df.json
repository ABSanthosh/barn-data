Opened in October 2024, Creation Palette YAE™ highlights Mitsui Chemicals’ innovative range, allowing visitors to experience the distinctive capabilities of each plastic product through immersive, multisensory demonstrations.all images courtesy of UOInteractive Demonstrations of TAFNEL™, STABiO™, and SYNTEX™UO studio crafted three interactive demonstrations and designed the accompanying lab equipment, focusing on the unique characteristics of plastics like TAFNEL™, STABiO™, and SYNTEX™. These displays let visitors observe and interact with each material, presenting a glimpse into its specific properties.TAFNEL™, a non-woven fabric with hydrophobic and oil-adsorbing abilities, is used to remove oil spills in the ocean and rivers. In the demonstration, visitors pour a mix of water and oil down a three-tiered incline lined with TAFNEL™ sheets, which absorb the oil and allow only water to reach the beaker below. This setup visually highlights TAFNEL™’s impressive oil adsorption and hydrophobic properties. STABiO™ is a plant-derived polyisocyanate plastic with the transparency of glass and rubber-like flexibility. Visitors handle a 300mm-diameter large lens made of STABiO™, experiencing its glass-like transparency, and refractive index its half-weight compared to glass, and its unique flexibility. SYNTEX™, a meltblown nonwoven fabric, is employed for filtration in various fields like hygiene, medical, and automotive. Here, SYNTEX™ functions as a filter paper in a pressurized setup, where visitors stir a cocoa powder solution, which is then separated into water and powder as it passes through a thin SYNTEX™ sheet, highlighting its filtration efficiency.Lens of Phenomena showcases Mitsui Chemicals’ functional plastics through interactive design by UO studioMinimalist Design devices act as a ‘Lens’ for plastics’ propertiesThe design of these devices is minimal and unobtrusive, utilizing transparent or reflective materials to allow the product’s properties to take center stage. Each installation functions as a ‘lens’ for observing the materials’ unique phenomena directly, keeping the viewer’s focus on the material properties themselves. These hands-on experiences offer visitors a view into the scientific ingenuity behind these materials, aiming to inspire ideas for new applications and innovations in functional plastics.TAFNEL™ demonstrates its oil-adsorbing abilities by filtering oil from water on a three-tiered inclinewith hydrophobic properties, TAFNEL™ highlights solutions for oil spill cleanup in water bodies.transparent materials in each installation place full focus on each plastic’s unique phenomenaa tactile experience with STABiO™ reveals glass-like transparency and unique flexibility in a plant-derived plastic",
