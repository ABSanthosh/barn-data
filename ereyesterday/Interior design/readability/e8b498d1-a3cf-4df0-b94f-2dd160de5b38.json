  "text": "This much-loved Richmond home is on the market for only the second time in 80 years. Originally built in 1888 as a tin shop, the double-fronted Victorian residence has been carefully reimagined by current owners Bree Johnson and Steve Rowley into a modern Australian masterpiece — without losing its rich heritage charm. Bree, co-founder of Frank Body and managing partner at Willow \u0026 Blake, and Steve, CEO of Frank Body, first fell in love with the property’s vine-covered facade. ‘It’s an iconic Richmond house,’ says Bree. ‘I used to drive past and sometimes park outside. So when it popped up for sale, I jumped instantly.’ After securing the home in 2016, the couple spent two years planning their dream renovation with Therefore Studio and Loc Build. The results are spectacular. The original facade remains intact, while the rear extension offers a striking contrast — an airy, contemporary space designed for family living. ‘We basically rebuilt everything past the facade,’ Bree explains. The interiors are a considered blend of heritage and modernity, featuring sand-coloured Petersen Roman bricks, Venetian plaster beeswax walls, and off-form concrete ceilings. Natural materials were paramount, creating a home that feels both luxurious and timeless. Light is a standout feature, flooding the home through carefully positioned windows and skylights. Bree particularly loves the bespoke light fittings, which add warmth and texture to the clean architectural lines. Beyond aesthetics, this home is an urban sanctuary. ‘Richmond is energetic and bustling, but you drive into the rear garage and enter a quiet, green world’ Bree says. The leafy courtyard has played host to countless long lunches, while the upstairs deck is a favourite retreat for quiet evenings. The location is unbeatable, with some of Melbourne’s best restaurants, cafes, and parks just a short walk away. ‘This pocket of Richmond is very community-driven. I walk everywhere and say hello to three people on my way to drop the kids off at kinder’ Bree shares. After nearly a decade in the home, Bree and Steve’s growing family has led them to an exciting new project, making this a rare opportunity for a new owner to step into a home that seamlessly blends history, modern design, and lifestyle. This truly special residence won’t stay on the market for long. 167 Brighton Street, Richmond is listed with David Sciola from Jellis Craig. Expressions of interest close Tuesday 25 March at 12pm.",
