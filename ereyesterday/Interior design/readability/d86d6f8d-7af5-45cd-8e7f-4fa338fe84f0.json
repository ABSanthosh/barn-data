  "description": "At first blush this CargoMate bike rack, by German bike accessories company Flectr, doesn't look like much. But the draw is that it can be installed in 30 seconds, without tools, on any bike. The ingenuity of this design is not in the refinement of the object; with even basic tools and materials, many of us could rig something like this up in an afternoon for any individual bike. The accomplishment is in how they designed both the fast, tool-free installation and the universal fit, compensating for different styles of handlebar. A lot of work and thought clearly went into this, as you can see by how it's installed in the video: The CargoMate has been successfully Kickstarted, with 35 days left to pledge at press time. The units are going for €69 (USD $79) and should ship in October.",
