Laheq will be developed on a luxurious island and feature an artificial ring, offering visitors a unique experience. The project is designed by Foster + Partners, a renowned British architectural firm also linked to other groundbreaking Saudi developments. Described as a “Forever Garden” due to its abundant greenery, Laheq will be situated on an island off Saudi Arabia’s west coast, forming part of an archipelago of 90 islands within the wider Red Sea development. Designer: Foster + Partners The island spans 400 hectares (988 acres) and is designed around a distinctive feature called “the Ring,” an 800-meter (approximately 2,600-foot) diameter artificial structure set in the water. This impressive centerpiece will house luxury apartments and hotels, with some residences available for purchase and others offered as vacation rentals. Beyond the Ring, the island resort will feature additional upscale residences, including timber-built homes, alongside amenities such as a bustling market, diverse retail spaces, entertainment zones, a world-class golf course, and a 115-berth marina. Wellness is a central theme, with dedicated facilities aimed at promoting relaxation and health. Water sports will be a major attraction, especially diving. Visitors will have the opportunity to explore what Saudi officials describe as the world’s fourth-largest barrier reef, located nearby, and encounter over 2,000 species of fish unique to the region, making it a haven for marine life enthusiasts and adventure seekers alike. Laheq is scheduled for completion in 2028, marking another milestone in Saudi Arabia’s ambitious Red Sea giga-project. Its unveiling comes on the heels of the recently completed Desert Rock resort, further highlighting the rapid pace of development in the region. The developer, Red Sea Global, has pledged that by 2030, all operations within the Red Sea project will be powered entirely by renewable energy. Essential efforts will be made to preserve extensive mangrove areas and restore the natural coastline, demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability. Beyond the Red Sea project, Saudi Arabia is experiencing an impressive construction boom, with several visionary developments underway. Notable among them are The Line, a revolutionary linear city that forms part of the Neom giga-project, as well as Qiddiya, a sprawling entertainment city, the futuristic Mukaab, the towering JEC Tower, and other transformative projects, all contributing to the nation’s ongoing transformation. Saudi Arabia is redefining its skyline but also prioritizing environmental preservation, renewable energy, and unique visitor experiences. As these visionary projects progress toward completion, they promise to transform the region, attract international visitors, and set new standards for sustainable luxury and urban development in the Middle East and beyond.",
