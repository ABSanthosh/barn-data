  "text": "There’s something about the devotion to simplicity we see in Scandinavian design. Clean lines and muted tones make it one of the most timeless design styles. But what happens when we infuse that signature calm with some modernism? The Curated Apartment, designed by Yevheniia Dubrovska and Yuliia Olenchyn and photographed by Yevhenii Avramenko, answers that beautifully. In this space, classic Scandi principles are complemented by bold materials and sculptural lighting. Let’s walk through the Curated Apartment and look through it. The living room in the Curated Apartment is rooted in Scandinavian principles. It features a muted palette of soft neutrals, crisp whites, and pale woods. These open up the room to light and air. But what truly elevates the space is the modern twist: sculptural furniture with organic curves, a striking brass chandelier that commands the ceiling, and bold yet balanced pops of color like the sunflower-yellow lounge chair and the teal-accented reading nook.  Each piece feels hand-selected, not for the sake of trend, but for how it contributes to the room’s sense of ease. Layered textures, including the subtly graphic area rug, add just enough dimension to keep things cozy without visual clutter. The kitchen in the Curated Apartment is a visual centerpiece. At first glance, you’re drawn to the exquisite veining of the marble countertops and backsplash. These ripple like fine art across the clean-lined cabinetry. The wood tones offer warmth and natural grounding, while the fluted white upper cabinets add texture. The kitchen transitions into the dining space with a glass-front cabinet, which turns dishware into decor. Whether it’s morning coffee or evening entertaining, this kitchen holds space for both ritual and beauty. The dining nook is effortlessly cozy and light-filled. The round wooden table encourages intimate conversation. The natural linen Roman shades filter in soft daylight. Paired with simple oak chairs and a touch of greenery, this Scandi-style space is designed for slow mornings, shared meals, and everything in between. In this bedroom, the bold, dark-stained headboard anchors the space with a sense of depth. The rest of the room remains airy and open. Light oak chevron floors and a sculptural shelving unit soften the contrast. Details like the matte black mobile chandelier and the wall-mounted globe sconce add a contemporary edge. This bedroom embraces a softer side of minimalism. With layered neutrals, warm wood tones, and gentle lighting, the space feels calm. The sculptural rattan screen and curved pendant bring texture and flow. This bedroom embraces a softer side of minimalism.
