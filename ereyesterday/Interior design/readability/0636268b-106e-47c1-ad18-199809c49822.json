  "text": "Photography is an evolving craft, but certain names in the industry evoke a sense of heritage and trust. Olympus, a pioneer in imaging technology, built a legacy with its precision optics and compact camera systems. In 2021, the company transitioned its imaging division to OM Digital Solutions, marking the end of Olympus-branded cameras but not the end of its innovation. The OM System name emerged, carrying forward the DNA of the cameras that many professionals and enthusiasts have relied on for decades. Designer: OM System For those who have followed Olympus’s journey, the return of a design inspired by the OM-1 film camera is a moment worth noting. The OM System OM-3, a mirrorless interchangeable lens camera, takes cues from the past while integrating modern photographic technology. Designed with portability in mind, the camera caters to urban photographers, travelers, and content creators who appreciate both function and form. Design That Reflects Legacy The OM-3 captures the essence of classic film cameras with a compact and lightweight build. The metal body adds durability without unnecessary bulk, making it an everyday carry for photographers who prefer a versatile tool that doesn’t weigh them down. The layout of the controls ensures an intuitive experience, with tactile dials that offer direct access to exposure settings and creative adjustments. A 3.0-inch vari-angle touchscreen allows for flexible composition, capturing images at unusual angles or recording video content. The electronic viewfinder features a 2.36M-dot OLED panel, providing a sharp and responsive experience for those who prefer composing through a traditional viewfinder. With IP53-rated weather sealing, the camera resists dust and moisture, making it reliable for outdoor shooting conditions. Computational Photography at the Core Modern imaging technology extends beyond traditional exposure settings, and the OM-3 incorporates computational photography features to enhance creative possibilities. A dedicated Computational Photography Button provides quick access to tools such as Live ND, Live GND, HDR, Focus Stacking, and High-Resolution Shot Modes. These functions allow photographers to achieve professional results in-camera without requiring extensive post-processing. The Live ND and Live GND features enable long-exposure effects without the need for physical filters, a significant advantage for landscape and architectural photography. Focus Stacking ensures deep focus in macro shots, useful for capturing intricate details in product or nature photography. The High-Resolution Shot mode processes multiple frames to generate detailed images beyond the sensor’s native resolution, ideal for capturing fine textures and expansive scenes. Imaging Technology and Performance At the heart of the OM-3 is a 20.4MP stacked BSI Live MOS sensor paired with the TruePic X dual quad-core processor. This combination allows for rapid image processing and improved low-light performance. The camera features 1053 cross-type phase-detection AF points, ensuring precise autofocus across the frame. AI Detection AF further enhances subject recognition, identifying human faces, birds, pets, trains, motorcycles, and other moving subjects. The camera’s 5-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) provides up to 7.5 stops of compensation, reducing motion blur for handheld shooting. This feature benefits both still photography and video capture, making it possible to shoot in lower light conditions without sacrificing sharpness. Versatile Shooting Modes The OM-3 offers multiple shooting modes to adapt to different creative needs. Silent Sequential Shooting enables bursts at up to 120 fps, which is ideal for action photography where capturing a precise moment matters. Pro Capture mode allows for pre-shutter activation, ensuring that fleeting instances are not missed. For astrophotography enthusiasts, the Starry Sky AF function provides accurate focus on celestial bodies without requiring manual adjustments. Customizable profiles for monochrome and color aesthetics give photographers greater control over their creative output, making it easy to develop a unique visual style straight from the camera. Video Capabilities for Content Creators While photography remains the core focus, the OM-3 also caters to filmmakers and content creators. The camera supports 4K recording at 60 fps with internal 10-bit H.265 encoding, ensuring high-quality footage without excessive file sizes. The OM-Cinema profiles introduce a professional-grade color profile system, allowing videographers to achieve distinct cinematic looks in-camera. Heat management is engineered to allow extended recording sessions without the risk of thermal shutdown. The camera transitions seamlessly between still photography and video, offering dedicated settings for each mode through a simple dial adjustment. A System Built for Expansion The OM System OM-3 is compatible with a broad range of M.Zuiko lenses, including new additions designed to complement the camera’s capabilities. Alongside its launch, OM Digital Solutions introduced the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 17mm F1.8 II and 25mm F1.8 II prime lenses. These lenses feature weather-sealed designs, fast apertures, and quiet autofocus, making them ideal for both photography and video applications. For those seeking extended reach, the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 100-400mm F5.0-6.3 IS II offers a 35mm-equivalent focal length of 200-800mm, with the option to extend to 1600mm using teleconverters. This super-telephoto zoom lens incorporates 5-axis Sync IS, providing up to 7 stops of stabilization for handheld shooting. With an IPX1-rated weather-sealed design, it is built for wildlife and sports photographers who require durability in harsh conditions. Pricing and Availability The OM System OM-3 will be available in late February 2025, with a suggested retail price of $1,999.99 USD. A bundled kit featuring the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 12-45mm F4 PRO lens will be priced at $2,299.99 USD. The M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 17mm F1.8 II and 25mm F1.8 II lenses will retail for $549.99 and $499.99 USD, respectively. The 100-400mm F5.0-6.3 IS II lens will be priced at $1,499.99 USD. The OM-3 continues the legacy of photography while addressing the needs of modern creators. The design follows the aesthetics of classic Olympus film cameras, appealing to those who appreciate tactile, deliberate shooting. Its advanced imaging capabilities and computational photography tools provide photographers and videographers with a complete creative solution. For those who have followed Olympus through its decades of innovation, the OM System OM-3 is a nod to the past while embracing the future. It is a camera built for those who appreciate the craft, the process, and the joy of making images that tell a story.",
