  "description": "When the owner of this property in Nungurner, East Gippsland first saw it come up for sale, she was enchanted. But having just bought a place in Mallacoota, she had to pass it up. The next time it came up for sale, just two years later, she jumped at the chance to be its next owner. Now, after almost six years of enjoying its breathtaking waterfront location, she’s decided to put her slice of paradise on the market. See more below!",

  "text": "Something you’ll often hear when you enter the market to buy a home is ‘don’t buy the first one you see’. It’s exactly what the owner of this Nungurner home was told before she went to view the property for sale — and it’s exactly what happened. It’s not hard to see why. The half acre property comprises two unique homes — The Tea House (main house) and The Little House — with views over the lake and across to Bass Strait that offer an immediate sense of calm. The main house, which according to the owner was once a tea house for the passing steamboat passengers, is a simple weatherboard cottage built over 100 years ago. It’s since had three owners and has been renovated to bring it into modern living. Among the most notable changes are the floor-to-ceiling picture windows that sit in place across the entire front of both homes, taking in the views of the water. ‘We finished off the house, making it a home,’ says the owner, referencing the additions of reclaimed European oak flooring, travertine tiles in the renovated bathrooms, and the cosmetic transformation of the kitchen. She’s also installed solar panels on the roof and created an abundant garden full of vegetables and fruit trees. ‘We repurposed where we could… we love the lived-in feeling and the wabi sabi nature of beautifully aged objects in keeping with a sense of history,’ she says. The Little House, which was placed on the property by previous owners as a salvation army hall, has also served time as a boutique Airbnb. The cosy home has undergone a similar treatment to The Tea House, with reclaimed items, large windows and an enviable connection out to the water beyond. Life out here is just as you’d imagine it would be, says the owner. From the patio you can see everything from the changing weather roll in to dolphins swimming, sea eagles soaring and at night, the stars shine bright. After almost six years of living here the owner has made the decision to put her beloved slice of paradise on the market, the owner says she’ll miss the views beyond every picture window, the wood fire burning on a cold winter’s evening, and getting fresh fish from the trawlers in Lakes Entrance. This Nungurner property is listed for sale with Casey Skipp from Bill Wyndham \u0026 C0. Expressions of interest close December 10.",
