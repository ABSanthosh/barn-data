I hope you are enjoying your July 4th weekend. It has been a leisurely one for me as I am enjoying simply sitting out on our gazebo and watching all the boaters having fun on the water over the holiday weekend. With the 4th being on a Friday, I didn’t get as much as I had planned to get done last week. Even though it was quiet on the blog, I did make good progress on my current project for my kitchen that I told you about last week. I am determined to get it done so stayed tuned. Now onto the links I found this week. Something to Think About It is getting hard to figure out what is real anymore. Can you spot the A.I. fakes? I only got 2 right.

The warm and calm feeling of being safe and content in my own comfy space. I just love it.
