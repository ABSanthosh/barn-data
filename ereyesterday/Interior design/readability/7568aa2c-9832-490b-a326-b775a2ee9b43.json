  "description": "Designer Joanna Barlow of MacCormick Architects had ‘the best time ever’ renovating her sister Lucinda’s family home of 15 years. The siblings’ only challenge throughout the project: keeping their excitement under control! Numerous meetings at the beach inspired the home you see today, featuring a fearless use of colour inspired by Lucinda’s zest for life. A second storey oriented north invites more light and space into the Bronte home, whilst remaining true to its original California bungalow architecture.",
