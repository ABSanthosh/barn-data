  "description": "We often hear that a rug is ‘an anchor’ for your space: it’s the thing that helps tie a room and all its furnishings together. But what about styling a round rug? Are the rules different? And where do these work best? In honour of Armadillo’s new Soft Geometry collection, we asked co-founders Jodie Fried and Sally Pottharst for their expert advice on how a round rug can make your room shine.",

  "text": "Styling a space is all about playing with shape and form, which sometimes means thinking a little outside the box — literally. This is where round rugs come into play. Opting for a circular piece over its rectangular counterpart can instantly bring a sense of calm, or help soften the rigid geometry of a typical room. Enduring Australian rug brand Armadillo has just launched a new collection Soft Geometry that champions the underrated beauty of rounded rugs and organic lines. ‘We love how a round rug can change the conversation in a room,’ Armadillo co-founder Sally Pottharst says. ‘It doesn’t pull towards corners or walls. Rather, it centres and connects, and that sense of circular movement can give a space breathing room.’ The new range reveals five beautiful designs, all crafted from natural materials. For example, the Nimbus is carefully hand-coiled from twisted strands of New Zealand wool, then double-stitched with natural jute for a soft sculptural profile. While Braid reveals a hand-plaited wool blend in a tight elegant coil; the Luna features a marbled, braided construction. Armadillo co-founder Jodie Fried says the key to styling a round rug is simply about striking a harmony between ‘rug, space and furniture.’ Where round rugs work Just like any good rug, a round rug should anchor the space it sits in. ‘Whether that’s a dining setting, a lounge arrangement, or a quiet corner. You want the scale to feel deliberate,’ Jodie adds. Sally says they work for anywhere you want to ‘guide flow’ without blocking off the space. This could be in an a kid’s room, entranceway, reading nook, informal dining settings, but they also shine in unexpected places. Simply adding a round rug to a bare corner of a open-plan living room, or under a favourite armchair helps add character and subtly define a space — even if it’s not in the centre of the room. Consider the silhouettes of your furniture While round rugs work equally well in small or large spaces, it’s more important to place it with the right furniture. ‘There’s a beautiful synergy between a round table and a round rug, they really echo one another,’ Sally explains. ‘I find they suit furniture with softness in the silhouette, such as curved backs, rounded corners, woven textures.’ That said, she notes the contrast of a round rug beneath more angular pieces can also feel incredibly modern and fresh with the right proportions. Picking the right colour and texture This one just comes down to functionality. For instance, a lower pile rug is best for under a dining table, to avoid any putting chair legs on an undulating surface. Meanwhile, something more tactile underfoot is beautiful in a lounge, for more solid pieces like a coffee table. Jodie explains that a round rug is also a great opportunity to add newfound colour to a space. ‘A round rug gives you permission to be a little playful because the shape already softens the statement,’ she adds. ‘Earthy and neutral tones tend to dissolve beautifully into a space, while stronger hues can be used to draw the eye.’ Shop new arrivals online here and in Armadillo’s Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Adelaide Showrooms.",
