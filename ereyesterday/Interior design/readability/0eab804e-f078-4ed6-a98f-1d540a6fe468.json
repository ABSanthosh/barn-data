Whether you’re redesigning a single room or a whole house, it’s easy to make a few mistakes along the way, it’s all part of the process! Let’s go over some of the most common design fails people run into so you know what to avoid next time you’re decorating a space. 1. Overcrowding a Room It’s tempting to fill a room with furniture and decor to make it feel “complete,” but too many pieces just makes the space feel cramped and chaotic. It’s important to have some breathing room between major pieces or sections. A simple rule is to choose fewer, higher-quality, more meaningful items to populate a room. A little space goes a long way in creating balance. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / 2designbcn 2. Not Considering Scale and Proportions It’s easy to choose furniture that looks good in the store, but fitting it into a room requires attention to size and scale. A huge couch in a small living room or a tiny coffee table in a large space can make the room feel off-balance. Take measurements and visualize how the furniture will fill the space before committing, as scale can either greatly improve or ruin a room’s flow. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / pro_creator 3. Overusing One Color Choosing one main color for a room seems like a good idea on its face, but using only one color can make the space feel monotonous and dull, even if it’s something bright like yellow or pink. Even in a room that’s largely a neutral color, small pops of bold colors can really elevate the feel from amateur to professional design. Think about contrast, color theory, and how colors interact with each other when picking out a room’s palette (and do make sure it’s a full palette, not just one color).

Not Allowing Enough Natural Light Natural light makes a room feel airy, inviting, and just downright beautiful, but many people make the mistake of blocking windows with heavy drapes or large furniture. This can make the space feel dark and closed off. Try to maximize natural light by using lighter curtains, blinds, or even sheer fabrics that let sunlight through. If privacy is a concern, opt for window films or clever plant placements instead. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / rushay1977 5. Not Considering Traffic Flow Considering traffic flow in your layout is necessary for making a room comfortable to live in. It’s easy to make the mistake of arranging furniture without thinking about how people will move through the space. If there’s not enough room to walk comfortably or if furniture blocks key paths, the space will feel awkward and cramped. Make sure there’s enough open space between pieces for easy movement and access to doors and windows. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / krisprahl 6. Over-decorating or Under-decorating Finding the balance between too much and too little decoration is tricky. Some people go overboard, filling every inch of space with decorative items, while others leave their walls and surfaces too bare to the point that it feels clinical. The fix to both of these is looking at inspiration and seeing how they handle their decor, so find examples of rooms you’d like yours to model and study their choices. That way you’ll get an idea of how much decor is the right amount for the style you’re hoping to capture.

Decorating a room isn’t necessarily about getting everything perfect, but creating a space where you feel comfortable and happy, with mistakes along the way being part of the process.
