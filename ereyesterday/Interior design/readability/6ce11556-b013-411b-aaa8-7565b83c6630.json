These residences will showcase a striking blend of state-of-the-art 3D printing technology alongside conventional construction methods, featuring two-story designs. This ambitious project is a joint effort between Icon and the Michael Hsu Office of Architecture and will be situated in Austin’s Mueller community. It joins the increasing trend of 3D-printed architectural developments in the United States, alongside noteworthy projects like Wolf Ranch and Community First! Village. Designer: Icon x Michael Hsu Office of Architecture The upcoming homes will offer a variety of floorplans catering to diverse preferences and needs, with sizes ranging from 650 to 2,400 square feet (approximately 60 to 222 square meters). These residences will include options with one to three bedrooms, allowing potential buyers to select a layout that best suits their lifestyle. The pricing for these homes will start at approximately $350,000 and can extend up to $1.3 million, depending on the size, finishes, and additional options selected. There are plans to introduce more affordable housing options shortly, aiming to accommodate a broader range of buyers. The architectural renderings suggest that the homes will emphasize the unique blend of construction methods. The distinct ribbed texture on the lower floors will showcase the 3D-printed aspect of the build, setting these homes apart from traditional constructions. Inside, the homes will offer open, spacious layouts that are flooded with natural light, owing to the extensive use of large windows. This design approach enhances the aesthetic appeal while creating a warm and inviting atmosphere, prioritizing comfort and livability. The construction of these innovative homes will rely on Icon’s proprietary Vulcan model 3D printers, which are pivotal to the project’s futuristic approach. These advanced printers will be deployed on-site to create the foundational first story of each residence. This is achieved by extruding a specially formulated cement-like mixture through a nozzle and building the structure in layers to form a sturdy shell. Once the 3D printing phase is complete, human builders will be called upon to add the second story. This phase of construction will utilize traditional building techniques, although specific details about this stage have not yet been fully disclosed. Besides constructing the upper levels, the human builders will be responsible for the meticulous tasks required to transform the concrete shell into a fully functional home. This includes fitting windows, installing doors, and completing all other essential components that ensure the structure is ready for occupancy, offering a seamless blend of cutting-edge technology and skilled craftsmanship. “Icon builds high-performance, durable homes using robotic technology and proprietary cementitious-based material, CarbonX,” said the firm. “Designed and engineered for precision, speed, and resiliency, the innovative technology allows for faster builds and, consequently, more schedule predictability. The 3D-printed wall systems of an Icon home provide higher levels of insulation that decreases the home’s temperature fluctuations in the summer and winter, and are designed to resist water, mold, termites, and fire.”",
