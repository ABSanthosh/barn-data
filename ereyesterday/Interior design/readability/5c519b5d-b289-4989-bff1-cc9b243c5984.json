  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Are you ready? Thanksgiving is days away. Are you hosting? I am. There will be 8 of us so I am going to have to get a little creative with seating since my kitchen table only seats about 6 comfortably. Holiday time is the only time of the year that I miss having a dining room like I had in my previous home. My dad made a large plywood top to go over the table so I could seat 12 – 14 people. I also miss having a dining room since I like to set a pretty table. With a separate dining room I could set the table days in advance. Not so now as we will be using the kitchen table up until it is time to serve Thanksgiving dinner. If you like to set a festive Thanksgiving table and need a few ideas you will find them in my post 26 Creative Thanksgiving Table Decor Ideas.
