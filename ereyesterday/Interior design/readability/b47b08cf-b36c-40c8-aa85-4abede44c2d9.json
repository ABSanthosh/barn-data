I don’t want to get into details of it, but if you know what I’m trying to imply, you would like the Switchback pick-up camper. At just 375 lbs, it is a great option for those prioritizing weight savings. The feather-light camper is made entirely of rot-proof aluminum, which adds to its longevity, and makes the Switchback a solid investment for people who camp in different weather conditions throughout the year. Of course, the weight is the first striking aspect from a camper’s point of view; but for me, it’s the A-frame form factor, which really wins the heart. Designer: Aliner  Designed equally well for off-roading into the wild or camping under the stars, the Switchback, by Pennsylvania RV manufacturer Aliner, is compatible with most mid-size and full-size trucks. When in drive mode, the camper folds down into a box and sticks just slightly above the bed walls. You can park the vehicle easily in the garage with the camper mounted or take it where your heart desires without impacting the mileage too much. When you’re at the camp, clip open the box, lift up the side hard walls in A shape, stretch out the inner fabric lining and swing the split door open to have yourself a nice sleeping camper. The entire folding and unfolding process takes under 30 seconds. Aliner has not done anything fancy in the Switchback. Provided with a comfortable 60″ x 72″ bed (which doubles as bench seating, when you’re living out a mid-day storm at the camp), the camper is only your cozy above-ground shelter on a short overnight or, at max, a weekend adventure. Aliner is mulling the addition of an electrical system, but that’s for an upgraded model. For now, it’s the bare minimum that you’re going to get for the $9,500 asking price. This is Aliner’s first niche pick-up camper, but not the first A-frame camper. The Pennsylvanian manufacturer is a world leader in compact and versatile campers, most A-shaped, symbolizing freedom and exploration. The Switchback, in addition to the sleeping arrangement inside, features a pair of long, lockable drawers, just outside at the entrance, below the camper floor. The drawers are 5 feet deep and should be able to store a camping stove, adventure gear, and other necessities. The cabin interior however measures 5.8 feet at the highest point. It is not standing height for everyone, but should be comfortable enough for the time two people plan to spend within the Switchback. Given its basic features, robust construction, and unique shape, the pick-up camper is easily the best, lightweight, full hard-sided truck camper out there!",
