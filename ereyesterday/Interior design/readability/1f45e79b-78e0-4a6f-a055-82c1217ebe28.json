  "description": "The Barton Housing Precinct in Canberra was established in the 1920s to house public servants prior to the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. Close to 100 years later, these homes are heritage protected and remain sought after, but the buildings are not necessarily connected to their leafy surroundings. Without undertaking a full house renovation, Josh Mulford Architects have addressed the indoor-outdoor disconnect in this particular Barton home, introducing a new kitchen that frames the established garden beautifully, whilst maintaining the design integrity of the heritage home.",
