  "text": "Hardware rarely gets its moment in the spotlight. These functional elements—the handles, knobs, and hooks that facilitate our daily interactions with spaces—often exist in the periphery of design consciousness. VIEFE challenges this status quo with their 2025 “Power of Balance” collection. This architectural hardware collection reveals an unexpected depth: a philosophical foundation rarely associated with utilitarian objects. The collection presents a conceptual framework for understanding how small elements create harmony in living environments. Ma: The Philosophical Underpinning The Japanese concept of “Ma” (間) forms the heart of VIEFE’s new collection. Western design philosophies often prioritize objects themselves; Ma celebrates the spaces between things—the intervals, gaps, and pauses that give meaning to their surroundings. Ma exists as charged space—potential waiting to be realized. It manifests as the breath between musical notes that gives rhythm to a composition. In architecture and design, it represents the meaningful pause that allows forms to exist in relationship with one another. This concept appears throughout the collection in numerous ways. Each piece—whether a handle, knob or hook—embodies awareness not just of its own form but of how it creates rhythm within a larger context. The hardware creates balance through thoughtful presence. This philosophical grounding provides the collection with a cohesive identity across diverse material choices and aesthetic directions. Tracing Material Histories VIEFE began in 1932 as a small turnery crafting wooden buttons. This historical thread continues within their contemporary identity, and wood maintains a central role in their material palette. The new collection features several wooden pieces that honor this heritage while exploring new territory. The Hinoki Wood handle, designed by Alexis Vivet, exemplifies this philosophy. Named after the Japanese cypress, the design incorporates aesthetic elements and cultural associations from Japanese tradition—specifically integrity and longevity. The handle includes subtle contours for ergonomic functionality. Available in Raw Oak, Oak, and Walnut finishes, these handles add organic warmth to cabinetry and furniture. The Luv Wood Handle extends a collection designed by German studio Kaschkasch. An upper curve has become the signature element for this line. Made from responsibly sourced certified wood, it features a Nordic-inspired aesthetic with both contemporary and timeless qualities. VIEFE approaches wood with ethical considerations at the forefront. The company uses certified wood throughout their designs and operates on 100% renewable energy. Their ISO 14001 certification validates their lower-than-average CO2 emissions. Metal Narratives: Urban Poetry Metal pieces showcase VIEFE’s evolution and range alongside their wooden heritage. The Brooklyn handle, created by Danish design studio Steffensen \u0026 Würtz, draws inspiration from contemporary urban architecture. Clean, structured lines reflect the functional elegance found in modern buildings. This aluminum handle comes in multiple sizes with several finish options: Polished nickel, Brushed black, Titanium black, Brushed brass cava, and the newly introduced Brushed bronze. Material quality and construction highlight VIEFE’s focus on durability—an essential consideration for elements used daily. The Milano handle presents a different urban inspiration. Designed by Kaschkasch, this minimalist piece references tubular railings from metropolitan environments. Circular forms and rounded edges create a modern aesthetic. Crafted from Zamak (a zinc alloy allowing precise detailing), Milano measures between 4.75″ to 7.28″. Available finishes include Matte white, Matte black, Moss grey, Forest green, and Volcano red. The piece accommodates both vertical and horizontal mounting for additional versatility. The Hinoki collection includes an aluminum version alongside its wooden counterpart—showing how design language translates across materials. Design as Conversation VIEFE distinguishes itself through an understanding of context. The company recognizes hardware as existing in dialogue with surrounding elements—the furniture it adorns, the room it occupies, and the person who interacts with it. This awareness elevates their pieces from functional elements into design statements that contribute to spatial narratives. A cabinet handle serves beyond opening and closing; it creates a deliberate pause in the visual flow, establishing rhythm through its presence. VIEFE’s Barcelona roots ground their design approach, while their collaborative process incorporates global perspectives. The company works with designers from various countries and disciplines to create pieces with European sensibilities yet universal applications. The 2025 collection aims to introduce this design language to American interiors. The incorporation of Japanese philosophy demonstrates thoughtful cultural exchange—using Ma as a conceptual foundation rather than merely an aesthetic element. Tactile Experiences in a Digital Age Physical interactions with objects are particularly significant in an era dominated by digital interfaces. VIEFE addresses this reality through ergonomic considerations and material selections. Their 2025 collection introduces two new finishes—brushed Bronze and Matte Bronze—expanding their design vocabulary. These warm metallic options work within both traditional and contemporary settings. The finish selection accommodates diverse design approaches. Polished nickel offers industrial coolness, while Titanium black provides dramatic depth. Each finish alters the underlying design’s character. Tactile quality defines this collection. Handles and knobs must perform effectively through years of physical interaction. The materials, textures, and forms address this fundamental requirement. Small Elements, Significant Impact VIEFE recognizes the outsized influence of details within design schemes. Contemporary interiors value personalization and thoughtful curation; architectural hardware provides an accessible method for transforming spaces without extensive renovations. Cabinet handles and door hardware require modest investment yet dramatically affect a room’s character. VIEFE’s collection offers pieces that can integrate with existing elements or introduce intentional contrast. The Power of Balance collection demonstrates how small components anchor a design philosophy. A thoughtfully selected handle completes a piece of furniture while enhancing the entire space. Forward-Looking Tradition VIEFE’s 2025 collection signals a future where architectural hardware receives appropriate design attention. By incorporating philosophical concepts like Ma into utilitarian objects, they expand our understanding of how spaces communicate with inhabitants. Their sustainability commitment points toward responsible industry practices. Operating on renewable energy and using certified materials acknowledges the importance of ethical production for every design element. The collection highlights how meaningful design exists in quiet moments, thoughtful pauses, and everyday objects. By focusing attention on these humble elements, VIEFE encourages renewed appreciation for detail and balance in our spaces. American audiences will see the Power of Balance collection at the upcoming Kitchen \u0026 Bath Industry Show (KBIS). VIEFE will present these pieces alongside their existing catalog. Those unable to attend can explore the full collection at viefe.us. VIEFE’s approach offers a thoughtful alternative to attention-seeking design trends. Their 2025 collection shows the power of everyday objects in shaping our experience of space.",
