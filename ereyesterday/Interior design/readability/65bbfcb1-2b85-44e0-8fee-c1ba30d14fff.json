And here we are already starting the last week of October. Halloween 2024 will be history in a few days. Then it’s full-on holiday mode. I have begun to slowly decorate for the holidays in-between getting things ready to take to Charlottesville in less than two weeks for my daughter Mandy’s wedding. The wedding is at a venue where we will be staying all weekend in lodges and cabins. I have wedding decor items to finish making and pack. Plus I need to pack enough bedding and towels, not only for Ed and me, but also for my older daughter, SIL, his parents and grandkiddies that will be flying in from California which makes it hard to bring it themselves. Doing all this the past week while we had a childhood friend of Ed’s stay with us while roofers and construction teams have been banging away and making a mess to fix the house after the tree punched through the roof and into a guest room during Hurricane Helene have made for a crazy week. All good, but I am a little off my game with so much going on and so many decisions to make. :-) I also wanted to mention that if you find yourself looking for Christmas ideas and inspiration in the coming days and weeks, remember I have hundreds of holiday ideas, tips and projects and more on my All Things Christmas Page. It is like its own website within my blog. You can find it all here: Creative Christmas Ideas for Decorating, Wrapping, Baking and More.
