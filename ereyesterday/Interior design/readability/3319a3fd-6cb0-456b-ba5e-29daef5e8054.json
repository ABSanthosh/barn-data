Perfect for that fireside daydream or an afternoon lost in your favorite paperback. Macrame Hanging Hammock Chair Buy on Wayfair Add a boho swing to your indoor or outdoor space. This cotton rope mesh chair with tassels turns any nook into a breezy book retreat. We especially love it for reading by the poolside. Kya Wicker Porch Swing Buy on Wayfair Imagine sipping iced tea and flipping through pages with this dreamy swing under a shady tree. Plush cushions make it the ultimate relaxation zone. Babs 2-Person Hammock with Stand Buy on Wayfair Stretch out with a classic hammock designed for two—but totally worth it solo. Great for reading, but also for your park-your-book-and-doze-off moments.",
