  "description": "Wick cord, or wicking rope, is a hack used by some gardeners and plant enthusiasts. A cord or rope made of cotton or nylon is used to connect a water source with the soil surrounding the plant. Capillary action causes water to slowly move from the water source to the plant. On a roofing forum on Reddit, one poster had a problem unrelated to gardening. He recently replaced the flat roof on his house with a new one. Flat roofs are notoriously poorly draining, and the poster observed standing water on their roof, an 8-square-foot puddle. For four days, the puddle would not evaporate nor drain. Seeking a solution, the poster put one end of a wicking rope in the puddle, weighing it down with stones, and routed the other end through a scupper into the drainpipe.\"It seems to work great!\" the poster writes. \"The puddle went from 8 sq ft and an inch deep to totally dry in less than 12 hours.\" It's cheaper, and a lot less hassle, than having to pump the standing water out.",
