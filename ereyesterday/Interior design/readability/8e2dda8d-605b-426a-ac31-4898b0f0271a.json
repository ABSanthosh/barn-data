  "description": "Neutral interiors are sometimes criticised for being beige and boring, but this beachside family home in Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs proudly proves otherwise. Using a muted colour palette peppered with timbers and textural tiles, designers Sequence Studio turned the once-dysfunctional residence into a calming house that’s a masterclass in warm minimalism.",

  "text": "When the owners of this Marouba home first approached Sequence Studio for a renovation in 2022, they were a young working couple looking to extend their two-bedroom beachside abode. Yet by the time the project came to fruition three years later, the clients had welcomed two sons, including one born just two weeks after works wrapped up on site. Sequence Studio director Loretta Lovecek says this timeline — held up due to a long waitlist before the project team could even get started — influenced the look and feel of the resulting redesign to create what’s now a welcoming home for a family of four. The brief asked to reconfigure the segregated living spaces with a more open-plan layout, in addition to building a second-storey extension housing the much-needed additional bedrooms. ‘They also wanted to create a home that felt more personal for them,’ Loretta says. Intended to be a family home for many years to come, the interior palette was designed to be simple and timeless. The challenge was making sure the typical coastal backdrop of white walls and pale ash engineered timber floors didn’t feel overtly plain. It had to have ‘a relaxed energy, without screaming “beachy.”’ ‘Neutral colours were key to creating a design with a long lifespan, with the ability to play with colour through art and soft furnishings,’ Loretta says. ‘To ensure the base was not too flat, textural materials such as the finger tiles to the kitchen bench, and the green bathroom tiles with their colour variation add some interest and movement to the space.’ A rust modular couch adds a perfect pop of colour to the light-filled living room, while the bedrooms reveal a bedhead made from green wall panelling. Other custom features include a striking metal balustrade that wraps around the staircase with a skylight overhead, casting linear shadows at the right time of day. The durable floorboards also transition to a tactile speckled carpet in a sandy hue for the cosy upstairs bedrooms. The house’s new personality comes to life in these harmonious little details. There’s just the right amount of intrigue, ensuring this brand of minimal feels anything but boring.",
