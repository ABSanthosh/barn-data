  "description": "Two years ago we spotted this gimmicky-looking MagicH chair, an \"ultra adaptive support home office chair\" by Chinese manufacturer Newtral. People went bonkers for it on Kickstarter; it landed $1.8 million. Now the company's back with a new offering, the Freedom-X, a \"multi-position chair\" with a built-in desk and cupholder, as well as swing-down armrests. The video gives you a better look at the product, where you can see that the build quality and upholstery stitching isn't exactly Herman Miller quality:Does anyone have any faith that this chair will last? If you read through the comments on the MagicH's campaign page, you'll find some brutal feedback. Let's just say you won't be passing that chair down to your grandkids; multiple buyers report mechanical failure around the six-month mark.That said, the Freedom-X has once again captured the crowdfunding masses. While Newtral was seeking just $10,000 to get this thing going, at press time they were at $780K-plus, with over a month left to pledge. Caveat emptor.",
