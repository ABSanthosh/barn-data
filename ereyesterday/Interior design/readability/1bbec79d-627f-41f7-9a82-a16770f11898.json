That’s why I’m always amazed when I travel and I see different species just flying and hanging around window sills, the park, picnic tables, and some even perch on people. But urban areas are dangerous places for birds as they are filled with hazards for them like tall buildings, glass windows, and artificial structures. People who live in areas like this will probably see injured birds every once in a while but we don’t really know how to treat them on our own. What if giving first aid to these injured birds is as easy as treating mild human injuries? BirdAid is an innovative, biodegradable splint designed to provide immediate first aid to injured wild birds, particularly in urban environments. The project emphasizes sustainability and compassionate care for wildlife. It is made from natural materials including eggshell calcium, agar, and potato starch. The materials, specifically the eggshells, were chosen since they provide natural calcium for bone recovery while the rest are to control the decomposition rate. Designers: Zay Kim, Chaewon Lee, and Jungmin Park They developed three splint variants with different decomposition rates to help users identify the severity of the injury and which to apply to that wound. Each material has a different color, including gardenia (yellow), basil (green), and beetroot (red), and this intuitive system helps non-experts still render first aid when needed. Using it is pretty easy as you just have to take the pack from the kit and then crush it. Then you just gently wrap it around the bird’s wound and wait for it to do its work. If you’re still confused about what to do, you just need to scan the QR code on the kit and read and follow the instructions indicated. The QR code links to a simple, step-by-step guide—complete with visuals—to help anyone, regardless of medical or veterinary background, confidently provide first aid to an injured bird. This ensures that even in stressful or unfamiliar situations, users can take quick and effective action without hesitation. BirdAid represents a small yet significant gesture towards integrating compassionate care into daily urban life. It bridges the gap between professional wildlife rescue and ordinary citizens, empowering people to make a difference in moments that truly matter. By enabling city dwellers to aid injured birds using a tool that is both intuitive and environmentally friendly, BirdAid not only supports animal welfare but also fosters a deeper sense of empathy, responsibility, and connection to the natural world within bustling city environments.",
