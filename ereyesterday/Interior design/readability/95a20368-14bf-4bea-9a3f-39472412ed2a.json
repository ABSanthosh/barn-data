Under the theme ‘Design for a Changing World: Bridging Cultures,’ the competition seeks functional prototypes that reveal the richness and diversity of Arab culture through a contemporary lens. Participants can submit original concepts across four product categories — seating, tables, storage, and lighting — merging craftsmanship with modern design sensibilities.‘Design has the power to connect cultures and ideas,’ says Alia Rachid, Founder \u0026 CEO of FROMM.  ‘This competition is an opportunity for creatives to explore heritage in a contemporary context.  Through mentorship and international exposure, we aim to support the next generation in shaping a  design language that’s rooted, relevant, and forward-looking.’ Alia Rachid, Founder \u0026 CEO of FROMM. | all images courtesy of FROMM.A PLATFORM CONNECTING HERITAGE AND CONTEMPORARY DESIGN FROMM.Lab is the educational platform of luxury design house FROMM., with roots in Msheireb Downtown Doha and a showroom in Milan.
