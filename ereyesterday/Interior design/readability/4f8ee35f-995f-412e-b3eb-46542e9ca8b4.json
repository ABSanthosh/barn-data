  "text": "The 18-07 Holiday Home by Office Inainn sits quietly on a hillside above Storfjorden, near the Geiranger–Trollstigen route. This project brings together two cabins as a single retreat, each built with a sense of gentle connection to the land. The design is shaped by respect for the steep terrain, using the contours of the hillside to inform both layout and orientation. The cabins are blessed with a southern view, which serenely opens up to the fjord, creating a fascinating connection with the landscape. Designer: Office Inainn The house is organized into a pair of rectangular forms that sit slightly offset from each other. One of these is taller and slimmer, acting as the entry point and forming a light-filled corridor that stretches along the property. Next to it, a lower wing contains the living spaces and extends outward, hovering above the hillside. On arrival, the taller section presents an unadorned, windowless facade, keeping the interior private until one steps inside and encounters a long expanse of glass revealing the fjord beyond. Above, a strip of clerestory windows brings daylight into the central passage. At either end, the two structures seem to weave together, unified by their exterior cladding, which wraps around and forms a sheltered porch at the entrance. This lower portion meets the ground, anchoring the building into its setting. The choice of dark timber for the exterior enhances the sense that the home is an organic extension of the slope, appearing almost as if it has emerged from the forested hillside itself. The interiors follow a theme of calm minimalism, using natural materials that echo the surrounding forest. Simple wood finishes and large windows keep the focus on the view and the changing light. Each room is designed to be comfortable and uncluttered, with built-in storage and thoughtful detailing. The spaces feel open yet private, encouraging a slow rhythm of living that matches the setting. The cabins’ horizontal layout keeps the interiors connected to the land outside, with every window framing a piece of the hillside or water. Living in the 18-07 Holiday Home is about finding a balance between comfort and simplicity. The main living areas are generous, with enough space for gathering, reading, or simply watching the weather move over the fjord. The kitchen and bathrooms are fully equipped, but they remain discreet, blending into the overall palette of the home. Every aspect has been planned to offer ease of use and a sense of peace, making daily routines feel both easy and intentional. This holiday home serves as an example of how architecture can quietly support a way of living rooted in place. The cabins are not only retreats but also a study in how minimal intervention can produce a home that is both useful and beautiful. For those who appreciate Norwegian design and a life lived close to nature, the 18-07 Holiday Home is a thoughtful and enduring model.",
