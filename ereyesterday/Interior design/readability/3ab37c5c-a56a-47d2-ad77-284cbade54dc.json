Rooted in a philosophy that design not only shapes objects but also consequences, the program spans five key domains: physical products, digital platforms, social innovation, service \u0026 experience design, and commercial ventures.Graduates have launched impactful careers, with their projects winning international awards and and, in some cases, being produced and sold through esteemed institutions like the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Looking back at a range of standout projects and initiatives that have emerged throughout the years, together they exemplify the departments’ creative reach and social ambition. celebrating twelve years of MFA in Products of Design at SVA: Lipi Devanagari Keyboard by Charvi Shrimali | all images courtesy of SVANEW YORK’S MOST COMPREHENSIVE MASTER PROGRAM IN DESIGN The MFA in Products of Design curriculum at SVA combines hands-on prototyping with critical studies in leadership, public policy, business, climate change, and behavioral psychology, encouraging students to design with purpose and long-term impact. This broad framework is taught by faculty members who are actively practicing designers, bringing current insights and professional expertise directly into the classroom.The design school’s program fosters deep creative inquiry through a no-grade policy that prioritizes experimentation over evaluation. Among its distinctive features is DESIGN:MATCH, a reverse job fair where students choose the companies they want to meet — past participants include Apple, Google, IDEO, and Spotify. Additionally, an annual collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art offers students the rare opportunity to propose original product ideas for potential manufacture and retail through MoMA’s Design Store.every year, MFA students in Products of Design pitch products for possible manufacture by MoMALOOKING BACK AT THE MASTER’S STANDOUT PROJECTS AND INITIATIVESOver the years, graduate projects from SVA’s master program have tackled a wide range of critical issues, including technology, health, justice, and cultural preservation. Examples of recent innovation include Natya.AI by Yukti Arora (Class of 2024), a dance training tool powered by computer vision and natural language processing designed to support Bharatanatyam practitioners. This platform offers real-time feedback and performance analysis, using emerging technology to preserve and evolve a classical art form. bridging tradition and technology: Natya.AI by Yukti Arora for Bharatanatyam dancersAnother notable project is ‘When No One Believes You’ by Antya Waegemann (Class of 2018), which reimagines how rape kits and sexual assault response materials are designed and deployed. Her thesis proposed six interventions, including two redesigns of the standard rape kit, an emergency resource app, a DNA detection tool for medical exams, and a tracking system for kit processing. Aimed at improving reporting rates, reducing stigma, and increasing accountability, her work addresses the systemic challenges faced by survivors, medical professionals, and law enforcement alike.Waegemann, the founder of Margo Health and part of the Trust and Safety team at Tinder, previously worked with InVision, Johnson \u0026 Johnson, and frog Design. She has received numerous accolades, including Fast Company’s World Changing Ideas Award (2020), the ICFF x Interior Design Magazine Award (2019), and was a speaker at the 2020 Design Indaba Conference. She also teaches design research and integration in the MFA Products of Design program.When No One Believes You by Antya Waegemann: Redesigning the Rape Kit and Responses to Sexual AssaultThe master program’s impact extends beyond individual projects through public exhibitions like ‘The Datalogue,’ ‘Engender,’ and ‘Re:Actors.’ These shows explore pressing themes such as digital ethics, gender identity, and post-pandemic social behavior. Presented at major international design fairs, they have earned recognition with the ‘Best of Schools’ award from ICFF + WantedDesign.",
