  "text": "Thanks for stopping by for this week’s Style Scouting. My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. Hello December 22nd! How did you arrive so quickly. Are you ready for the holidays? I had plans to get a few more holiday posts up before today, but with the kitchen a tarped closed construction zone, the living room and my studioffice holding the contents of the kitchen and trying to get the guest room back to normal, I haven’t had much time to be creative. Instead of getting stressed out about not posting, I had to come to terms that I can’t do it all. :-) I know you understand. XO As I do every year, I am going to take a holiday break from the blog and will be back at it come the first week of January. I have so many exciting things to share with you and even though the living room will become a construction zone on January 5th, having the kitchen in order means my mind will be too. I will be able to start sharing what is going on along with new ideas for 2025. So stick with me to see what I am most excited about. Lastly, I want to wish all of you who read my blog a holiday season wrapped in love, joy, and warm wishes. Many of you have been reading for years and others only for a few weeks. I appreciate each and every one of you, all of your kind words, support, and the connections we have made over the years. XO Diane Watching \u0026 Reading I placed a request on Libby for this book that was recommended by a friend. It has a 17 week wait list. Just found a deal for it $1.99 on Kindle.
