  "text": "Texas wellness company Thermasol introduces Solaris, the first solar-powered, off-grid sauna in the US. Solaris heats up to 76°C (170°F) in just 30 to 40 minutes, delivering an efficient sauna experience without relying on the grid. This new model offers a practical, energy-saving alternative to conventional saunas, showing how solar technology can power wellness spaces with minimal environmental impact. “Solaris is the world’s first fully off-grid, solar-powered sauna in the US – a radiant blend of design, innovation, and sustainability,” said Thermasol. Designer: Thermasol Solaris is designed as a plug-and-play sauna, making it easy to install and operate in locations where traditional electricity isn’t accessible. Ideal for remote retreats, off-grid cabins, or properties aiming to reduce their environmental impact, Solaris offers flexibility and convenience. Its solar-powered system means it can function independently of the grid, allowing users to enjoy a relaxing sauna experience virtually anywhere while minimizing energy consumption and supporting sustainable living practices. “We’ve seen growing demand from both homeowners and hospitality clients looking for energy-efficient wellness solutions,” said Jennifer Thayer, president of Harvia US – Thermasol’s parent company. “Solaris was born from that desire to pair luxury with responsibility.” Most saunas use either electricity or wood-burning stoves for heat, but both methods come with environmental downsides. Electric saunas can significantly increase carbon emissions, especially in areas where fossil fuels power the energy grid. Wood-burning saunas add to air pollution by releasing CO2 and other harmful particles directly into the atmosphere. Solaris takes a different approach, relying on integrated solar panels and high-efficiency, insulated thermal panels on its exterior. This setup allows Solaris to operate entirely off-grid, providing clean and renewable heat in any location. The sauna’s intelligent heating cycles are designed to retain warmth for longer periods while using less energy overall, making it a practical and more sustainable option for those seeking a lower-impact sauna experience. The off-grid sauna uses solar-tinted glass windows that let in natural light while maintaining privacy for users. It also includes an optimized airflow system and integrated heater controls for a comfortable and efficient sauna experience. Inside, the design draws inspiration from classic Finnish saunas, featuring ambient lighting and natural materials such as brushed alder benches. This blend of traditional elements and modern features creates a relaxing, inviting space that connects users to both nature and wellness. “You can even enjoy a traditional Löyly,” said Thayer, explaining that this follows the Finnish tradition of pouring water over hot sauna stones to create steam and raise humidity inside the sauna.",
