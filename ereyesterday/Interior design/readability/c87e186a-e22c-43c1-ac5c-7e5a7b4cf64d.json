  "description": "Portugese furniture designer Victor Manuel picks up where Postmodernism left off. Manuel refers to his style as \"Geometric Chimera—a bold fusion of furniture that challenges the norms of symmetry and conventional functionality.\" The designer takes the Midcentury Modern aesthetic and mashes it up—largely with itself—to create large pieces that don't always make functional sense, but never fail to draw the eye. \"My work is a synthesis of historical influences that translates into a new, contemporary style that is relevant to the history of design: hybrid design. I do not limit myself to paying homage to the great movements of the past; I seek to reinterpret them, balancing tradition and innovation, and thus offering a new approach to design.\" \"I like to say that being a Designer is more than a profession; it is a true state of mind. This vision is embodied in the hybrid style – an innovative fusion of functionality and art, which positions itself as a new artistic movement in the world of contemporary furniture design, challenging traditional norms and expanding the boundaries of this field.\" \"My goal is to create serene and organized environments. My creations are elegant, [and] meticulous attention to detail and quality construction are hallmarks of each piece, ensuring durability and longevity. They also bring a touch of vintage nostalgia, adding an extra layer of charm and personality to contemporary design.\" \"In a world that often values ??uniformity and the mass production of repetitive forms, I propose an alternative vision: A future of design that celebrates diversity and individuality, the luxury of innovation, a new concept: Geometric Chimera. Hybrid creations are not just furniture, but functional sculptures that challenge established norms and invite users to reimagine the spaces they inhabit. In this context, I redefine what it means to live surrounded by objects, proposing an experience that is simultaneously aesthetic and deeply personal.\" There's plenty more to see here.",
