Perched on a hillside in Melbourne’s Mornington Peninsula, the sculptural holiday home was built and designed by Inform, in partnership with architects Pleysier Perkins, who shaped the residence around panoramic views of the horizon.",

  "text": "Horizon House by Inform was designed in response to the beauty of its natural environment. After visiting the spot on the Mornington Peninsula for more than a decade, the owners decided it was time to replace their old existing single-storey beach house with something more befitting of the superb location. ‘The site is unique and warranted a new home that maximised it’s potential,’ says Pleysier Perkins director Simon Perkins, whose team worked on the design as part of Inform’s integrated builder-architect approach. From the street, the new house is modern and assuming, thanks to brick walls that have been bagged and painted, an ode to the retro brick beach houses in the region. But once you step inside the central entry hall and follow the corridor down to the living area, the true spectacle of the house is revealed. Open-plan spaces flow out to the terrace, sculptural concrete pool, and serene garden to fully ‘embrace’ its beachside setting — with panoramic views of Port Phillip Bay. The first floor with three bedrooms is activated when needed for entertaining and hosting guests, leaving the lower-level as a ‘one-bedroom’ apartment for the owners. ‘The configuration provides all rooms with terrace access and a direct visual connection to the bay,’ Simon says. It also means even intimate spaces feel expansive, as the omnipresent horizon line widens one’s perspective. At the rear, dramatic concrete forms curve to create an overhanging balcony that Simon calls the home’s ‘piece de resistance’. ‘It defines the project and in combination with the painted brick walls offers timelessness, solidity and durability, which is fundamental given its proximity to the sea,’ he adds. Materials have been selected for lifecycle optimisation, ensuring little to no maintenance is required, while the simple but striking architecture helped minimise construction costs. Inside, the muted interiors reveal finishes of timber, natural stone, and pops of green in the galvanised steel posts both inside and out riff off the coastal surrounds. ‘The property offers its owners respite from the city. The architecture is designed to celebrate its dramatic setting and provide the opportunity for retreat and reflection — a distinct contrast to their busy professional lives,’ Simon says.",
