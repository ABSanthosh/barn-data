  "description": "Touchscreens were really cool 15 years ago, when the iPad first came out. Now that the novelty's worn off, more people seem to realize that navigating submenus sucks. Manufacturers, particularly automotive ones, love touchscreens because it reduces their production costs. But the user experience suffers for it, and leaves many craving physical knobs, buttons, dials and switches.A Bulgarian company called Enhance manufactures an aftermarket knob for the Tesla. In keeping with the puerility of the target market, it's called the S3XY Knob. The retrofittable knob, which comes in a housing flanked with four programmable buttons, communicates with the car via Bluetooth and Tesla's API. It's mounted in the center console and allows drivers to access the climate control, media playback, drive modes and more without needing to fuss with the touchscreen. Visual feedback comes via a small circular screen atop the knob.Here's a demo of what it can do:The company also makes standalone S3XY Buttons for Teslas that are user-programmable. They come with stickers of various functions. The knobs run about $450, and buy-in for the buttons starts at $330 for a four-pack.The question is whether these objects will proliferate, or if manufacturers will listen to customer feedback and give people the kinds of controls they actually like.",
