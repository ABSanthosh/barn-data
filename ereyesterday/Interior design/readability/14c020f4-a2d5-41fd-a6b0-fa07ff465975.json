All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Costco is one of my favorite places to shop pretty much every day of the year, but it really shines around the holiday season. That’s not only when all of the fall- and winter-appropriate home decor and home improvement buys hit shelves, but it’s also when the retailer launches a huge range of giftable products that are so affordable, you could easily shop there for everyone on your list (and get yourself something good, too).Credit: Danielle BlundellRecently Apartment Therapy’s executive home director, Danielle Blundell, spotted a seasonal offering at her local Costco that’s one of my favorite buys ever: the Pendleton fleece throw blanket, which retails for just $16.99 (with larger bed-size versions — up to king size! — going for under $35 each). When she asked if anyone on the team had intel on the product, I immediately had to chime in. I bought this blanket for myself on a whim a couple of years ago in a previously offered Crater Lake pattern, and it was the best impulse purchase I’ve ever made.Credit: Danielle BlundellI’ve had my Pendleton fleece blanket for about two years now, and it’s become a go-to for lounging on the couch and piling up the bed on extra cold winter nights (a Wisconsin specialty!). The blanket gets shared between me, my husband, our guests, and even our two dogs. Because of that, it’s been subjected to pretty regular washings over the past two years. I’m happy to report it remains just as soft as when we got it!I’ve long been a fan of Pendleton’s classic wool blankets, a staple for the 161-year-old company. But a 100% wool blanket is expensive, and the dry clean-only care instructions aren’t super-practical for anyone with kids or pets. The fleece blankets are a fraction of the price, supersoft and cozy, and totally machine-washable. That makes them not only a great buy for your own home but also the perfect gift for almost everyone on your list. At under $20 each, they’re seriously hard to beat.If you don’t have a Costco membership, the fleece blankets are also available on Amazon in four beautiful patterns: the dramatic navy Big Thunder, the understated cream-and-gray Birch Tree, the classic Saltillo Stripe, and my favorite, the bold-striped Mount Foraker — if I buy another, this is the one I’m getting!As with most Costco gems, the Pendleton fleece throw won’t be available forever. So if you spot the display in your local store, make sure to grab one (or a few!).",
