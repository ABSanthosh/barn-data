  "text": "For our latest lookbook, we've selected eight homes with multi-purpose staircases that double up as seating, storage and in one case even a climbing wall. Integrating additional uses into staircases can make them characterful interior features rather than just functional structures. This can be especially favourable in smaller spaces where storage is a priority and additional seating might be required when hosting. In the eight examples below, we showcase homes that utilise their staircases in various ways, incorporating everything from a swing and a fireplace to a climbing wall. This is the latest in our lookbooks series, which provides visual inspiration from Dezeen's archive. For more inspiration, see previous lookbooks including staircases in tactile materials and sculptural forms and homes that feature wooden staircases. Photo by Ricardo Oliveira AlvesRural House, Portugal, by HBG Architects Lisbon studio HBG Architects produced a staircase that doubles as a table, bench and fireplace as part of this conversion of an old community oven in east Portugal into a holiday home (top and above). \"The brief was to transform an ancient community oven, owned by the client's family for decades, into a comfortable single-bedroom vacation house with space to gather the family when needed,\" the studio told Dezeen.

Instead, various platforms follow a spiralled path across 16 different floor levels, doubling as floors, shelves and furniture throughout. \"Rather than using walls and different floor levels to clearly divide the space into various functions, everything loosely connects and disconnects from each other through stepped floors,\" said Tato Architects founder Yo Shimada.

The feature was not suggested by the owner but by studio founders Javier Deferrari and Lavinia Modesti after observing the client's love for rock climbing. \"It had to be a key element of the home,\" the duo said.

The staircase is reminiscent of bleachers with wooden blocks added to define a walking route along only one side, while the other side provides space to read, sit and socialise.

The staircases merge into the ceilings and floors of the house, as the studio aimed \"to question the stereotype of the staircase, which normally serves as a fixed purpose of only moving up and down\".

The house was built around an old oak tree, resulting in a curved layout that embraces the tree's natural form.

This can be reached via a baby-blue storage unit that integrates a small staircase alongside a wardrobe.

The playful addition indulges in the spacious character of the house, with a landing that extends into a mezzanine on the first floor.
