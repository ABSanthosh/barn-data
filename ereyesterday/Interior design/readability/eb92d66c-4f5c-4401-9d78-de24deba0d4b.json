  "text": "The Soviet Retro Apartment, designed by Lepo Bureau, is where mid-century Soviet aesthetics meet modern-day comfort. Functional simplicity reigns in this space. The rich textures and classic tones are reminiscent of Soviet-era interiors.  In the Soviet Retro Apartment, the dark wood accents and vintage tilework are complemented by timeless furnishings. This results in an interior that’s stylish but rooted in history. Get inspired by this space that merges nostalgia and contemporary refinement. The living room in the Soviet Retro Apartment is dominated by a boxy leather sofa in a medium brown tone. It has sleek stainless steel legs. They’re not very visible, creating the effect of the sofa floating in the air. This is a trick to making a small space feel bigger. The coffee table is minimalist, with a wooden top resting over metallic legs. On one end of the living area is a large bookshelf housing decorative accessories. We also see a reading nook with a chair and a black side table and floor lamp, allowing residents to have a designated area for reading. This apartment follows an open floor plan. Light oakwood cabinetry covers the kitchen wall, while the countertops provide space to keep appliances. The range hood is nice and minimalist, while the small cubed tiles add visual interest. In the vacant space between the kitchen and living area is a dark wooden dining table. The chairs are compact—looking a lot like bar stools you’d see paired with kitchen islands—making sure there’s optimal functionality while saving space. The table is beautifully lit by daylight entering the large windows. A minimalist bed with soft upholstery takes center stage in the bedroom. On one side is a compact nightstand providing room to keep quick essentials, and this is paired with a pendant light. On the other end is a compact dresser with a mirror and organically shaped chair. We also see a wall-mounted globe light. This asymmetric setting creates a contemporary impact in the otherwise Soviet-inspired bedroom. A wooden workstation in the bedroom gives hoemowners a designated spot for working the day away. No matter what the size, your home should cater to your specific needs! This bathroom is spacious, housing a double vanity so both partners have their own space to get ready. A compact bathtub is covered in light-hued tiles. Simultaneously, a darker recessed shelf is illuminated with integrated LED lighting. Another bedroom in the Soviet Retro Apartment features a compact, dark wood vanity. This one has a segregated shower cubicle and a wall-mounted toilet to save space.",
