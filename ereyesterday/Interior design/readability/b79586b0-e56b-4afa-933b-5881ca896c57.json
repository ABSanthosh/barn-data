  "description": "Using 3D printers to create homewares isn’t a new concept, but not many makers have been able to execute the idea quite like FRANCA Studio. With a background in the fashion industry, Brisbane-based interior designer Isabelle Bayly brings elegant wall scones, pendant lights, and lamps to life that make bio-degradable plastic look more like silk or satin!",

  "text": "It all started when fashion designer-turned-interior-designer Isabelle Bayly was renovating her apartment in Noosa a few years ago. ‘I had a very particular vision for the space, but I was unable to find any lights within our price range that suited the aesthetic,’ the Brisbane-based creative says. ‘A friend of ours had just started playing around with 3D printing and I asked if it would be possible to 3D print a light.’ She mocked up a design for a rippling light shade inspired by the textural appearance of coral. They instantly fell in love with how the slightly transparent plastic offered a soft and dreamy glow, and before long, she was offering these lights on a made-to-order basis as part of FRANCA Studio — the construction and design business Isabelle founded with her builder-husband, Tom. ‘It’s very quickly moved to a full-time lighting business, which was a lovely surprise!’ Having originally studied fashion design before working in accessories at the Country Road Group, Isabelle only knew the ‘basics’ of 3D modelling software from her time at university. She admits there was a steep learning curve with ‘a lot of trial and error’ behind each piece that followed her first design, and many that never make it into production. But perhaps this also influenced her fresh approach to 3D-printed products. Rather than trying to make the plastic unidentifiable with bold colours, FRANCA Studio’s vases, pendant lights and wall scones appear remarkably organic and subtle, thanks to their sheer texture and fluid silhouettes. Each piece is made from Polylactic Acid, otherwise known as PLA, which is a kind of biodegradable thermoplastic made from renewable plant-based sources such as corn starch and sugar cane. ‘We’re currently using transparent PLA, matte PLA and a silk PLA. I think of these like organza, linen or raw silk and a high-shine material like satin,’ Isabelle says, naming Issey Miyake’s brand Pleats Please as a major source of inspiration behind her designs. ‘I begin with a sketch that is usually informed by either something I’ve seen in nature: like a shell my daughters have collected, or an item of clothing, or a vintage light I’ve found in an antique centre,’ she adds. It’s then translated into a software program and Isabelle produces 3D printed samples from her home studio, before sending off the finished design to a Brisbane printers to be manufactured. ‘Each piece is printed to order, so we usually have a lead time of three to four weeks,’ she adds. Coming from a fashion background, Isabelle was also drawn to the inherently sustainable and efficient elements of 3D printing production. ‘By producing only what is needed, we conserve materials, decrease energy consumption and prevent surplus materials ending up in landfill,’ she adds. ‘Our post-production waste is very minimal, but what we do produce is being collected with a view to eventually purchase a machine that allows us to recycle it back into new printable material. This will create a closed-loop production cycle!’ It’s clear Isabelle is bringing a thoughtful take to this unconventional manufacturing process. And we can’t wait to see what she does next!
