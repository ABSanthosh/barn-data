  "text": "This sleek Essendon home has seen Marly Hemisphere director Vittoria and Pulitano Commercial Construction estimator Maurice Chiarilli through all of life’s stages. ‘It was the first house we bought when we were getting married 27 years ago,’ Vittoria says. ‘At the time there was a small weatherboard on the property, which we did a small renovation to and lived in for 6 years before we outgrew it, having had two girls.’ That’s when the couple decided it was time to build their ‘dream home’, with help from their building company Pulitano Commercial Construction and architects Pleysier Perkins. Guided by her styling experience, Vittoria worked with the designers to bring the polished interiors to life — opting for terrazzo tiles, warm timber floors, and a luxurious marble island bench in the kitchen. The floorplan itself has been designed especially for entertaining. On the ground floor, the kitchen flows through to the open-plan living and dining area, where sliding glass doors open to an alfresco area with a wood-fire pizza oven, outdoor fireplace, and a built-in barbecue. Greenery lines the boundary of the property, as the home office looks out to a private courtyard. And in the tranquil backyard, there’s also a pool and spa! ‘It has been a wonderful home to raise our girls, with lots of beautiful natural light, heated hydronic floors, and a living area that has seen many Christmas gatherings and social get-togethers,’ Vittoria adds. Other than a recent refresh of the bathrooms, Vittoria says the house’s simple elegance has stood the test of time. ‘The house really has aged well and continues to look just as stunning as it was when it was first built.’ Having cherished the three-bedroom home’s indoor-outdoor lifestyle and ideal location for two decades, the Chiarilli family has listed 27 Hesleden Street, Essendon for sale. ‘We can’t wait to pass the house on to new owners who will love, live, and enjoy the house in the way we have — it’s been a joy to live in.’ 27 Hesleden Street, Essendon, VIC 3040 is listed for sale with John Morello from Jellis Craig Mooney Valley and will go to auction on Saturday March 1 at 2pm.",
