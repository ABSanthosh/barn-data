  "description": "Manufacturing machinery company KraussMaffei has designed a new twist on multi-component injection molding. Their ColorForm system cuts out a time-consuming step in the production of injection molded parts that are painted, like automotive bumpers and fascia. Instead of molding the part, then transferring it to a painting facility, the ColorForm rig molds the part, then flow-coats it with polyurethane (PU) or polyurea (PUA), all within a single machine. It's a six-step process:The method does mean you have to invest in four mold halves, rather than two. But the company reckons their system's increased cycle time, and the elimination of both a part-handling step and the spraypainting process, will be attractive to automotive suppliers seeking greater efficiency. One such supplier, Rehau Automotive, has invested in the system and plans to use it to produce fascia.",
