With its retro-meets-new-age charm, this cassette player encases your cassette in a transparent cover, allowing you to see the cassette’s reels rotate as the device plays music. But here’s the kicker – this thing isn’t just a cassette player, it’s a Bluetooth speaker too. You see, each IT ‘S REAL player comes with its own “Bluetooth Cassette” that lets you connect your phone to the IT’S Real device. Put the Bluetooth cassette in and the appliance lets you effectively play Spotify, YouTube, Apple Music, or any streaming app on your cassette player. The Bluetooth cassette works with other devices too, allowing you to turn your dad’s boombox, or your 30-year-old car’s tape-deck into a Bluetooth-enabled device that supports your phone. Designer: NINM Labs Let’s break down the player by talking about its form, function, and emotion. If you were born in the early 90s or before, chances are your vision of a cassette player are a lot different from what the IT’S REAL looks like. Most cassette players had a template design – either they looked like a boombox, with the cassette in the middle and speakers on the side, or they looked like a Walkman, with a compact form factor and an Aux input for headphones. The IT’S REAL looks nothing like either of those. It encases the cassette in a transparent outer housing, preserving and showcasing it as if it’s some sort of precious relic. This treatment is reserved for precious items, so to see a cassette player do this enhances the cultural and iconic value of the humble cassette. The transparent casing still retains its function, allowing the cassette to play while it’s inside, while front-firing speakers help you listen to the audio. Put any cassette in and the IT’S REAL plays your old tapes, whether they’re albums or personally made mixtapes that were a standard fixture of music-sharing culture in the 80-90s before discs became a thing. Buttons underneath the transparent hood let you play, pause, rewind, fast-forward, or eject the cassette, following the traditional functionality of cassette players from before… but what really sets the IT’S REAL player apart, is that it comes with a “Bluetooth Cassette”. While the IT’S REAL device is a purely traditional cassette player, the Bluetooth Cassette that comes along with it turns it into a Bluetooth speaker. Put the cassette in, start the player, and the cassette turns into a Bluetooth transmitting device, allowing you to pair a smartphone. Once paired, the cassette allows you to play music from your phone on the IT’S REAL’s built-in speakers. Bluetooth 5.0 means the cassette pairs with your phone seamlessly, and here’s the kicker – it can be used with other cassette players too – not necessarily just the IT’S REAL. Pop the Bluetooth cassette into your dad’s boombox, your hipster uncle’s Walkman, or even your grandfather’s car that still has a functional cassette deck built into the car’s dashboard. A lot of the IT’S REAL’s joy lies in its aesthetic and its retro-revival. The transparent design is beyond gorgeous, allowing you to appreciate the workings of the cassette player quite literally like some Teenage Engineering-like device that isn’t afraid to bare its electronics instead of hiding everything under a plastic facade. The act of playing a cassette tape may have died 20 years ago, but just like fashion is cyclical, tech trends have a way of making a comeback too – and the IT’S REAL capitalizes on this retro joy beautifully while still being a Bluetooth-enabled future-friendly device that anyone can use and love. For makers NINM Labs, this is far from their first rodeo. They debuted back in 2018 with the IT’S OK Cassette Player – a Walkman version of this product that did over $80,000 in funding from nearly a thousand backers. Soon after, the IT’S REAL Cassette Player made its Kickstarter debut, smashing past its funding goal by over 500%. The product is now available on the NINM Lab website for $151.86 USD.",
