  "text": "For a company that single-handedly revived transparent tech, the Headphones (1) have absolutely no transparency in their design. If you saw this video dated a month or so ago, it was Nothing literally confirming that they were due to debut their first over-ears. The internet’s been asking for Nothing to build AirPods Max ‘killers’ for a while, and it seems like Carl Pei finally had his cards in place to make this play… However, images from a private preview earlier last week showed what the headphones looked like – and the internet has thoughts. A lot of people on Reddit can’t help notice the odd shape, commenting on how it looks different from what they expected… and that’s a good thing. Subverting expectations is great if you can create a design that’s somehow received more positively than the consumer’s expectations. The problem is that Nothing’s ardent fan base now always has the highest expectations. And as a fan, I did too. Designer: Monica Bhyrappa Call me pedantic, but Nothing’s entire design DNA was transparency. Whether it was the earbuds or the phones, there was always an element of ‘see-through’ in their tech. Not so much in the phones, given how densely components are packed inside, but the Ear (1), Ear (a), and Ear (open) all had a transparent outer housing that let you peer into the electronics below. While the ‘alleged’ Headphones (1) do have a transparent shell, the design is FAR from actually transparent. In fact, it’s entirely opaque, except for one can-hugging outer shell that doesn’t really let you ‘peer into the headphones.’ That’s when I stumbled upon the ‘Spectrum’ headphones by Monica Bhyrappa. These phones were especially designed for wearers with autism, allowing them to experience less sensory load as compared to other humans. Autistic people experience the world very differently, and an overload of sensory input can easily overwhelm them. The Spectrum are a specially-tuned pair of noise-canceling headphones designed to phase out too many noises, allowing wearers to focus on audio that actually matters. The design brief is spectacular, and I’m all for accessible tech, but I couldn’t help but also notice one of Monica’s concept renders, which featured a set of transparent cans… and the second I saw them, I knew exactly what I wanted the Nothing Headphones (1) to look like. Nothing’s ethos is broadly to make tech fun again – not through awkward shapes, but through an eye-catching design that boasts transparency. You have a broader appreciation for tech if you know what’s inside it, or at least that’s what I personally believe. Beats by Dre had this entire scandal following a teardown that revealed metal cubes inside the headphones, added with zero purpose other than to make them feel ‘heavier’ and therefore ‘premium’. Nothing’s transparent tech was supposed to be an open challenge to that. Are the upcoming Headphones (1) ‘fun’? I’m sure there’s a set of people who love the design, and a set of people who think it’s funky, but not specifically for them. That isn’t the point I’m trying to make. What I personally wish is that the headphones adopted the ‘transparency’ design direction more aggressively. Headphones aren’t like phones. They’re thicker, have more air gaps to allow for vibrating components and air-based resonance. This inherently allows for headphones to have a lot of empty space on the inside – empty space that is PERFECT for beautifully showcasing through transparency. No, I don’t want glyphs on my headphones. But I do wish they looked a little different. I wish they championed transparency more than they currently are… because let’s not deny that Monica Bhyrappa’s Spectrum headphones do look absolutely gorgeous!",
