Inspired by the textures of cacao, chocolate, and coffee, this progression from last year’s Peach Fuzz signals an evolution in the wish for comfort, moving into a more grounded dimension.‘Underpinned by our desire for everyday pleasures, Mocha Mousse expresses thoughtful indulgence,’ says Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute. ‘A flavorful brown shade, PANTONE 17-1230 Mocha Mousse envelopes us with its sensorial warmth.’ Described as a ‘warming rich brown hue,’ Mocha Mousse reflects a growing global need for balance, comfort, and a deeper connection to nature. In a world-first partnership, the unveiling will be marked by a light show on the London Eye, bathing the London skyline in the tones of Mocha Mousse, Pantone’s color of the year 2025.images courtesy of Pantoneglobal celebrations for the 26th anniversary of the initiativeThis year marks the 26th anniversary of Pantone’s Color of the Year initiative, and for the first time, the celebration will span multiple global cities, including New York, Shanghai, and Mumbai.
