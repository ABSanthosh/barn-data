  "text": "What happens when clean lines, soft textures, and intentional lighting come together? You get the Lightwell Apartment, a serene retreat that turns everyday living into a sensory experience! The space is designed by Alexey Gulesha, Daniel Glamazdinov and Victoria Romaniuk.The Lightwell Apartment is minimal, but it’s also much about atmosphere. Every surface, shade, and shadow has been thoughtfully curated to create calm. From the warm wood tones to the subtle interplay of natural and artificial light, this space proves that design isn’t just something you see. It’s something you feel. The living space in the Lightwell Apartment is all about effortless elegance. Framed by full-height windows and soft drapery, the room feels airy yet grounded. A plush, neutral-toned sectional anchors the space. Sleek built-ins and a sculptural floor lamp keep the look modern, while the oversized artwork adds drama (but quietly). Light moves fluidly through the space, bouncing off the pale rug and matte finishes—a perfect example of design that lets the atmosphere do the talking. The dining and kitchen area of the Lightwell Apartment features a sculptural marble. Its curved surface catches the light and adds softness to the space’s sharp geometry. Paired with chrome-framed chairs, the setting feels refined yet approachable. Behind it, the kitchen disappears into the walls. There’s a seamless blend of cabinetry and shelving in soft, creamy tones. Open shelves offer just enough display to feel styled but never cluttered. With concealed appliances and thoughtful lighting, this kitchen doesn’t demand attention… it earns it with restraint. The bedroom in the Lightwell Apartment feels like a breath of calm. Soft, sun-washed tones wrap the space in warmth. Amidst this, the low platform bed and layered textures invite rest without distraction. The built-in desk is both sculptural and functional. A muted artwork floats above the bed, tying in the color palette with grace. Glass walls blur the line between sleeping and living, making the entire suite feel open, fluid, and bathed in natural light. The bathroom in the Lightwell Apartment is a refined blend of spa-like serenity and sculptural design. A freestanding tub anchors the space with quiet elegance, while matte black fixtures provide just the right amount of contrast. The floating oak vanity adds warmth and depth. This is paired with twin vessel sinks that echo the apartment’s love for clean curves. Large-format tiles, soft lighting, and a frameless glass shower complete the scene.",
