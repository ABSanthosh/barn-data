  "text": "Called the Zen, this tiny home is designed by the Australian tiny house building company Havenn Tiny Houses. It is a highly versatile home that is ideal for glamping enthusiasts. It isn’t intended for full-time living, but it serves as a multi-purpose single-level dwelling for short-term stays. It isn’t exactly a home, but an extra space for a home, quite like an ADU. Zen Tiny functions as an excellent additional space for a separate amenity. This unique and compact tiny abode is called an ‘Essential Luxury’, as it offers all the perks of a full-time home and the minimalism of a tiny home but in a truly tiny package. Designer: Havenn Tiny Houses Zen is half the size of a typical home on wheels, as it features a length of 14.2 feet, a width of 7.5 feet, and a height of 9.8 feet. It features a simple single-level layout that is ideal for multi-purpose flexibility. It can be used as a lovely self-contained bedroom that is surrounded by nature, making for the perfect glamping escapade. It can also be utilized as a home office, as it has more than enough room for two office setups. It is equipped with high ceilings, large windows, and a cute French door. These features help create a space that feels spacious and free-flowing. It would be great as a guest bedroom, as it has sufficient space for a queen-sized bed and essential storage. It is made using natural materials, and equipped with solar panels for a sustainable touch. Sustainably sourced and recycled materials were used to construct the home. The Zen tiny home is also equipped with energy-efficient insulation and windows, eco-friendly toilets, and solar panels. Water conservation is also achieved via greywater systems or rainwater collection, paired up with efficient fixtures. The home is designed to minimize environmental impact while offering a comfortable living space. The house is built using termite-and rust-proof frames on a galvanized steel base. The R-value 2.0 insulation provides comfort throughout the year, while the premium hybrid flooring adds some luxury. A large skylight has been placed above the main section of the home, allowing more natural light to stream in. The home also includes a fully-equipped kitchen and laundry appliances. The bathroom is also well-designed, and the toilet has an eco-friendly version for off-the-grid situations. The Zen tiny house is compact and minimal, yet well-equipped making for an excellent tiny home. It is priced at $18,750, so isn’t very expensive either. It lets you connect with the outdoors while reducing the impact on the environment.",
