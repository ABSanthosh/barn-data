  "description": "This Stupid Car Tray is something that will never make it into the MoMA, but which will probably make a lot of peoples' lives easier. And some good design thought has been put into it. It's a simple tray with legs on one end, allowing you to turn your car's passenger seat into a level surface. A tongue on the back slots between the seat and seatback, preventing it from sliding forward. The legs are hollow, allowing you to slide in taller items or the included cupholders. Rubber pads on the bottom prevent it from marring your seat surface. There's a thoughtful little notch on one side to admit a phone charging cable. A strap can be used to hold things in place. As pedestrian as this object seems, I like it because it considers how people actually use things, as opposed to how manufacturers think we use things. Plenty of people use the passenger seat as a storage locker. If anything it's strange that no auto manufacturer has picked up on this and designed a similar object.",
