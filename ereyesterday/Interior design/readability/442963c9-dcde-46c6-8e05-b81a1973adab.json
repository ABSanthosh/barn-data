I’ll also show you how various sets look together and share a few tips to help you create lovely arrangements! First, if you don’t want to sift through the tips in the post to find the links, here are my favorite Amazon tulips and a few others similar options if you are looking for a particular color or price point (and sometimes they have coupons!). These are the three types I ordered that look the most realistic: White Tulips Latex Coral Tulips (some of them on this link are a little different, these are latex, so be sure to double check what you order) Light Pink Tulips A couple more to consider: Tulips I don’t have yet but look similar to mine (and may come in other colors and bouquet sizes) Bigger set These white tulips (most realistic) mixed with these cream tulips (original set I bought years ago) I will begin by saying there is no comparison between real flowers and faux. Whenever it’s possible to have real, they will always be infinitely more beautiful. Real plants and flowers bring more joy and health benefits, too. :). But I do think there are reasons you may want consider having faux! We live in Washington state which is the tulip capital of the United States, so I feel a little guilty talking about faux when the tulip farms all around us are about to burst into bloom. :) But, let’s talk about them anyway! Over the past few years I’ve been growing in my appreciation for having some seasonal faux stems and blooms around the house for a few reasons (not to mention faux blooms are getting so much more realistic!). Above: Light Pink Tulips // Latex Coral Tulips (some of them on this link are a little different, these are latex, so be sure to double check what you order) Here are a few of the reasons I have come to appreciate having faux blooms: They are available for a bouquet whenever I want them.I can have more than one bouquet at a time all year round.Buying real flowers often can get expensive.I don’t always have flowers in my yard and we’re just getting started with landscaping.I can put a seasonal bouquet anywhere in the house and don’t have to worry that our puppy Finnegan will sneak off to eat them.It’s nice to invest once and be able to keep them for a long time.I enjoy seeing pretty bouquets around the house more often.and best of all, I like that they are EASY CARE! I will share more about my definition of an easy care house sometime :) but today let me show you some of my faux tulips! Tulips on the left // Tulips on the right I don’t know if you’ve looked for faux tulips lately, but they don’t all look the same. You can see the tulips on the left in the photo above look so much more realistic than the ones on the right–look at the difference in the leaves and stems (even though both of these tulips sets are very pretty). There are several distinctions that make the ones on the left look more realistic (and tips for what to look for when selecting faux tulips): The tulips are made of different materials that make them even feel like real tulips! The leaves and stems look more realistic The coloring on each bloom is more unique Some of the tulips in the set are closed and some are opening up — which I think is more like a real bouquet The more realistic blooms can be more expensive per stem, but it’s nice that you can find bouquets with fewer stems if you want to keep the cost down. Of course you can always collect more over time, or mix several types together! One way to stretch the budget is to mix new and old, or more expensive and less expensive, together. TIP: if you’re mixing more realistic stems with less realistic, try putting the more realistic leaves on the outer part of the bouquet. Let me show you a couple of tulip combinations I’ve used for my bouquets: Here is what this realistic bouquet of 10 tulips looks like in my pitcher. I love how simple, airy and natural just ten tulips look with a few flopping over the side of the pitcher. This is another set I considered as well — they look to be very similar. Be sure to check what they are made of when you shop if that matters to you, as well as compare what the leaves and stems look like (and the length of the stems). Sometimes one set is more expensive because it’s better quality or because of how many blooms are included (and that often makes the price per stem less, something to consider!). You can mix different types of tulips to stretch your budget but also the variation can give it a more realistic look. Or mix real with faux, no one needs to know :). Here is is what my pitcher looks like with 20 mixed stems —this has 10 stems that have the more realistic leaves (two bundles of five come in this one set — and you can get different colors) plus I added 10 stems of the less realistic leaves in a champagne color. This is what the champagne color tulips look like up close. Here’s a little bouquet of several colors with the more realistic tulips, wouldn’t these make a pretty bouquet? They come in different colors as well. Light pink Latex coral White These are the three types I ordered that look the most realistic: White Latex coral (some of them are a little different, these are latex, so be sure to double check what you order) Light pink I almost ordered these, they look very similar (they have more stems, but the cost per stem was less). And here is my original set of light pink tulips, my original set of coral tulips, mixed with a few of the newer realistic ones! I love coral so the pop of color on these is a joy-bringer….and they are holding me over until I can get to the tulip farms and buy the real deal! Want to watch videos where I compare these tulips and share tips on how to arrange them? Here are 3 you can check out: A comparison of my new coral tulips mixed with my original pink and coral sets. A close-up video of the realistic white tulip bundle. A comparison of my new white tulips with my original set, plus tips on how to arrange them together in a vase.
