  "text": "The sky darkens. Clouds drift lazily across the horizon. A playful moon peeks out from behind a cushiony barrier, observing the world below with childlike curiosity. This isn’t a scene from a storybook. It’s the dial of the new Christopher Ward x Mr Jones Celestial moonphase watch. Designer: Christopher Ward x Mr Jones When two British watchmakers collide, the result is rarely predictable. This collaboration has produced something genuinely distinctive in the often conservative world of horology—a watch that defies convention while celebrating the poetry of time itself. The Celestial immediately announces itself as something different. Gone are traditional hour markers and conventional hands. Instead, two purple swallows sweep across a dreamy nightscape, one tracking minutes along the outer edge while its companion indicates hours closer to the center. These avian timekeepers glide above three-dimensional pastel blue clouds. Behind this celestial cushion, a deep blue background studded with silver-gilted stars creates remarkable depth. But the true star is undoubtedly the moon. The luminous lunar face, rendered in a playfully cartoonish style, peeks out from behind the cloud formation. This isn’t merely decorative—it’s a functioning moonphase complication that accurately mimics the moon’s natural cycle throughout each month. What strikes me most is how this design manages to be both technically impressive and emotionally evocative. It captures that magical moment when day transitions to night—that liminal space where imagination takes flight. The Celestial’s distinctive artwork comes courtesy of Bea Watts, an assembly technician at Mr Jones Watches who won an internal design competition. “My design celebrates the beauty of the night sky in a playful way,” Watts explains. “I was inspired by the magical feeling of sitting outside to watch the sunset, and staying there till day transitions into night.” This personal connection gives the watch authentic emotional resonance. Watts hasn’t just created a pretty face—she’s captured a specific feeling, a moment of tranquility that resonates with anyone who’s ever spent time stargazing. Beneath the whimsical exterior beats some serious horological engineering. The watch is powered by Christopher Ward’s Calibre JJ04, which combines a Sellita base movement with an in-house moonphase module. What makes this movement special is how it handles the moonphase complication. Rather than advancing in discrete jumps, the moon display moves in one continuous, smooth motion. This is achieved by linking the moon display directly to the hour hand, ensuring both are in perpetual motion. The technical precision is remarkable. If kept wound, the moonphase complication will maintain its accuracy for an astonishing 128 years before requiring adjustment. All this technology is housed within a modest 37mm stainless steel case that sits 13.10mm thick. The watch offers 30 meters of water resistance—sufficient for everyday wear but not for swimming. This represents more than just a one-off novelty. It brings together two significant players in British watchmaking, each with their own distinct approach to the craft. Christopher Ward pioneered the online-only premium watch model when it launched in 2004, building its reputation on solid engineering and accessible luxury. Mr Jones Watches, meanwhile, has carved out its niche with boldly artistic timepieces that challenge conventional notions of how a watch should look and function. Both brands share a commitment to British watchmaking, and both founders serve as advocates for the Alliance of British Watch and Clock Makers. The Celestial represents a true collaboration rather than simply a co-branding exercise. Mr Jones provided the artistic direction, while Christopher Ward contributed the technical expertise. The result is a watch that couldn’t have been created by either brand working alone. Unlike traditional watches that prioritize instant readability, the Celestial asks for a moment of your attention. It rewards this pause with a miniature narrative that unfolds with each glance. The dial is essentially a slow-moving carousel. Time is read by observing the positions of the birds: one representing hours, the other pointing to minutes. This creates a continuous, animated effect that changes throughout the day. This approach to timekeeping feels more mindful, more connected to the natural rhythms the watch depicts. It’s less about telling time and more about experiencing it. Despite its artistic nature, the Celestial remains practical. The 37mm case size makes it accessible to a wide range of wrists, while the 44.07mm lug-to-lug measurement ensures comfortable wear. Buyers can choose between light or dark blue leather straps or a five-link polished and brushed steel bracelet. The blue leather creates a more casual, artistic impression, while the bracelet lends a touch of formality without compromising the watch’s playful character. As with many Mr Jones creations, the Celestial is produced in limited quantities—only 300 pieces will be made. Priced at $2,650 on a leather strap or $2,810 on the steel bracelet, it occupies an interesting middle ground in the watch market. It’s certainly not an entry-level timepiece, but compared to many limited edition watches with specialized complications, it offers considerable value. The watch is available now through both Christopher Ward and Mr Jones’ online stores. The Christopher Ward x Mr Jones Celestial represents something increasingly rare in watchmaking: genuine creativity. In an industry often bound by tradition and incremental evolution, this collaboration dares to reimagine what a moonphase watch can be. What makes it special isn’t just its technical specifications or limited production run. It’s the emotional response it evokes—a watch designed to make you smile, to remind you of quiet moments spent gazing at the night sky, to reconnect you with a sense of wonder. The Celestial strips timekeeping back to its emotional roots—tracking day and night through characters, rhythm, and color. It’s a kinetic art object built around a mechanical core, meant for anyone who sees the poetry in passing minutes. The night sky has inspired humanity since we first looked upward. With the Celestial, Christopher Ward and Mr Jones have captured a small piece of that eternal wonder and made it wearable. In a world of increasingly homogenized watch design, such creative courage deserves recognition—and perhaps a place on your wrist.",
