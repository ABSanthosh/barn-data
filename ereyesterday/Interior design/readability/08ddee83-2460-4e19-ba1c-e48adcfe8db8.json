  "text": "People who love the freedom of a mouse with a customizable trackpad, the Ploopy Classic is a no-brainer. The Canadian company respected for open-source peripherals made a name for itself with the customizable mouse launched in 2019, and now an upgraded version has landed with improved features and improved design that retains some elements for ergonomic success. The Ploopy Classic 2 trackball mouse makes subtle tweaks to how the peripheral functions for a more reliable and accurate scroll wheel experience. Being open source means the mouse can be easily 3D printed or even modified with custom cases in preferred colors for your convenience. The fresh version has a design and shape more or less similar to the predecessor. The large bulge on one side lets you rest the palm for more control over the big red ball trackpad input with the finger. There is a side-mounted scroll wheel that can be controlled with the thumb like any other editing or gaming mouse. Designer: Ploopy Hardware upgrades come in the form of a USB-C port swapped for the earlier USB Type-B port. That should make it more practical in your desk setup as third-party cables can be connected to the peripheral. To have more precise control over the scroll wheel, the mouse gets a Raspberry Pi RP2040 microcontroller that lets it run 15 times faster. One problem that the Classic had was the glitchy behaviour (unexpected directional switch) whenever the scroll wheel was rotated too quickly. Other hardware remains the same, like the PMW-3360 optical sensor and D2LS-21 button switches that have a satisfying button click. Since there is no way the original Classic can be upgraded with newer components as the printed PCB circuit board is non-removable, the company will discontinue the peripheral. Coming back to the Classic 2, it has the open-source QMK firmware that is installed on the trackball. That makes the mouse plug-and-play without any hassles that can sometimes accompany an open-source design. The open source plans for the mouse are available on GitHub, and you can make any number of modifications to suit your preferences. For the Ploopy Classic 2 trackpad mouse, you’ll need to buy the $101 kit that has to be assembled and soldered. If you don’t prefer that option, go for the $147 pre-assembled version. We’re sure DIY’ers and geeks will surely go for the raw kit option, as assembling the mouse will in itself be a very satisfying experience. We’ll need to test out the scroll wheel efficiency in real time to validate any claims by Ploopy, but it should be glitch-free for sure. As a personal preference, we would want a blue and black combo for the faceplates since it’ll match our work desk aesthetics.",
