This stunning interior design project, by Elemental Design, challenges the norm.We see rich, Eastern influences along with multi-functional furniture—all while embracing bold color. In this home, every detail tells a story. There are soft curves and intricate textures. And the vibrant colors aren’t just accents. They’re an integral part of the decor. Let’s walk through this space to look into it. The living area blends softness, warmth, and bold accents—and perfectly captures Eastern-inspired design. Curved architecture (seen through the walls) takes center stage. This creates an organic flow in the space. Simultaneously, warm beige tones set a tranquil atmosphere. A sculptural cream sofa with fluid lines anchors the space. The soft curvature of the seating arrangement complements the architecture of the room (and reinforces a cohesive aesthetic). We can see pops of muted terracotta bringing the space to life. Strategic zoning defines the open-plan layout, with a round area rug subtly demarcating the lounge from the dining and kitchen spaces. In the kitchen, the curved countertops are integrated with a round dining table. The wooden cabinetry has a vintage vibe, again another element of Eastern design. Nearby, we see a recessed area with muted terracotta tones, providing room for residents to practice their passions. This same tone of muted terracotta also dominates the foyer. The bedroom in this home is light and airy. It is dominated by beige tones. A plush upholstered bed is topped with interesting artwork, while the sleek beige cabinetry offers functionality. There’s also a compact section in the cabinetry to hold a decor piece.  We especially love the compact vanity. This features hues of terracotta as well as a mirror with curves and globe lights. A curved, wall-mounted desk provides room to work, while the wall-mounted cabinetry above saves space and provides room to store books. Finally, the large window allows natural light to illuminate the space.",
