  "text": "The Woven Apartment, designed by Khang Concept, is where the curves do the talking. The architectural forms create a statement of their own, letting understated design have its moment! The color palette is dominated by calming neutrals. Simultaneously, organic textures come together to add coziness. Whether it’s the arched details, woven finishes, or the muted palette, this home proves that minimalism doesn’t have to feel cold… it can feel like a hug. In the living room, a sculptural cream-toned sofa curves gently along the wall. This is grounded by a layered rug and organic coffee table. Floor-to-ceiling sheer curtains filter in natural light. The built-in bench seating and abstract wall art add character without clutter. The kitchen in the Woven Apartment is clean-lined and calming. It is a blend of matte cabinetry, wood textures, and soft under-cabinet lighting. The palette sticks to soothing tones, while the oversized hood and sleek open shelving bring drama. Tucked into a cozy nook, the dining area is all about organic flow. A custom-built banquette curves around a round black pedestal table, paired with a mix of rattan and sculptural chairs. A pendant lamp with natural textures floats above. This corner invites long, lingering meals and easy conversations. This bedroom is simple yet sophisticated. A soft upholstered bed adds functionality, while the wooden cabinetry provides storage space. A nightstand holds a globe lamp and a plant, adding to the decor of the otherwise minimalist room. The bedroom is a tranquil retreat. Custom wardrobes with woven panels frame a niche styled with ambient lighting. To the side, a sculptural desk with a chunky black leg and floating vanity shelves makes the space multifunctional. Natural light filters through full-length curtains, brushing softly against neutral bedding and organic textures. Playful yet polished, this bedroom features a soft, rainbow-arched headboard that adds charm. The mint green desk and sculptural shelves introduce a fun pop of color. With built-in wardrobes and a cozy workspace, it’s perfect for comfort as well as creativity. This bathroom continues the use of curves, as seen in the mirror. A terracotta-hued shower cubicle is segregated with a glass partition, keeping the space airy. The second bathroom uses the same terracotta color, but this time for the area around the vanity. This time, a curved partition separates the shower area. Matte black fixtures add visual interest.",
