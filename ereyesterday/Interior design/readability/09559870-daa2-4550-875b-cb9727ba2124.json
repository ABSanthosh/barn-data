  "text": "The Ember Apartment—effortlessly chic and irresistibly cozy! This space is moody and dark. But it’s also equal parts inviting. We like to call it a warm minimalist interior where rich materials dance amidst a restrained color palette. The space feels elegant and livable. And at the same time, it’s sophisticated. Let’s walk through the space to see what it feels like. The open-plan living space feels spacious yet intimate. Its layout encourages relaxation and allows residents to effortlessly move around—despite the compact space. The area for lounging is positioned right next to the dining and kitchen areas, which fosters an organic flow of conversation. The floor-to-ceiling window allows natural light to bathe the space during the day. Simultaneously, the sheer neutral curtains soften this light. Even when sunlight enters, the moody palette of browns makes sure to retain the dramatic vibe of the space.  At the center of the living space is a low-profile modular sofa. Its rounded silhouette adds organic forms. The muted area rug softens the space underfoot. Opposite the sofa, a sculptural accent chair with fluid curves adds an artistic touch. A monolithic coffee table in dark-toned marble serves as a focal point in the living area. It has a sleek and rectangular finish a sleek stone finish. The kitchen in the Ember Apartment features an island as the partition—a space-savvy design trick. It is striped on one end and features a marble pattern on the other. If residents want to enjoy dining here, the island has potential to add on a few bar stools, too. The cabinetry is matte and hardware-less, adding to the modern vibe of the space. Finally, the dining area in the Ember Apartment is a matte black, organically shaped dining table. It is sleek in build, so it occupies less visual estate, while still providing ample room for residents to enjoy meals and create memories. A swing arm wall lamp makes sure they can get targeted lighting as and when needed.",
