If not picking the color itself, then deciding how to make that color work in the space, what to pair it with and how to make it shine. There is a science to the matching of colors. It’s called color theory, but you don’t need an art degree to learn it. These six basic color combinations form the foundation of color theory, and once you start understanding them, choosing the right shades will feel much, much easier. Monochromatic A monochromatic color scheme sticks to a single color but uses different shades, tints, and tones of it. It works well in small spaces because it creates keeps things from feeling too busy or overwhelming. If you’re worried about it being same-y, just remember to make sure there’s contrast, that’s what keeps a monochromatic color scheme from seeming too dull. Texture also plays a big role. A flat, all-blue room could feel lifeless, but mixing materials like wood, fabric, and glass makes it interesting.

They work well together because they have similar tones, naturally flowing into one another without being one-note either. This method is great for people who love color but don’t want anything too bold or contrasting. To make it work, pick one dominant color and let the others support it. If green is the main color in a room, add blues and/or yellow-greens into the decor. This will make the main color pop without taking attention away from it.

These combinations are bold, high-contrast, and full of energy. They create a livelier space, but can feel overwhelming if not balanced well. Just make sure one remains the main color while the other serves as an accent A navy blue couch with burnt orange pillows feels intentional, but that blue couch paired and an orange chair might be a bit much. You could also go for more muted versions of both colors so the contrast is still there without the colors themselves being too loud. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz Split-Complementary A split-complementary color scheme takes a complementary pair and shifts it slightly. Instead of using two opposite colors, you pick one and pair it with the two colors next to its complement. For example, instead of just blue and orange, you might use blue with yellow-orange and red-orange. This method keeps some of the stark bold contrast that complimentary colors share, but softens it, making it less jarring. It’s a great way to introduce a mix of warm and cool tones in the same space. It’s perfect for those who like a little visual interest without the intensity of a full complementary scheme. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz Triadic Triadic color schemes use three colors that are evenly spaced on the color wheel, like red, yellow, and blue. These combinations are bold and full of personality.  Like the other color schemes, triadic works best when one color is the main feature, but it works well when balanced with plenty of neutrals or natural elements, too. A green, purple, and orange palette can play into earth tones and wood accents, for example. This is a great option for playful, creative spaces like kids’ rooms, art studios, or any area you want to have a unique look. Photo Credit: Envato Elements / bialasiewicz Color is one of the most powerful tools in interior design. The way colors work together can change how a space feels entirely. The mood, the air, the energy, all of this is affected by color, let along your style and decor. These basic combinations are the foundation of color theory, and once you understand them, you can mix and match with more confidence.
