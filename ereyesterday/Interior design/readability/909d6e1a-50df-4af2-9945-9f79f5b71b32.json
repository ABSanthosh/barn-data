  "text": "MVRDV has recently completed an innovative building known as Portlantis, characterized by its unique design resembling a stack of twisting boxes. This energy-positive structure is designed to host exhibition spaces and is intended to be dismantled and recycled at the end of its useful life. Portlantis spans 3,533 square meters (38,000 square feet) and is composed of five stacked boxes, each housing a distinct exhibition space. At the heart of the building is a large atrium, with a restaurant situated near the top. Each exhibition level features a unique theme and is equipped with panoramic windows that provide stunning views. The building also includes a rooftop viewing point for even more impressive vistas. Access to each level is facilitated by a bright red staircase on the building’s exterior, and there is likely an elevator installed as well. Designer: MVRDV “Portlantis is a beacon, it’s eye-catching, but it’s also a kind of watchtower,” said MVRDV founding partner Winy Maas. “When you live in Rotterdam, the port sits on the horizon – it’s ‘over there’ and many people don’t know what goes on there. Portlantis gives people a way to investigate, and see how things are changing in the port, how that relates to the city, and how it affects the life they live in the city. It does this extremely efficiently – like a machine for storytelling.” As previously mentioned, the end of the building’s useful life has been thoughtfully considered in its design. When Portlantis reaches the end of its lifespan, an agreement ensures that its facade panels will be returned to the manufacturer, promoting a cycle of reuse. Recyclable materials have been utilized wherever possible throughout the construction to minimize environmental impact. The foundation is also engineered to leave no permanent trace, allowing the site to be restored to its natural state after the building is dismantled. The building is also equipped with an on-site wind turbine and features exceptional insulation, along with a comprehensive focus on energy-efficient design. This allows Portlantis to generate 30% more energy than it requires, contributing to its status as an energy-positive structure. It is presumed that this energy surplus is averaged over a year. The building is also connected to the grid, and this provides a reliable energy source during periods when wind power alone may not be sufficient to meet the building’s energy needs. As mentioned, the uppermost level of Portlantis is home to a restaurant with a capacity to seat 150 guests, providing diners with breathtaking panoramic views of the port and its surroundings. The restaurant’s design includes windows that can be opened, offering visitors an open, balcony-like atmosphere that enhances the dining experience. Above this, an accessible rooftop provides a perfect finale to the educational journey through the building, allowing visitors to reflect on everything they’ve learned about the port and its significant impact on shaping the modern world.",
