  "text": "DecoratingFurnitureShoppingWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.As a shopping editor, one of my biggest challenges is keeping my small one-bedroom apartment clutter-free. It manages to stay spotless for approximately a day before all surfaces are covered with stuff. It’s maddening to both my boyfriend and I, but that’s what happens when you have to test so many home and kitchen products. I can tame the kitchen and bathroom pretty easily, but one area that also spills over is the makeshift office space that my boyfriend and I have in our living room. As a writer and editor, I, of course, adore notebooks, planners, sticky notes, and writing utensils — I have an absurd amount of pens. I find that a lot of office organizers are ugly. I’ve been stalking a variety of furniture websites to try to find the perfect desk organizer for years and haven’t been able to find it until now. I was familiar with Levenger, because my coworker wrote about one of the brand’s jewelry organizers last year, but I didn’t know that it sold furniture until my boss pointed it out. While browsing, I found Levenger’s Cubi Corner Desk Bookcase, which was exactly what I was looking for. And luckily, it’s on rare sale for the holiday season — 30% off with the code TRADITION.What Is Levenger’s Cubi Corner Desk Bookcase?The Cubi Corner Desk Bookcase can stand on its own, either on a desk or table corner, or can be configured in a variety of ways. For example, it can be combined with other Levenger organizers to create a whole, custom shelving unit. It’s designed to hold everything from magazines to pens and pencils. Unlike other direct-to-consumer companies, this arrives fully assembled. It’s available in either Natural Cherry or Dark Cherry wood. I opted for the Natural Cherry, because I thought that it complemented the other wooden side table that I have in the room.Why I Love Levenger’s Cubi Corner Desk BookcaseHonestly, I was prepared to be disappointed when it came to this bookcase. I’ve been testing products for nearly five years, and I’ve become a bit skeptical of products. There’s a lot out there that I don’t consider to be worth the money, but the Cubi Corner Desk Bookcase did defy my expectations. Some furniture within this price range can feel cheap, but this desk felt remarkably well-made (I also loved that I didn’t have to assemble it!). This bookcase was clearly smartly designed — it created space out of thin air on an area of my desk that I wasn’t using effectively. I was able to corral my many magazines, planners, and several books. I love that I can flip it on its side and use it that way as well. Even though I might move in the future (though hopefully not too soon), I could see this piece traveling from apartment to apartment with me. I’ll always be able to find a tiny space for it.Buy: Cubi Corner Desk Bookcase, $139.65 (normally $199.50)",
