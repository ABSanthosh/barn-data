Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Awhile back I was browsing Facebook Marketplace (as I do from time to time) and I stumbled upon a vintage blue and white platter that stopped me in my tracks. It was too far away for me to pick up so I let it go, but I couldn’t stop thinking about it! I had never seen this pattern before so i did a little research on eBay and found two more vintage blue and white platters as well as a large bowl that had different whimsical scenes on each–a couple of them even had sailboats! The brand is Vtg Sanyei (I see them sometimes on Etsy like this one). I LOVE dishes with different charming scenes like this, so I couldn’t resist — one at a time I bought all three. The “winter scene” I bought through a bid (you can sometimes bid on items to get a better price). Lucky for me the seller accepted my bid immediately and I got a great deal on it, so I was pleased about that. Now the only decision is where to put them! They are LARGE and I have a smaller home with fewer walls heheh. I bought heavy duty plate hangers (which I wrote about here, but I would use the heavy duty ones for these) as I am considering if I want to hang them (and they are quite heavy so I’ll have to think that over). I usually try not to buy things without knowing exactly where to put them but I made an exception since I loved them so much. I know I can set them up on my kitchen shelves if I could find the right stands, so I know I’ll find a spot. Stay tuned and I’ll share where these end up! :) More Inspiration: How to Hang Plates on the Wall Cafe Curtains in my Home and Hardware",
