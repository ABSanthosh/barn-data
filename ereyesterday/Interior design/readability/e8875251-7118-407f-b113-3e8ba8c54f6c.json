  "description": "Artist Leah Fraser approaches styling her home like starting one of her paintings, carefully composing each room with layers of colour, whimsy, and eclectic charm. The grand Victorian house is a hub of activity for Leah, her partner David Shrimpton, daughters Odette and Matilda, and their dogs, but there’s also a softness to the space, enhanced by romantic vintage furnishings and period features. Take a closer look inside this gorgeous home, which feels like a slice of the French countryside in Bronte!",

  "text": "Long before they bought it, artist Leah Fraser and David Shrimpton loved this Bronte home. ‘We have lived in the area for a long time, and had a place literally around the corner,’ explains Leah. ‘We used to walk past this place all the time and always loved it so much.’ Leah describes the large Victorian house as a ‘beautiful old dame’ filled with character, soul, and some wonderful little eccentricities. Originally built in the late 1800s, the property was extended by the previous owner with a sympathetic addition designed by Luigi Rosselli Architects. Leah and David have since embarked on their own renovations to address building issues, open up space, and add whimsy. ‘I think that the main challenges came from her being a very old house, as there was so much remedial work, and also because we didn’t want to lose any of the original features,’ says Leah. ‘All the flooring had to be ripped out and changed as it was in quite bad shape when we moved in.’ Leah’s ‘tile obsession’ drove many of the new material choices, starting with the black and white checkerboard kitchen flooring. Moroccan tiles in the bathroom introduce a more playful use of colour and texture to inspire escape and relaxation. ‘I also wanted to bring colour into both of those spaces, and as they are darker rooms, I lent into it and wrapped the colour around to the roof,’ says Leah. The updated kitchen has the feel of a house in the French countryside, owed to the new shiplap ceiling, arched entryway, and standalone vintage furniture. Leah explains, ‘I love that old kitchens that you see in rural Italy and France are really composed of pieces of furniture, and I think it gives a softness and makes it feel so unique.’ The direction of the staircase was meanwhile reconfigured, allowing more space for a larger main bedroom and en suite. At the very top of the house is the bell tower, creating views across the Bronte landscape. The family call it the ‘whale watching tower,’ where they can watch the ocean and world go by. Leah’s styling adds its own layer of romance to the home. She approaches interior design in a similar way to painting, devising each room as its own composition among a wider collection. ‘To me, a house should be cohesive even as you travel through each space, even though those spaces each have their own feeling,’ she says. ‘I love the views through doorways into other rooms being almost like a painting in itself, creating that moment of excitement and allure.’ Renovations were completed in seven months, setting the mood for the family and their lifestyle. Leah says there’s always ‘a million children in the house’ and other people stopping by, and this home encourages them to take a breath. ‘There’s always a softness, and music playing, and candles and incense.’ Leah Fraser’s new exhibition ‘Persephone’s Descent’ opens tomorrow at Arthouse Gallery in Rushcutters Bay.",
