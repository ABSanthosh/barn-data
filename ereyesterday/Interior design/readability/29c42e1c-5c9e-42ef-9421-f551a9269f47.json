  "text": "The green marble arrived before the foundation. This single fact reveals the priorities that would shape this Ontario home, designed by Studio Brocca, where Italian heritage and contemporary design sensibilities converge with thoughtful clarity. Standing on land once occupied by a 1940s property, the new residence serves as a prelude to the French chateau visible beyond, yet its soul speaks unmistakably of Tuscany. “The green marble is the first item we selected for the home, before we broke ground – and we did anything to make it happen,” Samantha Brocca says. The homeowners continue by saying, “Greens are not only our favorite color but they associate them with the beauty of the Italian countryside, rolling hills, and deep green cypress. Seeing as the house is set in a matured green space, greens also complement the exterior feel. The green marble was also brought in in the open concept closet in the bedroom, visible from all sizes surrounded by black metalwork to frame the opening and create a feeling of a light partition and interest in materials.” The 3,500-square-foot residence represents a balancing act between two design languages. Minimal architectural lines provide structure, while curves and arches create counterpoints of softness. This tension between linearity and fluidity manifests throughout the space, from circular light fixtures to the pickets of the staircase. What emerges might best be described as ‘warm minimalism’ – a term Brocca uses to capture the home’s essence. The palette draws directly from the Italian countryside, with deep greens reminiscent of cypress trees, and rust tones of terra cotta. “We feel that the color palette reminds us of the Tuscan wine country and rolling hills, but the contemporary touches bring the Tuscan palate into modern design,” the family says. “The overall feeling resembles and relates to multiple regions we have been so lucky to enjoy and keeps the gray months of Canada richer with warmth and color. The stacked wood framed openings in the bedroom give the feeling of rows of trees in Tuscan wine country.” For more information on Studio Brocca, visit studiobrocca.com. Photography by Lauren Miller. Leo Lei translates his passion for minimalism into his daily-updated blog Leibal. In addition, you can find uniquely designed minimalist objects and furniture at the Leibal Store.",
