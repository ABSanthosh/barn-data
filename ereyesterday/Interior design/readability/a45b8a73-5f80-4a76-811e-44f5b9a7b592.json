  "text": "Plywood and stainless steel meet historic brickwork in this bistro inside a former Kyiv nightclub designed by Ukrainian architect Nastia Mirzoyan. Named Kitsunya, the bistro opened earlier this year on the ground floor of a 150-year-old building in the city's Shevchenkivs'kyi district. Kitsunya opened in early 2024It serves Asian-style cuisine, which Mirzoyan subtly referenced in the interior by hanging rows of fabric panels – commonly used in Japanese interiors – above the bar. \"[Kitsunya] combines subtle Asian influences with a modern simplicity, aiming for a space that feels authentic without being overly decorated or traditional,\" the designer told Dezeen. It is located in Kyiv's vibrant Shevchenkivs'kyi districtDue to budgetary constraints, Mirzoyan opted to retain a number of existing built-in features – such as the bar that runs down the long, narrow space – as well as keeping original brickwork and services exposed. \"The bistro retains architectural features that add character to the space, including aged brick walls with rich textures from years of use,\" Mirzoyan continued. Most of the furnishings were made bespokeRather than spending money on changing the layout, the designer opted to invest in bespoke seating and tables, primarily made from wood and steel. According to the designer, the bar tables, bar stools, dining tables, metal stools and benches were all custom made for the project. Stainless steel and plywood contrast with historical elementsSquare-topped plywood tables are positioned against one wall flanked by Magnus Olesen X-line chairs – the blue seats and backrests provide a pop of colour in the otherwise neutral interior. Custom-made wall-mounted tables towards the front of the space are informed by the bar-style seating commonly found in ramen shops, and are paired with matching high stools. The venue transitions seamlessly from daytime to evening use – this sense of continuity was reinforced by the multiple forms of lighting present in the space. \"By using bright, neutral lighting in the morning and a warmer, amber-toned light in the evening, we crafted a space that feels welcoming for any time of day,\" the designer continued. Metallic elements feature throughoutIn dramatic contrast with the rest of the space, a corridor leading to the bathroom features walls lined with construction foil. This material was used for its affordability and capacity to reflect light, resulting in an unexpected and playful feel. The space used to be a nightclubKitsunya was previously occupied by a nightclub, which was forced to close following the Russian invasion of Ukraine due to newly imposed curfews. It was completed despite a shortage of people available to work in construction due to serving in the army. Mirzoyan has completed a number of projects in and around Kyiv despite the ongoing conflict, including the renovation of a Stalinist-era apartment and a cocktail bar with a dark brown and green colour palette. Projects by other studios situated in the Ukrainian capital include a house by Shovk that references Japanese design principles and a cosmetics showroom designed by Bude Architects.
