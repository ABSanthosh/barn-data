  "description": "If you’ve ever googled ‘best cafes in Melbourne’, you would have come across Florian Eatery on many, many lists. The charming Carlton North cafe has become a hotspot of our city’s hospitality scene since 2021, run by childhood friends Dom Gattermayr and Rose Richards. Now, the impressive duo has expanded their business into the space next door with the opening of their retail store, Florian Home — selling a collection of very cute homewares, vintage glasses, tableware, and pantry staples.",

  "text": "Florian Eatery might be famous for its picture-perfect breakfast plates, but second to the food, the duo behind the beloved cafe get the most compliments about their distinctive, homely interiors. Beyond its blue facade, Florian has a classic, slightly quirky and cosy charm, driven by an amalgamation of co-owners Dom Gattermayr and Rose Richards’ personal styles, their shared travels, and ‘life-long friendship’. ‘We’ve always wanted Florian to feel warm and inviting,’ Dom says. ‘People ask quite regularly where certain plates, vases or even artworks are from.’ ‘Most of the pieces decorating Florian belong to Rose and I — we took [them] from our houses to get the doors of Florian open in the early days when we didn’t have cash left for these things.’ This interest from customers is what prompted the friends-turned-business partners to start selling a small curation of objects from the café: tea towels, house made jams, and Tart magazines. So when the landlords approached Dom and Rose last year wondering if they’d like to take over the space next door to the cafe, the duo felt it was the perfect time to create their own retail store, Florian Home. The simple, yet eclectic and slightly international flavour of Florian home echoes the vibe of the cafe next door. Timber tables and bentwood chairs showcase a curation of locally made and vintage homewares, alongside a selection of pieces imported from Europe, while soft, hand-sewn curtains (made by Florian’s barista, Hannah!) complete the space. Dom says their focus is mostly on pieces for the kitchen and dining spaces; including elegant glassware from Ichendorf Milano or the Florian Home branded mug; Sabre Paris’ colourful cutlery; pantry staples like Golden Groves extra-virgin olive oil; and food and lifestyle publications. They’re also working with local makers on some exclusive commissions, such as ceramics by Tahni Bouhadana, and they’ve got a collection of in-house aprons in development. Rose says the team is pretty proud of the ‘little corner’ of Rathdowne Street they’ve carved out, which now gives customers the chance to take a piece of Florian’s hospitality experience into their own home. ‘We want people to see something beautiful and feel excited about going home with it, setting the table to have friends or family over, or just buying something for themselves or someone they love,’ she adds. ‘Buying something well made will last in your home forever, and the pieces we carry are timeless — so you know that you will be reaching for them in two or even 20 years time.’ Shop Florian Home online or in store at 619 Rathdowne Street, Carlton North.",
