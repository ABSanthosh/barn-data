  "text": "When the owner of this 149-square-metre Sydney apartment decided to downsize from her three-storey Mosman House in 2024, she didn’t want to compromise on comfort or functionality. ‘Her vision was clear,’ explains Jan Elias, director of Mr \u0026 Mrs Elias. ‘While the footprint was smaller… she wanted a space that still felt grand.’ The original apartment had a cramped layout with disconnected rooms that blocked natural light and, perhaps its biggest shortcoming, didn’t make the most of the stunning views of the Harbour Bridge beyond. But the potential was there, and a full-scale renovation ensued to open up the home and make the once hidden views the focal point. ‘The client’s brief was to create a sense of “wow”,’ Jan adds. The home underwent a complete redesign of the kitchen, living, dining, bedrooms and bathrooms, proving to be the biggest challenge for the team at Mr \u0026 Mrs Elias. ‘The view was hidden, which completely diminished the property’s potential,’ Jan explains. ‘We had to rethink the floor plan entirely, removing key walls, repositioning rooms, and working around structural constraints to ensure the flow led naturally to the Harbour Bridge.’ Even the material and colour palette was designed to honour the view, with natural stone, timber and soft lighting grounding the apartment. Refined finishes nod to its harbour-facing location, and the client’s wish for understated luxury. ‘The moment you walk through the front door and see the Harbour Bridge perfectly framed by the open-plan kitchen, dining and living room, it never fails to impress,’ says Jan. ‘It’s a reminder how smart spatial planning can completely transform a home.’ The apartment serves as a reminder that downsizing doesn’t mean compromising on space or comfort. ‘It was an honour to bring this client’s vision to life and create a space where every detail truly counts,’ Jan says.",
