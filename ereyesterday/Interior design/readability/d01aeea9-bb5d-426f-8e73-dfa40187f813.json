Please Read Our Disclosure Policy here Spindle Leg Table One of the secrets for a comfortable, welcoming room is to make sure you have surfaces for people to set down a drink, snack or a book. I like to have a variety of small tables throughout our home so we can move them around and use them as needed. In a smaller room, these little tables are essential. We’ve always used small tables in a variety of ways: nightstands next to chairs place to hold a stack of towels in the bathroom display a stack of books as a plant stand Of course, they are always our go-to when we have guests so everyone has a place to set a drink! Wood Oval Accent Table // More Sources Above Below I’ve rounded up a variety of small accent tables in different styles and finishes that would be so handy around the house! Click here for above sources (or scroll and click images below) If you love decorating ideas, or wish you had someone to help you decorate, I just completed the newest decorating guide in our step by step Room Recipe Method course! If you aren’t familiar with my decorating course, it’s brand new! It is a fresh and unique format for a course, each of the lessons is organized in a digital magazine! So much fun and an inspiring way to decorate your home. You can flip through each guide at your own leisure and start decorating right away! Each decorating guide is 60-100 ish pages, so there’s lot of practical information inside. I’ve assembled all of my own tips, formulas and guidance so I could share the step by step thought process and method I use to decorate my own home! The course is organized so you can go through the guides one at a time not only to learn, but to decorate and arrange elements in your room as you go (starting with what you have and adding new touches over time!). The newest guide is called Seating Places + Spaces–it includes my tips and formulas for arranging furniture, rugs, lamps, and curtains and more so you can make everyone feel comfortable and welcome in your home. Room Recipe Method is designed around what I think decorating should be all about — creating a sanctuary. We’ve released three decorating guides in the Room Recipe course already. You can get started on the course guides right now in HomeBody Gathering Place (they are not currently sold separately). Every week we also offer additional teaching, inspiration, behind the scenes and encouragement in what we call our Home Therapy sessions, so there is always fun new content and simple, practical ideas you can use to transform your home.
