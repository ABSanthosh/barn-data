My Sunday post where I share the random stuff that captured my attention or inspired me that I found online. photo: Cottage Living The past week has been good and not so good. The good news is that the fall temps and sunshine have made for one very beautiful weather week. The leaves haven’t changed here yet, but they will soon. The other good news is that the roof on the house that was damaged when a tree went through it, will be start to be replaced this Thursday. We were told it would take two days. One way I am trying to stay positive about the destruction is that I got to chose a much lighter color of roofing that will go much better with the lighter color we painted the house a few years ago. I am excited to see how it all comes together. On the not so good news, I have been sick with RSV since Monday! My twin sis got it also. I have been cuddling up all week on one of the comfy recliners in my living room with my favorite throw and laptop propped on a pillow on my lap. I may not have been too productive physically, but I sure got my computer files and email cleaned out which felt good. I feel better, but still have congestion and the dizzies. I will be happy when it is all out of my system. Ed got the RSV vaccine and he hasn’t gotten it. I didn’t get the vaccine, but will most likely get it in the future to avoid feeling like I have the past week ever again. Now onto all the links I found while snuggling with my laptop and a box of tissues all week long. :-) Posts You May Have Missed This Week: The Cozy at HomeDecorating challenge.
