  "text": "Electroluminescent DSKY moonwatch by apollo instrumentsApollo Instruments introduces DSKY Moonwatch, a timepiece design that recreates the original computer interfaces used by astronauts during the space mission. The wristwatch is divided into three parts. The small screen on the right is the display for the time, date, timezone, stopwatch, alarm, and GPS navigation in a seven-segment display font and electroluminescent lighting. The screen beside it reproduces several of the operational routines and guidance computer interface, presenting them in their original display. Below these two, there’s a keypad that makes Apollo Instruments’ DSKY Moonwatch a wearable computer. It supports multiple programming platforms since the core software of the timepiece is programmable. Design-wise, the design team uses CNC micro-machined stainless steel for the case with a military-grade ceramic coating. They opt for full-grain, Italian Nappa leather hybrid straps as well as hand-finished, stainless steel deployment clasps.all images courtesy of Apollo Instrumentsoriginal verb and noun computer interface sequences on viewThe Apollo Instruments Moonwatch team, led by founder Mark Clayton, says that the DSKY served as the primary computer interface between the astronauts and the spacecraft’s guidance, navigation, and control computer. The system allowed the astronauts to input commands, receive real-time flight data, and monitor the spacecraft’s systems. In return, they could navigate and control the spacecraft during their missions. Fascinated by this and many space explorations, Mark Clayton and his team and Apollo Instruments set out to recreate this exact computer interface by turning it into DSKY Moonwatch. The functional wristwatch with a seven-segment display font even bears the original operation requests astronauts entered. They appear as the original verb and noun sequences on the left-side screen of the timepiece. The coloration of this display lights up with the help of Rosco, an Academy Award-winning supplier of color filters to the motion picture industry. Apollo Instruments introduces DSKY Moonwatchmicro-USB port installed to program the timepieceFor the micro-OLED display on Apollo Instruments’ DSKY Moonwatch, the digital display replicates the high-contact image of the electroluminescent display on the original Apollo DSKY. Both these screens are also sealed with anti-reflective, scratch-resistant Schott glass panels. For the keypad, there are 19 tactile buttons on board the timepiece, faithfully recreated using the original Gorton font. Aside from displaying the time and date, to name a few, Apollo Instruments’ DSKY Moonwatch can also display data in different formats. One of them is projecting how parameters were presented to the astronauts during the space mission. Multiple custom formats are also available, so the users can toy around with them. To program and charge DSKY Moonwatch, Apollo Instruments installs a micro-USB port on the rear of the device. There’s also an I/O port that offers ISP support for bootloader programming and 8 programmable digital I/O channels. The wristwatch is available for pre-orders, with the delivery period starting in the first quarter of 2025.the timepiece design recreates the original computer interfaces used by astronauts during the space missionthe electroluminescent screen displays the time, date, timezone, stopwatch, alarm, and GPS navigationthere’s a keypad for programming, making the timepiece a wearable computerthe design team uses CNC micro-machined stainless steel for the case with a military-grade ceramic coating",
