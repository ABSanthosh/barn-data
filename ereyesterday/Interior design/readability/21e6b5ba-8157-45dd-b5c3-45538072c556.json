  "text": "Apple liquid glass UI makes the button see-throughDuring the WWDC25, Apple introduces the Liquid Glass UI for iOS 26, a software redesign that makes the apps, buttons, and toolbars see-through. Planned for a September 2025 release, the redesign also celebrates iPhone’s 20th anniversary, even if it’s in 2027. The look is present in iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS, and CarPlay to make all the Apple devices uniform. Even Safari and Camera apps will be transparent. Reports say that the brand plans to demonstrate the Liquid Glass UI during the WWDC25 at Apple Park HQ in Cupertino, California, on June 9th, 2025.So far, the Apple Liquid Glass UI uses clear toolbars, and the controls look shiny. The apps and buttons have a ‘glassy’ look as if they were made from polished glass. The home screen icons have round edges too with a semi-translucent background. In the snippet that the company released, the icons may only have spurts of vibrant colors, unlike the other iOS updates. This means only parts of the icons have rainbow-esque shades, from yellow to pink, and the rest of the design is minimal and ‘see-through.’all images courtesy of AppleA change from the last iOS7 update in 2013The Apple Liquid Glass UI is a significant visual change for the brand. The last time they redesigned their software and look was in 2013 with iOS 7. Here, they went from using real-life design to ‘flat’ designs with bright colors. The upcoming UI, then, is a change, but an expected one, given that the brand aims for ‘clarity’ in its designs. The Apple Liquid Glass UI shares the style of the VisionOS. The buttons and toolbars move like liquid or as if they were floating, and the elements can change their size and adapt to the surroundings and backgrounds. It’s not just blurring or making the background transparent, as the glass elements take on colors from the interface. These floating icons then have the same shading or palette as the wallpaper or backdrop since they’re see-through. The theme of glass in the UI isn’t new to the brand, either. Apple has already filed patents dating back to 2014 on all-glass iPhones, Apple Watches, and even Macs. So far, there are no updates yet on the rollout of the Apple Liquid Glass UI. This is a developing story. designboom expects to update the story in time for the brand’s announcements.during the WWDC25, Apple introduces the Liquid Glass UI for iOS 26the apps and buttons ‘float’ over the backdropthe transparency allows the new background to mimic the surroundings of the buttons and controlsthe update is present across all Apple devicesdetailed view of the interfacethe software redesign makes the apps, buttons, and toolbars see-through with partial coloring",
