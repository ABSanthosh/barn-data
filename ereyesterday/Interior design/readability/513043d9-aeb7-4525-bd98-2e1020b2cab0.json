  "text": "Swedish designer Gustaf Westman displayed existing and new objects including a colourful \"puzzle\" shelf during a three-day pop-up event in New York City. Named Gustaf Westman in New York, the show was located in an industrial storefront in Williamsburg and displayed the designer's colourful objects and furniture on a meandering pink and orange pathway. Swedish designer Gustaf Westman held a New York City pop-up that gave nod to a museum experienceSmall descriptions were placed on the ground in front of the objects, as \"a nod to a museum experience\", while printed pamphlets similar to museum guides were available to visitors. \"The decision was very organic,\" Westman told Dezeen. \"When we came here, it was like a gallery space. It's also a bit ironic, because I've only been doing this for four years and I'm not really ready to do a museum.\" A brightly coloured pathway weaved through the space, which was divided by Westman's screens and a larger display wall towards the front. Among the new objects displayed was Puzzle Shelf, a shelving unit made of interlocking, stackable rectangular forms that conclude in puzzle-shaped feet. Westman noted that the shelf is 3D-printed and processed to resemble the material qualities of his other ceramic and metal objects. \"I have an obsession with trying to test all different materials and trying to make them look the same,\" said Westman. \"Even if I work with wood or ceramics or glass, I want to keep the same finish, so [3D printing] is the next step.\" The shelf was made in a host of bright colours such as red, pink, cream, and dark blue. Existing and new objects from the designer were displayedThe remaining space was filled with pedestals and shelving outfitted with existing glassware and objects such as a spiralling book stand and flower-shaped mirrors, along with furniture such as a coffee table that pinches wine glasses in place. The designer previously used nylon tights to create \"terrazzo-like\" tables and displayed his objects during Day Two from Stockholm Design Week 2024. The photography is by Kate Fatseas unless otherwise stated Gustaf Westman in New York was on show at 25 Fillmore Place, Brooklyn from 10-13 October.
