  "description": "This White Marble Bookmark is by British designer Paul Cocksedge. It pushes the boundaries, to say the least; the thing is 30cm × 22cm × 90cm (11.8\" × 8.7\" × 35.4\"), and not easy to move at 110 kg (242.5 lbs). \"The Bookmark splits the room and I enjoy the fact that it elevates the book. It becomes a focal point. Books tend to be hidden on shelves where you can't really appreciate them. I added this curve at the bottom so it gently rocks and it's counter-intuitive to what a heavy piece of marvel should really do but it's quite playful.\" \"The Marble Bookmark is everything a bookmark is not: heavy to lift, difficult to carry, and bigger than the book itself. The work alters the power balance between page keeper and book, tethering it to its place on lamp can create long or wide shapes, and be adapted to fit into various interior spaces.\" If you're into the concept but can't spare the floor space, Cocksedge also offers a tabletop model. This smaller version is \"just\" 22cm × 10cm × 24.5cm (8.7\" × 3.9\" × 9.6\"), and weighs 13 kg (28.7 lbs).Unsurprisingly, these will not see mass production; Cocksedge is only making 20 of each.",
