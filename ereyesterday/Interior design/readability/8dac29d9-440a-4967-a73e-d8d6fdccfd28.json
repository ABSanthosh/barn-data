The transformation of this unique and tiny space, once an area designed to house horses, offers a glimpse into how thoughtful design can blend historic charm with contemporary living. This quaint space, now a short-term rental, turns the old into something new, combining minimalism with subtle yet sophisticated design. Photo: Denys Vinson The building has a storied past. Originally a stable, it had long been converted into residential housing, but time had left its mark. The interior, which originally covered just 172 square feet, was in need of a complete overhaul. The absence of a mezzanine left the space feeling cramped, and humidity issues had compromised the structure. During demolition, the team discovered remnants of the building’s equine origins, including old horse irons buried in the ground. The structure’s rich history provided both a challenge and an opportunity to create a design that would honor the past while embracing the future. Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson The design team’s primary objective was to make the space functional and comfortable for modern living while maintaining its original charm. The attic, once used for storing hay, was converted into a mezzanine – taking full advantage of the high ceilings that reached nearly 20 feet at the rear of the structure. This clever use of space provides a dedicated “night” area, making the compact home feel much larger than it is. Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson The design choices focus on fluidity and warmth. The use of curves is a key feature, softening the edges of the space and creating a welcoming, organic flow between rooms. Each element was carefully considered to reflect a minimalist aesthetic while incorporating both classic and contemporary design influences. Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson The ground floor is the heart of the apartment, a multifunctional space that serves various needs throughout the day. At its center is a striking curved kitchen island, which serves as a visual anchor in the room. Its design is not just for aesthetics; it is highly practical, housing a sink, washing machine, and dishwasher. The island is surrounded by a custom-designed bench that follows the curves of the walls, offering ample seating for dining, lounging, or even working. Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson The kitchen itself is compact yet fully equipped, located beneath the staircase leading to the mezzanine. A large storage cabinet, designed to blend seamlessly into the room, hides away electrical panels and provides additional space for kitchen essentials. This clever use of space ensures that everything is within arm’s reach without overwhelming the minimalist design. Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson The bathroom is built with perfect symmetry and a keen sense of artful minimalism. A sliding door, hidden within an archway, opens to reveal a beautiful vanity with a high basin that sits as a statement piece in the room. Surrounding the vanity are two equally symmetrical arches: one leads to the shower, while the other frames the toilet. A large mirror stretches across the wall, creating the illusion of space while hiding functional storage behind it. The water heater is discreetly tucked away above the toilet, ensuring that the bathroom remains uncluttered and serene. Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson Photo: Denys Vinson Upstairs, the mezzanine serves as the home’s intimate sleep area, where the design focuses on comfort and functionality. The bed, elevated to accommodate the roof’s structural elements, sits in the center of the room. Below, ample storage space has been ingeniously incorporated, making the most of every inch of available space. The shallow dressing area is enhanced with mirrored moldings, creating the illusion of depth and space, while a small niche with a green marble shelf adds a touch of luxury. Photo: Denys Vinson The floor is covered in a woven carpet that runs up the stairs, leading to a cozy sleeping area. To further enhance the sense of light and openness, small windows were introduced along the mezzanine walls. These not only invite natural light into the space but also frame views of the ground floor below.
