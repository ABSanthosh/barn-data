Since I’m on a roll finding a place for everything in my house, hiding power strips has been at the top of my list. I wanted a solution that would not only hide cords but also look attractive in the room—and I found the perfect tools for the job! I got two different styles of these cable management baskets. The first one I ordered (THIS ONE) is made of imitation rattan. While it’s not my favorite finish, it looks great at a distance and does the job of concealing cords and a power strip. Since I really liked how functional this basket is I ordered a different set for other spaces in the house (like our kitchen and Snug). These other cable management baskets (below) just arrived and came in a set of two sizes, and the finish is natural and lovely in our home! I would buy these again (and probably will!). Cable management baskets These baskets are an attractive and practical way to hide cords and power strips to keep everything looking neat. You can also tuck in a couple of extra phone chargers to keep them organized or have on hand for guests! The basket is naturally ventilated, so it prevents overheating of power strips and chargers. You don’t want to put power strips in closed in or tight spaces without ventilation or overload them (we never plug in heaters or anything powerful like that on a power strip just to be safe). We will use our new baskets for charging phones (which we can set on top of the basket with the cord coming out one side), hiding a lamp cord on the kitchen counter. Be sure to measure whatever power strip you want to use (I got these surge protectors for our new baskets) to make sure it will fit. These power strip baskets are so handy for hiding a power strip and corralling all your cords in one neat place, I’m so glad I found them. Here’s to simple, pretty solutions for a more peaceful home!
