  "text": "Everyday Carry (EDC) enthusiasts are often drawn to extremes—gear that’s either hyper-functional and minimalist or unapologetically rugged and overbuilt. Somewhere between those poles, there’s a sweet spot where design meets practicality, where tools feel like natural extensions of the user rather than cumbersome additions. WESN’s Ridgeback Microblade plants itself firmly in that middle ground, a knife that doesn’t scream for attention but quietly earns it through thoughtful details and rock-solid construction. It’s small enough to live unnoticed in a pocket, yet capable enough to stand out when you put it to work. But here’s the thing: knives this compact often fall into one of two camps—purely utilitarian or borderline decorative. The Ridgeback, however, avoids that trap. It balances an aesthetic rooted in the wilderness with materials and build quality that cater to actual, everyday use. It’s a knife for people who appreciate subtle craftsmanship and know that sometimes the smallest tools are the ones you reach for the most. The Ridgeback isn’t just a product—it’s a reflection of WESN’s ability to build gear that feels like it belongs, no matter where life takes you. Designer: WESN Crafted with materials that reflect its dual nature, the knife pairs a gorgeous hammered titanium front handle with a smooth titanium back scale. This combination represents both the raw textures of the outdoors and the polished surfaces of urban life, creating a visual dichotomy that you can’t stop admiring. At 3.75 inches open and just 2.25 inches closed, its compact design invites you to carry it anywhere without hesitation. A yellow thumb stud and matching lanyard bead punctuate the muted titanium tones, a detail that feels as intentional as it is functional, ensuring the knife remains visible in dim environments. Despite its size, the Ridgeback packs serious cutting power. The 1.5-inch blade is forged from M390 steel, a high-end material prized for its durability and edge retention. This steel can stand up to demanding use, whether you’re tackling minor outdoor tasks or mundane chores like opening stubborn packages. The precision machining is matched by a frame-lock mechanism, a feature that ensures the blade stays securely in place during use. Unlike many microblades, the Ridgeback prioritizes grip and handling. Its ergonomic shape feels surprisingly comfortable, and the textured front surface adds security, even when conditions get slippery. That index finger cutout firmly wraps around your finger, ensuring the blade doesn’t ever slip out of your grasp. At just 500 units, WESN intends to make the Ridgeback feel as exclusive as it looks. One could argue that forging a hammered titanium handle is a major task in itself, but it’s WESN we’re talking about. The limited-edition run isn’t a feasibility decision, it’s purely because this knife is a work of art, not a commercial EDC tool for the masses. For collectors, the knife offers a rare opportunity to own something unique, while EDC enthusiasts will appreciate the meticulous craftsmanship and premium feel. At $150, the Ridgeback Microblade sits firmly in the premium category, although for an all-metal knife with a titanium handle, it’s well worth the price. Available through WESN’s website, it’s a knife that will likely disappear quickly from shelves, especially given its appeal to both collectors and those seeking a distinctive yet practical EDC blade. A good knife doesn’t need to announce itself, and the Ridgeback exemplifies this philosophy. Compact, reliable, and beautifully designed, it’s a piece that feels as at home slicing through an apple as it does in a display case. But with only 500 out there, you might want to act before this small wonder is out of reach.",
