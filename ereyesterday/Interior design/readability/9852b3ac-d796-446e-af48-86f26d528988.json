But in fact it was designed as a virtual boxing trainer. You can hit the bag—as hard as you want, the company says, without fear of damaging it—while the projected coach runs you through drills and offers pointers. Built-in sensors track your body's movements, allowing the AI coach to offer real-time feedback. It can also be using for other forms of exercise, and even gaming. Here's how it works:Here's a less polished demo where a personal trainer shows you how she uses it:The Growl, which is going for $2,450 on Kickstarter, has been a smash hit; at press time they had over $375K in pledges, with 23 days left to pledge. They'll say they'll ship in February of next year—and point out that, bucking the trend, there's no subscription required.",
