  "text": "This modern classic apartment—designed by Yevheniia Dubrovska—is for the art collectors at heart. It sets an understated base with neutral colors, but interestingly tops these with decor. We see influences of the Scandinavian style, too, strategically adding warmth (especially the wooden accents!). Simultaneously, large, accent pieces of art bring the space to life. Let’s walk through to look at the details. A gray modular tufted sectional forms the centerpiece of the living room. The Persian-style area rug below perfectly adds the traditional touch. Simultaneously, the sleek floor lamp provides illumination—while the funky art pieces add visual interest. Not to forget the wall moldings on the ceiling, subtly adding the French country style. The kitchen weds minimalist white with wood forms and some stunning marble! A massive white pendant light takes center stage, illuminating the stunning marble top island. Instant luxury is added through the black bar stools. We especially love the entryway into the kitchen: a beautiful oakwood bookshelf. The wall-to-wall oak paneling adds the traditional style to this interior. Interestingly, this is wooden cabinetry doubling as a divider! The oversized Persian-style rug sets an artistic base. Finally, the retractable wall-mounted lamp and sculptural floor lamp by the bedside light up the room. The bathroom features a black and wooden wall-mounted vanity. This is paired with a round mirror, which adds a sense of movement to the space. The shower area features lighter-toned tiles with black hardware. And the freestanding bathtub adds the perfect spa-like feel! This Scandinavian bedroom features a simple bed with a gray headboard. The nightstand is mounted onto the headboard, saving space. We love how the nook between the cabinetry is utilized and formed into a workstation. Working with those outdoor views? The best! The attached bathroom is as space-savvy as it gets. Even in the compact space, we see a shower cubicle, wall-mounted toilet, and vanity. The hidden storage in the bathroom gives you room to store toilet paper rolls—plenty of them.",
