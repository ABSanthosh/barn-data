  "text": "It isn’t often that a company’s logo translates well to actual hardware. Like the Ferrari logo is niche, and doesn’t apply to actual products, but the Mercedes-Benz logo, which could easily be a keyring, a steering wheel, or rims. Another example is the Batarang, which, out of either sheer coincidence or great branding, looks exactly like Batman’s logo. That being said, I wouldn’t necessarily call the Twitch logo a great example of what I just explained, but designer Andrea Dalle Fabbriche turned the iconic blurb that streamers know too well into a macro pad that handles every aspect of streaming. The product looks exactly like the Twitch logo, which feels less like hardware and more like functional memorabilia at this point. 8 keys and 3 sliders handle all your streaming needs, from emoting to muting-unmuting, starting/stopping a stream, and adjusting mic levels. The keys are mechanical, and adjustable too, which means aside from reprogramming layouts, you can swap keycaps too, creating a Twitch hardware device that uniquely suits your needs. Designer: Andrea Dalle Fabbriche The design prioritizes simplicity: a 3×2 grid, tactile feedback from linear or tactile switch options (likely in the MX family), and a vertical slider on the left that adjusts volume or mic gain control. It’s unbranded, deliberately stripped of logos aside from the silhouette itself, because the shape is the brand. Why is it genius? Because it emotionally binds the streamer to the service. Nobody’s going to use a Twitch macropad streaming on Discord or YouTube. Why would they? It looks weird, and contrarian. The clicky keys have that satisfying tactile feel that mechanical fans love, and there’s a vertical slider tucked into the left side of the pad – probably for mic gain or stream volume. What makes the design smarter than it looks is its layout. The grid is intuitive. No wasted space. Because it’s modular, every key is a blank canvas. Swap the caps. Reassign the functions. If you’re used to muscle-mapping macros on your keyboard or stacking hotkeys in software, this thing simplifies that whole mental load. You could set it up to control OBS, Discord, lighting, music, anything that accepts keyboard input. Even though it’s a concept, the product feels grounded in actual pain points. Streamers don’t need flashy RGB bricks with 32 touchscreens, they need something quick, responsive, and dead easy to read mid-stream. This pad leans into that need with a style that doesn’t overpower its function. If it ever sees production and lands under $100 with decent mapping software, it’ll punch far above its size.",
