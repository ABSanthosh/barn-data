    "description": "Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi has branched out from making smartphones into home appliances and even EVs. The company clearly has no problem thinking outside of the box. Which explains this Top Air Vent Pro, their alternative take on the air conditioner:The first thing that will be strange to Western consumers is that, unlike a window air conditioner or a mini-split, it does not draw air from outside the dwelling. It actually sucks it in from the bottom. It's intended to be mounted near the ceiling, and blows cool air along it. Because cold air sinks, the thinking is that this cools the entire room off effectively, without the inhabitants feeling a draft. (Cultural note: In China, it's popularly believed that drafts, particularly on one's neck, makes people sick.)When the seasons change and it's time for heat, the unit's deflector blasts hot air straight down along the wall. The idea is that the heat would then travel along the floor and dissipate upwards. I'd want to read some user reviews to see how well this arrangement works, but the unit is Asian-market-only.",

    "description": "Neutral density (ND) filters are used by photographers to stop down the amount of light entering the camera lens. The filter is actually two layers that are polarized; rotate the outermost one, and the admitted light is reduced or increased.A startup called Lombell figured it would be a good idea to put this arrangement into a pair of sunglasses:While I can appreciate that this must've sounded like a cool idea, wouldn't the UX suffer, since each lens needs to be adjusted independently? I've never tried these, but unless your eye can easily detect between F-stops, I'd guess you have to take the glasses off as you dialed them to ensure symmetry. If this is you, these are $90.",

    "description": "How to make the cutest and (fluffiest!) yarn wrapped Christmas tree decor.  This is one of my easiest holiday DIYs yet! These Styrofoam yarn trees can be changed up with any material you'd like to use.  I wanted some new holiday decor for our basement but didn't want to spend a ton of money -- I came up with this idea and they turned out better than I imagined. At first I was going to use basic yarn on Styrofoam cones, but wanted a fluffier look.  Enter this finger knit yarn I've had forever -- for the blanket I still haven't made yet, ha!:  It is SO so soft and fluffy and I had an idea -- I wondered how it would work wound around the cones instead of regular yarn. Well, I'll tell you...it worked ADORABLE. 😁 This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   These DIY yarn Christmas trees are quick to make with just a few easy steps. I started with basic craft foam forms:  I got my soft looped yarn and foam cones from Michael's.  And used my hot glue gun to attach the yard at the bottom of the cone first:  I started the first line of yarn about an inch from the bottom because this yarn drapes so much.  I went up about 3/4 inch to an inch each pass around the cone:  Just do a bead of hot glue and then lightly press the top portion of the yarn along the glue.  I just kept wrapping...this was a great mindless craft to do while watching TV. They go together fast:  When I got to the top of the very top of the cone, I cut just enough excess yarn and then wrapped it up on the very tip with hot glue. This finger knit looped stuff is very forgiving! I did three different sizes -- one was about six inches, one was 11 inches and the final was about 17 inches but I cut those two down a bit: I used one skein of yarn for all the trees and had a bit leftover. It's like a snowy, fluffy forest! :) I think they are the cutest. You don't even have to do anything to cover the white foam -- it disappears behind the yarn:  I giggled every time I finished one. They are adorable and SO easy and inexpensive! The foam products are often on sale, or you can use a coupon at one of the craft stores. I added some of the fairy lights I showed you here for a bit of twinkle:  You can also have them glow from \"inside\" by running those tiny lights under the yarn around the tree:  You can dress this Christmas tree craft up in so many ways! Add a pop of color by sticking in red beads here and there to look like berries.Use embellishments like these adorable tiny plaid bows, mini pine cones or holly berry leaves throughout the trees. (I may have to add those bows!)This would be a REALLY cute idea for a kid's room in a variety of bright colorful yarns. Stick a small dowel rod into the top with a star or angel glued on for a finishing touch. Pom poms glued all around or attached with pins would be adorable as well! I wanted something simple but fun on this table in our basement and these were perfect!I went super cozy and a bit rustic with the decor down there, so they fit right in:  See more about our Disney prints here! I love our \"snowy\" fluffy trees! I think they may have to go on the mantel next year instead. :)I used the Bernat brand finger knit yarn in cream (here are all the colors they offer!) but the cream seems hard to find right now.  You can pin this craft for later using this image:  Now I'm off to make a scarf with the remaining yarn I have! ;) If you have extra foam cones laying around when you're done, try my Santa hat cone craft: Check out a bunch of my favorite, easy Christmas crafts here!  See more of our home and shop items in each room here.Never miss a post by signing up to get posts via email.  This content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I love seeing pics of friends and family with their hot coffee and comfy clothes out finding the deals.  WAY back in the day I would wake up early to shop, but those days are long gone! Now it would take an act of God to get me up super early the day after Thanksgiving, ha! If you're like me and prefer to shop from your computer instead of trekking all over, this is for you! This post is so fun to pull together every year -- check out my ten themed gift ideas from last year. I added ** two asterisks ** before each item that is an Amazon Black Friday Deal! Beauty finds Let's start with a bit of beauty, specifically nails! I prefer to do my own -- I used to get gel or dip nails before a vacation or big event, but it's rare that I do that anymore.  I've found a few items that make my nails look great and thought I would share them.  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it.
