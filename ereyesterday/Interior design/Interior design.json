The all-metal machine is still in production:Pinching the butterfly clamp causes the holding mechanism to protrude from the hole. You insert your pencil into it, then release the clamp, and the pencil is held securely for sharpening.If that's not fancy enough for you, the company makes a limited edition version called the Cosmic Blue Sharpening Machine. It's been lacquered in a pearlescent dark blue and features gold accents:It runs a whopping $295. (The original ain't much cheaper, at $195!)",

By being familiar with what contractors do day-in, day out, company founder Dan Raymond spied an opportunity to speed at least two tasks: Nailing roofs on, and nailing button-cap nails to house wrap. He subsequently invented this thing:This Boss Magnetic Cap can be friction-fit over the hammer's head. A magnet holds the nail in place, allowing you to drive it with one hand while the other holds more nails for re-loading:While it won't hold framing nails, you can simply pop the cap off and do those the old-fashioned way.Runs $13.",

    "description": "You don't need to stain or paint worn out furniture to give it new life! Sometimes you don't want to do ALL the work on old or distressed furniture...sanding and then staining or painting it can take quite a bit of time and effort.  If you have an old piece of furniture that needs some love, these tips will refresh your piece with way less work!  First, the reason for this makeover. For years now, we've had the Everett table in our entryway:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I shared all the ways I've decorated that World Market table over the years -- the open design and two surfaces can be challenging to style without looking too busy.  This table is great for a foyer or behind a sofa -- it's loooong and skinny, so doesn't take up valuable walking space:  I added the cute labeled drawer pulls to the front when I bought it. It's a nice little custom detail.  I've always loved this table, but for the past year or two I've been wanting to transition some of the farmhouse-style pieces we have in the house. I never went all in on the farmhouse style, but I definitely dabbled in it! :) For a few weeks I searched Facebook Marketplace for a dresser or credenza that would work in this spot, but I didn't find the perfect piece.  I was sitting and thinking one day (as one does), and started considering the dressers we already have in the house. That's when I realized the vintage dresser in our son's room would be perfect!: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to keep your houseplants from dying. One of my most commonly asked questions is about our plants! It never fails that I'll get messages or emails about plant care when I share a room that has one in it. Today I'm sharing the biggest mistake I find so many are making when it comes to their house plants. I love having plants around the house -- they truly add \"life\" to our rooms and are the perfect way to fill awkward spaces.  Over the years of honing my plant growing craft, I've figured out the one big thing that keeps our fiddles leaf trees and other house plants thriving:  And it's probably not what you think!  Sunlight is important of course...that varies quite a bit depending on the type of plant.  Fiddles love sunlight! I've found over the years that they don't love direct light, ours (actually all of our plants) tend to do better with indirect light: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I find fertilizing isn't necessary in most instances -- I don't do it a lot. Maybe once a year? In general ours do better in the summer months and go dormant in the cloudy, winter months with shorter days. I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!:That plant behind the sofa is fake!

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
