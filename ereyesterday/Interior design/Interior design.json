So let‚Äôs dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we‚Äôre buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The ‚ÄúUnder $12.99‚Äù list isn‚Äôt the only one with items priced that low ‚Äì for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

    "description": "In November of 2020, we published a post called ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs It Like To Downsize‚Äù after living in our smaller home for 6 months. We covered a range of experiences ‚Äì like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months‚Ä¶ and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let‚Äôs get into it. I won‚Äôt recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.

    "description": "Sure, our food supply has been poisoned by large corporations, and we're hooked on sugary drinks that make us sick. Can design help? Maybe‚Äîor we can just stay in our lane and design more stuff for you to buy! Shiny shiny! Here are the food, drink and kitchen-related designs that jumped out at us in 2024.M√∂bino, by Metaform Architects, is a beautiful espresso cup made by combining digital fabrication with handwork. When bad UX is the point: This no-handle coffee mug, by British design collective Ma3t, was designed for rock climbers. NASA's zero-gravity drinking cup was prototyped in space. A fine example of form follows function: These stange glasses for K√∂lsch beer. A vice-friendly design classic: Joe Colombo's Smoke Glasses. Another industrial design classic is Spanish industrial designer Rafael Marquina's no-drip oil cruet. Italian industrial designer Corrado Dotti designed these elegant, double-walled Cilindro oil cruets, which appear to float. This stunning, minimalist glass bottle is by RISD grad Peter Ivy. Old-school package design: Japanese bamboo spice vessels. These V√∂k serving trays, by industrial designer D√∂gg Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir, were inspired by the Icelandic environment. An eye-catching design detail: The knurled Buster + Punch handles on this Staub cookware. Cloche, by industrial designer Guillaume Bloget, is a low-tech, designey food smoker. Also low-tech and involving flame is this Bola Grill Master, a design for a barbecue grill with height-adjustable cooking surfaces. The Tibetus Technical Bridge-Console, by Italian brand Snaidero, is an overhead rail system for kitchen islands. If you're obsessive about your toast, perhaps Mitsubishi Electric's sealed, insulated $270-$500 single-slice toaster is for you. There are a lot of surprisingly innovative design features in this 1963 GE refrigerator.From Japan, this Mirable Kitchen is faucet can clean dirty dishes without soap, using micro-bubbles. From China, Boelon's hi-tech \"luxury\" kitchen sink has some crazy features.In the UK, Costa Coffee has rolled out an autonomous, small-footprint 24-hour coffee shop in kiosk form. Back in America, SeaWorld has been selling burgers where the cheese comes in syringes. (Next step is we inject it directly into our bodies.) A collaboration between Serve Robotics and Wing Aviation combines robots with drones for food delivery.UK Supermarket chain Tesco's laser-etched avocados save on packaging waste. Always wanted to disaster prep, don't know where to start? Costco sells these 150-serving emergency meal buckets. Lastly, Unnecessary Design Studio has created this object to harvest burrito waste for taco fillings.",

    "description": "Each year, over 100 million bicycles are produced worldwide, versus 94 million automobiles. The modern buyer includes urban residents seeking environmentally-friendly transport and exercise, as well as those in developing nations seeking a reliable and affordable means of transport. Bike ownership surged during the pandemic‚Äîsome estimates have it at 25% growth in 2020 alone‚Äîand sales will only grow. So it's not surprising that we saw a ton of bike-related designs this year.We'll start off with the precursor to the bicycle: The running machine, a/k/a the Draisine, developed by German inventor Karl Drais in 1816. Drais could never imagined that in 208 years, his invention would yield descendants like these:This low-maintenance, corrosion-proof RCYL Bike. Some 90% of the bike is made out of plastic. Taiwanese manufacturer BESV's stylish PSF1, a folding e-bike. The Owlet, a radical¬†new form for the e-bike. Bleeding into motorcycle territory is this electric, off-road 2x2 Ultra Bike by Russia's Robo Systems. As e-bikes proliferate, so too do e-bike accidents. In a drive to increase safety, Dutch police have begun using this roadside e-bike speed testing contraption. E-bikes need to be charged, of course. Industrial Design student Matthew Quejada designed this Ultium Lift, an e-bike charging station for garages. Another type of bike Drais probably couldn't have foreseen is the cargo bike. German company Dynamic Drives has completely re-thought the cargo bike form factor with their Intelectra pedelec. Meanwhile in London, manufacturer Cityshuttle has mashed up the electric cargo bike with a tractor-trailer to create their ePack.For those who don't need a full cargo bike, from Germany comes this Allpacka One, a collapsible cargo box for bikes.Engineer Robert G. Ozarski invented the Kradl, an electricity-free, spring-loaded bike hoist that makes it easier to store.Industrial designer Adrien Rovero designed this cheeky bike rack as a clear statement. Swiss company V-Locker designed these space-efficient, paternoster-like bike storage lockers. Also in Switzerland, industrial design firm Erfindergeist created this transforming train seating for bike storage.Bike helmets, too, are increasingly receiving design attention. The Ventete aH-1 is an inflatable, collapsible design.Industrial designers Masaru Kiyota and Sawyer Hagen designed the Oshel, a lockable bike helmet. Another industrial designer, Ash Lewin, has realized his dream for the fastest bike helmet ever. And finally, for you mountain bikers: The RinseKit Tailgate Shower¬†makes it easy to hose your bike off after a muddy ride.",
