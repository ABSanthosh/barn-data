    "description": "Today Adidas releases their 3D-printed Climacool Laced sneakers. Last year they released a similar shoe that was a slip-on, but this time they've gone with eyelets. The polymer kicks are printed as one piece, except for the laces and the conventional mesh tongue, which are both added afterwards. (The tongue is presumably bonded to the inside of the shoe, rathern than sewn; the company doesn't say.) \"Inspired by the sensation of transformative structures, these shoes adjust and conform to your environment. With a lightweight, multidimensional lattice configuration, they're built for airflow and movement. A foot-hugging design provides a 360 degree airflow for all-day comfort. CLIMACOOL wicks and disperses sweat for cool, dry and distraction-free performance.\" The novel production method doesn't bring any time savings: The company says that between the \"spinning, baking, and compression\" required for the polymer blend—the specifics of which have not been revealed—each pair takes 24 hours to produce. The shoes are only available in one colorway, the one you see in the photos. They run $160.",

    "description": "How to build a wood burning stone fire pit on top of a concrete patio. There are a few safety issues to consider when building a DIY fire pit on a concrete surface. I'm sharing the how-to here!Years ago we had a large patio poured in our back yard. The best part was a 14 foot circular fire pit area we designed off to one side. I shared how this part of the patio looked the day of installation:  One big project I had to hold off on was the DIY fire pit. The concrete contractors advised we wait a bit because the stone for the pit is so heavy. The patio had to cure for a couple of weeks.  Before I started, we got a quote for a small stone retaining wall around the circular fire pit area as well as a fire pit with stone that matched our house. The quote came back at almost DOUBLE what the entire PATIO cost. Lordt.  Soooo we decided to do it ourselves with a kit and it was crazy easy. It doesn't look custom, but it does the job...burns wood. ;) Here's the kit we got from Menards:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Our favorite handy finds for around the house, all $10 or under!It's that time of year! This time the Amazon Prime sale goes for four days -- running from the 8th through the 11th of this week. I know there are a bunch of great deals on more expensive finds, but I prefer to share affordable items we actually use and love. Last year I shared my top favorites under $30, and the year before some of my best finds under $25. This year I went even lower and put a list together of handy home items, all for $10 and under! I wasn't meaning to gather things that I find particularly helpful, but it turned out that way. :) We use every item on this list of useful products, and all are super affordable, even without prime day discounts.This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I know, I know...Christmas is a long way off! But I use these discounts to shop early and I'm always so thankful I did! It's so nice to have items crossed off your list before you even start. This new Amazon prime membership for ages 18-24 would make a great graduation or start of college gift! It's half the cost of regular memberships. Now the fun stuff! First up, these handy touch up paint pens! These are fantastic and make it so easy to touch up scuff marks and small drywall fixes:They come with four in the set and are easy to fill up. You push the button at the bottom of the pen to push the paint up into the brush. So handy! I keep them in our junk drawer for easy access. I got this one for myself last Christmas -- this puzzle \"scoop\" is also a magnifier and has a handy click on light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Artist Jai Vasicek and filmmaker Matt Sharp spent several fast-paced years globetrotting before COVID forced them to put down roots. The couple needed a new outlet for their creative energy, so they purchased a weatherboard house near Byron Bay, ripe for renovation.

With just one bedroom (down from five), it’s an unorthodox home that’s expansive, ‘barefoot’ and perfectly suited to Jai and Matt’s life and work.",

And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.
