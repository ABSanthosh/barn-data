    "description": "Here's an example of a company creatively adapting their product for a new market. NYC-based Garrison Flood Control Systems creates flood barriers that keep water out. By turning them around, they can keep water in. Perhaps the company noticed that in Europe, burning EVs are submerged in dumpsters filled with water to prevent reignition. However, that requires transporting both a dumpster and a crane to the site of the fire.Garrison has an easier solution. Their existing Mayim system of modular flood barriers consists of stackable, compact panels. They've thus adapted them into this Mayim EV Firefighting Pool Kit. These are much easier to haul to the scene, and can even be stored on a fire engine. Firefighters can build the walls right around the burning vehicle, then fill the newly-created-pool with water. \"A full sized deployment would take 3-4 firefighters 15-20 minutes,\" the company writes. Pretty darn smart!",

    "description": "Firefighter Ryan Twombley's TTRC invention is a safer way for first responders to fight EV fires. However, EVs have an unpleasant trick: Once the fire is extinguished, it can spontaneously re-ignite—days, weeks, and even months later. A study in Australia found one extinguished EV \"reignited 68 days after the initial incident.\"In European countries like Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, and neighboring Norway and Sweden, fire departments aren't taking any chances. An increasingly popular approach there is to haul both a crane and a dumpster to the site of a burning EV. Once the fire is extinguished, the vehicle is craned into the dumpster, which is then topped off with water. Being fully submerged guarantees that all batteries in the array are cooled simultaneously, reducing the change of reignition. The vehicles are left in the drink for up to 24 hours, then taken to special facilities where they can be safely dismantled and scrapped. The water in the dumpster is then treated as hazardous waste.It's a smart idea. Worldwide, there have been cases of extinguished EVs reigniting as they're being towed away from the accident scene. This means the tow trucks themselves sustain damage. That's led some tow truck drivers to, quite understandably, refuse to haul burnt EVs away. To solve that problem, a British company called EV Cool Tubs provides transportation for damaged EVs in their dedicated dumpsters. They also pitch the containers to \"vehicle storage/body-shop repair compounds, and vehicle assembly plants to store compromised EV battery packs,\" they write. \"They can also be used to store e-bikes and e-scooters that are presently becoming a serious concern nationally for the vehicle recovery industry. These watertight tubs can be flooded by the Fire \u0026 Rescue Service in emergency situations.\"No such solution is yet widespread in the U.S. At a congressional hearing last year Scott Benavidez, Chairman of the Automotive Service Association's Board of Directors, provided the following warning: \"There are numerous instances in which damaged EVs have caught fire and caused damage to the repair facility at which it was being held, as well as other vehicles in its vicinity. Due to these risks, repair shops are now encouraged to allocate space in their facility where they can isolate EVs for safe storage.\" There's a business opportunity there.",

    "description": "How to easily treat wood butcher block counters so they will resist moisture and last forever!Contrary to popular belief, wood countertops are not hard to take care of! If you treat them correctly up front, they will last for decades (even around a sink). One of the top five questions I get about our house (and our old one!) is about our butcher block countertops. We've had wood counters on our islands for around 15 years now. Thanks to my Dad I know the best way to treat them and keep them beautiful for years! I shared how to protect bare wood counters a few years ago, so check out that post to see more detail. I also share how I stained the butcher block in that post. This time I wanted to show you how well they have held up over the past eight years and share how I retreat them every year or so: It's really best to reapply this every six months or so...but as you'll see, it's not absolutely necessary. Ours have held up beautifully even after a year or more.  Overall, the whole island counter has lightened from use, and it was uniform. The only part that was slightly darker was under the tray that I use for hand and dish soap: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Nearly EVERYTHING is easily cleaned off of the wood counters. We've had water condensation sit for hours, water spills, wine, cat vomit 😖 -- all of it. If you treat them well like I'll show you, you won't have any issues keeping them clean.  The only thing that I haven't been able to remove is permanent marker:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build a wood burning stone fire pit on top of a concrete patio. There are a few safety issues to consider when building a DIY fire pit on a concrete surface. I'm sharing the how-to here!Years ago we had a large patio poured in our back yard. The best part was a 14 foot circular fire pit area we designed off to one side. I shared how this part of the patio looked the day of installation:  One big project I had to hold off on was the DIY fire pit. The concrete contractors advised we wait a bit because the stone for the pit is so heavy. The patio had to cure for a couple of weeks.  Before I started, we got a quote for a small stone retaining wall around the circular fire pit area as well as a fire pit with stone that matched our house. The quote came back at almost DOUBLE what the entire PATIO cost. Lordt.  Soooo we decided to do it ourselves with a kit and it was crazy easy. It doesn't look custom, but it does the job...burns wood. ;) Here's the kit we got from Menards:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
