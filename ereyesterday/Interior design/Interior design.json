    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136268/Victor-Manuels-Geometric-Chimera-Style-of-Furniture-Design",
    "description": "Portugese furniture designer Victor Manuel picks up where Postmodernism left off. Manuel refers to his style as \"Geometric Chimera—a bold fusion of furniture that challenges the norms of symmetry and conventional functionality.\" The designer takes the Midcentury Modern aesthetic and mashes it up—largely with itself—to create large pieces that don't always make functional sense, but never fail to draw the eye. \"My work is a synthesis of historical influences that translates into a new, contemporary style that is relevant to the history of design: hybrid design. I do not limit myself to paying homage to the great movements of the past; I seek to reinterpret them, balancing tradition and innovation, and thus offering a new approach to design.\" \"I like to say that being a Designer is more than a profession; it is a true state of mind. This vision is embodied in the hybrid style – an innovative fusion of functionality and art, which positions itself as a new artistic movement in the world of contemporary furniture design, challenging traditional norms and expanding the boundaries of this field.\" \"My goal is to create serene and organized environments. My creations are elegant, [and] meticulous attention to detail and quality construction are hallmarks of each piece, ensuring durability and longevity. They also bring a touch of vintage nostalgia, adding an extra layer of charm and personality to contemporary design.\" \"In a world that often values ??uniformity and the mass production of repetitive forms, I propose an alternative vision: A future of design that celebrates diversity and individuality, the luxury of innovation, a new concept: Geometric Chimera. Hybrid creations are not just furniture, but functional sculptures that challenge established norms and invite users to reimagine the spaces they inhabit. In this context, I redefine what it means to live surrounded by objects, proposing an experience that is simultaneously aesthetic and deeply personal.\" There's plenty more to see here.",

    "description": "For publishers like Barnes \u0026 Noble and Italy's Feltrinelli, things looked horrible in the mid-2000s. The Kindle came out in 2007, making e-books available to the masses. For the next five years, print book sales took a nosedive. Publishers panicked. Independent bookstores went under. To survive, Barnes \u0026 Noble and Feltrinelli began hawking coffee, DVDs, and even toys and vinyl records in their retail outlets.Millennials and Gen-Z to the rescue. To everyone's surprise these generations, though raised on screens, actually preferred the tactility of print books. They also shared their book passions through social media. By 2015, print book sales were climbing out of their sales hole.Then came the pandemic in 2020, and demand for print books exploded. Next BookTok became a phenomenon, further driving demand. Today print book sales dominate e-book sales at a ration of 4:1, with revenue at $64 billion and $13 billion, respectively.Now Feltrinelli, firmly back in the black, is making a book-centric splash at the Salone. The company commissioned British artist/designer Es Devlin to create \"Library of Light,\" a kinetic installation at Milan's Pinacoteca di Brera art museum. Occupying the museum's Cortile d'Onore (the main courtyard), Devlin's installation is a sweeping cylinder of illuminated bookshelves, housing over 3,000 books on themes of \"Thought for Humans\" donated by Feltrinelli. The entire installation rotates, reflecting sunlight during the day and casting light and shadows around the courtyard at night. Visitors are free to browse the books, and every evening at 8pm readings from selected texts are piped into the courtyard, voiced by Devlin and actor Benedict Cumberbatch; for those hard of hearing, the readings are accompanied by an LED display providing closed captions. The tick marks atop the perimeter of the shelving are Devlin's nod to the Umberto Eco quote \"Books are the compass of the mind.\" Said Es Devlin of the project:\"I have always experienced libraries as silently intensely vibrant places where minds and imaginations soar, while clutched like kites by their seated bodies. This kinetic sculpture reflects the synaptic connections being forged, the resonances and associations at play within the minds of a temporary community of readers. As Jorge Luis Borges said, \"I am not sure that I exist, actually. I am all the writers that I have read, all the people that I have met, all that I have loved; all the cities I have visited.\" After the Salone closes, the books will be donated to Milan's library system.",

    "description": "Fresh and flavorful salad recipe with crunchy ramen noodles. I had the most delicious salad last week and immediately asked for the recipe from my friend. It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How I organize our everyday household items throughout the house! I've been on a mission over the past few months to get our house decluttered and organized...for good!  This year I've been determined more than ever to rid our home of unneeded stuff and get all of our random household clutter organized. I don't know what got me so focused on it, but I've been a machine...we've gotten rid of so much and now (almost) everything else is nicely organized.  I feel like I'm finally getting our life in order (at least the stuff part!). We've only lived here seven years. :) I figured I'd share the ways I've organized our everyday household items throughout the house.  Keep a few things in mind as you read this! First up, I'm nearing the big 5-0 and with every year I want less and less things in our home. I thrive and function so much better in a clutter-free home, but even ten years ago that was not the case at all!  Our son recently turned 18 (!!) and will be going off to college in just a few months, so I've had more time over the past few years to tackle these types of projects. (And the days of Nerf bullets and toy clutter are gone, although I still step on the occasional Lego!)  This may sound like I've gotten rid of everything in our house, which is soooo not the case. I love my stuff. :) But what we do have, we use and enjoy AND most everything has a dedicated spot.  1. Take advantage of your closet space  Closets are great of course! But if you don't utilize them well, that storage space won't benefit your home as much as it should!  A few years ago I showed you a main floor closet had been full of random crap. At the time I called it my Monica closet (Friend's sitcom reference) because after we moved in I just chucked stuff in there. I did a quick declutter and it looked so much better!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

So I've been working on it here and there over the past few years.  The real organization started when I found these plastic basketweave storage bins at Big Lots a couple of years ago:  RIP to Big Lots by the way, I'm SO sad about them closing! I loved that place.  They had a taller version (pictured) and a shorter version. I grabbed a bunch of them, mostly in the larger size. I grouped like items in the bins, like tissue boxes, trash and grocery bags, medication and vitamins.  Just random household items we need throughout the day with easy access. Of course I needed a way to label them, so I used my trusty clip on bin labels: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
