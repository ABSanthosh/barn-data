    "description": "Beurer is a German manufacturer of personal care products. When they needed to update their line of men's grooming devices, they turned to Munich-based industrial design firm Fluid Design.Beurer MenCare The ChallengeCrafting the next generation of a MenCare range that seamlessly embodies the Beurer brand DNA. The SolutionBased on the newly developed Beurer Visual Design Language, we created a destinctive MenCare Line that celebrates newly established design elements. A bold design languageWe have injected a dynamic and confident expression of the Beurer design DNA into the MenCare line, giving a fresh and strong resonance to its audience. The MenCare line includes an all-in-one multi-groomer, beard trimmer, hair clipper and a rotary shaver. While each product serves a distinct function and varies in size, they share a common character that underscores their belonging to the same family. All products feature a unified front contour with a consistent 4-degree tapering angle, creating a cohesive appearance. This design includes a recessed surface on the front that serves as a functional space for ergonomic buttons and the display. On the back, the well-defined gripping ribs have been carefully incorporated to ensure a secure hold, even in situations where hands may be wet, such as in the bathroom. Additionally, the prominent red \"Beurer line\" serves as a defining element that also contributes to a distinctive and cohesive aesthetic across all products. ?A strategic partnership?As Beurer's strategic partner, we developed the company's newly defined design language and product design guidelines to ensure a consistent company portfolio. The MenCare Line is an excellent example to represent the new aesthetics of Beurer's design language. Highlights \u0026 CapabilitiesA pivotal design element?The red \"Beurer line\" separates the functional from the user interaction area, supporting intuitive handling and usability while also adding to the overall distinctive aesthetics of the product line. Multidisciplinary, full-service design?Starting with early conceptual sketches, followed by in-depth market research, gathering user insights and developing both, low and high-fidelity mockups, we seamlessly progressed to the final product.

    "description": "When patience pays off! My amazing second hand dining table find.   I shared my new obsession love for Facebook Marketplace (and a few helpful shopping tips) a few months ago. I've discovered so many beautiful and unique finds for our home at a great price! I love this method of shopping because I can browse at my leisure (usually right before bed 😂), or if we're looking for something very specific, it allows me to \"save\" a search for specific keywords and/or set up alerts to notify me of new listings.  There was one big item I'd been looking into for some time. I've looked here and there for years, but more recently the hunt started when I painted this cane buffet table earlier this year:  It turned into a pain of a project, but it was all worth it -- we LOVE the end result. That warm wine color is so lovely!   But as often happens, one little change created an itch to make another one. We've had our dining table for seven years and I loved the wood top:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     A few years ago I refinished it and added a protective Tung oil top coat -- it has held up beautifully and is so low maintenance.  But the more farmhouse style tabletop and metal base were not meshing with the changes I'd made in the room. I've been dreaming up ways I could change out the metal legs, but never moved forward with it because the planked wood top was what really didn't fit in.  Plus, it was starting to drive. us. crazy. that we couldn't push the upholstered chairs at the ends all the way in.  As time passed, I was envisioning a more traditional table in this space. It would be nice to have something larger as well.  The dining room is part of our open concept living area. It was labeled as a \"morning room\" on our plans and is full of windows and natural light.  It's not a traditional, stuffy dining room, but I was craving a little bit of a traditional style in there. Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build a shelf to hide the washer and dryer components.  This easy DIY shelf will hide the ugly washer and dryer components, but also gives you plenty of additional storage for laundry needs.  This is the second time I've added a DIY shelf unit behind our top loader washer and dryer -- I love them!   This shelf project was one of MANY in our mud room/laundry combo makeover. I tackled so many DIYs, from customizing a set of base cabinets to tiling the backsplash and finally adding beautiful floral wallpaper.  This washer and dryer shelf was something I was really missing in our current laundry area. As a reminder, this is what we had when we moved in:  Not bad at all! But the cabinets were hung at a height that were better suited for front loaders -- there was no room underneath to put a shelf, but it was difficult to reach over the washer and dryer and access the cabinets.  **I get a lot of questions about that tray under the washer -- it catches small leaks. It was cracked so we ended up removing it. (I now use a Govee water sensor next to the washer.) Part of my big plan for this space was to move those cabinets over to another wall in here, with drawer cabinets underneath. This was a great decision, it made the flow of the room work so much better.  That created space for the shelf above the washer and dryer. You can see how I built this shelf to hide the ugly stuff behind the washer and dryer at our old house: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

I started by figuring out the middle spot between the two machines. I hung a piece of scrap wood and drilled it into studs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
