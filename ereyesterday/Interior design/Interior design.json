    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/133601/Celebrating-NOOKA-Designing-Time-Book",
    "description": "The work of long-time Core77-fave NOOKA—founded by Matthew Waldman—is the subject of a newly-released book, Designing Time, a lavish and time-travel-y chronicle of the brand's evolution and its efforts to make us rethink how we perceive the formal intersection of time and design. \"The Future Should Not Look Like the Past\" offers a deep dive into NOOKA's journey, from its inception to its impact on the design landscape. Established in the late 1990s, NOOKA was a pioneer in creating timepieces that employed a unique visual language, \"making the concept of time more intuitive and accessible.\" The brand's partnership with Seiko marked the beginning of a new era in watch design, introducing passive intelligent interfaces that enriched the user experience.With ambitions ahead of their time, Waldman's vision was \"to promote a universal language through design that transcends cultural and geopolitical boundaries.\" He created a shorthand for the concept—Mindstyle—which \"merges interface design with lifestyle aspirations, aiming to foster a better future.\"Inside the BookSpanning 200+ pages, Designing Time is an absolute treasure trove for design enthusiasts, and an incredible pleasure to meander through. It features an array of content—including sketches, renders, and photographs—accompanied by inside stories and process images of unrealized projects. (Always some of the most ambitious!) The book not only highlights NOOKA's groundbreaking products (such as the iconic STRIP belt and futuristic sunglasses), but also delves into the brand's cultural impact during the 2000s. Anyone in the design world at that time will be taking a very enjoyable trip down memory lane with this thing.Launched on Kickstarter Japan in 2022, the book quickly reached its funding goal, reflecting the enduring interest in NOOKA's innovative approach. The first print run sold out, and a second edition [Hard cover only] is set to ship in November 2024, so more of us will be able to get ouir hands on one.Find more info here: https://www.nooka.com/nooka-book/",

    "description": "A motorcyclist riding through rainy weather might coat their visor with a water repellent spray. However, they then have to travel fast enough for wind resistance to blow their visor clear. At slower speeds, their visibility remains compromised.This Bikerguard invention, created by two engineers in Slovenia, is a remote-controlled wiper blade for motorcycle helmet visors. You do have to drive two screws through the top of your visor to attach the mounting base, and you can then pop the Bikerguard on and off as needed. A wireless remote control attaches to your bike's handlebars. The POV demonstration does seem convincing:The developers claim that motorcycle police bodies in Slovenia, Hungary and Germany \"are in the process of evaluating BIKERGUARD for potential integration into their motorcycle fleet.\" In the meantime, they sell these online for €319 (USD $339) a pop. A three-pack of replacement wiper blades runs €25 (USD $27). I wouldn't be surprised if, in the future Oakley develops a visor for runners with one of these attached.",

    "description": "How to make EASY Christmas bows for your holiday decor! Simple instructions to make fluffy DIY bows, from small to big, for your Christmas decorations.  I searched for \"easy Christmas DIY bows\" a few years ago and tried at least three versions (that seemed incredibly easy).  Each time I ended up with a mess of ribbon that looked NOTHING like what they showed.  I finally found a simple bow that ended up looking pretty cute, so I wanted to share the easy steps! You only need two things for this quick tutorial -- wired ribbon (I think I had 30 yards) and wire of some kind. You can use wire, floral wire, pipe cleaners...anything like that will work.  1. Cut your ribbon to long lengths First up, cut one long piece of ribbon at around five feet (I ended up making them a bit longer, around 65 inches) and a shorter piece at two feet.  You'll see the size of the bows with these measurements in this post -- adjust the lengths to your liking!  Then place the long one on a surface like so: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisgxUQ7mMJs_cmJWuWHiPUMsqqTkWyZNkwb53FA5W2kba1P9NMQJ6y7wZE1Zm2luxzVeOQt7euTP45wif3IYS3VnqZ2mfqE7z9LcaT76x4DQUpRCnmLI1tvOQa_tpuUB8p6SyTNLLe5AQ/s16000/IMG_9870.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     Using wired ribbon will make this much easier -- it keeps its shape as you go.  I had to study the photo as I did this because I kept doing it backwards. You just lay it flat and then pull one side over, then the other.  You may want to widen that part at the top as you go, that will be the back part of the bow. 2. Make your ribbon loops Then, take the smaller section of ribbon and overlap the ends a bit like so: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to add a DIY library paneling molding look to your walls. Install your own wall molding (and save a ton!) that gives you that classic library/dark academia look.  Last I left you on my office makeover, I had installed the peel and stick wallpaper, removed and installed the new baseboards, installed the chair rail and given everything a couple coats of paint:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh4jopEj9wjsj8HIOO-PsOATH1_DeXdnazTqWXszpIRT9mzlEkoAd4U4kpN-quAQy5Wv-4uryzulNakpXykBGMSejOLM9WymhYMXCMyFDfQkWFuaamzm-Kzxje7JnlMXHz2SEzkoAAWNQzymFPTM6hrSyHcWOU-8T05rxlIGgs1JmGXkNA2GlWUswKz67U/s16000/green%20trim%20grasscloth%20wallpaper.jpg\"\u003e That pretty green paint color is called Vintage Vogue -- it's a Benjamin Moore color, but I have it mixed at Sherwin-Williams.  You can read all about that process and the grasscloth wallpaper I used here.  After that, I stalled out on the DIY stuff (because: marching band season) till recently. My goal for the lower third of the wall was to create a library paneling type of look.  There are so many ways to add character to your walls with molding. For this room, I wanted it to be a simple but beefy look that adds some detail to this room.  Step One: Deciding on your design I ended up doing a classic look using two pieces of molding. Simple, primed one by twos and this cove trim:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgcCKs_avyABffKvSfWkDZvlCWipvBV24wLWD5pfxSt9Go5dL_9kLZ3TEN2qlCn2nPy3U5cbxJ-KhBSBWdaxsZIsDunSiY5NoS0069uK8X9elU1QtcIrBHoJXYNv3huFCt6XUs77fpZD5HbWKSPycPnsKeCLq9HY8TKGfxCAAnFUEW_dEnqPWNkCv8fn5w/s16000/vinyl%20curved%20molding.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    When those curved pieces are placed on each side, it really makes that thin 1x2 feel much more substantial: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjivUqajw5lmCvq4r8o6Ch1EWOgKxj0Z0BqVROiElip7e75nxGY5hyphenhyphensgcjTQe07sXXhonU9mv0E8oRuU5y_Yg09bfu-n4D_WFyHsaAbGma5eEiEeznqdbZHZ9UBR0vAnYfb20mERrSlRs3QYmkrZKOeq5QL-Km8hCLw0o7086JuxAZ8TLTVnPBvA8kNuus/s16000/DIY%20library%20paneling.jpg\"\u003e The curved molding is actually a paintable vinyl product that is great for outside and in bathrooms. I like that it's lightweight, easy to cut and cheaper than wood.  I had already added the curved trim to the top of the chair rail. Usually I would go with a simple 1x2, but I really like how this turned out with that coved look on top and bottom of each piece of trim.  Before I got started, I needed to fix some gaping in the baseboards and chair rail. It was only bad along the long wall in the room: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
