    "description": "My tips for finding beautiful treasures on Facebook Marketplace! If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse.

The laundry and bathroom have been moved close to the centre of the plan, ensuring a logical flow for the stylish appointed interior. An existing backyard jacaranda provided both inspiration and constraints for the project, designed as a farmhouse-style home in the city.",
