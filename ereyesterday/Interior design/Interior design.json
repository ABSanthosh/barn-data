But every once and awhile I open my recipe binder (it creaks and a cloud of dust poofs out) and find one I love and I just have to share. You will thank me for this one! :) I’ve made this “pie” for years, but for some reason it’s been a while since I last did. And now that we’ve had it again, I’m quite sure I’ll be making it weekly. Or so. It’s SO easy. And insanely good. You will LOVE it. That is, if you like peanut butter. Or chocolate.

This beautiful flowering perennial is easy to grow once you find the perfect spot in your garden. Peonies are one of my all time favorite cut flowers -- the blooms are so full and lush and sometimes incredibly fragrant! Even the foliage is a deep, pretty green...the combination makes for stunning bouquets and arrangements.I'm sharing all the tips you'll need to grow these gorgeous flowers! Peonies can be a bit finicky at first, but once they're established you will rarely need to touch them again. They are seriously one of the most glorious flowers I've ever seen.
