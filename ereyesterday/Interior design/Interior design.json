    "description": "How to stain a fiberglass entry door in a rich wood color.  One of the most common questions I get is about the stain we used on our wood front door. Turns out our door isn't wood, but it is stained to look like it.  Did you know you can stain a fiberglass door and it will look just like wood? I didn't realize this until we built our current house. I had no idea you could use stain on anything but wood, and I've been at this DIY thing for a long time! We have a Therma Tru door set with sidelites (see specifics of our indoor and outdoor home finishes here) and picked the stain color called English Walnut.  Our front door doesn't get much of the elements because it's protected on our front porch. But even without the wind and rain hitting it directly, the dark stain was still super faded nearly eight years later.  I'm prepping for our son's high school graduation party, and this DIY project was on my list! The process wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. There are only a few simple steps in this application, they just take some time. The before photos of the door finish didn't look as horrible as in real life, but it was faded, worn out and chipping in some spots: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Our builder didn't do a great job the first time this door was stained, so we had a lot of areas (particularly in more detailed spots) that were chipping away completely:  The builder left some of the leftover product, so I was able to look it up online and order more stain.  I went with the dark, rich English Walnut again in this same-day stain: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Over the years I've come up with quite a few ways to save on both annual and perennial plants this time of year. Sometimes I will still splurge on a plant or tree, but for the most part these methods will save me a TON on flowers, bushes and trees for our gardens and yard. I've planted or replanted a TON of plants this spring (most were small, individual flowers) and have loved watching them thrive. I gathered my top five ways to save on plants this spring and summer! 1. Pick spreading plantsI love our window boxes, but they can be expensive to fill every spring. I learned years ago that using flowers that spread will make my money go a lot further. My favorite has always been the Wave Petunias because they multiply like crazy and cascade out of boxes or containers: These are the only annual flowers I plant each year because they spread and fill in so beautifully. Annuals only last one season, perennials will come back year after year.For your landscaping, look for ground cover or flowers that spread, like this awesome sedum plant I showed you years ago:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "When you look up Damascus steel saw blades on the internet you'll find many tutorials for would-be blacksmiths about upcycling end-of-use bandsaw blades into the pricey material that practically defines the garish realm of collector knives.This tool from Woxna, completes that circle in a way, rescuing Damascus steel from the display case and putting it back to practical use in an everyday workhorse: the pruning saw. Woxna is a relatively new company looking to produce premium outdoor gear and with their folding saw aim to upgrade the (likely) weakest leg of a well-heeled bushcrafter's blade tripartite of axe, knife, saw.  The founders turned to Nikita Golovlev of Struktur Design, a Swedish industrial design firm, to help them develop it.The saw folds for protection of both hand and blade, in the garden or out in the wild. The handle is offered in walnut and oak, and initially the blade came in high-carbon and stainless steel flavors. The Damascus version emerged as a bit of a lark for the company, but one rooted in a foundational desire to make objects worthy of passing down through generations. The conceptual power of Damascus steel derives from its formation, the folding and welding of its layers at anvil and furnace. Its visible path through forging is the selling point, but ironically in the market its story is held to surface level on the seamless edge of knives, reduced simply to style. Woxna and Struktur have serendipitously stumbled upon the natural medium for the narrative of Damascus – the thick blade and serrations of a pruning saw. Here the variegated strata of force and material are sharply delineated in every angular tooth. Stainless or not, sticking your saw blade in water, especially in the boonies, is not Core77 approved.Could Damascus steel's implied promise of high-performance be realized in this form? When you look closely you see that during manufacture, when the teeth are ground, the varied hardness of the layers create mini-serrations on the cutting edges. If you've ever been tempted by the look of Damascus this is the moment to take action — in Woxna's outdoor saw its beauty runs more than skin-deep. Also, through May 28th the kickstarter has some hefty-discounts for backers.Thanks to Nikita at Struktur for the following pics of the product development process:Initial idea sketch - wooden handle saw inspired by axes and knives Fitting the blade, locking and assembly screws in CAD Concept render 3D-printed scales on a fuctional prototype First milled samples arrive and assembled Softening up the edges and oiling the scales Ramping up the small scale production",
