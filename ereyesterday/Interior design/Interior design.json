    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134091/Industrial-Design-Case-Study-An-Alzheimers-Battling-Therapy-Light",
    "description": "Based on MIT research, a company called Bright developed Beacon40, a light technology that \"could significantly reduce toxic beta-amyloid levels in the brain, a major factor in cognitive decline.\" To turn this into a product aimed at those struggling with Alzheimer's, Bright turned to ID consultancy Y Studios.BEACON40® therapy light is designed to promote brain health for people living with Alzheimer's disease symptoms. Beacon40's technology is based on neural research that shows lights pulsing at a gamma frequency of 40Hz (40 times per second) increases microglia responses in the brain to purge the amyloid beta plaque associated with Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Complementing scientifically proven methods to dramatically reduce the risk of cognitive decline including regular exercise, healthy diet and quality sleep, Beacon40 can also be used by people looking to prevent cognitive decline. Design ConsiderationsAvailable as a standalone personal light or a surround system to fill a room, the industrial design of the Beacon40 is imbued with a quiet elegance that blends beautifully into any home or office. The design was purposely created to present the innovative wellness technology with an extremely approachable experience. Complimenting soft \"pillow-like\" surfacing with geometric forms crafted an inviting appearance for the BEACON40®. The fabric diffuser was selected to retain the warmth of the home environment while the base cradles the premium interface, angled for sitting or standing operation. We paid very close attention to the ergonomics and UX design by making it easy to turn the lights on/off, set daily timers and adjust the tone and brightness. We had to consider that a typical user may have some level of cognitive decline and the app integration would not be desirable for everyone. This guided us to having full physical controls on the base as a necessity. The tactile interface delivers an uncomplicated success, clearly providing feedback for each setting in separate, easily understood controls. The system can also be voiced controlled via Amazon Alexa, Google Home or Apple Home to set daily routines. You can see more of Y Studios' work here.",

    "description": "Sydney’s inner-city suburbs are lined with rows of picturesque terrace houses standing side by side, but this one in Surry Hills hides a renovation like no other. Architect George took an experimental approach to transform the — initially unliveable — 1880s Victorian into a family home for a couple who’d lived their whole lives in apartments, and longed for a playful space that could ‘heighten their mood’. And the resulting residence is a masterclass in architectural expression.",

After living there for more than a decade, Sarah used her skills to celebrate the home’s evolution in a thoughtful extension, unlocking the untapped potential of the 270-square-metre block.",

    "description": "Tips for purging and storing photos, artwork and paper mementos. Purging family keepsakes, photos and children's artwork can be SO overwhelming. As with any major decluttering project I take on, the process of sorting through and organizing these mementos took a lot of time!From start to finish, it took me NINE months to complete the process of going through all of our most treasured photos and paper memorabilia. I learned a lot through the process and wanted to share some tips with you. :) I decided I wanted to store everything all together when I was done. The bookcases I built in our basement have provided a ton of storage for us. I knew this was the perfect spot!: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I still had plenty of room, so one of those cabinets is now a storage spot all of our family photos and stuff from our kids' childhoods. I had five main \"paper\" items to sort through and store: Small photos -- we had eight photos boxes FULL. Medium to large photos -- things like school and family photos. Some of my old family photos (some nearly 100 years old!!) are HUGE, and I wanted to find a way to enjoy them but keep them protected. Kids' schoolwork -- PILES of school projects ranging from tiny to huge. Mementos from our childhoods, travel and school like report cards, music programs and ticket stubs.Greeting cards -- more on that in a minute! My first step was to go through everything to decide what to keep. The key word there is KEEP -- one of my favorite parts about the Konmari decluttering method I've used for years is that it teaches you to hold on to items you cherish, instead of trying to decide what you want to give up. There is a difference, and I find keeping items I LOVE so much easier than deciding what needs to go. If I don't love something, I no longer feel guilty donating it. And if I LOVE it, I no longer feel guilty for keeping it, no matter how silly it may seem. It really is freeing to purge the clutter this way!Step one: The photosMy first part of this project was sorting through thousands of photos. It took me a loooong time to do this.Family photos and a small box of items are the only things from my childhood that my Mom was able save from move to move...so I cherish those photographs.Because of that, a few years ago I would have felt bad about tossing ANY photos. I've learned if I don't know the person in a picture and the people in my life who do (say, my Dad), don't want the photos...I can toss them. I can toss blurry photos I took from the bus windows on Girl Scout and school field trips. :) I can also throw away doubles from all of the rolls of film I took in middle and high school. (I did text some to friends to see if they wanted them.) It was SUCH a great feeling to toss a ton of the photos that were cluttering up the ones I wanted to enjoy. I whittled the photos down from eight boxes to five. I use these simple cardboard photo boxes and my last set held up for ten years!: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
