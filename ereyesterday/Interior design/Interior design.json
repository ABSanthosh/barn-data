    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137385/Aircela-Says-Their-Machine-Makes-Carbon-Neutral-Gasoline-Out-of-Thin-Air",
    "description": "An NYC-based startup called Aircela claims they've invented a machine that creates gasoline out of thin air. As in, vehicle-ready gasoline that you can pour into a car. Perhaps most incredibly, they say this gasoline is carbon-neutral. Although the gasoline will emit CO2 when used, it was created out of CO2, and thus doesn't add any new CO2 to the atmosphere. Meaning they've technically just recycled the CO2.For that claim to hold, of course, the machine must be powered by renewable electricity. Assuming you've got a source, here's how the machine performs its feat, according to the company:I. Capturing Carbon from the AirAircela's machine uses a water-based solution containing potassium hydroxide (KOH) to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from ambient air. Air flows through a specially designed chamber where it contacts the liquid sorbent, efficiently capturing CO2. II. Producing Hydrogen from WaterWe use electrolysis — powered by renewable electricity — to split water (H2O) into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is kept for fuel synthesis; the oxygen is safely released. At the same time, the sorbent used in the capture step is regenerated for reuse, allowing the cycle to run continuously. III. Synthesizing FuelThe captured CO2 and hydrogen are combined to create methanol. That methanol is then converted into gasoline through a two-step catalytic process known as methanol-to-gasoline (MTG). The result is fossil-free, engine-ready gasoline — fully compatible with existing engines and infrastructure. Aircela says the machine can produce one gallon of gasoline over a 24-hour period, and that it's 90 octane \"or higher.\" The company envisions the machines being owned by households… …or at network scale: So is this real? It appears so; it's attracted multiple well-known investors including Jeff Ubben, the activist investor who sits on ExxonMobil's board. That said, there have been no third-party studies conducted yet who have verified Aircela's claims. At press time the company had not revealed how much one of their machines would cost.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137384/Infinite-Machines-Cyber-Utilitarian-Olto-E-Bike",
    "description": "Though it looks more like a scooter, this Olto E-Bike was designed specifically for bike lanes. Created by NYC-based transportation startup Infinite Machine, the Olto was designed with what I can only call a cyber-utilitarian aesthetic. The Olto is well-proportioned, getting right what the Tesla Cybertruck got wrong. When you nail proportions and get angles right, it imbues the design with confidence, which is further evinced here by the unadorned welded steel and anodized aluminum body. There are no extraneous stylistic elements here. It's clean, modern and beautiful. It's also available in all black. It has a 40-mile range and can hit a top speed of 20 mph. It takes 5.5 hours to get a full charge. Here's where the removable rechargeable battery goes:To fully appreciate the design, you really need to see how this thing works. Check out the magnetic folding pedals, the flip-out passenger footpegs, the hanging hooks beneath the seat:One hurdle to owning one is its weight. At 176 lbs, only those who live in elevator buildings would be able to keep this in their apartments; otherwise it would have to live outside. City dwellers might not be comfortable leaving a $3,500 machine, locked or not, in full view of thieves.The Olto is currently in production and will be available for sale later this year.",

    "description": "How to make your builder grade cabinets look custom with simple trim. Adding just a bit of inexpensive trim makes a big difference on the sides of your kitchen cabinets! I've been hard at work in our kitchen finishing up a few smaller projects. I LOVE our kitchen, but I've planned all along to add some small details that add some interest and character.  You know character is the name of my game! My goal for the past couple decades of home ownership has been to add custom touches to our homes. :)  I started with adding \"legs\" to the sides of our island. That project made the island feel so much more substantial, and we can still access the cabinets underneath.This one is a quick project that I never had to address in our old kitchen makeover because we didn't have any exposed cabinet ends:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Basic cabinet side panels don't bother me -- but I do see them as an opportunity to make the kitchen look more custom!  I considered a bunch of different designs, but in the end went with the simplest. My friend Jenny shared a bunch of great options for dressing up the ends of cabinets here.  First I had to remove all of the trim along the side -- the quarter round, baseboard on the wall and the trim along the back of the cabinet.
