    "description": "At first blush this CargoMate bike rack, by German bike accessories company Flectr, doesn't look like much. But the draw is that it can be installed in 30 seconds, without tools, on any bike. The ingenuity of this design is not in the refinement of the object; with even basic tools and materials, many of us could rig something like this up in an afternoon for any individual bike. The accomplishment is in how they designed both the fast, tool-free installation and the universal fit, compensating for different styles of handlebar. A lot of work and thought clearly went into this, as you can see by how it's installed in the video: The CargoMate has been successfully Kickstarted, with 35 days left to pledge at press time. The units are going for €69 (USD $79) and should ship in October.",

    "description": "These strange-looking buses operate in rural Shikoku, Japan. They're Toyota buses that have had an unusual proboscis added. The non-standard snout houses an extra axle fitted with steel wheels. Another of these axles, unseen, is tucked under the rear. When the roadgoing buses get to the train tracks, the axles with the steel wheels are lowered onto the rails. The bus can then power itself along the railway tracks.These DMV (Dual-Mode Vehicle) buses were developed by Japan's Asa Seaside Railway as a cost-effective way to provide public transportation. While the modifications require investment, the buses are significantly cheaper to maintain that trains—and also prevent residents from needing to transfer between travel modes. Here's a video of the DMVs in operation:",

I know so many people tend to get \"stuck\" when it comes to making their own decorating decisions for their home. We might worry too much about what other people will think (especially for those of us who post our homes on social media, since we have Instagram telling us what people like or don't like). We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon. We worry that we are making a design or budget mistake, even if our heart knows it's what would bring us more joy.",

    "description": "Five ways to save money on plants and flowers this planting season.Gardening is one of my favorite pastimes, but also one of the most expensive! Over the years I've come up with quite a few ways to save on both annual and perennial plants this time of year. Sometimes I will still splurge on a plant or tree, but for the most part these methods will save me a TON on flowers, bushes and trees for our gardens and yard. I've planted or replanted a TON of plants this spring (most were small, individual flowers) and have loved watching them thrive. I gathered my top five ways to save on plants this spring and summer! 1. Pick spreading plantsI love our window boxes, but they can be expensive to fill every spring. I learned years ago that using flowers that spread will make my money go a lot further. My favorite has always been the Wave Petunias because they multiply like crazy and cascade out of boxes or containers: These are the only annual flowers I plant each year because they spread and fill in so beautifully. Annuals only last one season, perennials will come back year after year.For your landscaping, look for ground cover or flowers that spread, like this awesome sedum plant I showed you years ago:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to hang patio lights over your patio, deck or yard.The ultimate guide on how to hang outdoor patio lights and all of the products you'll need!There's nothing quite as charming as beautiful cafe lights draped over a deck or patio -- they add so much character and ambience to outdoor living spaces in the evening. Now that we've had them at two homes, these outdoor string lights are a staple for our outdoor spaces. There are a lot of things to consider if you're planning to install these exterior lights yourself. You'll need a few tools in order to hang them so that they withstand the elements. You'll also need to consider where you are hanging them from to ensure they will be sturdy over time. I've compiled all of the methods -- whether you have mature trees, a solid wood fence...or nothing at all in your backyard!This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. The best string lights that will last!I tried a few options when we first installed patio cafe lights at our first house years ago.

A lot of them weren't nearly long enough for what we needed. The lights we ended up using are still going strong ten years later! They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too. We used them on our outdoor dining area under the wood pergola at that house:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
