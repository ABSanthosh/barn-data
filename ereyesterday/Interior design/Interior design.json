    "description": "This Stupid Car Tray is something that will never make it into the MoMA, but which will probably make a lot of peoples' lives easier. And some good design thought has been put into it. It's a simple tray with legs on one end, allowing you to turn your car's passenger seat into a level surface. A tongue on the back slots between the seat and seatback, preventing it from sliding forward. The legs are hollow, allowing you to slide in taller items or the included cupholders. Rubber pads on the bottom prevent it from marring your seat surface. There's a thoughtful little notch on one side to admit a phone charging cable. A strap can be used to hold things in place. As pedestrian as this object seems, I like it because it considers how people actually use things, as opposed to how manufacturers think we use things. Plenty of people use the passenger seat as a storage locker. If anything it's strange that no auto manufacturer has picked up on this and designed a similar object.",

A portion of sales will be donated to support research or conservation field work in Bale Mountains National Park.\" The Nyala Chair, one of which is part LACMA's permanent collection, is carried by the Wexler Gallery.",

Linen closet redo Since it's the season of decluttering and organizing, let's start with the closet that was a huge pain in my butt for years: I finally got down to business and removed the shallow wire shelving and replaced them with deeper wood shelves: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    SO much better! I added a pretty touch to the back wall with some leftover wallpaper. It's a sweet hint of color when you open the door. 2. Main bedroom makeoverThe dark gray paint color I painted our bedroom years ago was proving to be difficult to work with, so I had an idea to brighten things up: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Christmas decor storage ideas and hacks that will make next year's decorating easier!I've figured out some great holiday storage solutions over the years that have helped to keep our Christmas decor better organized. These methods have made pulling out decor for the next Christmas much more efficient. These little tips save my sanity each November when the holiday decor comes out and when I put them away for the year. In general I find packing holiday decor away is faster and easier than setting it up! Am I the only one? I quite like the process, it feels cathartic to clean up the house and simplify everything for the new year. Here are my Christmas decor organization methods and a few tips I've figured out along the way!  1. Label your decor for next year My first tip is to label as much as you can -- especially the stuff you put up in the same spot every year. I've found over the years that labeling light strands I use for specific areas helps a TON!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.  You can find my awesome label maker here! This smaller version works great too -- it's just a little more basic. Both are super easy to use.  I label any spot that uses more than one strand of lights -- both inside and outside. So when I get them out I know exactly how many bushes or trees are covered by that group of lights. I also label them inside, like the strands on our stair garland. That way I'm not trying to figure out how many I used the year before.  I use a LOT of these remote plugs and switches for our indoor lights. (That one is my favorite because I can use one remote for five items.) I store them away with the items that need a remote, like for the garland on our stairs. I just keep them plugged into the light strand.  I also keep any needed extension cords attached and stored away with the lights. If you have more than one set of these remotes, you know the joy of trying to figure out which one goes with which remote. ;) I label the matching sets so we know what goes with what: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it.
