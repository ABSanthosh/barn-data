    "description": "A part of Time \u0026 Style's 2025 Collection, the Wooden Cantilever Chair is a singular creation that erases and rewrites the aesthetic of plywood furniture.Lightweight, strong, resource maximizing; plywood is a revolutionary material of unquestionable benefit to furniture manufacturing and home construction. It does have an ugly side though. And we aren't talking the adhesive which binds the plies together, which were bad, but are getting better. The ugly side is ugly, un-asethetic. It is the edge. The ply. Its malignant presence marring many otherwise exemplary furniture designs. From the Eames through Yanagi, to Stark, designers have shaped the material into new forms, but almost uniformly within the natural bounds prescribed by its planar nature. No matter how far it is contorted and formed it retains that sliver of evil, the ply, often gap-toothed ... even if the outermost plies have been pinched to a single pursed seam, it is lurking ... even veneered, it is there, the planar specter, stubbornly inorganic.The genius here is flipping it, taking that sliver and making it the whole, then shaping it till no hint of rectilinearity remains. A pillow mint profile that converts the ersatz growth rings of ply into delicate contour lines describing the form. This must require who-knows how much care and, likely, waste in achieving such consistent beautiful strata, but in our eyes the outcome justifies the expenditure.From their website: \"Molded plywood technology makes it possible to create curved shapes that solid wood cannot achieve while keeping the warmth and natural feel of wood. This technology also provides strength and flexibility. We have re-examined this method to explore new ways to express the beauty of wood, leading to the creation of The wooden cantilever chair.\"\"This chair features a Bauhaus-style cantilever structure, in which the seat is supported by the frame without back legs, creating a floating effect. Molded plywood gives the chair both strength and flexibility, allowing it to bend slightly for a comfortable sitting experience. This natural bending makes the chair gently adapt to the body. To enhance the feel of the wood, we shaped the plywood into an oval form, just like solid wood, resulting in a soft and warm texture. The seat shell, supported by the frame, is made of carefully shaped wooden parts that connect to create a beautiful whole. These elements come together in a single flowing form, making the chair not only comfortable but also visually elegant.\"Amen, Brother.* * * See more of our 2025 Milan Design Week coverage here * * * /// - - - - M-I-L-A-N-O - 2-0-2-5 - - - - ///",

The presentation was library-like, dense with materials and finishes that demanded to be touched and craftsmanship worthy of lingering scrutiny. Time \u0026 Style, the company, is based in Asahikawa, on the island of Hokkaido, and handles production in house, from \"log purchasing to lumbering, drying, woodcutting, wood assembly, polishing, and finishing.\" Its showroom opened in Milan in 2022.Here are some standout pieces from our visit, first in shelving ...... and in seating, table finish and joint details ...... in ceramic, glass, wood, lacquer, small objects ...If you are a frequent reader of this blog you know how the above checks many of our areas of interest: Time \u0026 Space was very much a nexus of that in the wide expanse of Milan Design Week.

But I definitely don't want it to be the center of attention -- often they do stand out more than we'd like! I've gathered a few of my favorite ideas on how to incorporate a TV into the design of your house, and even help it to disappear a little bit!1.

White frames and other colors work well too of course, I just think the black helps to make the TV stand out a little less.  I love the idea of incorporating big artwork to steal the focus:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Beautiful DIY ways to display mementos and keepsakes around your home. Framing photos or filling photo albums isn't the only way to display memorabilia -- these are simple ways  honor your special memories and create some fun conversation starters as well! It's been a sentimental few months for our family! Our son is graduating high school in a soon and we're experiencing a lot of \"lasts\" with him lately. (I know many firsts are to come too, it is very bittersweet!)And as I shared in my last post, we recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog of 14 years, Peanut. Needless to say, I've been a bit emotional. 💙Early this year I started decluttering like crazy -- it's been years since I've purged our home like that. This process included sorting through a lot of old bins and paperwork that have been stored away. During that decrapification I found so many items with such wonderful memories attached to them, and I was determined to figure out ways to display them in our home.I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me to see so many of these throughout my day!Most of these ideas are easy to complete and don't cost much at all. A lot of our keepsakes are small -- I've struggled with adding them around the house because they look cluttered instead of cherished items. I've found that grouping them together makes them look more purposeful (and pretty!).When we moved years ago, I packed away a baggie of these matchbooks from our travels. I was so excited to find them again!:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   This one was easy -- I just placed them in a decorative bowl by a candle. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through them in the past few months, reminiscing about the exact dinner or travel that corresponds to each one. Here are some more ways to display matchbook covers: Attach them to the back of a shadowbox frame to create artwork. Hot glue magnets to the back for a fun way to display them (this would work best with match boxes).Have an artist make custom artwork with your match covers -- this would be perfect if you don't have the physical book but can find examples online. I love the custom artwork idea, probably because we have something similar that a friend made for us: When my husband retired from teaching (he was a band director), a close friend had this beautiful art made with every school musical he had conducted over the years. It's one of our most treasured pieces and I think it would be a brilliant idea for a student who's involved in theater or the arts. You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts. What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself. During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Melbourne-based ceramicist Ella Reweti and her partner Huw Smith (a metal fabricator) are both used to ‘making’ things in their careers, so as first-home buyers, it was only natural that their home should also be a bit of a personal project. Since they moved into their cute Victorian cottage about two years ago, Ella and Huw have taken a hands-on approach to improving the home’s comfort and sustainability in phase one of the renovation. We visited their Preston abode with home comfort and energy advisor Tim Forcey to see just how energy-efficient their half-renovated home is — and you might be surprised to know it already performs better than the average Melbourne home!",
