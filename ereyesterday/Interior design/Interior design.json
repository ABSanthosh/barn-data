    "description": "Manufacturing machinery company KraussMaffei has designed a new twist on multi-component injection molding. Their ColorForm system cuts out a time-consuming step in the production of injection molded parts that are painted, like automotive bumpers and fascia. Instead of molding the part, then transferring it to a painting facility, the ColorForm rig molds the part, then flow-coats it with polyurethane (PU) or polyurea (PUA), all within a single machine. It's a six-step process:The method does mean you have to invest in four mold halves, rather than two. But the company reckons their system's increased cycle time, and the elimination of both a part-handling step and the spraypainting process, will be attractive to automotive suppliers seeking greater efficiency. One such supplier, Rehau Automotive, has invested in the system and plans to use it to produce fascia.",

    "description": "Early Christmas decor finds for this holiday season!I don't usually buy a whole lot of new Christmas decor each year, but I found some cute items this year that really caught my eye! Many of you aren't even considering holiday decor just yet, and I totally appreciate that. :) It's crazy how early the stuff comes out in stores now, but it's even crazier how fast it sells out! These finds were different than most of the Christmas items I've seen out and about this year, and nearly everything was on sale when I purchased!I'm sharing a few simple ways to display these holiday decorations as well. The first decor items I found were these really cute accordion (they are also calling them honeycomb) trees in cream and green: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   I thought they were so unique, but after I purchased them I started seeing this style ALL over the place. It's definitely the trend this year. I'm trendy on time for once! 😂The trees assemble in seconds -- they connect together with magnets. They would be great in multiples along a shelf or console table. Thread some fairy lights throughout and you have a beautiful vignette in just a few minutes. The cream trees have more of a traditional look, and the green ones are softer and more rounded. There are also skinnier red versions that I didn't see in my local Walmart. Bonus: they fold up flat to store away for next year. I found a couple really cute entertaining/serving pieces recently as well. This Christmas platter from Michael's had the sweetest little details: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Where to find the best throw pillow covers for under $20!I'm back to share my favorite resources for cute and affordable pillow covers. I love sharing where I find home decor at a great price.  Pillow covers are one of those things I switch out more often than any other decor item. If you get them for a good price, they're an easy way to change up the accent colors in a room. I also like to use different textures and colors for the seasons.  I've found some sources for budget-friendly throw pillow covers (and inserts) over the years -- the prices are so good! ALL of the throw pillow covers I'm sharing have a zipper and are under $20, and most are well under that, or come in a set of two. This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. I prefer covers instead of store-bought pillows these because they cut down on the storage space significantly. I wash and store them away for different seasons and holidays and then reuse the removable inserts in the new cases. I find softer down-like inserts more comfy than the traditional pillow stuffing. I've been using these lightweight down alternative pillow inserts because you can get them in SO many sizes. The prices are hard to beat! When you order your inserts, order one size larger than your pillow cover for a fuller look!  1. Amazon pillow covers Amazon has a ton of throw pillow cover options under $20. I LOVE these neutral windowpane pillow covers on our bed: The quality is great -- I've washed them numerous times. They are SO pretty. There's a similar striped version I usually have on our dining room window seat as well: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

Let me tell you, the joy of packing light (only for yourself! not the whole fam!) and having a few nights of sleepovers in a fun new place and exploring so freely (just us eating dessert for breakfast if we want to!)… it’s euphoric. And our latest trip that we enjoyed was a completely new spot for me! She grew up going to Sedona with her family, but I had never been! She didn’t have to work hard to sell me on it though – the gorgeous views, the warm temperatures, magical mystical vortexes, shops full of crystals, and this pool? Sold! Where We Stayed In Sedona We splurged to stay at Enchantment Resort, which is a resort that my best friend has always wanted to experience.
