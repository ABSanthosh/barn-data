    "description": "A California-based company called MarsCharge is dedicated to developing EV infrastructure. To design their flagship product, a freestanding commercial charger that can top off two EVs at once, they turned to industrial design consultancy DesignStein Studios. After extensive industry feedback, MarsCharge realized that there was a huge demand for large, standalone EV charging station chargers that actually work. The client built a highly-engineered prototype freestanding DC fast charger that can fully charge most EVs in approximately 20 minutes, which is nearly twice as fast as most standalone DC fast chargers, and arguably one of the fastest on the market today. However, they found it lacking a beautiful design and easy-to-use interface. Styling was paramount. Our client did not want a clunky, boxy-looking charger like most of what exists on the market today. After collaboration with them, we selected three design themes that would embody the charger's design: Monolithic, Annular and Premium. Monolithic designs aren't simply large, their presence stops you in your tracks. Annularity promotes a natural, swooping flow, eliminating the slightest hint of \"boxiness\" in our design. Premium structures stand alone. You know them when you see them. Together, these Mood Board elements became the inspiration for our sketches.MONOLITH, ANNULAR, PREMIUM With our mood board completed, we explored multiple design directions (below). The first drawings below, with the pencil sketches behind them, are the initial configurations: Our client loved them, and through the collaborative process we encourage with all our clients, they evolved into these detailed concepts: The video below has the full story on how we employed our process with MarsCharge, and helped them use this design to increase their profitability.You can see more of DesignStein Studio's work here.",

Sometimes you don't want to do ALL the work on old or distressed furniture...sanding and then staining or painting it can take quite a bit of time and effort.  If you have an old piece of furniture that needs some love, these tips will refresh your piece with way less work!  First, the reason for this makeover. For years now, we've had the Everett table in our entryway:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

It's a nice little custom detail.  I've always loved this table, but for the past year or two I've been wanting to transition some of the farmhouse-style pieces we have in the house. I've never went all in on the farmhouse style, but I definitely dabbled in it! :) For a few weeks I searched Facebook Marketplace for a dresser or credenza that would work in this spot, but I didn't find the perfect piece.  I was sitting and thinking one day (as one does), and started considering the dressers we already have in the house. That's when I realized the vintage dresser in our son's room would be perfect!: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to keep your houseplants from dying. One of my most commonly asked questions is about our plants! It never fails that I'll get messages or emails about plant care when I share a room that has one in it. Today I'm sharing the biggest mistake I find so many are making when it comes to their house plants. I love having plants around the house -- they truly add \"life\" to our rooms and are the perfect way to fill awkward spaces.  Over the years of honing my plant growing craft, I've figured out the one big thing that keeps our fiddles leaf trees and other house plants thriving:  And it's probably not what you think!  Sunlight is important of course...that varies quite a bit depending on the type of plant.  Fiddles love sunlight! I've found over the years that they don't love direct light, ours (actually all of our plants) tend to do better with indirect light: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I find fertilizing isn't necessary in most instances -- I don't do it a lot. Maybe once a year? In general ours do better in the summer months and go dormant in the cloudy, winter months with shorter days. I also don't add anything special to the soil to help it drain -- half the time I leave the plant in the pot it came in for a year or so!:That plant behind the sofa is fake!

Unlike many renovations of homes of this era, however, the brief given to Nest Architects was not to open it all up, but rather to create cleverly connected — yet separate — spaces to accommodate a growing family with changing needs. The resulting design, together with furniture and decoration by Studio Esar, celebrates a home that embraces nature, and allows the family to retreat into their own worlds, without losing connection.",

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
