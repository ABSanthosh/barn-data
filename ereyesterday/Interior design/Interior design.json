    "description": "Here's an impressive piece of design and engineering. Dutch company Expandable's Touchdown Trailer can be transported to site by a tractor-trailer. Once onsite, built-in legs extend downwards to take the weight of the trailer, allowing the tractor-trailer to take off. The axles then slide out from underneath the trailer, and the legs can then lower the trailer to the ground. The sides can expand outwards to create more space. This is a far more convenient arrangement than transporting a trailer to site, and having to hire a crane to pull it off of a flatbed. The trailers come in multiple sizes, and the company says just one person can set them up in 15 minutes. Here it is in action:",

    "description": "This GM-sponsored project is by Matthew Quejada, done while pursuing his Masters of Industrial Design at Pratt Institute.Prompt\"Design the garage of the future.\"General Motors provided the brief to design a new garage technology using their Ultium platform, a branding umbrella for their entire electrification ecosystem.Sketch IdeationDistilling a wide variety of concepts, I arrived at four distinct directions that could represent completely new product categories for GM. While evaluating each idea, I realized one concept stood out from the others for its greater implications: an electric bike charger.Electric bikes are significantly more common in urban areas compared to suburban areas, even though the average trip is only slightly longer. Having personal experience with the car-centric culture of the suburbs, I wanted to look for a way to encourage the use of a lower energy-intensive mode of transit.A full scale cardboard prototype helped me evaluate the placement of touchpoints, overall sizing, and interactions with the concept.ProductUltium Lift is an electric bike charging station for the suburban home, powered by General Motors. Designed to encourage more sustainable transit, Ultium Lift makes electric bike ownership elevated and desirable.Charging StagesEngageLiftChargeSignalPurposeMixed mode transit is the future of mobility. General Motors provided the prompt to envision the garage of the future, and I sought an opportunity to challenge car-centric culture.Streamlined storage and status at a glance make electric bike ownership easier than owning a car. E-bikes are significantly heavier than traditional bikes, so an automated lift system makes storage effortless while doubling as a mantel for a prized possession.The Ultium Lift app seals the deal with smart charging features like AutoCharge and Battery-to-Grid charging. Using these features, Ultium Lift can contribute significantly to the electrified home and lead owners into the energy transition.Smarter charging. Effortless storage. Status at a glance.You can see more of Quejada's work here.",

This is one of my favorite posts all year. My decor preferences overall (from colors to textures) lean \"fall\" anyway, so this is the time of year I feel like our home really shines! I prefer warm, rich colors and incorporating brass and wood decor accents. This time of year, more is MORE in our home. :) We'll start the tour in the entryway, where I decorated our Everett table with faux stems in dusty pink and plum colors: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. On the other side, I filled this glass candle hurricane with little acorns and pine cones:I piled my wicker pumpkins on the lower shelf, along with dried hydrangeas in a faux leather basket: Everything goes so well with the lovely rug I added a few years ago. It's so pretty!I keep most of our Halloween decor to the basement (and outside), but I have a few touches on the main level.

    "description": "How to spray paint cabinet hardware and get a perfect finish! You can give your kitchen or bathroom cabinets a new look by spray painting your knobs and pulls instead of replacing them.I love any project involving one of my very favorite DIY \"tools\" ever -- spray paint!I've blabbed on and on about my love of spray paint for years now. It's one of the easiest and least expensive ways to completely transform an item or room.  This transformation was in the kitchen and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I've added an update on this hardware and how it held up at the end of this post! When I was picking out the finishes for this house, I went much \"softer\" and lighter than I had in the past.  It felt right at the time, as we were starting fresh. But I quickly discovered that I am a contrast lover through and through. Almost immediately I was craving it. I started painting walls super dark, hung dark wallpaper and changed out some lighting for bigger and bolder options.  This project involved our kitchen handles:  I picked a lovely brass handle that looks GREAT. I loved the handles and the color was gorgeous! But they didn't feel substantial enough -- it was something I noticed every time I walked into the kitchen. I bought a set of black handles just to see if I liked them:  We loved them! But it would have been kind of spendy to replace all of the hardware. And ours are really nice, I just wanted to change the color.  So...spray paint to the rescue!I've spray painted bathroom and kitchen handles in the past and it's a really easy DIY project. Spray paint is a GREAT way to ease into do-it-yourself projects. For this one I used the Krylon Fusion All-in-one spray paint to paint our hardware:      I wanted a slightly more modern feel so I went with the satin black. It leans towards a matte finish but is not dull at all.  The easiest way to spray paint cabinet hardware. Spraying hardware can be tricky because you need to get all the angles. Sometimes it's difficult to access it all. My friend Lindsay shared this brilliant tip for spraying pulls and knobs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
