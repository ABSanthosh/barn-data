    "description": "At first glance, this appears to be some sort of vintage display case. In fact, it's a window-mounted birdhouse. You install it like a window A/C and load it with feed, and then you've got something like an aquarium for birds.I like the end result that they're selling—you get to check out birds up close, binoculars-free—but am puzzled that the unit doesn't seal from the outside. That access hole is permanently open. It does open wider so you can more easily clean the thing out (from the outside of your house). The only interface on the interior is the lid up top, which covers the refill hole. With no way to keep rain out of this thing, I can't imagine it would last long. Nevertheless, manufacturer Coveside Conservation Products, which makes wildlife feeders and habitats, has mass distribution; this item is sold at Lowe's, for $165.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136366/Why-Does-No-One-Make-Milk-Crate-Accessories-Like-Interior-Drawers",
    "description": "At first glance, this Grabinet Outfitter Kit appears useful. It's a set of nine drawers that apparently allow you to store/organize smaller items in a milk crate. The catch is, these won't fit in a standard milk crate, just the ones by its manufacturer, UbeCube. (Standard milk crates are 11\" tall and 13\" square. UbeCube's offerings are slightly larger, and truly cubical at 13.5\" all around.) I poked around to see if anyone makes a similar offering for actual milk crates. The Grip Store—that's \"grip\" as in film set, not hand traction--makes these $10 dividers for standard milk crates used by the dairy industry (and apparently film production crews). Each unit consists of two plugs that snap into the crisscross lattice on the sides, and a divider that slots between them. The divider is only as high as the bottom of the handle cutouts, so you can still pick the whole thing up. Print Foundry, a 3D-printing operation out of Fargo, North Dakota, sells just the plugs, four for $13; you supply the 1/4\"- or 6mm-thick divider of your choice. The company is a mom-and-pop outfit, and it shows in the finish quality of the product. What I could not find is anyone who makes a drawer-style offering like UbeCube's. There's either a gap in the market, or no market at all—after all, the type of people who use milk crates for storage tend to be DIY'ers who will improvise their own solutions. As evinced on Pinterest.",

    "description": "Fresh and flavorful salad recipe with crunchy ramen noodles. I had the most delicious salad last week and immediately asked for the recipe from my friend. It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How I organize our everyday household items throughout the house! I've been on a mission over the past few months to get our house decluttered and organized...for good!  This year I've been determined more than ever to rid our home of unneeded stuff and get all of our random household clutter organized. I don't know what got me so focused on it, but I've been a machine...we've gotten rid of so much and now (almost) everything else is nicely organized.  I feel like I'm finally getting our life in order (at least the stuff part!). We've only lived here seven years. :) I figured I'd share the ways I've organized our everyday household items throughout the house.  Keep a few things in mind as you read this! First up, I'm nearing the big 5-0 and with every year I want less and less things in our home. I thrive and function so much better in a clutter-free home, but even ten years ago that was not the case at all!  Our son recently turned 18 (!!) and will be going off to college in just a few months, so I've had more time over the past few years to tackle these types of projects. (And the days of Nerf bullets and toy clutter are gone, although I still step on the occasional Lego!)  This may sound like I've gotten rid of everything in our house, which is soooo not the case. I love my stuff. :) But what we do have, we use and enjoy AND most everything has a dedicated spot.  1. Take advantage of your closet space  Closets are great of course! But if you don't utilize them well, that storage space won't benefit your home as much as it should!  A few years ago I showed you a main floor closet had been full of random crap. At the time I called it my Monica closet (Friend's sitcom reference) because after we moved in I just chucked stuff in there. I did a quick declutter and it looked so much better!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

So I've been working on it here and there over the past few years.  The real organization started when I found these plastic basketweave storage bins at Big Lots a couple of years ago:  RIP to Big Lots by the way, I'm SO sad about them closing! I loved that place.  They had a taller version (pictured) and a shorter version. I grabbed a bunch of them, mostly in the larger size. I grouped like items in the bins, like tissue boxes, trash and grocery bags, medication and vitamins.  Just random household items we need throughout the day with easy access. Of course I needed a way to label them, so I used my trusty clip on bin labels: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
