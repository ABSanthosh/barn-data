    "description": "This month Starbucks is opening their first 3D-printed storefront. Sited in Brownsville, Texas, the structure is by German 3D printing construction company Peri 3D. As with a lot of 3D-printed construction projects we've seen lately, this seems to be more about novelty than the cost-savings that was once promised for 3D-printed construction. The building was erected at an estimated cost of $1.1 million. That said, it was built quickly; the shell was printed in under a week. The strange part is, no customer will ever get to set foot inside of it. The 1,400-square-foot building was designed as a drive-thru and also has a walk-up window, but there's no interior seating. It's due to open on April 28th.",

Both are embodied in these Molla lamps, designed in 1974. The construction of the Slinky-like lamp couldn't be simpler: It consists of little more than a spring (\"molla,\" in Italian) and an E27 socket. I bet shipping them was easy.The pieces were in production by Italian lighting manufacturer Candle.",

If you'd like to see everything we did in the old backyard, be sure to check out these posts!  Our backyard was just so pretty and magical, and we definitely missed it after moving. But we soon realized how much we LOVE having a covered patio. When we moved in, we placed our outdoor table and chairs out there, but we learned pretty quickly that we prefer to lounge in comfy chairs. :)I sold our outdoor table and replaced it with our chairs that used to sit near our outdoor fireplace. This was how it looked soon after moving in:    It's around 200 square feet, which we've realized is a perfectly lovely size for conversations with a small group of friends.  You know how I love symmetry! It won out here too, does that surprise you? :)  A couple of years ago I moved seat configuration around a bit to give us a little more walking room along the side. Instead of two chairs on each end, I placed two under the large picture window to open things up a bit: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Tons of tips and ideas for decorating the wall around a TV. The age old question -- how to make the big TVs of today work in the scheme of a room and not overpower it.Televisions don't bother me much so I'm not a big stickler about this. But I definitely don't want it to be the center of attention -- often they do stand out more than we'd like! I've gathered a few of my favorite ideas on how to incorporate a TV into the design of your house, and even help it to disappear a little bit!1. Create a TV gallery wall My favorite ideas involve gallery walls -- especially those with black frames. I think they work so well with the TV: Source: Pottery Barn catalogThis post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. What a beautiful room right? I think this TV wall is done so well. White frames and other colors work well too of course, I just think the black helps to make the TV stand out a little less.  I love the idea of incorporating big artwork to steal the focus:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "The Barton Housing Precinct in Canberra was established in the 1920s to house public servants prior to the opening of the provisional Parliament House in 1927. Close to 100 years later, these homes are heritage protected and remain sought after, but the buildings are not necessarily connected to their leafy surroundings. Without undertaking a full house renovation, Josh Mulford Architects have addressed the indoor-outdoor disconnect in this particular Barton home, introducing a new kitchen that frames the established garden beautifully, whilst maintaining the design integrity of the heritage home.",

In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset. And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.
