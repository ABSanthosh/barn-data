    "description": "Though Philips is no longer the consumer electronics giant they once were—they've shifted into health technology—they still manufacture some personal care items, like electric shavers and hair dryers. Now, somewhat bizarrely, they're dipping their foot into the DIY repair movement to support those products. The company has partnered with Prusa, the Czech company that has become one of the world's largest manufacturers of 3D printers, to launch this new Philips Fixables initiative.The idea is that Philips will provide 3D files for replacement parts for their products. Consumers will be able to download these files and print the parts themselves, or through a supplier. For now the selection is quite sparse—the only downloadable file available is for a trimmer comb—but the initiative has only launched this month, and the company says more parts are to come. (And hopefully more languages, too; at present the Fixables website is only presented in Czech.)",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136905/Glow-in-the-Dark-Substitute-for-EDC-Gear-Actual-Radioactive-Isotopes",
    "description": "Commonly available glow-in-the-dark materials are made from phosphors, which are chemicals like zinc sulfide or strontium aluminate, that manufacturers mix with paint or plastics. These phosphors absorb energy from sunlight or even artificial light, then give it off over time; that process, known as phosphorescence, is what causes them to glow. For some objects, it is not desirable to rely on phosphors, since they need to be \"charged\" (i.e. regularly exposed to light in order to produce their glowing powers). For example, there are gunsights and watch faces made with tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen, which glows continuously. The radioactivity emitted by a tritium gunsight or watch face is so weak that it cannot penetrate human skin, thus is deemed to be safe; manufacturers are quick to point out that you encounter more radiation just walking around on our planet. TEC Accessories, an EDC gear company, sells this line of Isotope Tritium Fobs. These are glow-in-the-dark key fobs that, you guessed it, rely on tritium for that always-on glow. There is a bit of a catch: TEC Accessories can sell you the key fob--but they can't actually sell you the tritium. Tritium is illegal to sell in the U.S., where the company is based. Thus they've got an entire page on their website describing how to skirt U.S. laws to get your hands on the stuff. Once you've ordered and received your vial of tritium, you can pop it into their key fob, and off you go. You're probably wondering: Aren't radioactive materials dangerous? As with gunsights and watch faces, the answer is that it might be—if you ingested it or inhaled it. Contained within a vial that is inserted into a titanium key fob, you'd have to go to a lot of trouble to do either of those things.You'd also have to go to a lot of trouble to order tritium. But darn if these things don't look cool. The fobs run $14.50 to $80 a pop.",

    "description": "How to build a shelf to hide the washer and dryer components.  This easy DIY shelf will hide the ugly washer and dryer components, but also gives you plenty of additional storage for laundry needs.  This is the second time I've added a DIY shelf unit behind our top loader washer and dryer -- I love them!   This shelf project was one of MANY in our mud room/laundry combo makeover. I tackled so many DIYs, from customizing a set of base cabinets to tiling the backsplash and finally adding beautiful floral wallpaper.  This washer and dryer shelf was something I was really missing in our current laundry area. As a reminder, this is what we had when we moved in:  Not bad at all! But the cabinets were hung at a height that were better suited for front loaders -- there was no room underneath to put a shelf, but it was difficult to reach over the washer and dryer and access the cabinets.  **I get a lot of questions about that tray under the washer -- it catches small leaks. It was cracked so we ended up removing it. (I now use a Govee water sensor next to the washer.) Part of my big plan for this space was to move those cabinets over to another wall in here, with drawer cabinets underneath. This was a great decision, it made the flow of the room work so much better.  That created space for the shelf above the washer and dryer. You can see how I built this shelf to hide the ugly stuff behind the washer and dryer at our old house: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "How to stain a fiberglass entry door in a rich wood color.  One of the most common questions I get is about the stain we used on our wood front door. Turns out our door isn't wood, but it is stained to look like it.  Did you know you can stain a fiberglass door and it will look just like wood? I didn't realize this until we built our current house. I had no idea you could use stain on anything but wood, and I've been at this DIY thing for a long time! We have a Therma Tru door set with sidelites (see specifics of our indoor and outdoor home finishes here) and picked the stain color called English Walnut.  Our front door doesn't get much of the elements because it's protected on our front porch. But even without the wind and rain hitting it directly, the dark stain was still super faded nearly eight years later.  I'm prepping for our son's high school graduation party, and this DIY project was on my list! The process wasn't nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. There are only a few simple steps in this application, they just take some time. The before photos of the door finish didn't look as horrible as in real life, but it was faded, worn out and chipping in some spots: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.
