    "description": "Midcentury Italian lighting designer Angelo Lelii created this Polifemo lamp in 1956. The unusual design features a stem interrupted by a sort of brass eyeball with a plastic diffuser. The eyeball illuminates and can be pivoted. The design is inspired by, and named for Polyphemus, the cyclops from Homer's Odyssey. (The shape of the top of the lamp is meant to reference a wine goblet; in the story, Ulysses got Polyphemus smashed on wine in order to escape from his lair.) The lamp was put into production by Lelii's company, Arredoluce, from the mid-'50s until at least the '60s. Today you can find them on vintage sites, but they're rare, sought-after and pricey.",

To install it, you simply place your bed's existing legs atop the pads. The company claims the rocking motion can help people, particularly those with insomnia, dementia, cerebral palsy and other neurological conditions, more easily fall asleep. Users can select between different modes like Rock, Shake, Random and Interval.These run $659. The company says their findings are science-backed, and they link to their sources here.",

    "description": "Quick fix for nicks or scratches in wood floors and furniture.If you have scratches in your cabinets, wood floors or furniture, this easy solution will make them disappear!These are especially helpful if you have animals that like to scratch your wood furniture. Cat scratches on wood or marks from dog claws on the floors will vanish with this trick. :) Sometimes I hesitate to share these more basic \"DIYs\" or fixes, but then I do them in our home and am reminded that they are super helpful. So I'm sharing! :) This is a quick repair for anything wood in your home that has minor damage -- anywhere where the top finish or stain has nicked off. I miss the gorgeous floors in our old house so much!: They are white oak, finished on site hardwoods and are gorgeous. (The stain color is Jacobean by Minwax.)And they have held up beautifully. You pay for that quality -- they are labor intensive to install, but so worth it! Compared to our current engineered flooring, those were pristine (and we lived with those for way longer).We find a new scratch or nick in our engineered hardwoods often. It's not too bad...usually we don't even notice them until we're cleaning. It's when I'm vacuuming and trying to pick up what I think is dirt that I see them: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Decorating ideas for an inspired Santa-themed entryway. I pulled together a fun Christmas Santa display for our foyer this year and absolutely love how it turned out!  In general, tabletop and bookcase decorating are the hardest for me to get right. I find it much easier to decorated smaller spots, especially for the holidays.  Usually I'm overwhelmed by all of the display space our long Everett entryway table has. Last year I just lined up our cute lighted village: And it was very pretty! But I wanted to do something a little more Christmasy this time.  This year I decided to place the DIY wood \"believe\" sign I made a few years ago on the bottom shelf.  Each letter is individual and I made them to stand up, so I spread them out along the bottom and then added some small decor accents like greenery and pinecones: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

So let’s dive right into the 3 categories that we cover each year: Gift Ideas for Grown-Ups Gift Ideas for Kids Gift Ideas Under $12.99 Every year that we make these, we love including actual things that we own and enjoy, as well as things that we’re buying for others (like our own kids, each other, and relatives/friends). Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it). Quick note: The “Under $12.99” list isn’t the only one with items priced that low – for example, there are also two gifts under $12.99 on the kids list.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
