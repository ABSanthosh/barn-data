    "description": "Harvest mice are Britain's tiniest rodent. They're not considered pests themselves, and in fact are actually seen as pest control; they prey on agricultural pests, saving farmers on pesticides. They also take their place in the food chain, supporting predators like hawks and owls, which supports overall biodiversity.The mice's habitats are increasingly being infringed upon by human development. In order to provide them a safe place to live, British conservation consortium The Wildlife Trusts provides readymade nests for them—by cutting holes in tennis balls donated by Wimbledon: The balls are attached to poles that are placed in field. The mice, talented climbers, readily populate them.Wimbledon goes through some 55,000 tennis balls with each competition, so unlike Britain's human denizens, the harvest mice will suffer no housing crisis.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137850/The-InfinityCrane-An-Omnidirectional-Ceiling-Crane-That-Can-Adapt-to-Irregular-Spaces",
    "description": "This InfinityCrane, by German logistics company CeiliX, is a revolutionary object-handling design for workshops, factories and warehouses. To allow workers to move heavy objects, facilities like these often use gantry cranes or bridge cranes. Those take up a lot of space, and are not suited for spaces interrupted by columns, nor irregularly-shaped rooms. The InfinityCrane, in contrast, is suited to any space because it does not ride along a dedicated track or beam. Instead, a modular system of ceiling rails is installed, adapting to whatever shape the room is.Along these rails rides a SkyRunner unit… …equipped with laterally-positioned rollers arranged in the manner of a tank tread: This allows it to move omnidirectionally:Fitted with a hoist, it can hold 250kg (551 lbs), which a worker can then effortlessly push through the air.If heavier capacity is required, multiple SkyRunners can pitch in. And because they can operate independently, they can do things bridge and gantry cranes can't, like rotate and reorient objects in space.The InfinityCrane is a new invention, having just hit the market this year. CeiliX says they're currently developing a heavier-duty SkyRunner than can handle 500kg.",

    "description": "There’s an almost country feel to Rebecca Monaghan and Richard Ennis’ home, owing to its location in the Champion Road Estate Heritage Precinct — a largely intact 1940s housing estate based on ‘garden city’ planning principles — in Williamstown North. After years living on a noisy Footscray corner, the couple were attracted to the area’s relaxed feel and wide nature strips, and the potential to optimise the house to suit their creative work and home lives. A renovation by Architecture Architecture has achieved all this and more, resulting in more light-filled and open internal spaces, and a shining example of appropriate heritage upgrades.",

    "description": "How to easily treat wood butcher block counters so they will resist moisture and last forever!Contrary to popular belief, wood countertops are not hard to take care of! If you treat them correctly up front, they will last for decades (even around a sink). One of the top five questions I get about our house (and our old one!) is about our butcher block countertops. We've had wood counters on our islands for around 15 years now. Thanks to my Dad I know the best way to treat them and keep them beautiful for years! I shared how to protect bare wood counters a few years ago, so check out that post to see more detail. I also share how I stained the butcher block in that post. This time I wanted to show you how well they have held up over the past eight years and share how I retreat them every year or so: It's really best to reapply this every six months or so...but as you'll see, it's not absolutely necessary. Ours have held up beautifully even after a year or more.  Overall, the whole island counter has lightened from use, and it was uniform. The only part that was slightly darker was under the tray that I use for hand and dish soap: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Nearly EVERYTHING is easily cleaned off of the wood counters. We've had water condensation sit for hours, water spills, wine, cat vomit 😖 -- all of it. If you treat them well like I'll show you, you won't have any issues keeping them clean.  The only thing that I haven't been able to remove is permanent marker:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build a wood burning stone fire pit on top of a concrete patio. There are a few safety issues to consider when building a DIY fire pit on a concrete surface. I'm sharing the how-to here!Years ago we had a large patio poured in our back yard. The best part was a 14 foot circular fire pit area we designed off to one side. I shared how this part of the patio looked the day of installation:  One big project I had to hold off on was the DIY fire pit. The concrete contractors advised we wait a bit because the stone for the pit is so heavy. The patio had to cure for a couple of weeks.  Before I started, we got a quote for a small stone retaining wall around the circular fire pit area as well as a fire pit with stone that matched our house. The quote came back at almost DOUBLE what the entire PATIO cost. Lordt.  Soooo we decided to do it ourselves with a kit and it was crazy easy. It doesn't look custom, but it does the job...burns wood. ;) Here's the kit we got from Menards:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
