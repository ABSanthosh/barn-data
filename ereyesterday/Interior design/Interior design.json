    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "When Brompton wanted to develop an onboard toolkit for their folding bicycles, they turned to British industrial design firm Goodwin Hartshorn. \"We took advantage of the bike's foldability to create a toolkit which fits inside the frame,\" the firm writes. \"This protects it from theft and from the elements.\" \"The kit includes all the tools necessary for most roadside repairs in a compact, lightweight unit. Perhaps the most innovative features of the kit are the space-saving double-ended driver bits and the unique tyre levers. These not only make removing tyres substantially easier, but also incorporate 10 and 12mm spanners. \"Brompton retails these for $100.",

    "description": "The Core77 Design Awards Visual Communication category features all visual and graphic design, branding and identity projects for print, digital or physical environments. Examples include logos and identity systems, environmental graphics, signage, typefaces, infographics, motion graphics, print design, advertising, etc.The Core77 Design Awards Branding Identity category features a visual design system, or elements of a system that communicate brand philosophy and values, visually and experientially – conveying a desired image of a product, company, or organization. Examples include logos, custom typefaces, color palettes, complete brand identity systems.For YanYan Zhang, design is deeply rooted in care – \"whether for the craft of or for the human problems they address.\" In her mind, when a project is approached with care, the purpose and thought behind that work shines through. From Core77 Design Awards entrants, she looks forward to seeing \"work where care has been applied no matter where one is in their career.\"Today, YanYan leads the Brand Design Group as an Associate Partner and Executive Creative Director at VSA Partners, where she has spent almost two decades delivering strategic brand-centered solutions for clients ranging from the financial, tech, and commodities sectors to local non-profits. She has led teams in developing brand experiences for clients including the CME Group, IBM, and Sappi. From brand building to brand management and evolution, YanYan works across traditional and digital mediums to deliver smart solutions that lead to meaningful impact.Reflecting on her design practice, YanYan is curious about the evolving role of AI in design, which not only affects the practice of design but also has significant impacts on the world. Says YanYan, \"It affects the authenticity and validity of information (visual and verbal), and since information can be communicated at such expedited speeds, so can miscommunication.\" More optimistically, she feels encouraged by the continued diversification of designers and the perspectives they bring.Play Design Lab won the 2024 Visual Communication category for Unboxing Daxi.The 2024 winner in the Core77 Design Awards Visual Communication category was Play Design Lab, which created a dynamic visual wall for the Unboxing Daxi exhibition at Taiwan's Daxi Wood Art Museum. The dynamic display was intended to encapsulate the essence of woodcraft, utilizing 3-D wooden materials and synchronized digital displays.Shuka won the Branding/Identity category for their packaging for Halsa.The 2024 winner in the Branding/Identity category was Shuka and its striking design for Halsa, a subscription service delivering customized vitamin sets.Our jurors want to know how much you care – about your work.
