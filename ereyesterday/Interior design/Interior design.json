The matte surface on top ensures usability, while the sides, through refraction, create an illusion where the internal legs seem to reflect outward, appearing projected onto the stool's outer walls.\" \"The structure consists of four solid blocks that are visible from within, yet from the outside, they dissolve into negative space.\"The Tralucid Stool is in (limited edition) production by Italian design platform Delvis Unlimited.",

    "description": "What industrial designers, architects and contractors have in common: They all do client work on projects that span months to years. Documenting the process is important, both for creative purposes and occasionally for legal cover-your-ass purposes. Having readily available proof of when certain milestones were achieved is important.With digital photographs, you can sift through metadata to find the date and time an image was shot. But wouldn't it be way more convenient if those stats were stamped right on the photo, the way disposable cameras used to do it?The developers of CamScanner, a productivity app, think so. They've introduced a Timestamp feature into their app that adds a tamper-proof (they claim) time and location stamp directly onto images as they're taken. \"For freelancers, digital nomads, and small teams, the Timestamp enables smoother, more transparent collaboration,\" they write. \"Professionals such as photographers and consultants can use the tool to document service hours with time-stamped images, which helps support fair and verifiable billing. At the same time, managers in industries like construction and nonprofit work can monitor remote progress through photo updates, saving time and reducing costs.\"It undoubtedly has a whiff of Big Brother, but I could see it being useful for keeping track of prototypes, site developments and the like.CamScanner isn't the only one in this game, of course. The following apps offer similar capabilities, offering date, time and GPS location watermarks on captured images:Timestamp Camera (Android)Timestamp Camera Basic (iOS)Smart GPS Camera Timestamp (Android)GPS Map Camera (Android, iOS) Happy documenting!

    "description": "Five ways to save money on plants and flowers this planting season.Gardening is one of my favorite pastimes, but also one of the most expensive! Over the years I've come up with quite a few ways to save on both annual and perennial plants this time of year. Sometimes I will still splurge on a plant or tree, but for the most part these methods will save me a TON on flowers, bushes and trees for our gardens and yard. I've planted or replanted a TON of plants this spring (most were small, individual flowers) and have loved watching them thrive. I gathered my top five ways to save on plants this spring and summer! 1. Pick spreading plantsI love our window boxes, but they can be expensive to fill every spring. I learned years ago that using flowers that spread will make my money go a lot further. My favorite has always been the Wave Petunias because they multiply like crazy and cascade out of boxes or containers: These are the only annual flowers I plant each year because they spread and fill in so beautifully. Annuals only last one season, perennials will come back year after year.For your landscaping, look for ground cover or flowers that spread, like this awesome sedum plant I showed you years ago:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to hang patio lights over your patio, deck or yard.The ultimate guide on how to hang outdoor patio lights and all of the products you'll need!There's nothing quite as charming as beautiful cafe lights draped over a deck or patio -- they add so much character and ambience to outdoor living spaces in the evening. Now that we've had them at two homes, these outdoor string lights are a staple for our outdoor spaces. There are a lot of things to consider if you're planning to install these exterior lights yourself. You'll need a few tools in order to hang them so that they withstand the elements. You'll also need to consider where you are hanging them from to ensure they will be sturdy over time. I've compiled all of the methods -- whether you have mature trees, a solid wood fence...or nothing at all in your backyard!This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. The best string lights that will last!I tried a few options when we first installed patio cafe lights at our first house years ago. I felt like Goldilocks -- some were too wimpy and the bulbs broke easily. A lot of them weren't nearly long enough for what we needed. The lights we ended up using are still going strong ten years later! They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too. We used them on our outdoor dining area under the wood pergola at that house:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Do you feel the freedom to make your house your own? Do you decorate in a way that makes you happy, brings you joy and reflects who you are? I know so many people tend to get \"stuck\" when it comes to making their own decorating decisions for their home. We might worry too much about what other people will think (especially for those of us who post our homes on social media, since we have Instagram telling us what people like or don't like). We sometimes worry too much about the impact our changes will have on a future sale, even if we are making good decisions and have no plans to move any time soon. We worry that we are making a design or budget mistake, even if our heart knows it's what would bring us more joy.",
