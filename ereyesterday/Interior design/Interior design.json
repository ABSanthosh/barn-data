    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "iFixit, the company dedicated to teaching people how to repair their own products, has plenty of engineering expertise. What they don't have is industrial design chops. When they wanted to create their own soldering iron system, they turned to ID consultancy Spanner to create a powerful unit that would be consistent with their brand. The resultant product is called the FixHub.iFixit FixHub At Spanner, we're passionate about collaborating with innovative companies to bring amazing products to life. That's why we were thrilled to partner with iFixit on the FixHub, a soldering iron that's more than just a tool – it's a portable powerhouse designed for the modern fixer. It reflects a commitment to empowering people to take charge of their repairs. The FixHub isn't your grandpa's soldering iron. It's a high-performance system that combines rapid heating, portability, and smart features to meet the exacting standards of today's repair warriors. This is the tool that makes soldering as mobile as your gadgets, letting you conquer fixes wherever you roam, from the field to your workbench. Spanner played a pivotal role in bringing the iFixit FixHub to lifeOur expert team was instrumental in devising, designing, and engineering this innovative, portable soldering iron. We worked closely with iFixit to ensure the FixHub aligned perfectly with their brand, delivering a product that was not only high-performing but also visually appealing and affordable. Our contributions to the FixHub included:- Strategic Design Direction: We helped define the overall product vision, ensuring that FixHub was a perfect fit for the iFixit brand and the needs of iFixit's customers. - Mechanical Engineering: Our engineers designed and refined the FixHub's mechanical layout and feature details, considering factors like manufacturability, assembly, cost, and, repairability (of course). - Industrial Design: We established the general design aesthetic for the FixHub with considerations for a broader product line, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing look. - UX Design: We played a key role in designing the seamless interaction between the soldering iron and the hub, including the innovative cap that doubles as a stand. Together with iFixit, we created a portable soldering station that empowers people to repair their devices with ease and efficiency. The FixHub's success is a testament to our collaborative approach and our commitment to delivering exceptional products. \"Like the soldering iron they helped design, the Spanner team was fast, responsive, and highly skilled. They quickly grasped our users' needs and delivered an intuitive, user-friendly design with impressive efficiency.\"— Brett Hartt, Chief Engineer, iFixit \"Working alongside the iFixit team to bring the FixHub to life was an incredibly rewarding experience. We were driven by the goal of creating a tool that would empower people to repair their devices with ease and efficiency. Spanner was proud to contribute our expertise in design, engineering, and manufacturing to ensure the FixHub met the highest standards of quality and performance. Enabling the positive impact that the FixHub will have on the repair community is truly inspiring.\"— Spanner Senior Product Designer, Alyssa KinoshitaYou can see more of Spanner's work here.",

Typically featuring an upholstered bench along a wall (replacing dining chairs on at least one side of a dining table), a banquette seating area suits small home and apartment dwellers, or those in larger houses seeking a second dining area for casual meals. It can also be a great way to sneak some extra storage into your home.

Also feels like a good moment to mention that nothing was sponsored/gifted to get into this guide. If something is on these lists, we just genuinely love it and think it would make a good gift (and in some cases, we already own it and truly like it).
