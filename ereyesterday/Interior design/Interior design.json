    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135528/Surprise-Theres-Still-a-Huge-Market-for-Ashtrays",
    "description": "If you do an online search for ashtrays, you'll be shocked at how many offerings are on the market. If you're American, you'll likely find this strange; only 11% of us smoke cigarettes. In the rest of the world, however, smoking rates remain startlingly high. A company called Provape combed through data from the World Health Organization to see which European countries have the highest rates of smoking: In first place is Belgium, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 33.9%. Belgium has implemented multiple anti-smoking measures, such as plain packaging for cigarettes, high tobacco taxes, and public smoking bans. Sweden takes second place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 33.8%. Cigarette packages in Sweden must carry health warnings and advertising has strict regulations in a bid to reduce smoking. Third place is claimed by Austria, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 31.3%. Smoking remains a large public health issue in Austria, with significant rates of tobacco-related diseases.Bulgaria is in fourth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 29.8%. Bulgaria is home to several large tobacco companies which have complicated efforts for a reduction in smoking. However, tobacco taxes have been implemented to reduce the proportion of adults who smoke. Taking fifth place is Finland, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 29.3%. Smoking has been banned in all enclosed public spaces,and Finland has high taxes on tobacco products. Denmark is in sixth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.8%. Denmark aims to be a tobacco-free country by 2030, with a goal of fewer than 5% of the population smoking tobacco products. To do this, they have invested in numerous public health campaigns, raising awareness about the dangers of smoking. In seventh place is Iceland, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.7%. Iceland's national Quitline service offers free advice and guidance for smokers trying to quit, and the country also offers smoking cessation programs that offer counselling and prescription medications. Italy takes eighth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.5%. Italy has banned all tobacco adverts on TV, radio, and print media, as well as implementing high taxes on all tobacco products to reduce smoking. Ninth place is claimed by Georgia, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 28.2%. With a long history of tobacco farming, efforts to reduce smoking in Georgia face challenges due to economic interests.Russia is in tenth place, with an estimated cigarette smoking prevalence of 24.8%. Smoking is heavily ingrained into Russian culture, but the government has launched campaigns to raise awareness about the dangers of smoking. Cigarettes are also required to have graphic health warnings on their packaging as a deterrent. Fairly shocking. Scandinavian countries routinely rank as the happiest in the world, and they dominate the top ten. The figures aren't much better in Asia. Japan is at 30.8%, China at 45.6%. South Korea is at 22.6%, but with a weird gender split: 39.7% of men smoke, but just 5.2% of women. You might think America is doing pretty good at just 11%. But the UK has us beat, at just 5.1%. The three countries with the lowest smoking rates are all in Africa: Ghana at 3.7%, Ethiopia at 4.6% and Nigeria at 4.8%.",

    "description": "How to fix furniture damage and painting mistakes.  Recently I painted our dining room buffet and had SO many issues during the process. I'm sharing how I fixed all of them along the way and ended up with a gorgeous result!  I know better by now...I've learned to never say to myself \"Wow! This project is going so well!\" -- because something inevitably happens right after I say it.  Definitely can't think it, and never say it out loud. 😂 I also know I should never, ever EVER tell myself that a DIY project won't take long. I've done it a million times...this will be so easy! This won't take long at all! I've done this 800 million times, what could go wrong?  I know these things, and yet this is what I did.  Here's the culprit...the wood sideboard I purchased for our dining room a few months after we moved in:  A friend of mine owned a beautiful home decor shop, and I found it there about seven years ago. I was SO in love with it, especially the cane doors.  It fit in beautifully with the \"nod\" to farmhouse style that I had going throughout our house. It's also just a really useful piece -- I store a ton of serving dishes inside.  Later I built a wall of bookcases and a window seat at the end of this room and painted the main wall a dark blue with pretty picture frame molding.  Last year I switched gears completely and painted the whole room in a warm and lovely color called Pachyderm:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
