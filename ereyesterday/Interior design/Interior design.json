    "description": "The UK's Wine Society, a member-owned community of oenophiles, has contracted some unusual packaging for some of their wines: Flat-shaped plastic bottles, made from recycled ocean plastic, and recyclable themselves. After conducting a study, the group has concluded that using this recycled PET, and in this shape, is more sustainable than using glass.\"Our packaging report showed that rPET bottles have a significantly lower carbon footprint than single-use glass bottles; they're less energy-intensive to make, smaller and less breakable than glass so can be packed more tightly, and of course significantly lighter (63g compared to an average of 453g for glass bottles).\"Furthermore, they say the plastic is inert and doesn't affect the flavor, though they do recommend it only for wines with a one-year-or-less shelf life.",

    "description": "Texas-based Massimo Modular offers this stunning, futuristic take on the prefabricated home.Their Model E9 is trucked to site, where you need to have laid the foundation in advance and prepared for utilities, then craned onto the foundation. It's been designed with anchor points in the bottom to connect it to the foundation (should your municipality require it). You'd then have a general contractor connect the water, electrical and sewage or septic lines. The structure is 37.7' long, 10.8' wide and 10.5' tall. It's got an underfloor heating system, wiring, plumbing, and HVAC already built in. The electrical requirements are 150-amp 220V dual-phase, and the company says you'd be able to run the refrigerator, stove, washer, dryer, HVAC and heated floor all at the same time. The asking price (not including delivery/installation) is about $100,000. The company reckons it takes just two hours to \"install\" one of these. Meanwhile, the lifespan of the structure is estimated to be 70 years.Lastly, as seen above they're currently setting up \"Modular Communities\" in Las Vegas; Malibu, California; and three locations in Texas. A further two are planned for Florida and Louisiana.",

    "description": "How to make these easy and fun floating witch hats for your front porch or inside! I've wanted to make these cute DIY \"floating\" luminary witch hats for our porch for years! They turned out to be a really easy way to add some cute Halloween decorations to our front porch, but you could hang them anywhere for easy decor. I tried a couple methods of creating these hanging hats with two lighting options, and I'll share both here. Both are very simple, but one is so simple it only take a couple minutes to create each witch hat luminary.  I started with these inexpensive black witch hats:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This witch hat set came with 12 hats and a bunch of cute plastic bat cutouts as well. (This set has six hats if you don't need as many.)  My first tutorial uses LED votives that operate on a timer -- once you turn them on, they'll run for a certain amount of time. So turn them on in the evening and they'll operate every evening after. I used fishing line for this project because you want the hats to look as though they're floating around on your porch. :) If you don't have that on hand, dental floss works as well. (These don't weigh much!)  How to make your witch hats glow I tied the line around the \"flame\" of the votives: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "How to build long wood DIY picture ledges in minutes. These wood picture ledge shelves can be customized to the length and width you need and are a great way to display art and photographs!If you do a lot of DIYing, you may have enough scrap wood on hand to make these. If not, they can be made affordably with basic pine from the hardware store. When we moved into this house, I knew immediately I wanted to do something fun on our staircase walls. This project in particular was on the wall under the stairs: It needed something -- and I imagined some simple display shelves with photos along this wall. First I stuck some painter's tape to the wall to figure out the sizes of each one and get an idea of how it would look. I built three, four and five foot shelves. I wanted to go down low on the wall as much as possible because it just felt right visually to me. These shelves only come out about four inches from the wall. To build these you'll need three pieces of wood -- one 1x2 for the front, one 1x3 for the base, and one 1x4 for the back, all cut to the length you want. You can also make the shelf with a 1x4 on the bottom so it would be a bit deeper. I found the three inch to be fine but if you plan on leaning a bunch of frames I'd go with the four inch. You can see what I mean here:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

A friend of mine recently had a baby girl and it was fun to talk about all the names they were considering for her. And since I already shared a list of 100 classic boy names, I also loved compiling this list of my favorite classic old-fashioned baby girl names.
