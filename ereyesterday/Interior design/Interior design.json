    "description": "Local transportation remains a challenge for many African regions, which are beset by high fuel costs, low incomes and punishing road conditions. German company AfricroozE aims to solve these challenges with their eponymous e-bike, designed specifically for the African market. The robust bikes were designed to be cheap to produce, using affordable steel and commonly-available components. To weather African road conditions, the bikes are kitted out with thick spokes and fat, puncture-proof tires. With a 350W motor, the single-battery Commuter model has a max payload of 90kg (198.4 lbs), a range of 40 - 60km (25 – 37 miles) and a top speed of 30 km/h (18.6 mph). A more powerful dual-battery Allrounder model boasts a 500W motor, yielding a maximum payload capacity of 150kg (330.7 lbs) and a range of 75 - 100 km (47 – 62 miles). To make it easier (and greener) for riders to power the batteries, AfricroozE has set up a network of solar-powered charging stations across Uganda, Zambia, Kenya, Togo and Benin. They've also trained local mechanics in those regions both to repair the bikes and operate the charging stations, creating local jobs.The bikes start at €600 (USD $682) and the company has created a microcredit system to help buyers finance the bikes. In contrast, a motorcycle can cost more than $10,000, and bring additional costs with both fuel and maintenance.This video tells the development story of the bikes, and shows the impact they're having:",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136511/This-Inside-Out-Fruit-Bowl-Keeps-Fruits-Fresh-Longer",
    "description": "In the U.S., approximately 30-40% of the food supply is wasted. This translates to about 133 billion pounds of food each year, with fruits and vegetables accounting for around 40% of that waste. The phrase \"One bad apple spoils the whole bunch\" literally refers to the fact that a single rotting apple can quickly contaminate other apples in a group. This is not due to any morally bankrupt behavior on the part of the apples, but rather that rotting apples produce ethylene gas, which hastens the ripening and decay of nearby apples. Storing fruits in a bowl can trap ethylene gas, which can lead to over ripening and spoiling of a whole bowl of fruit. Designer Agota Jonas wanted to create a better fruit bowl, to try to solve this problem. She literally turned the bowl inside out, and created the Fruitbridge. Most fruits are round, and like trees, the Fruitbridge gently holds them with minimum contact, keeping fruit apart from each other and allowing air to circulate freely.These fruit stands are made of food-grade stainless steel, using low-energy fabricating methods: laser cutting, cold rolling, and hand finishing. Material is not wasted. Leftover pieces are reused for other small products such as tealight holders and keychains.Sold in variations holding two or three rows of fruit, the Fruitbridge is avaialble directly from the Lucky Round Avocado website.",

I've gathered a few of my favorite ideas on how to incorporate a TV into the design of your house, and even help it to disappear a little bit!1.

    "description": "Beautiful DIY ways to display mementos and keepsakes around your home. Framing photos or filling photo albums isn't the only way to display memorabilia -- these are simple ways  honor your special memories and create some fun conversation starters as well! It's been a sentimental few months for our family! Our son is graduating high school in a soon and we're experiencing a lot of \"lasts\" with him lately. (I know many firsts are to come too, it is very bittersweet!)And as I shared in my last post, we recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog of 14 years, Peanut. Needless to say, I've been a bit emotional. 💙Early this year I started decluttering like crazy -- it's been years since I've purged our home like that. This process included sorting through a lot of old bins and paperwork that have been stored away. During that decrapification I found so many items with such wonderful memories attached to them, and I was determined to figure out ways to display them in our home.I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me to see so many of these throughout my day!Most of these ideas are easy to complete and don't cost much at all. A lot of our keepsakes are small -- I've struggled with adding them around the house because they look cluttered instead of cherished items. I've found that grouping them together makes them look more purposeful (and pretty!).When we moved years ago, I packed away a baggie of these matchbooks from our travels. I was so excited to find them again!:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   This one was easy -- I just placed them in a decorative bowl by a candle. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through them in the past few months, reminiscing about the exact dinner or travel that corresponds to each one. Here are some more ways to display matchbook covers: Attach them to the back of a shadowbox frame to create artwork. Hot glue magnets to the back for a fun way to display them (this would work best with match boxes).Have an artist make custom artwork with your match covers -- this would be perfect if you don't have the physical book but can find examples online. I love the custom artwork idea, probably because we have something similar that a friend made for us: When my husband retired from teaching (he was a band director), a close friend had this beautiful art made with every school musical he had conducted over the years. It's one of our most treasured pieces and I think it would be a brilliant idea for a student who's involved in theater or the arts. You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts. What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself. During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
