    "description": "Two pandemic-inspired trends that have lasted through 2024: Somewhat paradoxically, people are spending more time at home, as well as spending a lot of time outdoors. Here are the innovations we saw this year aimed at both of those environments.To meet a German client's needs, Polish architecture firm KWK Promes developed this privacy fencing that appears at the push of a button.In Austria, Germany, Italy and Switzerland, these roller shutters are common. They resemble the rolldown gates urban American stores used to protect their businesses, but here the application is domestic, allowing homeowners to black out a room in seconds. In a village in Canada, residents are used to visiting bears destroying their privacy fences. Some neighborhood kids devised this outside-of-the-box solution.This homeowner hacked a way for his robot dog to help him out with yardwork.Worried about your tissue box blowing away in a strong breeze? Japanese design firm Form Design Studio created this tissue box made out of iron. Canadian firm Bateman Labs has a new take on work-from-home and gaming set-ups. They've devised a new furniture category: Modular armchair-based workstations and gaming stations. Tracing paper patterns onto fabric is time-consuming. This hi-tech Ditto system projects the patterns directly onto your fabric. In an effort to combat clutter, industrial design firm Kritzer came up with this unusual U-shaped power strip. No room for a laundry rack? Singaporean company Good Living offers this hi-tech automatic ceiling-mounted retractable laundry rack. Running out of space in the kitchen? Japanese company Yamazaki offers this add-on kitchen drawer and worksurface. A company called Rinseroo has harnessed the properties of thermoplastic rubber to create this Slip-On Tub Hose. U.S. Gymnastics coped with this year's sweltering Olympic Village by bringing in BedJets, which are in-bed air conditioning systems. Chinese company Xiaomi designed a draft-free air conditioner that exploits cool air's tendency to sink. If you're DIY'ing your house's interior, Trusscore is a user-friendly sheetrock alternative. Moving outside the house, the Bola Grill Master is a low-tech design for a barbecue grill with height-adjustable cooking surfaces. A similar take, with a different execution: The Takibi Stand, a space-saving Japanese alternative to the barbecue grill. Also from Japan comes this Square Kettle, which the manufacturer says boils water faster. Meant to cope with uneven ground, this camping table from Ruck \u0026 River only has one leg. For those who prefer four legs, French company Fixmotion's self-stabilizing outdoor tables get rid of wobble on uneven surfaces.Veteran tent designer Jake Lah created this Cot Tent for Helinox. No more sleeping on that cold, hard ground. Gear Aid's Heroclip is a carabiner with a swing-out hook and a pivot. Australian industrial design firm Tricycle re-thinks the design of the overlanding water tank with their G-Series. And finally, Gnara's GoFly zipper design makes it easy for women to pee outdoors.",

    "description": "For every schlocky consumerist invention spammed into our inboxes this year, we did see some true innovations. Objects and systems intended to improve society and businesses, created by clever designers, engineers and inventors. Here's what jumped out at us in 2024:Vertical farm pioneer Plenty says \"We can grow an entire soccer field worth of produce in the size of a goal.\" For pop-up event spaces and exhibitions, this Expandable Touchdown Trailer can move its own wheels out of the way, then lower itself to the ground. Pipe Lighting's inflatable, lightweight LED lights provide better UX for production crews. This CruiseUp, a new type of flying vehicle, uses innovative \"CycloRotors\" to move the vehicle in all directions. The Aerocart is a goose-inspired towed cargo glider that aims to slash shipping costs. This PlugVan system offers modular, hot-swappable van interiors for camping and work. Maxim de Jong, a pioneer of \"soft system space architecture,\" designed this revolutionary inflatable space station. It's a more economical way to get a space habitat into orbit.Design researcher Sasha McKinlay, of MIT's Self-Assembly Lab, has developed a revolutionary clothes production method using an industrial knitting machine and a heat-blasting robotic arm. UK company RapidRoot has developed a lightweight, concrete-free building foundation system that allows for building in remote locations. Japanese researchers have developed a flying fire hose that can reach through windows. In Washington State, a frustrated DOT official worked out a way to use drones to erase difficult-to-reach graffiti. Bounce Imaging created a throwable panoramic thermal camera and two-way speaker for the military and police. It provides better tactical awareness and aids with hostage negotiations. The Spacetop, now coming to market, is a no-screen laptop. AR glasses provide the screens. Swiss company Zippsafe has designed a space-saving locker room that utilizes textile lockers. This brilliant hardhat design blows an air curtain in front of your face, serving as a safe and less cumbersome alternative to wearing facemasks.These cleverly-designed anti-flooding barriers by AquaFence keep structures safe during hurricanes. The Spider X1S is a large-format laser cutter with a compact form factor.Airback's backpacks and luggage can shrink their contents with a vacuum, allowing you to carry 50% more stuff. Former architect Hoxxoh, now a mural artist, hacks sprinklers to spray paint.",

One of my favorite inexpensive ways to add some festive holiday touches around the house is with printable art. I replace random framed art here and there with pretty Christmas prints.  It's SO easy to either print these at home, or send off to a quick printing service like CVS or Walgreens. I usually use smaller sizes like 8x10 and below, but you can have larger sized printed and shipped to you in a few days.  I've shared a ton of FREE Christmas printables that you can download and print at home for next to nothing.  Today I've rounded up twelve moodier prints for the season that give such a cozy vibe, I love them all! All of these are under $5 (at the time of this post).  If you saw my Santa-themed foyer last week, you saw the beautiful Santa art I used there:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiqgR6aOhYkqJOPvCvmzcJR1MoK05_T76bTBz_MrYPxN0i9l8mgExy6igBDumcIANvr4w3fS4LhU0XXxeW1c_HipeWpWT7MPZmw6tSsv4JA9v8pXxt1Wcqmgze_xab3reXyNs33P-R6afoVr-xjOZvplkRH3BpW0WmDD5ygCmsp5HoS9pEnjV1c_4nAnZQ/s16000/Santa%20themed%20display.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.

Cat scratches on wood or marks from dog claws on the floors will vanish with this trick. :) Sometimes I hesitate to share these more basic \"DIYs\" or fixes, but then I do them in our home and am reminded that they are super helpful. So I'm sharing! :) This is a quick repair for anything wood in your home that has minor damage -- anywhere where the top finish or stain has nicked off. I miss the gorgeous floors in our old house so much!: They are white oak, finished on site hardwoods and are gorgeous. (The stain color is Jacobean by Minwax.)And they have held up beautifully. You pay for that quality -- they are labor intensive to install, but so worth it! Compared to our current engineered flooring, those were pristine (and we lived with those for way longer).We find a new scratch or nick in our engineered hardwoods often. It's not too bad...usually we don't even notice them until we're cleaning. It's when I'm vacuuming and trying to pick up what I think is dirt that I see them: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it.
