He subsequently developed this Pulli Bin, which features a front that opens:The doors contain a locking mechanism; opening the lid all of the way unlocks them, allowing you to pull the bag out of the front. There's a removable drip tray at the bottom, and the inventor says the doors also make the can easier to clean inside. The Pulli Can is headed for production, but no price or release date has been announced.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135186/Smart-Design-for-a-Garage-Door-Track-That-Offers-a-Better-Seal",
    "description": "There's an automotive design feature that came out in the '90s, called \"window indexing\" or \"automatic window drop.\" It was applied to German cars with frameless doors; I remember seeing it in a BMW. The idea is that once you close the door, the window automatically scooches up a few millimeters, tightening its seal within a channel in the roof. When you open the door, the window automatically drops out of the channel.Intriguingly, a similar idea, with a much less hi-tech execution, has been applied to garage doors by a company called ThermoTraks. Garage doors are typically the leakiest part of the house, leaving gaps around the edges that air can flow through. ThermoTraks has designed a system to counter this. It consists of a sealing kit that goes around the full perimeter of your garage door, and a special door track, which is the BMW-like part. At first glance, the tracks look like they've been damaged in shipment: In fact, the company has purposefuly kinked the rails at the points where the wheels rest in the track in the door-closed position. This forces the door outwards, mushing its edges into the flexible seals for a draft-free experience. It's a smart, low-tech way to prevent heat from escaping your house through the garage.",

    "description": "How to make DIY sliding shoe cubbies for the mud room!These sliding shoe storage boxes were an easy fix for one of our problem areas!We have a great bench in our mud room/laundry combo with a ton of space, but it was lacking a spot for us to toss shoes on the way in the door. It was a spot that bugged me since we moved in: I started some mud room updates last year and added the shiplap wall, no sew cushion and long pillow. It made a huge difference in here and I LOVE this half of the room! The only part that bugged me were the baskets underneath the bench. I used what we had when we moved in, but they drove me absolutely crazy. They shed everywhere and didn't hold their shape. I knew I'd build something eventually to replace them. It's pretty complex though...get ready for this super elaborate DIY.  I built...a BOX:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   Ha! Well, two boxes. You'll notice I used inexpensive, low quality plywood for most of this build -- because it holds shoes. Dirty shoes. I don't need the inside to be pretty. :) Once you get the measurements figured out, building one is super easy. It's figuring out the exact dimensions that takes the longest.  I had my wood cut down at Lowe's and that made this go super quick. My shoe boxes are 14 inches tall and 20 inches wide, but of course if you try this out you'll want to make them to fit your space.  I didn't use jigs or anything -- just nailed it together with my nail gun and it's super sturdy. I laid the bottom piece on the ground, then surrounded it with the sides. (You can see how I constructed it if you look at that pic above.)I made the front and back pieces wider (20 inches) so they cover up the rough edges on the front.  I used a nicer, paint grade plywood for the front panels so it would paint up nicely. After a few coats I put them in place and realized they definitely needed a little something:  They were functional but super boring. :)  My thin lattice trim molding to the rescue! I painted some scrap that I had in the garage and did a simple frame around the front. Be sure to check out all the ways I've used that lattice trim over the years!  After that I added a long, heavy duty handle to the front of each shoe box...and they were done!:  I wanted them to look as built in as possible, so instead of wheels I put a few large felt pads on the bottom:  They slide in and out super easy because our tile is so smooth. (I tested that out before building them -- if you use wheels remember you'll have to adjust the height of your boxes!) At first I was worried they wouldn't hold as many shoes, because we could stuff so much in the baskets. Turns out these are HUGE and hold plenty!:  No, I didn't paint the inside. We're the only ones that will see in there. Pick your battles my friends! :) They turned out even better than I had envisioned! And they are SO super functional, I'm so happy to have those baskets out of here!:  The handles actually work great, because nine times out of ten I'm using my feet to pull them open and closed. 😂 If you would do the same, make sure to get long hardware for the front.  SO. much. cleaner. Achieving both form and function always makes me happy!: They only took me a few hours total -- I wish I would tackled this way sooner. These would also be a great option for under the bed storage! Just use carpet sliders underneath instead of the felt. :) Here are more details about this room if you're interested: no sew bench cushion long lumbar pillow fabric -- Joann's DIY shiplap wall wood framed mirror  cubby canvas bins -- Hobby Lobby  black and brass sconces long black hardware -- Lowe's   Check out this huge laundry/mud room makeover here!: See more of our home and shop items in each room here.Never miss a post by signing up to get posts via email.   This content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "You don't need to stain or paint worn out furniture to give it new life! Sometimes you don't want to do ALL the work on old or distressed furniture...sanding and then staining or painting it can take quite a bit of time and effort.  If you have an old piece of furniture that needs some love, these tips will refresh your piece with way less work!  First, the reason for this makeover. For years now, we've had the Everett table in our entryway:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I shared all the ways I've decorated that World Market table over the years -- the open design and two surfaces can be challenging to style without looking too busy.  This table is great for a foyer or behind a sofa -- it's loooong and skinny, so doesn't take up valuable walking space:  I added the cute labeled drawer pulls to the front when I bought it. It's a nice little custom detail.  I've always loved this table, but for the past year or two I've been wanting to transition some of the farmhouse-style pieces we have in the house. I never went all in on the farmhouse style, but I definitely dabbled in it! :) For a few weeks I searched Facebook Marketplace for a dresser or credenza that would work in this spot, but I didn't find the perfect piece.  I was sitting and thinking one day (as one does), and started considering the dressers we already have in the house. That's when I realized the vintage dresser in our son's room would be perfect!: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
