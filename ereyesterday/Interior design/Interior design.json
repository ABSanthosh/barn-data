    "description": "This folding Z-Down chair is by 20th-century Danish furniture designer Erik Magnussen. Magnussen ingeniously figured out how to create the form using just two pieces of bent tubing and two connectors, with the leather seat and backrest slung between them. It is the leather that holds the chair together; sitting in puts the leather in tension and creates a bit of springiness, as you can see in the video below. Shortly after its design in 1968, the chair went into production by Danish manufacturer Torben Ørskov. It continued to sell throughout the 1970s before eventually being discontinued. Today they fetch a pretty penny on secondhand sites.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136404/1980s-Design-Commentary-Ron-Arads-Concrete-Stereo",
    "description": "This Concrete Stereo system was designed by Ron Arad in the 20th century. It consists of a turntable, an amp and two tower speakers.Had it been designed in 1993, it would've been seen as an ironic commentary on the fate of the vinyl LP; dominant throughout the century as the central distribution method for in-home audio, its demise was widely predicted in the '90s as the CD grew in popularity.However, Arad designed this in 1983, which might be puzzling to some. In 1983 vinyl was still hot and everyone owned a record player; indeed they were shiny status symbols. Arad's take was likely a reaction to their sleek, magic-box aesthetic. Additionally, the early 1980s were a bad time for the UK and London, where Arad was based. The country was in the throes of both recession and deindustrialization, still trying to claw their way out of the 1970s. \"Part of the attraction of coming to London in the 1970s was seeing part-demolished buildings,\" Arad said, years later. \"You could still see bomb sites and re-developments with half-flattened houses revealing old wallpaper and fireplaces stacked one about the other.\" The crumbling infrastructure made its way from the outside world into Arad's mind and eventually the stereo. Just ten were made and yes, they actually worked. Christie's auctioned one off in 2019 for the princely sum of £47,500 (USD $60,710). Five are in the wild and the other five are in museums: The SF MoMA, the Vitra Design Museum, the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen in Rotterdam, the Röhsska Museum in Gothenburg and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.",

    "description": "Beautiful DIY ways to display mementos and keepsakes around your home. Framing photos or filling photo albums isn't the only way to display memorabilia -- these are simple ways  honor your special memories and create some fun conversation starters as well! It's been a sentimental few months for our family! Our son is graduating high school in a soon and we're experiencing a lot of \"lasts\" with him lately. (I know many firsts are to come too, it is very bittersweet!)And as I shared in my last post, we recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog of 14 years, Peanut. Needless to say, I've been a bit emotional. 💙Early this year I started decluttering like crazy -- it's been years since I've purged our home like that. This process included sorting through a lot of old bins and paperwork that have been stored away. During that decrapification I found so many items with such wonderful memories attached to them, and I was determined to figure out ways to display them in our home.I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me to see so many of these throughout my day!Most of these ideas are easy to complete and don't cost much at all. A lot of our keepsakes are small -- I've struggled with adding them around the house because they look cluttered instead of cherished items. I've found that grouping them together makes them look more purposeful (and pretty!).When we moved years ago, I packed away a baggie of these matchbooks from our travels. I was so excited to find them again!:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   This one was easy -- I just placed them in a decorative bowl by a candle. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through them in the past few months, reminiscing about the exact dinner or travel that corresponds to each one. Here are some more ways to display matchbook covers: Attach them to the back of a shadowbox frame to create artwork. Hot glue magnets to the back for a fun way to display them (this would work best with match boxes).Have an artist make custom artwork with your match covers -- this would be perfect if you don't have the physical book but can find examples online. I love the custom artwork idea, probably because we have something similar that a friend made for us: When my husband retired from teaching (he was a band director), a close friend had this beautiful art made with every school musical he had conducted over the years. It's one of our most treasured pieces and I think it would be a brilliant idea for a student who's involved in theater or the arts. You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts. What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself. During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Fresh and flavorful salad recipe with crunchy ramen noodles. I had the most delicious salad last week and immediately asked for the recipe from my friend. It's crunchy and sweet and has...ramen noodles! Weird, right? Hang in there, I promise it's so good!! As I age I find I like more foods. Do you find the same? I don't know if my tastes have matured over time, or that I'm just trying more foods than I used to. Up till a few years ago I didn't even like avocado -- now I could eat it with a spoon.  I actually avoided this salad at first because I didn't like most of the ingredients. Everyone raved about it though, so I had to give it a try. It was all over then...I hoarded the rest of it for myself and couldn't get enough. :) So I knew I had to share it with you! After some searching I realized this is a very popular recipe, but can vary quite a bit. It's a perfect dish for picnics or get togethers, especially in the warmer months.  This ramen salad is cold and crunchy and full of flavor: It's very quick and easy to put together! As usual, I have some edits and thoughts on the ingredients, so stay tuned.  Here's the list of ingredients: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
