    "description": "Everyone knows what a car seat for children is. But this little-seen safety object is for the expecting parent before the car seat is needed. \"INSAFE Seat-Belt Guide redirects the lap belt away from the belly of a pregnant woman. It eliminates the danger of putting too much pressure on the belly in the case of sudden braking or traffic accident. Using the INSAFE adapter reduces the risk of the unborn child's injury in the case of a car accident.\" \"INSAFE prevents the belt's tendency of sliding up, to the middle part of the abdomen and further to the chest, therefore, it prevents a dangerous phenomenon of so-called 'diving' during a collision, which is slipping underneath the lap belt.\" \"While using the adapter, the seat belt does not press the belly and it is not necessary to adjust it repeatedly, which provides the expectant mother with comfortable driving. The adapter is recommended from 2-3 months of pregnancy or if it is noticeable until the end of pregnancy.\"These run €32.50 (USD $35) in Europe. The only U.S. retailer I could find is asking for a whopping $125!",

    "description": "Despite the name, Swiss company Model Group makes paper, not models. (It's a family-run business, and Model is their last name.) For several years, the company has been experimenting with creating injection molded products derived from paper.They've developed what they call Paper-Pearls, which are like nurdles but derived from wood fibers used in the papermaking process—including fibers too short for paper production, which would otherwise go to waste. These Paper-Pearls are combined with bioplastics, and injection-molded by German manufacturer Arburg's machines. \"It can be used with conventional injection moulding machines and tools,\" the company writes, \"so that [changing over] is as easy as possible.\"As for why they're doing this:\"While traditional plastic is laboriously extracted from petroleum, paper fibers are the basis of our Paper-Pearls – a much cheaper raw material.\"Here are some sample items they've successfully molded using Paper-Pearls:Checker Pieces Handle Pin Ashtray (SMH)Furniture Assembly Aids Letter Opener Business-Card-Sized Box Development is ongoing. The company's ultimate goal is for items molded with Paper-Pearls to become recyclable \"in the paper cycle,\" as opposed to in the plastic cycle. But they're not there yet.",

    "description": "How to spray paint cabinet hardware and get a perfect finish! You can give your kitchen or bathroom cabinets a new look by spray painting your knobs and pulls instead of replacing them.I love any project involving one of my very favorite DIY \"tools\" ever -- spray paint!I've blabbed on and on about my love of spray paint for years now. It's one of the easiest and least expensive ways to completely transform an item or room.  This transformation was in the kitchen and I'm really happy with how it turned out. I've added an update on this hardware and how it held up at the end of this post! When I was picking out the finishes for this house, I went much \"softer\" and lighter than I had in the past.  It felt right at the time, as we were starting fresh. But I quickly discovered that I am a contrast lover through and through. Almost immediately I was craving it. I started painting walls super dark, hung dark wallpaper and changed out some lighting for bigger and bolder options.  This project involved our kitchen handles:  I picked a lovely brass handle that looks GREAT. I loved the handles and the color was gorgeous! But they didn't feel substantial enough -- it was something I noticed every time I walked into the kitchen. I bought a set of black handles just to see if I liked them:  We loved them! But it would have been kind of spendy to replace all of the hardware. And ours are really nice, I just wanted to change the color.  So...spray paint to the rescue!I've spray painted bathroom and kitchen handles in the past and it's a really easy DIY project. Spray paint is a GREAT way to ease into do-it-yourself projects. For this one I used the Krylon Fusion All-in-one spray paint to paint our hardware:      I wanted a slightly more modern feel so I went with the satin black. It leans towards a matte finish but is not dull at all.  The easiest way to spray paint cabinet hardware. Spraying hardware can be tricky because you need to get all the angles. Sometimes it's difficult to access it all. My friend Lindsay shared this brilliant tip for spraying pulls and knobs:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "A tour of our FUN and playful basement Halloween decor. I decorate our main living areas for fall every year (fall decor tour coming soon!), but the outside of our house and basement family room is where I have FUN with Halloween decor. I started going all in on the Halloween down in the basement a few years when one of my sisters and I started a Hocus Pocus movie night tradition with our kids. Her kids are younger so I go crazy with Halloween decorating. Nothing too spooky, and nothing is perfectly styled just so. We did our movie night last week and I thought it would be fun to share how I decorate this space for the month of October. I finished building our kitchenette (from the ground up!) earlier this year, and it's been fun to add some seasonal items down there. Most items in this space are from HomeGoods over the years. The large ceramic ghost was a Michael's find earlier this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. He's paintable but I left him as is for now.
