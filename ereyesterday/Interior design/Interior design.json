    "description": "This Multi Auto Spray product is by Japanese industrial design consultancy Lont. The product consists of just the gun. Because all Japanese 500mL bottles (roughly equivalent to our 16-oz bottles in the 'States) have standardized cap threading, the Multi Auto Spray can use any 500mL bottle as its vessel.The product is designed for gardening, cleaning and even dogwalking (for spraying dog mess off of the sidewalk). It comes with a carabiner that loops through the leather strap up top, so it can be hung from a belt. It's powered by an internal USB-rechargeable battery. You rotate the nozzle to either jet or mist, and you spray it by pressing the large button on the back. It can empty roughly 25 500mL bottles on a single charge. The Multi Auto Spray is in production by Japanese gadget company Belle Leaf and retails for ¥7,000 (USD $47).",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136065/Japans-Swap-Reefer-Trucks-with-Freestanding-Detachable-Cargo-Containers",
    "description": "If you hear the term \"Reefer Truck,\" you might think it has something to do with weed. But that's the colloquial term used in Japan for refrigerated (\"reefer\") cargo trucks.Vehicle manufacturer Nippon Trex Co. learned of a problem faced by their clients in the cold-chain cargo business: Not enough drivers, not enough trucks. They thus designed this Swap Reefer truck, which features a long cargo-carrying chassis and has a special trailer that can be detached and stands on its own legs. This has several advantages. Typically, a reefer truck driver shows up to the loading point. The cold cargo, which might be perishables or pharmaceuticals, is loaded as the driver waits. During the loading process, the temperature of the refrigerated cargo cabin naturally drops. Once everything's loaded and the container is sealed again, the driver must wait for the cargo cabin to work its way back down to temperature before they can leave.Once they get to the destination, the driver must of course wait for the truck to be unloaded.The Swap Reefer is a far better system. The cargo container is loaded and set to temperature beforehand, so all the driver does is show up, then attach it. At the destination, they detach the trailer and don't need to wait for the unloading; instead they can take off to do another job. Furthermore, if it's a long haul, the cargo container can be carried there by multiple short-haul drivers, relay-style.I've cued up the video below so you can see how the trailers are detached. It looks pretty straightforward:I'm glad they solved the problem using a physical solution and human drivers, rather than focusing on autonomous trucks.",

    "description": "A decorative, DIY way to hide TV electronics and components in style. While I was designing our HUGE entertainment center project in our basement, I wanted to make sure we could hide the cable box and stereo system receiver out of the way. I didn't want to look at them every day, but we needed to be able to access them easily of course.  Thankfully there's an easy way to do that if you are stashing these electronics inside a cabinet or console. I've shared how to add metal sheeting to cabinet doors before, (you can see the fireplace makeover at our old house there) but this time it was even simpler. I figured I'd share how I did it.  Why add metal sheeting you ask? Well when you hide electronic components hidden away, it's best to give them some air flow. Otherwise they run hot and that will shorten the life of the components. Also, your remotes won't work through a wood cabinet door, but will through metal sheeting.**You can also use an RF remote control system that allows you to keep your TV electronics in another room -- I'll add a link to that at the end of the post. We didn't want to use that because we use the voice controls often.  Here's a reminder of how this project ended up:  This is one of my favorite projects I've ever tackled!     I cut the back out of two of the bottom bench cabinets in preparation for the electronics to be added later. We knew we'd have a receiver down there at the very least, and I wanted to allow for more air flow and access from the backs of the cabinets.  A few weeks ago we had the first part of our sound system installed, and every time we turned on the TV we had to open the cabinet to get the remote to work. Then a cat or two would crawl back there...so I knew it was time to get those door fronts replaced.  I removed the cabinet doors from the hinges and used a large drill bit to make holes in the four corners of the front panel. This gives you a spot to insert your jigsaw blade:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. This is where I did things a little differently than last time -- I sawed right up to the edge of the center panel against the cabinet frame. This takes a little bit more of a steady hand but it doesn't have to be perfect! I had plenty of spots that weren't perfectly flush: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "EASY and inexpensive ways to clean gunk out of a drain There are two simple and very effective ways to clean to clear gunk and hair out of your drains without using harsh chemicals. And with one method you'll have everything you need in your kitchen.  One of these drain clearing methods works better in the kitchen on built up foods and fats, and the other works well in bathroom sinks and showers where the clog culprit is most likely from hair down the drain. We used to grab the Drano (and an even more caustic product once -- never again) every time the water started to slow in our sinks. No more! These methods work every time and it only takes a few minutes to use each drain cleaning hack.  Why you should clean your sink drains Well I think most of us understand why. At least we know when sinks start to drain slow they need to be cleared out. But I'm guilty (and I think a lot of us are) of not doing it enough.  In a kitchen, there are fats, oils and other foods that gunk up pipes over time. (Did you know even pasta is bad for your pipes?) In the bath, it's the dreaded hair. And unless you're diligent and stay on top of it all the time, clogs happen eventually. If you're not treating your drains right, eventually you'll need to clear out the pipes.  And your sink will probably be stinky. Ever had a foul smell in the kitchen you can't place? This is probably it. Cleaning out the food goo and gunk This one is typically used in kitchens where you have the thick build up of fats and gooey food. I used to use the old school method of hot water, then baking soda and finally vinegar to clear a kitchen drain.  But years ago I heard of a more effective and even easier way to get it done...and I've never gone back! I try to do this every six months or so, but as we've already discussed...drains aren't usually something I think of cleaning regularly. You'll only need a couple \"ingredients\" to flush the built up food and fats in your kitchen drain.  First up, boil a saucepan full of water. If your drain is already backed up or running slow, you may need to do this numerous times or boil a lot more water to start: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
