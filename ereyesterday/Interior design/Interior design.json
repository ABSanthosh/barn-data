    "description": "We've seen so many blue-sky ID school assignments that this one, which focuses on practicality, is refreshing. It's from the \"Basic Knowledge of Product Development\" class at Germany's Magdeburg-Stendal University of Applied Sciences, run by professor Mathias Bertram.\"The task was to design a connector between two predefined profiles with a volume not exceeding 75ccm. This connector was then 3D-printed using FDM and tested for load resistance with a specially defined fixture. The goal was to develop a component under given constraints that could withstand as much weight as possible before breaking. To achieve this, topology optimization analyses were applied, and the 3D printing process was fine-tuned for maximum load capacity.Here's what three different students came up with:Daniel Glatthaar Vincent AckermannAdrian Wiepcke \"Although the connector was designed for FDM printing, it could also be manufactured using metal casting. Renderings illustrate how the component would look as a precisely cast part: Noise textures mimic the characteristic surface produced by sand casting, while brushed textures represent polished outer surfaces. Realistic imperfections like stains and nicks further enhance the authentic look of both shaders.\"This being Germany, where function is every bit as important as looks, the students were required to load-test their creations to prove out their designs.",

    "description": "Tons of tips and ideas for decorating the wall around a TV. The age old question -- how to make the big TVs of today work in the scheme of a room and not overpower it.Televisions don't bother me much so I'm not a big stickler about this. But I definitely don't want it to be the center of attention -- often they do stand out more than we'd like! I've gathered a few of my favorite ideas on how to incorporate a TV into the design of your house, and even help it to disappear a little bit!1. Create a TV gallery wall My favorite ideas involve gallery walls -- especially those with black frames.

What a beautiful room right? I think this TV wall is done so well. White frames and other colors work well too of course, I just think the black helps to make the TV stand out a little less.  I love the idea of incorporating big artwork to steal the focus:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Beautiful DIY ways to display mementos and keepsakes around your home. Framing photos or filling photo albums isn't the only way to display memorabilia -- these are simple ways  honor your special memories and create some fun conversation starters as well! It's been a sentimental few months for our family! Our son is graduating high school in a soon and we're experiencing a lot of \"lasts\" with him lately. (I know many firsts are to come too, it is very bittersweet!)And as I shared in my last post, we recently had to say goodbye to our sweet dog of 14 years, Peanut. Needless to say, I've been a bit emotional. 💙Early this year I started decluttering like crazy -- it's been years since I've purged our home like that. This process included sorting through a lot of old bins and paperwork that have been stored away. During that decrapification I found so many items with such wonderful memories attached to them, and I was determined to figure out ways to display them in our home.I cannot tell you how much joy it has brought me to see so many of these throughout my day!Most of these ideas are easy to complete and don't cost much at all. A lot of our keepsakes are small -- I've struggled with adding them around the house because they look cluttered instead of cherished items. I've found that grouping them together makes them look more purposeful (and pretty!).When we moved years ago, I packed away a baggie of these matchbooks from our travels. I was so excited to find them again!:This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.   This one was easy -- I just placed them in a decorative bowl by a candle. I can't tell you how many times I've gone through them in the past few months, reminiscing about the exact dinner or travel that corresponds to each one. Here are some more ways to display matchbook covers: Attach them to the back of a shadowbox frame to create artwork. Hot glue magnets to the back for a fun way to display them (this would work best with match boxes).Have an artist make custom artwork with your match covers -- this would be perfect if you don't have the physical book but can find examples online. I love the custom artwork idea, probably because we have something similar that a friend made for us: When my husband retired from teaching (he was a band director), a close friend had this beautiful art made with every school musical he had conducted over the years. It's one of our most treasured pieces and I think it would be a brilliant idea for a student who's involved in theater or the arts. You could make something similar with playbills from theater productions, artwork for marching band shows, or program covers from concerts. What a special way to honor a student or teacher! If you are knowledgeable with photo editing programs, you could make one of these yourself. During my purge I found a little container with a bunch of tiny keepsakes. It made me sad that they were hidden away, so I grabbed a display case I had and started adding the items: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

By extending the roof of the building all the way to the rear, the architects were able to unlock space on the 225-square-metre site, to feature four bedrooms plus a study over three levels. The ‘least good parts’ of the home were optimised, introducing a sunken lower ground floor that immerses the living area in the garden.",
