    "description": "A lot of architecture think-tank stuff loses me, but this one I can both follow and get behind. Amor Immeuble is a Paris-based quartet of architects interested in material research and experimentation. They recently encountered a series of beautifully-crafted marble pieces that were once prized and are now considered waste. With their \"Deposees\" series, the group considers how best to preserve these pieces and integrate them into modern life.Essentially, the group notes that as fireplaces are no longer needed for heat, they're often removed during renovations to free up floor space. However, they often have ornate marble mantles that were the must-have interior design feature of the 19th century. They were sold by catalog, as the group explains:\"Nineteenth-century marble-makers flooded France with these kit dressings by the wagonload, standardizing catalogs with a limited series of model-types, utilitarian syntheses of historical styles.\"\"The ambivalent status of these standardized ornaments—architectural archetype or decorative product, indispensable figure in the domestic landscape or cumbersome antique—is inevitably debated during interior renovation projects.\"\"What position should we, as architects, adopt in such situations? What is the value of this ornamented interface, ultimately stripped of all function when the ducts are condemned? What place should be given to the many pieces that have been deposited? Among these sheet-rock facings, consoles and modillions stand out, more elaborate and massive in their function as projecting supports.\" \"The generic nature of the fragments collected enables us to turn them into three-dimensional assemblies that temporarily occupy the domestic space of the gallery: the rock, reduced to an ornamental motif, is used here for its structural capacity, and the contoured form becomes a framework component, abstracted from its original orientation and symbolism.\" At present there's no practical application for the salvaged mantle fragments, but the constructions pictured here were exhibited at the DNL Gallery in Paris.",

    "description": "Plastic is made from fossil fuels. Steel isn't, but we must burn an awful lot of fossil fuels in order to produce it. Iron ore must be pulled out of the ground, typically using gas-powered machinery; we then have to burn coal to make coke, in order to extract that iron in a blast furnace, which is also powered by coal.Incredibly, Swedish Steel AB has come up with a way to make fossil-free steel. Their ore supplier, LKAB, pulls the stuff out of the ground with electricity-powered mining equipment. Rather than coke, green hydrogen (made using wind, hydro and solar energy in Sweden) is injected. The furnaces are electric, also powered by renewables. The casting is done using electric induction heating rather than the material being molted in a coal-fired furnace. Veteran Swedish furniture designer Emma Olbers has designed the world's first piece of furniture made from fossil-free steel. Her Tellus bench, intended as street furniture, features armrests wide enough to rest a cup of coffee on, and the seating angles were created with ergonomics in mind. The Tellus bench is in production by Norwegian outdoor manufacturer Vestre. Below Olbers discusses her design philosophy and what she was going for with the bench. (Interestingly—perhaps this is a translation thing—her take on \"form follows function\" is \"forms follow planetary boundaries.)",

    "description": "Our favorite pet stain remover spray that gets everything out with NO scrubbing!  I'm sharing a quick post about a pet stain remover we've used for years and LOVE. We can't live without this stuff now! This isn't a sponsored post, I just like to share things that work. If you have animals I think you'll find it worthwhile.Just a warning...these are the worst pictures you'll ever see on the blog. 😂 I can't get around not showing you so you can see how it works, so bear with me.   Our little chihuahua dog absolutely HATES going out when it's really cold out. He's fine most days, but when it's bone-chilling cold he will go in and out as fast as possible. I can't blame him!  This time of year we will occasionally find a little pee spot:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. About eight years ago I found a non-toxic pet stain spray called Furry Freshness on a Facebook ad of all places. I decided to try it out based on the raving reviews. It really is a miracle solution. I've never used anything like it! You just spray the spot enough so that it's saturated: And by the next day the stain will be gone (well, usually). Sometimes we have to spray again, but it's just the same process of saturating the stain. We've used this so many times in our house and I can't even find the spots where we sprayed.  Let it sit for the best results -- don't scrub it into the carpet, don't do anything! This was just a few hours later:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
