I've kept a list of a few of these \"trendy fads\" that I think can and should be permanent fixtures in our homes. Some are older, some new...but I think all of the below are timeless looks and I'll explain why!And by the way, as I always say -- if you like it, do what you want! It's your house and you should enjoy it. Don't listen to me or anyone else when deciding what you truly love in your home!Dark hardwood floorsI couldn't believe my ears when I first started hearing mumblings of dark hardwood flooring becoming outdated. Flooring has definitely trended to lighter wood tones over the recent years, but I adore a classic darker wood stain. In our last home we were able to do traditional finished onsite hardwood floors throughout.

In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset. And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.
