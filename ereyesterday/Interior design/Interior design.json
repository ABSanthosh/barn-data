There is nothing more grounding and inspiring to me than a neutral living space with a few colors as accents - think rust red, terracotta, green or dusty rose. But in 2025, Scandinavian design feels a bit more rebellious…",

    "description": "Honda has announced they're launching Fastport, a B2B venture for delivering packages in urban markets. The company has designed this Fastport eQuad, a electric quadricycle, specifically to haul packages using bike lanes, avoiding both emissions and traffic. The eQuad runs on Honda's swappable Mobile Power Pack (MPP) batteries, reducing downtime. The UV-resistant canopy can be tinted for sunny cities, and a built-in fan helps keep the driver cool. The company says they've designed both large and small cargo boxes (we assume the images here show the large unit) that can be customized for different delivery needs. The large panels on the side will presumably be used for branding. Speaking of branding, I'm surprised by Honda's restraint; these days most manufacturers would have their name slathered all over the thing. The eQuad will make its debut later this month at the Eurobike show in Germany. The Fastport service is scheduled to launch in North America and Europe later this year.",

Those cloches are from IKEA and I just took a few fern sprigs off of a bundle I have. I love the look of them under the glass! (Find similar cloches with wood bases here.) Sometimes little faux plants can look a little wimpy on their own, and adding the glass makes them feel a bit more substantial, but not busy.  I had a big fake succulent I loved for my green office bookcases, but it needed a little something.

    "description": "How to make your builder grade cabinets look custom with simple trim. Adding just a bit of inexpensive trim makes a big difference on the sides of your kitchen cabinets! I've been hard at work in our kitchen finishing up a few smaller projects. I LOVE our kitchen, but I've planned all along to add some small details that add some interest and character.  You know character is the name of my game! My goal for the past couple decades of home ownership has been to add custom touches to our homes. :)  I started with adding \"legs\" to the sides of our island. That project made the island feel so much more substantial, and we can still access the cabinets underneath.This one is a quick project that I never had to address in our old kitchen makeover because we didn't have any exposed cabinet ends:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Basic cabinet side panels don't bother me -- but I do see them as an opportunity to make the kitchen look more custom!  I considered a bunch of different designs, but in the end went with the simplest. My friend Jenny shared a bunch of great options for dressing up the ends of cabinets here.  First I had to remove all of the trim along the side -- the quarter round, baseboard on the wall and the trim along the back of the cabinet. I used a pry bar and my hammer to pull those off.  Because the cabinets have a small \"lip\" on the front, I needed to make everything even so I could add the trim on top. Most cabinets will have that face part that will make things uneven on the side. I had a piece of luan cut to the size I needed and then I nailed it on to the cabinet with my nail gun:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

I think of English interiors similarly: a mix of the cool with the traditional, classic with a twist.
