It allows the user to eliminate the marking step (if not the measuring), as well as obviating the need to make trips to the miter saw station. The inventor claims the time savings has led him to finish jobs early.Here's how it works: The Sumpokun sells for ¥27,400 (USD $190).",

    "description": "How to make your builder grade cabinets look custom with simple trim. Adding just a bit of inexpensive trim makes a big difference on the sides of your kitchen cabinets! I've been hard at work in our kitchen finishing up a few smaller projects. I LOVE our kitchen, but I've planned all along to add some small details that add some interest and character.  You know character is the name of my game! My goal for the past couple decades of home ownership has been to add custom touches to our homes. :)  I started with adding \"legs\" to the sides of our island. That project made the island feel so much more substantial, and we can still access the cabinets underneath.This one is a quick project that I never had to address in our old kitchen makeover because we didn't have any exposed cabinet ends:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    Basic cabinet side panels don't bother me -- but I do see them as an opportunity to make the kitchen look more custom!  I considered a bunch of different designs, but in the end went with the simplest. My friend Jenny shared a bunch of great options for dressing up the ends of cabinets here.  First I had to remove all of the trim along the side -- the quarter round, baseboard on the wall and the trim along the back of the cabinet. I used a pry bar and my hammer to pull those off.  Because the cabinets have a small \"lip\" on the front, I needed to make everything even so I could add the trim on top. Most cabinets will have that face part that will make things uneven on the side. I had a piece of luan cut to the size I needed and then I nailed it on to the cabinet with my nail gun:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Interior stylist Belle Fearon and Jake Weston moved from Paddington to Avalon Beach for a slower pace of life, including daily beach visits. They searched for an original weatherboard cottage retaining its ‘beach shack’ essence, and found it in this sun-filled home. Since then, it’s been summer holidays year-round for the couple and their regular guests. They’ve made only small DIY updates to the property so far, adding character to the relaxed interiors through lighting and eclectic styling.",

Studio Prineas overcame these obstacles to create a recessive, yet deliberately distinct extension that adds valuable space and optimises the existing architecture. It’s now a home connected to its garden, embracing the naturally sloping block.",
