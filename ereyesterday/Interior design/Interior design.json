    "description": "From the Beetle to the Rabbit to the Golf, Volkswagen has long made affordable, practical cars that those with smaller budgets can afford. Now they're aiming that prowess at the EV market with the unveiling of their ID EVERY1. The concept car is intended to make the transition into production for €20,000 (USD $21,667) in 2027. Hailed as \"affordable entry-level all-electric mobility\" by Thomas Schäfer, CEO of Volkswagen Passenger Cars, the 94hp vehicle will reportedly have a range of 155 miles. Aesthetically, the vehicle was designed to have a friendly, approachable look. \"Our ambition was to create something bold yet accessible,\" says Andreas Mindt, Volkswagen's Head of Design. \"The ID EVERY1 has a self-assured appearance but remains likeable – thanks to details such as the dynamic front lights and the 'smiling' rear. These design elements make it more than just a car: they give it character and an identity that people can relate to.\"The big question for Americans is whether that €20,000 sticker will apply in 2027, given the way our current administration's tariff war is going. The point may be moot; sadly, VW has announced no plans to bring this affordable EV to the U.S. market. With any luck things will change in two years' time.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/135826/Fantastic-Design-Details-in-this-Zilch-Bike-Pump",
    "description": "There isn't much design in your average bike pump: It's a plunger, a hose and a couple of wimpy feet you step on to stabilize the base. And the hose has no place to dock when the pump isn't in use.In contrast this Zilch pump, by a startup called Radian, was designed with a heavy emphasis on UX. The designers started with the typically fiddly process of getting the nozzle onto the valve stem. Rather than going with a friction arrangement, where you jam the nozzle onto the valve, the Zilch uses an elegant clamping mechanism. You slide the nozzle over the valve with no friction at all, then press a lever to activate an internal clamp, forming a secure connection. You do the same in reverse to disconnect, meaning there isn't that annoying little blast of air as you remove the nozzle.When you're done pumping, the hose can be hung from the plunger for storage. The plunger handle is self-centering, so the hose handle's dock is always in place.The base of the pump features three feet rather than two, splayed for stability. Lastly, the pump has been designed for serviceability; the user can easily disassemble it and replace parts as necessary.The Zilch pump has been successfully Kickstarted, with 24 days left to pledge at press time. It starts at $95.",

    "description": "My tips for finding beautiful treasures on Facebook Marketplace! If you love vintage and unique decor in your home, then the Facebook Marketplace will become your favorite source for interesting pieces!  Recently, especially over the past year or so, the seasonal decor releases at places like Target and Walmart are just hitting me differently.  It's hard to find something unique -- all of the decor items start to look the same after a while.  Over the past few years I've fallen back in love with thrifting and antiquing. It helps that our teenage son enjoys it too -- he loves looking for vintage sports memorabilia.  Late last year I clicked on the little marketplace button at the bottom of my FB page while winding down in bed one night. I was surprised at all of the beautiful pieces that were both interesting and full of character.  I started logging in everyday to check out the finds. It's easy to get slightly addicted once you find a few treasures!  In the past few months I've learned a lot about successfully shopping on this app, so figured I would share my tips along with some of my finds! 1. Search for keywords and add filters. Looking through all of the listings can become a major time suck, so searching by terms helps to whittle down the items.  You can use any word you'd like -- wood or metal, new or used. Or search a specific design style you love like modern or farmhouse. Not only can you use keywords, but you can set a price range, condition, color and more to filter your search: I love just about anything brass, so I use that every so often to look for treasures. These brass library bookends were one of my first finds: Love the candlestick in front of the books!  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     This brass planter was in great condition: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
