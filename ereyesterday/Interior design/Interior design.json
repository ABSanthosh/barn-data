    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134464/Yamaha-Designers-on-Creating-the-Futuristic-Motorcycles-in-Tokyo-Override",
    "description": "As a transportation designer, you might be asked to design a concept vehicle for 100 years in the future. You crank out sketches, renderings, maybe a model, maybe even a life-size one. But the frustration is, you'll never live to see the thing in actual use.Yamaha Motor Co.'s design team has experienced a twist on this. They were approached by Netflix, the producers of \"Tokyo Override,\" an anime series set 100 years in the future. The design team was asked to create a racing motorcycle to be used by the protagonists. Thus they would get to see their creations in action, albeit on a screen, ridden by fictional characters. \"We wondered what kind of relationship between mobility and people would exist in Tokyo 100 years from now,\" said Yamaha designer Satoshi Nakamura. The team worked with Netflix on the worldbuilding, learned about characters' personalities, then designed a bike to suit Tokyo, the characters and the times. The resultant Y/AI bike, so named because it contains AI, embodies Yamaha's philosophy of Jinki-Kanno, \"The seductive exhilaration of being one with the machine.\" In this video with Yamaha's team, you can see they actually put a crazy amount of thought into the design: \"Tokyo Override\" is currently streaming on Netflix.",

    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134462/Bose-Re-Imagines-Their-Classic-901-Speakers",
    "description": "Born in 1929 in Philadelphia, Amar Bose grew up with an interest in electronics. While still a teenager, he started a business repairing radios and model trains. He eventually pursued a degree in Electrical Engineering at MIT. After gaining his doctorate, he became an MIT professor.In 1956, Dr. Bose purchased a high-end stereo system. He was disappointed with its performance, and wanted a speaker system that could deliver concert hall results within the confines of one's home. Nothing like that existed, so Dr. Bose set about researching acoustics in order to invent something that would meet his wants.By 1968 Bose, now running his own company, released the Bose 901. The revolutionary design of these stereo speakers featured nine drivers each, one facing the listener, eight facing the wall behind. The reflected sound created the sense of concert-hall-like acoustic spaciousness that Bose sought. And the gentle curve across the front of the housing became a persistent Bose design cue.The 901 went on to become one of the most commercially successful speaker systems of all time. It went through four iterations, and remained in production from 1968 to 2017—nearly 50 years.To celebrate their 60th anniversary this year, Bose tapped fashion designer Ronnie Fieg, founder of fashion brand Kith, to collaborate on a re-release of the 901. Fieg in turn pulled in Brooklyn-based furniture designer Mark Jupiter as a co-collaborator. Fieg and Jupiter have been generous with sharing in-process shots of their reinterpretation of the classic design: \"Since its debut in 1968, this speaker has stood as a pinnacle of audio engineering. For those that don't know, the inception of the 901s was a result of Dr. Bose's visionary pursuit to develop a speaker system that could replicate a live concert in his living room. They leveraged breakthrough technology that used a combination of both direct and reflecting sound to deliver the same immersive listening experience as live.\" Bose has not announced a release date nor prices. Sadly, it appears these may be extremely limited-edition.",

    "description": "Upgrade your plain Christmas wreaths with these easy and inexpensive DIYs! Wreaths are one my favorite ways to decorate for the holiday season. There are so many easy ways to add festive touches to inexpensive, plain wreaths.  I put wreaths of every size all over our house when I decorate for Christmas. I realized this year that it takes me forever to put all of our holiday decor out because I can't leave well enough alone...I LOVE to tweak things and add my own touch. I've done that with wreaths a lot over the years, and even more so this year. I've gathered a bunch of DIYs for basic wreaths to give you some inspiration for this season! This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     I think evergreen wreaths are quite beautiful on their own, especially with some twinkling lights. I wanted this simpler look for the bookcases in my office that's been undergoing a makeover.  I picked up a couple of these Norway spruce wreaths from At Home:  src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh_IjzAjSLtroC1bI_h0IccAs-9ShtgnUtOlSvwr4joScdWnKaH92CACARASQw4Qemgn8_HrkSSuJqACSNA5zIdwo1Fg17TwmQw_bf95sHTVsFxfwMorH-jEzo_AQgThB_qD4_Y9jaU-83grsKGlV54mHUvOn4CMh8zJntdIPCUPGLhOp1VGRyxacOb1KI/s16000/Norway%20spruce%20wreath%20At%20Home.jpg\"\u003e They come in a two and three foot width, mine are the smaller versions.  I grabbed some of my pinecone stems that I use every year (from Hobby Lobby) and secured them together with some green floral wire: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjvq6HwgZEOG5D_sslqiBPv0MY4QUXk_rDMyI1u6aMkVGzB11SPSxJVsynDE0QTOB96tVOmYLv9tdkN0yk6pr9XsDNfWKZWFjjTAi-iKfVb99mkYzfSuExdg6SR6AJ-E5S_cHwIJ2HIi3zCU0pGD2skEg48KKB1mtSO99Z5_yO7TVcOhzTbdZ3EW05uPN4/s16000/green%20floral%20wire%20for%20wreaths.jpg\"\u003e Then I used that same wire to attach the pinecones to the bottom of the metal base on the wreath.

    "description": "Twenty beautiful Christmas mantel decorating ideas.I've gathered a bunch of absolutely gorgeous Christmas mantels to give you some inspiration this holiday season! If you have a fireplace, you know it's a focal point all year, but even more so during the holidays. If you decorate just that one spot it will make the room feel so festive!Even if you don't have a fireplace, a TV built in or console can be decorated similarly. If holiday decor intimidates you but you want to add some festive touches, I would suggest tackling the tree and a mantel and/or TV stand. My Christmas mantels have varied big time over the years -- from bright, traditional colors to more neutral moody vibes. I'll share a few of my favorites first, and then I have more beautiful examples from talented DIY and decor bloggers. At our last house, I finished up tiling our stacked stone basement fireplace right before the holidays. I loved how it looked with our flocked tree: The stone and long wood beam stole the show, so I didn't need to do much otherwise. Just some simple greenery along the top was perfect. The thorn in my side at that house was our corner fireplace in our family room. I thought it would be such a cool design feature, but I ended up hating it. 😂At first I added some box molding to the walls above it and tried to take advantage of all of that mantel space for my Christmas decor: We later built out that corner fireplace a bit and brought the wall forward. This changed the game! It was so much easier to work with, and looked like it fit so much better in the room. I was so excited to decorate the new fireplace for Christmas! The longer mantel was fun to decorate, and those hanging lanterns added some whimsy: I loved the traditional pops of red, but the next year was one of my all time favorites. I went super simple with inexpensive glass vessels wrapped with pretty scrapbook and wrapping paper:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it.
