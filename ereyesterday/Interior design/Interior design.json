    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/134365/Industrial-Design-Student-Work-Community-Gravestones-for-Potters-Fields",
    "description": "This Community Gravestones project is by Cameron Brentlinger, an Industrial Design student at Pratt Institute. Brentlinger put an incredible amount of thought and research into the work, which seeks to destigmatize a taboo subject: NYC's anonymous mass graves. The goal was to create \"dignified memorials and ceremonies for unidentified or unclaimed people at the end of life.\"COMMUNITY GRAVESTONE is an equitable gravestone design for Potter's Fields. It is an impermanent memorial made from local adobe for individuals who are interred in mass graves. The ritual seeks to provide dignity, remove the stigma of these cemeteries, and create a space for collective grief by creating gravestones and arrangements for a communal burial space. Nature is used as a tool to acknowledge the cyclical quality of life and the interconnectedness of all beings to create a welcoming space for the living and the dead. ResearchHart Island is New York City's Potter's Field for the unclaimed and unidentified located off the Bronx. There are over a million unidentified New Yorkers buried on the island. Design Values How It WorksAfter identifying the core values for the design, I started storyboarding a concept for an interactive making ceremony and memorial that allows the public to acknowledge and pay respects to those who are buried. MaterialsHart Island is a burial site that goes through immense change. It felt necessary to find a material that also goes through change to symbolize the impermanence of these memorial spaces, our memories, our lives, and the change of our grief cycles. For this reason I decided to use local adobe (clay, sand, silt, and hay) which with break down into the soil overtime. Mold PrototypeThe mold was designed as simple and intuitive as possible to allow the grave making process to be easy for the cemeteries to output. Gravestone Prototypes and ArrangementsThe gravestones are laid out in the field with suggested pattern arrangements. People as well as plants and insects are invited to come and appreciate the forms and pay tribute to the members of the community who are buried there. ConclusionAnd so, For a moment's time these physical bricks will exist above the mass graves, slowly evolving as hints of lichen and bugs inhabit its crevices. Eventually, the brick will combine with the soil that is made up of those who were buried before. New life grows from the soil and the pattern continues. Interestingly enough, Brentlinger started out studying Photography at Pratt, but was drawn to Industrial Design after creating her own photography sets. \"I realized Industrial Design was much more than just making things,\" she told Pratt News, citing the extensive research, problem-solving, and collaboration required in ID. \"I fell in love with the design process. I feel like I can design or make anything as long as I go through these steps that I was taught.\"Community Gravestones won both a 2024 Change Agent and Activism in Sustainability Award and a Material Lab Prize.",

Now in its first full bloom since completion, the garden is flourishing, featuring an assortment of vibrant plantings and roses with inspiration taken from famous English gardens including Highgrove, Kensington Palace and Hidcote Manor.",

    "description": "Twenty beautiful Christmas mantel decorating ideas.I've gathered a bunch of absolutely gorgeous Christmas mantels to give you some inspiration this holiday season! If you have a fireplace, you know it's a focal point all year, but even more so during the holidays. If you decorate just that one spot it will make the room feel so festive!Even if you don't have a fireplace, a TV built in or console can be decorated similarly. If holiday decor intimidates you but you want to add some festive touches, I would suggest tackling the tree and a mantel and/or TV stand. My Christmas mantels have varied big time over the years -- from bright, traditional colors to more neutral moody vibes. I'll share a few of my favorites first, and then I have more beautiful examples from talented DIY and decor bloggers. At our last house, I finished up tiling our stacked stone basement fireplace right before the holidays. I loved how it looked with our flocked tree: The stone and long wood beam stole the show, so I didn't need to do much otherwise. Just some simple greenery along the top was perfect. The thorn in my side at that house was our corner fireplace in our family room. I thought it would be such a cool design feature, but I ended up hating it. 😂At first I added some box molding to the walls above it and tried to take advantage of all of that mantel space for my Christmas decor: We later built out that corner fireplace a bit and brought the wall forward. This changed the game! It was so much easier to work with, and looked like it fit so much better in the room. I was so excited to decorate the new fireplace for Christmas! The longer mantel was fun to decorate, and those hanging lanterns added some whimsy: I loved the traditional pops of red, but the next year was one of my all time favorites. I went super simple with inexpensive glass vessels wrapped with pretty scrapbook and wrapping paper:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "link": "https://www.thriftydecorchick.com/2017/12/how-to-make-easy-large-diy-christmas.html",
    "description": "How to make EASY Christmas bows for your holiday decor! Simple instructions to make fluffy DIY bows, from small to big, for your Christmas decorations.  I searched for \"easy Christmas DIY bows\" a few years ago and tried at least three versions (that seemed incredibly easy).  Each time I ended up with a mess of ribbon that looked NOTHING like what they showed.  I finally found a simple bow that ended up looking pretty cute, so I wanted to share the easy steps! You only need two things for this quick tutorial -- wired ribbon (I think I had 30 yards) and wire of some kind. You can use wire, floral wire, pipe cleaners...anything like that will work.  1. Cut your ribbon to long lengths First up, cut one long piece of ribbon at around five feet (I ended up making them a bit longer, around 65 inches) and a shorter piece at two feet.  You'll see the size of the bows with these measurements in this post -- adjust the lengths to your liking!  Then place the long one on a surface like so: src=\"https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEisgxUQ7mMJs_cmJWuWHiPUMsqqTkWyZNkwb53FA5W2kba1P9NMQJ6y7wZE1Zm2luxzVeOQt7euTP45wif3IYS3VnqZ2mfqE7z9LcaT76x4DQUpRCnmLI1tvOQa_tpuUB8p6SyTNLLe5AQ/s16000/IMG_9870.jpg\"\u003e This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience. I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links.  See my policies and disclosure page for more information.     Using wired ribbon will make this much easier -- it keeps its shape as you go.  I had to study the photo as I did this because I kept doing it backwards. You just lay it flat and then pull one side over, then the other.  You may want to widen that part at the top as you go, that will be the back part of the bow. 2. Make your ribbon loops Then, take the smaller section of ribbon and overlap the ends a bit like so: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

We covered a range of experiences – like the good things about moving to a smaller home (owning less stuff! saving money!) and some of its challenges, especially in the initial stages of downsizing (paring down! figuring out storage!). We still agree with everything in that post, but it had only been six months… and since it has now been over 4.5 years (!!!), we feel like we have a few more to add about the long-haul downsizing experience. Let’s get into it. I won’t recap our entire decision to downsize (you can see the full explanation here) but the highlights are: We used to live in a 3,150 sq. ft. home in suburban Richmond, Virginia Now we live in a 1,400 sq.
