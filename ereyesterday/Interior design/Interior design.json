    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/137760/A-Very-Unusual-Midcentury-Modern-Chair-of-Dutch-Design",
    "description": "This vintage lounge chair might be the strangest piece of Midcentury Modern furniture I've seen. Produced by Dutch manufacturer De Ster Gelderland in the 1950s or '60s—and probably designed in-house, as there's no famous designer's name attached to the piece—it is an odd mishmash of styles. First off, the spindle back. During the Midcentury period, this would have been seen (at least in America) as a folksy throwback. Spindle-back chairs were associated with English and Welsh furniture from earlier centuries. The woven rush seat also speaks of folk craft; no modern upholstered fabrics here. However, this is offset by the striking padding on the backrest, a circle on a piece otherwise devoid of perfect geometric shapes, made of bouclé (yarn loops). This was a then-modern touch; it was just a few years earlier, in the late '40s, when Eero Saarinen popularized bouclé by using it on his iconic Womb Chair, designed for Florence Knoll. Then there are the through-tenons. This was a nod not to the Arts \u0026 Crafts movement, as an American or Brit might guess, but Scandinavia's own past. Through-tenons were a feature of vernacular Scandinavian furniture dating back to the 16th century—as were spindle backs, hence their inclusion. These nods to the past aside, the low-slung chair's rakish stance, the angles of the armrest support, and the splay of the short, stubby legs are hallmark Midcentury Modern. All in all, I've never seen a chair that blended such rustic, vernacular elements with Midcentury Modern design cues in what I feel was a successful way. Perhaps because it's so evocative. I read one description of the design that called it \"timeless,\" and I disagree; this is multiple time periods woven together, in a way that works in my opinion, while it rides right on the line of being a camel (i.e. a horse designed by committee). Wonderful piece and I can't take my eyes off of it.",

    "description": "Here's a simple invention designed to save landscapers and lawncare businesses money: Those pieces of welded steel tubing were developed by Long-Island-based D'ttach. It's simply a hitch receiver supported by a telescopic bar that can be attached to the front arms of any zero-turn, whether sit-down or stand-on. This allows the user to attach a number of D'ttach accessories to the front of the machine, instantly transforming what was only a grass-cutting machine into something with far more utility. Commercial zero-turns are expensive, often running into five figures, and the D'ttach add-ons save the operators the expense of needing to haul a second dedicated machine to the jobsite.The company makes a dethatcher: An aerator: A barrel carrier:A jack, for changing the blades and cleaning the deck underside: A leaf plow: And even a snowplow: The latter two attachments are particularly clever, allowing the operator to generate income during autumn and winter months, when there's no grass to be cut.",

    "description": "How to build a wood burning stone fire pit on top of a concrete patio. There are a few safety issues to consider when building a DIY fire pit on a concrete surface. I'm sharing the how-to here!Years ago we had a large patio poured in our back yard. The best part was a 14 foot circular fire pit area we designed off to one side. I shared how this part of the patio looked the day of installation:  One big project I had to hold off on was the DIY fire pit. The concrete contractors advised we wait a bit because the stone for the pit is so heavy. The patio had to cure for a couple of weeks.  Before I started, we got a quote for a small stone retaining wall around the circular fire pit area as well as a fire pit with stone that matched our house. The quote came back at almost DOUBLE what the entire PATIO cost. Lordt.  Soooo we decided to do it ourselves with a kit and it was crazy easy. It doesn't look custom, but it does the job...burns wood. ;) Here's the kit we got from Menards:  Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Our favorite handy finds for around the house, all $10 or under!It's that time of year! This time the Amazon Prime sale goes for four days -- running from the 8th through the 11th of this week. I know there are a bunch of great deals on more expensive finds, but I prefer to share affordable items we actually use and love. Last year I shared my top favorites under $30, and the year before some of my best finds under $25. This year I went even lower and put a list together of handy home items, all for $10 and under! I wasn't meaning to gather things that I find particularly helpful, but it turned out that way. :) We use every item on this list of useful products, and all are super affordable, even without prime day discounts.This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    I know, I know...Christmas is a long way off! But I use these discounts to shop early and I'm always so thankful I did! It's so nice to have items crossed off your list before you even start. This new Amazon prime membership for ages 18-24 would make a great graduation or start of college gift! It's half the cost of regular memberships. Now the fun stuff! First up, these handy touch up paint pens! These are fantastic and make it so easy to touch up scuff marks and small drywall fixes:They come with four in the set and are easy to fill up. You push the button at the bottom of the pen to push the paint up into the brush. So handy! I keep them in our junk drawer for easy access. I got this one for myself last Christmas -- this puzzle \"scoop\" is also a magnifier and has a handy click on light: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

In fact over the last two years they've held pretty steady - we did update the kitchen light to my dream chandelier that looks like bubbles at a beach sunset. And before that we finally settled on the right seating that fit perfectly into the seating area. But yeah, since then... settled! So it felt like it was finally time to share how it all turned out.

What followed was a major four-year build and numerous setbacks, to finally arrive at the Ibiza-inspired house you see today. With just one bedroom (down from five), it’s an unorthodox home that’s expansive, ‘barefoot’ and perfectly suited to Jai and Matt’s life and work.",
