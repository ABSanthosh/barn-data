    "description": "How to hang patio lights over your patio, deck or yard.The ultimate guide on how to hang outdoor patio lights and all of the products you'll need!There's nothing quite as charming as beautiful cafe lights draped over a deck or patio -- they add so much character and ambience to outdoor living spaces in the evening. Now that we've had them at two homes, these outdoor string lights are a staple for our outdoor spaces. There are a lot of things to consider if you're planning to install these exterior lights yourself. You'll need a few tools in order to hang them so that they withstand the elements. You'll also need to consider where you are hanging them from to ensure they will be sturdy over time. I've compiled all of the methods -- whether you have mature trees, a solid wood fence...or nothing at all in your backyard!This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information. The best string lights that will last!I tried a few options when we first installed patio cafe lights at our first house years ago. I felt like Goldilocks -- some were too wimpy and the bulbs broke easily. A lot of them weren't nearly long enough for what we needed. The lights we ended up using are still going strong ten years later! They are the industrial grade Feit incandescent string lights and when I found out they are what most businesses (restaurants especially) use, I was sold.Many of my readers suggested these way back then -- thank you! You can usually find these light strands at Costco too. We used them on our outdoor dining area under the wood pergola at that house:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

The experimental furniture piece was SLA 3D printed out of Accura, a tough, flame-retardant resin that offers both durability and, after cleanup, a fine surface finish. As with much of Donders' work, this was designed less as a production piece, and more to demonstrate the role that advanced computational modeling can have in material optimization. The sturdy table, which measures 450mm (17.72\") in all three dimensions, weighs just 3.8kg (8.4 lbs).

Porsche Design created a folding outdoor TV, and Pininfarina an expanding dining table.Not to be left out, Rolls-Royce's design team has created a chess set. \"Every detail of the Rolls-Royce Chess Set exudes elegance. The embedded chess pieces are ceremoniously unveiled, evoking the sense of occasion synonymous with the arrival of a Rolls-Royce motor car. Generous spacing around the chess board enhances the game's theatrical allure, while the use of the finest materials, hand-fitted veneer, and polished details echo the superior craftsmanship found in Rolls-Royce interiors.\" The pieces are hidden away beneath the surface of the board:A push-to-open drawer on either side contains extra queens, for when you manage to get a pawn all the way across the board.Each piece and each square contains a perfectly centered magnet, allowing you to avoid the problematic piece-creep that bedevils so many chess players. As far as I can tell, you don't have to buy a Rolls-Royce car to buy the chess set. Mother's Day is coming up, so if yours appreciates faceted polished stainless steel chess pieces with a ceramic cladding and choosing between exotic veneers and leathers, well, you're welcome.",
