    "link": "https://www.core77.com/posts/136050/A-Designey-Stainless-Steel-Water-Filtration-Unit",
    "description": "Britas and other popular water filtration systems are often made of plastic. For those who prefer metal, there are stainless steel offerings from Berkey and Boroux, shown below. Well-considered industrial design is about the transitions. The equatorial seam on both the Berkey and Boroux units is probably cost-effective, but lends these units an institutional look. In contrast, a startup called Rorra produces a more designey stainless steel offering: Rorra's more flowing form gives you the impression the designer(s) sweated the details. To me it's a lot easier on the eyes. There are a couple of caveats with the Rorra. One is that it requires four AAA batteries. These do not power the filtration—the unit is gravity-fed, as are the competitors'—but provide the juice for the filter replacement notification light. Which leads us to the second caveat. All water filtration systems require the user to periodically replace the filter. And the filters for these three manufacturers are proprietary, meaning if they go out of business, you've now got a worthless stainless steel artifact. Berkey has been around for over 30 years, providing some peace of mind as to their longevity. Boroux is a bit newer, having launched around 2016. Rorra, the newcomer, came on the market in 2020. With any luck their offering's better looks will lead to market longevity, but anytime you buy something from a new company that requires replacement parts, you are taking a gamble.",

    "description": "This country home in Woodend, Victoria, has lived many lives. The owner has heard plenty of colourful stories about its history as a maternity hospital from around the 1930s. It also reportedly looked after soldiers during WWII before eventually being purchased by a nun in 1951. But now, designers Pipkorn Kilpatrick have ushered the building into its latest chapter, serving as a light-and-bright family home.",

    "description": "EASY and inexpensive ways to clean gunk out of a drain There are two simple and very effective ways to clean to clear gunk and hair out of your drains without using harsh chemicals. And with one method you'll have everything you need in your kitchen.  One of these drain clearing methods works better in the kitchen on built up foods and fats, and the other works well in bathroom sinks and showers where the clog culprit is most likely from hair down the drain. We used to grab the Drano (and an even more caustic product once -- never again) every time the water started to slow in our sinks. No more! These methods work every time and it only takes a few minutes to use each drain cleaning hack.  Why you should clean your sink drains Well I think most of us understand why. At least we know when sinks start to drain slow they need to be cleared out. But I'm guilty (and I think a lot of us are) of not doing it enough.  In a kitchen, there are fats, oils and other foods that gunk up pipes over time. (Did you know even pasta is bad for your pipes?) In the bath, it's the dreaded hair. And unless you're diligent and stay on top of it all the time, clogs happen eventually. If you're not treating your drains right, eventually you'll need to clear out the pipes.  And your sink will probably be stinky. Ever had a foul smell in the kitchen you can't place? This is probably it. Cleaning out the food goo and gunk This one is typically used in kitchens where you have the thick build up of fats and gooey food. I used to use the old school method of hot water, then baking soda and finally vinegar to clear a kitchen drain.  But years ago I heard of a more effective and even easier way to get it done...and I've never gone back! I try to do this every six months or so, but as we've already discussed...drains aren't usually something I think of cleaning regularly. You'll only need a couple \"ingredients\" to flush the built up food and fats in your kitchen drain.  First up, boil a saucepan full of water. If your drain is already backed up or running slow, you may need to do this numerous times or boil a lot more water to start: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

    "description": "Adorable spring and Easter decorating ideas. Easy and cute ways to add some spring touches around the house with beautiful florals and decor. As much as I LOVE the fall season, there's something so special about the start of spring after a very cold and snowy winter. Our weather has felt more like summer around here lately, and it has me in the mood to clean up the garden beds and haul out the spring decor. I picked up a few new pieces and used some old ones to add some sweet touches around the house!This light and pretty decor has put us all in such a good mood! :) I found these cute bunnies in the Target dollar section this year: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    They had smaller versions last year that are just as detailed. This trio of gold bunnies was a new find this season: I seem to like bunnies in a set of three. ;) I love their cute poses! They are bigger than the Target versions: There's also a set with really adorable Easter egg votive holders as well. I've had two fuzzy green bunnies on sticks from Pier One (RIP) years ago. I've never found a good spot for them, but this year I cut down the sticks and placed them in this greenery in our foyer:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
