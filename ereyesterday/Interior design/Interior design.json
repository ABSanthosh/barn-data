    "description": "In addition to plain ol' beautiful furniture designs, this year we saw a lot of unusual pieces that demonstrated really outside-of-the-box thinking. Here are 21 of our faves.The Brico series of chairs, by furniture designer Martin Kechayas, are made of offcuts from the production of other chairs. We think of bamboo as an extraordinarily hard material, but industrial designer Brian Chang figured out a brilliant way to use bamboo to create comfortable, springy seating. Industrial designer Eva Dugintseva designed Som, an easy-to-assemble 3D printed chair. Jef and Jess Behnke, a/k/a Two Moose Design, have a creative take on tambour cabinets.These cantilevered Tripod Tables are by Fernweh Woodworking. Willy Guhl, one of Switzerland's first industrial designers, created these radical fiber cement Loop Chairs in the 1950s. Simone Giertz's swivel-arm chair valet is simply brilliant.Korean artist/designer Oneseo Choi makes furniture from aluminum extrusions. These SAI 39 benches, by industrial designer Robin Bourgeois, are made from plywood industrial waste. Mitten State Woodworks works in an unusual furniture design niche: Behind-the-sofa consoles. Chinese company Cluvens makes these over-the-top, powered \"computer cockpits.\"Carpentopod, designed and built by Netherlands-based game developer Giliam de Carpentier, is a coffee table that walks. The hooks on this simple Charlotte Perriand wall rack are pure form follows function. Italian design brand Mavimatt produces this UFO (\"Unidentified Furniture Object\") rocking chair. This South African builder has made a series of clever, transforming space-saving workshop furniture designs.This one is here in the \"strange\" category because airplane seats usually suck. In contrast, there are a lot of nice design touches in Cathay-Pacific's new Premium Economy seats. There's also lots of nice, functional design details in Grovemade's handsome standing desk. And some unusual design details in this Hans J. Wegner sewing table. This FurnSpin system, by Hettich, features a surprising cabinet mechanism.Speaking of surprising mechanisms, furniture designer Jory Brigham shares this clever furniture hack: How to make invisible cabinet hinges by using ball bearings. Lastly, not a furniture piece, but a pleasing trend for cat owners: Repairing cat-damaged furniture with embroidery.",

    "description": "If you're thinking about grad school, you might spend some of your holiday time sparkling up that portfolio as the application deadline is soon approaching for SVA's MFA in Products of Design program in NYC.Natya.AI is an app designed specifically for Bharatanatyam dancers, offering real-time voice and visual feedback during practice sessions. Developed by Yukti Arora as part of her thesis, Democratizing Bharatnatyam: Investigating the Interplay Between Dance and AI. The department teaches Industrial Design, Interaction \u0026 Service Design, Social Innovation Design, Leadership and Strategic Management, and Business. Why all these disciplines at the same time? Department chair Allan Chochinov argues that \"to design anything requires the design of everything. If you talk to anyone who is actually deep into the lived experience of practicing design, they will acknowledge that they are doing everything all at once: While designing a physical product for example, they are looking at what digital components and apps might be for that product. They are also looking at the product as a \"service platform\" and are constantly measuring the business risks and business value of any idea while they are prototyping. If they are an admirable organization, they are looking at the social value of an idea from the inception of a design project all the way through the narratives through which they market the idea.\"Chochinov adds, \"We need designers to have skills and to be comfortable in all of these facets of design because if they don't, they will not be in the meetings where decisions get made. Particularly around finance. If you are a designer who does not understand finance, you will for sure not be in the meetings where strategic decisions get made—you will just be 'handed a decision' of what the leadership team has decided to make, and told to 'make it.' We don't want our designers in jobs where they get handed a decision; we want our graduates to be active members of teams that make those decisions.We don't want our designers in jobs where they get handed a decision; we want our graduates to be active members of teams that make those decisions.RE:ACTORS, which won best student booth at NYCxDESIGN's Javits Center, encourages \"re-physicalizing in a pandemic world.\" Every year, students of the program design products for manufacture and sales at MoMA as part of its ongoing partnership. Here, a top product is Hui Zheng's Roller Coasters.\"Our program also features a no-grade policy—something that both the students and faculty appreciate. Not having grades encourages maximum risk from the students, and fosters a collegial relationship with the faculty (as opposed to a hierarchical one where teachers are 'measuring' you.)\"Like a metaphor of a relationship, Crystal Lo's Kuddle Charging Stand will only charge if both of a couple's phones are close together on the dock. You can see what the department is looking for in a candidate in Core77's article, Getting Accepted: How to Be a Standout Applicant to SVA's Products of Design MFA Program, and learn much more about the program at https://productsofdesign.sva.edu/Ready to apply? Get all the details at their Apply Page.Dana Krouham created a public intervention as part of her thesis, CHRONIC: How Understanding Your \"In our program, you are not forced to choose one discipline of design—you get to experience and build marketable skills in all of them. This vastly increases the potential breadth of practice in your career, and provides a broader portfolio of work to share in job interviews.\"",

Whatever the reason, I'm way behind this year. I wanted to have this tour up weeks ago...but here we are! I hope you enjoy this Christmas home tour and it inspires you! I plan to put a video tour together, I'll update this when I get that up. The only space I didn't include this year is our basement family room and bar, but you can check out the basement tour from last year. I don't change up the holiday decor down there too much so it looks almost exactly this same this year. ;) BedroomLet's start in our bedroom! This room got a big makeover early this year when I installed some vertical tongue and groove molding to brighten up the space. I'm so pleased with how it came together. I like to add a few Christmas touches in our room every year, like our flocked, snowy tree: This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.I may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links. See my policies and disclosure page for more information.    This year I did all silver and white ornaments on that tree, but didn't hang them everywhere. I kind of cascaded them around the tree, in a band of ornaments. It's just a different look and I really like how it turned out! I draped some of my favorite Norfolk greenery on our standing mirror: It needed a little something, so I made my own bell garland with some green floral wire and these tiny brass bells:Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.

These photo ornament ideas are so easy to DIY and add a personal touch to your Christmas tree! I'm sharing a few I've done over the years, including my most recent (and favorite!) version.  I love celebrating the events and special moments of each year by adding photos to our holiday decor, and the tree is the perfect place to display them.  EASY PHOTO TREE Years ago I did the simplest version of this by printing out photos from my phone and just tucking them into the tree:  I mean...you can't get easier than this!  For a nostalgic touch, I edited them with a sepia tone before printing.  This tree decorated with photos was so sweet and I loved looking through the pictures throughout the season. It was surprisingly pretty on the tree too!:  This post may contain affiliate links for your convenience.
