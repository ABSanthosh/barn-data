    "description": "The term \"street furniture\" obviously refers to objects on streets. But NYC-based industrial designer Nik Bentel was inspired by a ubiquitous piece of street furniture, the bike rack, to design something similar for inside the home. His Loopy Chair draws on the same manufacturing techniques used to produce bike racks, here pressed into the service of creating seating. The powder-coated steel chair can be ordered with a suspended seat made of cloth-wrapped foam. It's not in production by a major manufacturer, but Nik Bentel Studio has taken the increasingly popular approach of batch-producing a limited run. They go for $3,000 a pop.",

    "description": "Whirlpool's new Spin\u0026Load Dishwasher Rack is designed to improve accessibility. The lower-level rack can rotate a full 360 degrees, making it easier for those with mobility issues to access all parts of it. You don't have to buy a new Whirlpool machine just to get the rack; it can be retrofitted into 24\" wide machines made by Amana, JennAir, KitchenAid, Maytage and Whirlpool. A complete list of model compatibility is here.The product grew out of an internal initiative known as AVID (Awareness of Visible and Invisible Disabilities), whereby company interns engaged in a design competition to create a more inclusive product. Company engineers then ran with the winning design, collaborating with the United Spinal Association for feedback, as well as conducting separate user testing. This design is a great example of a company pushing farther, of their own initiative, to solve more people's problems. With any luck, competitors will take note and end users will benefit.The Spin\u0026Load rack is available for $150.",

But every once and awhile I open my recipe binder (it creaks and a cloud of dust poofs out) and find one I love and I just have to share. You will thank me for this one! :) I’ve made this “pie” for years, but for some reason it’s been a while since I last did. And now that we’ve had it again, I’m quite sure I’ll be making it weekly. Or so. It’s SO easy. And insanely good. You will LOVE it. That is, if you like peanut butter. Or chocolate. Or sugar. This peanut butter pie is a great recipe for the warmer months, because there's no oven needed! But it's also a staple for a holiday meal.
