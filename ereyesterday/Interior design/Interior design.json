    "description": "When Apple's Smart Folio for iPad came out, it seemed pretty nifty. The tri-fold cover attached magnetically and offered a couple of different viewing positions. However, tech accessories brand MOFT (\"Mobile Office For Travelers\") has designed this Dynamic Folio, which makes Apple's offering look positively primitive. MOFT's origami-based design elevates the tablet to a better height for reading, viewing or drawing.It can also be hooked on your thigh for stability… …and even offers a place to perch a phone, if you're drawing from reference material. In short, it offers a lot more versatility—and it's essentially the same thing as the Smart Folio, just with angled creases rather than straight ones. It's a tiny design change with an outsized impact. As humble as this product is, it ought be studied in design schools, as an example of doing a lot with a little.The MOFT Dynamic Folio has been successfully Kickstarted, with 20 days left to go at press time. Prices start at $39, and they expect to ship in May.",

    "description": "This WP200Pro 5G, by Chinese manufacturer Oukitel, is a ruggedized smartphone. The company says the shockproof casing, aluminum frame, impact-resistant glass and reinforced rubber can take a beating, and it's both water- and dust-resistant. It also has a rather bizarre design feature. On the back of the phone is a small additional screen that can display notifications. This screen can be popped out and placed into a wristwatch accessory, and connects to your phone via Bluetooth. And, get this, the screen has an earbud on the back of it, and can be popped into your ear.They've done a real bang-up Photoshop job showing this \"Multifunctional Bluetooth Earphone\" in use. It will be interesting to see if this feature actually proves useful and catches on. We'll have to wait for the phone to be released; at press time Oukitel hadn't announced a price nor delivery date.",

    "description": "EASY and inexpensive ways to clean gunk out of a drain There are two simple and very effective ways to clean to clear gunk and hair out of your drains without using harsh chemicals. And with one method you'll have everything you need in your kitchen.  One of these drain clearing methods works better in the kitchen on built up foods and fats, and the other works well in bathroom sinks and showers where the clog culprit is most likely from hair down the drain. We used to grab the Drano (and an even more caustic product once -- never again) every time the water started to slow in our sinks. No more! These methods work every time and it only takes a few minutes to use each drain cleaning hack.  Why you should clean your sink drains Well I think most of us understand why. At least we know when sinks start to drain slow they need to be cleared out. But I'm guilty (and I think a lot of us are) of not doing it enough.  In a kitchen, there are fats, oils and other foods that gunk up pipes over time. (Did you know even pasta is bad for your pipes?) In the bath, it's the dreaded hair. And unless you're diligent and stay on top of it all the time, clogs happen eventually. If you're not treating your drains right, eventually you'll need to clear out the pipes.  And your sink will probably be stinky. Ever had a foul smell in the kitchen you can't place? This is probably it. Cleaning out the food goo and gunk This one is typically used in kitchens where you have the thick build up of fats and gooey food. I used to use the old school method of hot water, then baking soda and finally vinegar to clear a kitchen drain.  But years ago I heard of a more effective and even easier way to get it done...and I've never gone back! I try to do this every six months or so, but as we've already discussed...drains aren't usually something I think of cleaning regularly. You'll only need a couple \"ingredients\" to flush the built up food and fats in your kitchen drain.  First up, boil a saucepan full of water. If your drain is already backed up or running slow, you may need to do this numerous times or boil a lot more water to start: Read the full postThis content is property of Thrifty Decor Chick LLC.
