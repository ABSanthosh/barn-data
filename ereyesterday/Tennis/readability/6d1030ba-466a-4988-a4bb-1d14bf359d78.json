  "description": "The world’s best #NextGenATP stars are set to descend on Jeddah next week when they compete in the seventh edition of the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Arthur Fils, Alex Michelsen, Jakub Mensik, Shang Juncheng, Learner Tien, Luca Van Assche, Nishesh Basavareddy and Joao Fonseca will take to court at the 20-and-under event, aiming to follow in the footsteps of former champions Jannik Sinner, Carlos Alcaraz and Stefanos Tsitsipas. Ahead of the tournament, ATPTour.com looks back at some of their breakthrough moments as part of our Best of 2024 series. On Wednesday, we will focus on first-time winners, with Shang featuring. [ATP APP] Arthur Fils, 20 years old The Frenchman built on his breakthrough 2023 season with standout results at ATP 500 events in 2024. Fils won titles in Hamburg and Tokyo, topping the 2024 ATP 500 Bonus Pool. “I’m very happy about the tennis I’m producing,” said Fils after his triumph in Tokyo. “I’m working a lot and trying to build my tennis. I think now it’s better, from Hamburg to Tokyo. I still have to improve but it’s cool.” The 20-year-old cracked the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time in July, while he earned Top 10 wins against Hubert Hurkacz, Alexander Zverev and Taylor Fritz. Can he end 2024 with a title in Saudi Arabia? Alex Michelsen, 20 years old The 20-year-old has gone from strength to strength in 2024 after first gaining attention in July 2023 when he reached the Newport final. The American advanced to the title match in Newport once again in 2024 and enjoyed a run to the final Winston-Salem as well as a semi-final showing in Metz. Michelsen is proud of his development in 2024. “I try not to put pressure on myself this year,” Michelsen told ATPTour.com earlier this season. “I feel like even on the court, I'm always pumping myself up no matter what the score is. Win or lose a point, I'm saying something quietly or loudly to myself. I feel like the pressure hasn't really gotten to me.” Journey To Jeddah Hub Jakub Mensik, 19 years old Possessing a thunderous game, Mensik reached new heights in 2024. The Czech made a fast start to the season when he came through qualifying to reach the second round at the Australian Open. He then reached his first ATP Tour final in Doha, beating Top 10 star Andrey Rublev and former World No. 1 Andy Murray. Quarter-final showings in Shanghai and Vienna meant Mensik ended the season inside the Top 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings, having started the year at No. 167. Off court, Mensik put his head down and studied hard to complete his final exams in Czech language, English and Geography. “It was super difficult in that time. I was also doing final exams in school, so that was also a big part of my life, because before a Grand Slam I had final exams, and I had the elbow [injury],” Mensik said. “I was really, really, nervous… But I think that we made a good decision that I stayed focused on school at that time and skipped Roland Garros. “Of course, it was a difficult decision, but I have to say now that it was a very good decision. And after that, of course I was much more happier to play on the court, pain free. And obviously, with straight As in school.” Shang Juncheng, 19 years old Shang made Chinese history in September when he won his first ATP Tour title in Chengdu. By triumphing on home soil, the 19-year-old became just the second Chinese champion in ATP history (Wu Yibing, Dallas 2023). The lefty’s dynamic game style has caused opponents plenty of problems in 2024, with Shang also reaching the semis in Atlanta and Hong Kong. Shang owes a lot of his success to his parents, who were both professional athletes. “When I got into tennis, as athletes they both helped,” Shang told ATPTour.com at Wimbledon. “My mum played an individual sport, she knows how to compete by herself and then also having her team help her. My dad playing a team sport was a little bit different, but with physical contact, he knows how important fitness is and measures to help prevent injury, so I think it's really perfect for me as a kid to start like that in a family who understand. I'm fortunate they've taught me so many things, basically everything I know, and it's just really positive.” Basavareddy, Fonseca, Tien, Van Assche Shine American Basavareddy finished 2024 on fire. Since September, he won two ATP Challenger Tour titles and reached a further three finals at that level. Inspired by Rajeev Ram, the 19-year-old will head to Jeddah high on confidence. Brazilian Fonseca made his mark on home soil in Rio de Janerio, where he advanced to the quarter-finals at the ATP 500 event. The 18-year-old, who also reached the quarters in Bucharest, is thankful for the support he has received from Brazilian legend Gustavo Kuerten. “My first interaction with Guga was at the Davis Cup at the start of the year,” Fonseca told ATPTour.com as part of our Next Gen Influences series. “He said some really nice stuff to the whole team. [He shared] his experience, the way he managed his career after so many injuries. It is really inspiring and he is an idol. He is a really nice person and he has said some really nice stuff.” Tien lifted three ATP Challenger Tour trophies in 2024, more than anyone else competing in Jeddah. Van Assche, who played in Jeddah in 2023, enjoyed a run to the third round at the Australian Open in January. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
