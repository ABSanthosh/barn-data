  "description": "Tomas Machac arrived at the Abierto Mexicano Telcel presentado por HSBC in Acapulco as the highest-ranked player not to have won an ATP Tour title. The Czech changed that in style this week in Mexico, where he defeated Jakub Mensik, Daniel Altmaier, Learner Tien, Brandon Nakashima and Alejandro Davidovich Fokina to triumph. Machac, who is the third Czech to claim an ATP 500 trophy (the series began in 2009), alongside former Top 10 players Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek, is up to No. 20 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings following his run. The 24-year-old spoke with ATPTour.com about his victory. What does it mean to you to win your first ATP Tour singles title? It means a lot. It is something I never dreamed could happen. Especially at an ATP 500, so it feels amazing for me. I was working very hard in the past year, so I am happy I can achieve something that shows me I am going the right way. Could you take a moment to acknowledge some of the key figures in your life and career who have helped you to reach this milestone? I think the people around me who are helping me when I am struggling. It is very important because in those moments when the stress is in the court you just feel the good people around you will try and help you in your career. It helps me a lot as when I achieve those moments I will call those people and without them I would not be here. My family, my girlfriend and cousins. Plus my coach and my team. My chiropractor, my physio from Australia, my fitness coach. We are all working together and the result is going up and up. This is a milestone moment in your career. How will you celebrate this victory? I will celebrate with my family. I will now try to recover and be ready for Indian Wells as I feel a little bit injured but hopefully it is nothing serious. I have work to do and after I will celebrate. How would you describe yourself as a player, and how would you describe yourself off the court? I can be very aggressive and I can play defence, so I think my game is unpredictable. Sometimes I don’t know what to do on court and then I can play my best tennis. Off the court I think I am a nice person, easy going. What do you consider to be your biggest passion outside of tennis and can you tell us a little bit about that interest? I like to spend time with my family. When I earn some money I buy some nice stuff but the most important thing is spending time with the best people and the people that are trying to help me when I struggle. We know you enjoy basketball and have also said before you like reading and watching shows about history. Given how intense life on Tour is, how important is it for you to have interests outside of tennis? Those hobbies change a lot. Since then I don’t have as much time to read and I spend more time on Netflix and watching series. I like Peaky Blinders. This is one of my favourites. And Game of Thrones and these are shows I can watch and relax. I like to drive vintage cars too. What is your dream day without tennis? To spend time with the family and have a nice lunch and then walk to the forest to really chill down. Then it would be to watch Netflix at home and have a nice dinner. Nice and easy. You get to travel with this job a lot. If you could visit one place for a holiday and not for tennis, where would it be and why? I would say a nice island. I have never been to exotic islands so I would say something exotic. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
