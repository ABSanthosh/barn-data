The fourth seed powered to a 6-4, 7-6(4) victory, becoming the first Czech player to reach seven ATP Tour quarter-finals in one season since Tomas Berdych in 2017. With the one-hour, 43-minute win, Lehecka extended his perfect record against opponents outside the Top 100 in the PIF ATP Rankings to 8-0. ‚ÄúHe didn‚Äôt forget how to play,‚Äù Lehecka said of Cilic, the former World No. 3. ‚ÄúWe saw that today, it was a good test for me.
