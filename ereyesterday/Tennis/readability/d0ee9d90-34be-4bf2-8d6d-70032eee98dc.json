  "text": "World number six Elena Rybakina's former coach Stefano Vukov has been provisionally suspended by the WTA while an investigation into his behaviour towards the player continues. Earlier this week, Kazakhstan's Rybakina announced Vukov, who helped her win Wimbledon in 2022, was rejoining her team.But the WTA has confirmed to BBC Sport the 37-year-old Croat is currently banned after allegedly breaching the WTA's Code of Conduct. It is not clear whether Rybakina herself, or someone else, raised the complaint against Vukov which began the current investigation.Vukov denies any wrongdoing. \"While the WTA does not typically comment on active investigations, we believe it is necessary to clarify this matter due to recent public statements that misrepresent the situation,\" the women's governing body added.\"We will not provide further details at this point in time.\"The provisional suspension means Vukov will not receive accreditation for WTA events, stopping him from going into player-only areas which include the practice courts, other training facilities and restaurants.Concerns have regularly been raised over the past few seasons about Vukov's behaviour towards Rybakina.The manner in which he talks to her - on and off court at tournaments - has come under scrutiny, although it is not known exactly which part of the WTA's Code of Conduct he is alleged to have broken.On Thursday, he told The Athletic - which first reported the story about his provisional ban - that he \"never abused anyone\".Pam Shriver, a former Grand Slam doubles champion who coaches Wimbledon semi-finalist Donna Vekic, has been one of the most vocal critics of Vukov's behaviour. During Rybakina's run to the 2023 Australian Open final, Shriver urged the player to find a coach who \"speaks and treats her with respect at all times\".In response, Rybakina refuted suggestions, external Vukov had stepped over acceptable boundaries, calling them \"disturbing\" and \"fake news\".When Rybakina announced she was re-employing Vukov, Shriver used social media, external to call on the \"entire sport to finally stand up to known abuse and cult-like manipulations of players\".Vukov began coaching Rybakina when she was a teenager, guiding her to become one of the WTA Tour's leading players.The partnership ended before last year's US Open and she appointed Goran Ivanisevic as her new coach.What her intention to bring back Vukov means for Ivanisevic, the 2001 Wimbledon champion who coached Novak Djokovic for many years, is unclear. Ivanisevic's representatives confirmed to BBC Sport that he was working with Rybakina on a trial basis, which will be reviewed at the end of the Australian Open.",
