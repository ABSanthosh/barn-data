  "description": "Novak Djokovic won his first clay-court match of the season on Wednesday at the Gonet Geneva Open, where he overcame Marton Fucsovics 6-2, 6-3 to reach the quarter-finals at the ATP 250. The Serbian captured the gold medal at the Paris Olympics last July on clay but struggled in his first two matches on the surface in 2025, falling to Alejandro Tabilo in Monte-Carlo and Matteo Arnaldi in Madrid. However, the former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings was in control throughout his 75-minute win against Fucsovics. Djokovic dominated the physical baseline exchanges with his watertight groundstrokes, and was impressive on serve, not facing a break point, according to Infosys ATP Stats, to improve to 6-0 in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. \"My first win this season on clay,\" Djokovic said. \"It is great to break the ice in a way. It is a very demanding surface. We all know how tricky it is to play on clay, compared to the other surfaces, you always have to expect an extra ball, an extra shot. \"Here, a bit more altitude, so it helps if you have a good serve. Today I think that was my strongest shot. I had a high percentage of first serves, a lot of free points on the first serve when I needed, to get out of trouble. I think it makes life on the court a bit easier, so I am very glad to be able to play the best tennis when needed. All the way through, I was quite focused and pleased with the level of tennis, so hopefully that can continue tomorrow.\" Djokovic will head to Roland Garros next week, when he will aim to clinch a record-extending 25th major title. For now, his focus will remain in Geneva, where he is chasing his 100th tour-level title. The second seed, who turns 38 on Thursday, will continue his pursuit against Arnaldi in the quarter-finals. Djokovic will seek revenge against the Italian after losing to the 24-year-old in straight sets in the Spanish capital last month. Djokovic is making his second appearance in Geneva, having reached the semi-finals 12 months ago. Earlier, top seed Taylor Fritz made a winning start in Geneva, where he moved past Frenchman Quentin Halys 6-4, 7-6(5) to reach his third tour-level quarter-final of the season. The American, who suffered a disappointing opening-round exit in Rome to Marcos Giron, struck 29 winners en route to his one-hour, 37-minute triumph against Halys. Chasing his first title of the season, the No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings will play sixth seed Hubert Hurkacz in the last eight. Hurkacz downed Arthur Rinderknech 6-4, 6-1. Karen Khachanov advanced when Kei Nishikori retired in the second set due to injury. Khachanov led 7-5, 2-5 in the pair’s eighth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting (5-3 Nishikori). Khachanov will meet Sebastian Ofner in the quarter-finals after the Austrian beat Nuno Borges 7-6(2), 7-6(4). [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
