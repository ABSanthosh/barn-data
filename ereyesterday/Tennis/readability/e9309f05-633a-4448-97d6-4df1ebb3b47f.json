  "text": "Teenager Mirra Andreeva underlined her growing reputation as the hottest emerging talent on the WTA Tour by shocking world number one Aryna Sabalenka to win the Indian Wells title.Russia's Andreeva, 17, produced a composed and clinical performance to fight back for a 2-6 6-4 6-3 victory.It is her second successive title - and back-to-back victories at WTA 1,000 level - after triumphing in Dubai at the end of February.Speaking to the Indian Wells crowd during the trophy presentation, a laughing Andreeva said: \"I'd like to thank myself - for fighting until the end, for always believing and for never quitting.\"I tried to run like a rabbit because Aryna was sending bullets [across the net] and it was hard.\"Andreeva is the youngest champion in WTA history at this level - the highest tier of events below the four Grand Slam tournaments - and extended her winning streak to 12 matches by beating Belarusian three-time major champion Sabalenka.On Monday, Andreeva will rise to a career high of sixth in the world rankings.Andreeva has been tipped as a potential superstar ever since bursting on the scene as a 15-year-old at the 2023 Madrid Open.Former British number one Andy Murray was impressed enough to text a good luck message on her Grand Slam debut at the following year's French Open, while several former major champions, including Andy Roddick and Martina Navratilova, have been among many predicting she will be a future world number one.\"Andreeva is playing well above her years,\" said Navratilova, who was analysing the final for Sky Sports on Sunday.What is perhaps most impressive about Andreeva is her composure and ability to change approach when facing adversity.That skill was demonstrated again as the ninth seed, who turns 18 next month, fought back against the top-ranked women's player in the world.Andreeva lost the opening set after being unable to take any of five break points - meaning she had not converted any of her 15 opportunities against Sabalenka's serve across their five sets this year.Top seed Sabalenka, 26, saved three more early in the second set before Andreeva, using the drop shot to great effect, finally ended the unwanted streak to earn a break in the third game which proved enough to level the match.Andreeva's relentless defensive skills and ability to mix up her returning game created uncertainty in Sabalenka's mind.Three successive breaks at the start of the decider tipped it in her favour as she continued to draw mistakes from an increasingly frustrated Sabalenka.The youngster's attacking potency was illustrated with a cracking forehand winner on her first match point when Sabalenka served to stay in the match.\"It was me against me. I made a lot of unforced errors on important points and I just let her play a little bit better,\" said Sabalenka.",
