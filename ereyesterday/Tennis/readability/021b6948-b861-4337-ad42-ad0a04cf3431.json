  "description": "For this year’s Nitto ATP Finals, we’re thrilled to present Momentum. This special collaboration gives every tennis fan the chance to claim free, official memorabilia from our flagship event - and have their love for the sport be recognised. Here’s what you need to know: What is Momentum? Momentum is an eight-day experience where fans claim Traces: digital memorabilia from the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals (10-17 November). What is a Trace, and why would I want one? Traces are digital memorabilia that tell the story of the Nitto ATP Finals. Each of the 15 singles matches will have its own Trace, with a unique design created from official match data. Each is a keepsake that allows fans to relive showdowns between the world’s greatest players. Because they are time-limited, they are also a way for fans to prove: “I was there!”. How many Traces will there be? Momentum will feature 15 Match Traces, corresponding to the 15 singles matches at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals. There is also a Tournament Trace, which is claimable upon joining the experience. Each account will be limited to one claim of each Trace. All Traces are free to claim. When can I claim Match Traces? Each Match Trace will be claimable for 24 hours only, on match day. There will be eight claim windows in total, corresponding to the eight days of the tournament (10-17 November). Each window opens and closes at midnight in Turin (6pm ET, 11pm UK, 12am CET). Round-Robin: Day One (Sunday): Match Trace #1 \u0026 #2 Day Two (Monday): Match Trace #3 \u0026 #4 Day Three (Tuesday): Match Trace #5 \u0026 #6 Day Four (Wednesday): Match Trace #7 \u0026 #8 Day Five (Thursday): Match Trace #9 \u0026 #10 Day Six (Friday): Match Trace #11 \u0026 #12 Semi-finals: Day Seven (Saturday): Match Trace #13 \u0026 #14 Final: Day Eight (Sunday): Match Trace #15 What happens if I miss one? There’s no penalty for missing a claim. The joy is in the journey of collecting. How are Traces made? Each Match Trace is created from official ATP match data, provided by Tennis Data Innovations. We take this data and hand-craft visuals. On Momentum, the metric we’re focusing on is momentum - a TDI metric created from multiple data points. This is what we believe best captures the story of tennis - the push-and-pull, back-and-forth battle between players. What is the Tournament Trace? This special Trace tells the story of fans’ journey through Momentum. You will be able claim yours as soon as you join the experience. Over the course of the tournament, you will be able to increase the level of your Tournament Trace by collecting Match Traces. How do I get involved?
