  "text": "Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic are just one win away from setting up a juicy quarter-final in Melbourne after the pair progressed into the fourth round on Friday. This time, it was Alcaraz’s turn to drop a set, overcoming the loss of the third set to defeat Nuno Borges 6-2 6-4 6-7(3) 6-2. Djokovic then produced a rock-solid performance to dispatch 24th seed Tomas Machac 6-1 6-4 6-4 to set up a fourth round with another Czech, 24th seed Jiri Lehecka. Second seed Sascha Zverev continued his march to the second week, coming through in straight sets against Jacob Fearnley. He’ll face Ugo Humbert after Arthur Fils retired from their match when he was down two sets to one. Jack Draper and Aleksandar Vukic played their third five-setter of the tournament in the night match on Rod Laver, with the Brit coming out on top in a fifth-set tiebreak. Day Six 2025 Australian Open Round of 32 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Novak Djokovic (7) Tomas Machac (26) 6-1 6-4 6-4 Jiri Lehecka (24) Benjamin Bonzi 6-2 6-3 6-3 Jack Draper (15) Aleksandar Vukic 6-4 2-6 5-7 7-6(5) 7-6(10-8) Carlos Alcaraz (3) Nuno Borges 6-2 6-4 6-7(3) 6-2 Alejandro Davidovich Fokina Jakub Mensik 3-6 4-6 7-6(7) 6-4 6-2 Tommy Paul (12) Roberto Carballes Baena 7-6(0) 6-2 6-0 Ugo Humbert (14) Arthur Fils (20) 4-6 7-5 6-4 1-0 (RET) Alexander Zvereev (2) Jacob Fearnley 6-3 6-4 6-4 Alcaraz Blunders But Beats Borges I like what I’ve seen so far from Carlos Alcaraz, and he continued his impressive run at the Australian Open on Friday, moving into the last sixteen with a 6-2, 6-4, 6-7(3), 6-2 victory over Nuno Borges. Alcaraz set the tone early with a break in the opening game against World No. 33 Borges. And with his tweaked serve, he was dominant, losing just six points in each of the first two sets. Borges, who made the fourth round in Melbourne last year, fought back in the third set, coming through a marathon hold at 4-3, where he saved two break points. The Portuguese then missed a return on set point at 5-6, 30/40, but took control in the tiebreak, forcing a fourth set. The one chink in Alcaraz’s armour is that he can switch into low-percentage tennis mode (or highlight reel craving mode), which can lead to a flurry of unforced errors, and that happened in the breaker when he lost four straight points from 2-2. Alcaraz quickly regained control in the fourth, breaking Borges and securing two love holds to start the set before cruising through. Carlos’s 50 unforced errors are pretty high, so that’s a stat to watch. He’s playing with a slightly heavier racket this year (a lead added to the hoop, an interesting move considering he had elbow issues before), which could also contribute. I missed Rod Laver. I’m just really, really happy to be able to play here once again. I tried to show my best tennis here. For me, it has been a pleasure every time that I step on this court… The last time that I played here I lost [to Alexander Zverev in the 2024 quarter-finals], so I wanted to play here and get another win here in Rod Laver. I’m just happy to see a full crowd here watching my matches. It’s just a privilege to feel this love here in Australia, in the other part of the world. I’m trying to play different tennis, some different kinds of shots. That’s what makes me enjoy playing tennis, what makes me smile on court and helps me to show really good tennis — and try to entertain the people as well, making them happy. Alcaraz on his win. Zverev Foils Fearnley Sascha Zverev has a bit of a reputation for dropping sets in the early rounds of the Grand Slams, but he’s started in Melbourne flawlessly, bagging his third consecutive straight-sets victory with a 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Great Britain’s Jacob Fearnley.  The only blip on his record was his first loss of serve in the tournament, likely caused by the tricky weather conditions and Fearnley’s solid return game. Still, it made little difference, as he broke back each time, maintaining his momentum to win in straight sets. Based on what I’ve seen, if they meet, Zverev will be a real handful for Alcaraz. He typically performs well against him, so I would like to see that match, but Djokovic might have something to say about that. As for Fearnley, he played very well, and he’s now 77th in the world. He’s got a sharp return and has made fast progress from where he was a year ago. However, someone like Zverev is too experienced and has that higher base level, which allowed him to pull away at the key moments and get the job done. I think my opponent did a great job of maximising today. He was very aggressive, returning quite well. I’m happy with a straight-sets win. Much more difficult conditions to play [compared to previous rounds]. In the first few matches, there were perfect conditions, no wind at all. Today was obviously very different. Jacob is an incredible player, he went through all the stages – going to university, playing Futures, Challengers – and now he is playing on the big stage. I have massive respect for him. He will get better over the next few years. Zverev on his win Djokovic Dominates Machac Other Matches of Note I said in my previous recap that Alejandro Davidovich Fokina loves a five-setter. On Friday, he continued his comeback heroics, rallying from two sets down to defeat Czech Jakub Mensik 3-6, 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-4, 6-2, saving two match points along the way. The victory sent Davidovich Fokina into the fourth round of the Australian Open for the first time, where he will face American Tommy Paul, who beat Roberto Carballes Baena 7-6(0), 6-2, 6-0. Jack Draper channelled his inner Adrian Mannarino in the night match, winning his third five-set match in a row in Melbourne by defeating Aleksandar Vukic 6-4 2-6 5-7 7-6(5) 7-6(10-8). Draper has had questions about his stamina over the last two seasons, but winning three five-setters in a row is no mean feat, and I think he was the worthy winner in this close encounter. The Brit was down two sets to one, but he recovered and then shook off relinquishing a 3-1 lead (and breakpoints for a double break) to win the deciding tiebreak by playing braver tennis.  Draper’s reward is a fourth-round match against Carlos Alcaraz, who usually plays well against. However, after three five-setters, I think it’s even more of an uphill task.

He will get better over the next few years. \u003ccite\u003eZverev on his win\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eDjokovic Dominates Machac\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025.jpg\" alt=\"djokovic ao 2025\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025.jpg 1920w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-390x220.jpg 390w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-150x84.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201920%201080\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025.jpg 1920w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-390x220.jpg 390w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025-150x84.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/djokovic-ao-2025.jpg\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Matches of Note\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025.jpg\" alt=\"australian open draw 2025\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1332\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025.jpg 2048w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-1536x999.jpg 1536w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-150x98.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%202048%201332\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025.jpg 2048w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-300x195.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-768x500.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-1536x999.jpg 1536w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025-150x98.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/australian-open-draw-2025.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003eI said in my previous recap that Alejandro Davidovich Fokina loves a five-setter. On Friday, he continued his comeback heroics, rallying from two sets down to defeat Czech Jakub Mensik 3-6, 4-6, 7-6(7), 6-4, 6-2, saving two match points along the way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe victory sent Davidovich Fokina into the fourth round of the Australian Open for the first time, where he will face American Tommy Paul, who beat Roberto Carballes Baena 7-6(0), 6-2, 6-0.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Draper channelled his inner Adrian Mannarino in the night match, winning his third five-set match in a row in Melbourne by defeating Aleksandar Vukic 6-4 2-6 5-7 7-6(5) 7-6(10-8).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraper has had questions about his stamina over the last two seasons, but winning three five-setters in a row is no mean feat, and I think he was the worthy winner in this close encounter.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brit was down two sets to one, but he recovered and then shook off relinquishing a 3-1 lead (and breakpoints for a double break) to win the deciding tiebreak by playing braver tennis. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDraper’s reward is a fourth-round match against Carlos Alcaraz, who usually plays well against. However, after three five-setters, I think it’s even more of an uphill task.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eAustralian Open Day 7 Round of 32 Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao.jpeg\" alt=\"monfils ao\" width=\"640\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao.jpeg 640w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao-150x100.jpeg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20640%20427\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao.jpeg 640w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao-150x100.jpeg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/monfils-ao.jpeg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJannik Sinner (1) vs Marcos Giron\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMiomir Kecmanovic vs Holger Rune (13)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlex Michelsen vs Karen Khachanov (19)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrancisco Cerundolo (31) vs Alex de Minaur (8)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTaylor Fritz (4) vs Gael Monfils\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBen Shelton (21) vs Lorenzo Musetti (16)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLorenzo Sonego vs Fabian Marozsan\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eCorentin Moutet vs Learner Tien (Q)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
