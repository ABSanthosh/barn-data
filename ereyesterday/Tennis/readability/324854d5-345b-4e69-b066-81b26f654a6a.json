  "description": "Novak Djokovic tied Rafael Nadal for the most ATP Masters 1000 match wins on Friday with an emphatic return to the Miami Open presented by Itau. The six-time champion produced a rock-solid performance to ease past Australia’s Rinky Hijikata 6-0, 7-6(1) and snap his three-match losing streak. Djokovic, who owns the most titles (40), finals (59) and semi-finals (78) at Masters 1000 level has now equalled Nadal for most match wins (410) since the series’ introduction in 1990. “I was playing really well, at a very high level from the beginning,” said Djokovic, who improved to 45-7 in Miami. “I knew exactly what I wanted to do tactically. I played him in the first match of the season in Brisbane. So I think it was good to do some homework, look at those videos.” ATP Masters 1000 Win Leaders  Player  W-L  Titles  Novak Djokovic  410-91  40  Rafael Nadal  410-90  36  Roger Federer   381-108  28  Andy Murray  230-101  14  Andre Agassi  209-73  17 The 99-time tour-level titlist Djokovic is this week bidding to move clear of Andre Agassi (6) for the most titles in Miami tournament history. In the third round, the Serbian will face lucky loser Camilo Ugo Carabelli, who rallied past fast-rising American Alex Michelsen 6-7(3), 7-5, 6-3. Djokovic’s return to Miami for the first time since 2019 marked his record 501st match at Masters 1000 level. The 37-year-old was entering the tournament on his first three-match losing streak since 2018 after defeats at the Australian Open (retirement), in Doha and Indian Wells, but bounced back well on Friday in Miami. Djokovic looked considerably transformed from the player who hit 37 unforced errors en route to his first-round loss to Botic van de Zandschulp in Indian Wells, striking just three in his 27-minute opener against Hijikata. “I know that the stats and the metrics have not been that great for me post Australia,” added Djokovic. “Obviously it took me a little bit more time after an injury to really find that groove, find that movement, that rhythm, that striking zone. I love the way I was practising actually the last seven to 10 days and had some great, great sessions on this court as well. “I'm obviously excited to compete to keep on playing at the highest level when I play this way. Obviously it's always a pleasure when you come back to an amazing city like Miami after six years of absence and I've had this many people in the first match, so I'm really, really grateful for their support.” While Hijikata found his range in the second set, highlighted by an epic scramble in the tie-break to hit a winner past Djokovic, the former World No. 1 reacted in clinical style. Djokovic reeled off the following six points to seal an 80-minute win and improve to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The No. 86 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Hijikata was aiming to score the biggest win of his career, but was unable to convert either of the two break points he created in the match, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
