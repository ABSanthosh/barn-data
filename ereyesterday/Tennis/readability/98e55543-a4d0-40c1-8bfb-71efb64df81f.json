  "description": "Carlos Alcaraz may not have been at his best Tuesday night, but the top seed is up and running at the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam. The Spaniard was put through his paces, but prevailed 7-6(3), 3-6, 6-1 against Dutch wild card Botic van de Zandschulp to advance to the second round at the indoor hard-court ATP 500. Alcaraz, who was stunned by the Dutchman in the second round at the US Open last year, struggled to find his range throughout the testing clash. Yet the 21-year-old regained his composure to motor through a dominant final set and seal a two-hour, 33-minute victory. “I think [there] were a lot of ups and downs in the match,” said Alcaraz who improved to 3-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Van de Zandschulp. “Being set point down in the first set, I think Botic played a really solid match. Not too many ups and downs for him, really consistent throughout the match. I’m just really happy to get through. [I had to] be really focused in the tough moments, to keep pushing and trust the good tennis will come again. I’m happy to get through a difficult match and have a chance to get better in the next round.” Real steal ⛓️ Top seed @carlosalcaraz avenges his loss to Van De Zandschulp last year at the US Open with a hard-fought 7-6(3) 3-6 6-1 victory in Rotterdam! @abnamroopen | #abnamroopen pic.twitter.com/0KY7QGu0Gb — ATP Tour (@atptour) February 4, 2025 Despite boasting 16 tour-level titles, Alcaraz is yet to reach a championship match indoors. He will continue his title campaign against qualifier Andrea Vavassori or two-time titlist in 2025, Felix Auger-Aliassime in the second round. “It was different, it’s totally different when you’re competing than in the practices,” Alcaraz said when asked of the conditions. “I started really nervous, I think it’s normal. The first match in every tournament is never easy. I just had to get used to my first match here in Rotterdam. You have to get used to playing with a full crowd, it’s totally different. I’m just happy to get used to it.” Alcaraz, sporting a nasal strip to aid his breathing, found it hard to settle into the early stages of Tuesday’s first-round clash. It seemed as if Van de Zandschulp was going to capitalise on an error-strewn performance from Alcaraz, who hit 40 unforced errors in the opening two sets. Yet the Dutchman, aiming to record his first win of 2025, was unable to fend off the No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings, who roared back in the decider. Van de Zandschulp tallied eight doubles faults, including one to let slip set point in the first set. Van de Zandschulp was able to live with the four-time major winner from the baseline, and even found success when advancing to the forecourt. This was highlighted in the sixth game, when Van de Zandschulp outfoxed Alcaraz in a cat and mouse point at the net — the type of point the Spaniard has become known for dominating during his career. Van de Zandschulp hit two double faults when serving out the first set to gift Alcaraz a route back into the clash. The top seed came alive in a dominant tie-break, securing a mini break with a blistering backhand winner on the run. The Dutchman's double faults began to reappear in the decider. He served two in his opening service game as Alcaraz raced to a 3-0 lead. From there, the Spaniard produced some dazzling shotmaking to record victory in his 10th ATP Tour event on indoor hard courts. Holger Rune advanced to the Rotterdam second round for the third consecutive year after defeating recent Australian Open quarter-finalist Lorenzo Sonego 7-6(4), 6-4 in two hours, 11 minutes. The Dane hit 30 winners - including 17 off the forehand wing - to 27 unforced errors, a clear step ahead of the Italian's 23-39 mark. The fifth seed collected his 44th indoor win since the start of the 2022 season, second only to Felix Auger-Aliassime's 53. The 2022 Rolex Paris Masters champion next faces Spain's Pedro Martinez and will attempt to improve his break point conversion rate, which was 2/13 against Sonego, according to Infosys ATP Stats.
