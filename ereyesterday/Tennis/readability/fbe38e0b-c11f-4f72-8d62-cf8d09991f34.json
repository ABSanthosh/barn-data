Fritz was the first man to book his spot. He defeated Alexander Zverev for the fourth time this season, battling to a 6-3 3-6 7-6(3) win. It was a disappointing loss for the German as, given his form and ability, he should have won that match, but Fritz knows how to get the job done against Sascha and delivered yet again. In the evening match, Jannik Sinner cruised past Casper Ruud 6-1, 6-2 in 1 hour and 9 minutes. It was a total demolition job, with the Italian stronger in every area. I think we may have a similar outcome in the final tomorrow. Nitto ATP Finals 2024 Semi-Final Results Winner Loser Scoreline Alexander Zverev (2) Taylor Fritz (5) 6-3 3-6 7-6(3) Jannik Sinner (1) Casper Ruud (6) 6-1 6-2 Fritz Outsts Zverev to Make Finals Taylor Fritz has the wood on Sascha Zverev this season, winning four of their last five encounters and, more importantly, the two most significant matches – the US Open quarter-final and today’s semi-final. Fritz is the first American since James Blake in 2006 to reach the ATP Finals title match, and he battled through the contest to win 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(3). Zverev was the betting favourite heading into the match after his recent run of form, but he doesn’t seem to play well against Fritz. The opening set highlighted their recent matchups as the 5th seed broke early and controlled most of it. In the second set, Zverev fought back, levelling the match with some solid serving and saving the sole break point he faced to hold for 5-2. In the decider, both players held serve in tense exchanges, with Fritz holding from 0-40 in game five, Zverev saving two break points in game eight before Fritz saved two more en route to holding for 6-5. Fritz had lost nine of his last ten deciding tiebreaks before this one, but he garnered an early advantage and capitalised on three Zverev mistakes to take it 7-3. With little to separate the two: 15 games and 97 points won apiece, it boiled down to a few points here and there, and I think Fritz played braver tennis. Zverev played the better tennis overall but lacked conviction on the big points. Fritz is not a good matchup for him, but he needs to get out of just sitting behind the baseline and waiting for his opponent to make a mistake. I didn’t particularly appreciate how he hit his forehand either—it unravelled quickly, and he started hitting to make it rather than with purpose, which let Fritz get on top from the baseline. Fritz played garbage in the fifth game of the decider, making three terrible errors to slip to 0-40, but Zverev let him off the hook, which proved costly.  If you look at how Djokovic, Sinner, and Alcaraz play Fritz, he’s won one match against them in 18 attempts. This is food for thought for Zverev, and he needs to do something different the next time they meet. I trust my game, and I trust my level. I don’t feel anywhere near as uncomfortable in these situations anymore because I’ve been putting myself against the top guys at big events lately… I’m really confident in my game. Fritz on his win.

He won just one match during the indoor swing, his worst loss being to the 124th qualifier, Benjamin Bonzi, in Metz. A win against a sick Alcaraz and the out-of-form Rublev saw him a surprise semi-finalist in Turin, but his luck ran out on Saturday night, and Jannik Sinner took him to the cleaners. It was a complete demolition job from start to finish, and Sinner played like he was facing a club player. It was like a prime Mike Tyson facing the 58-year-old version of himself that took to the ring last night against a YouTuber.  Buoyed by the crowd, Sinner showcased depth, precision, and aggressive shot-making that Ruud could not handle. The Italian raced into a 3-0 lead in the first set and never looked back, striking 22 winners and committing just ten unforced errors. There’s not much else to talk about. Although Ruud at least fashioned a couple of break points during the match, he had little success as Sinner played like he had the ball on a string. So, yet another performance that demonstrated the ruthless consistency that has defined his 2024 season, will he do the same in 2025 or be forced to watch from his couch if WADA gets the ban they seek? I felt I was returning well in the first games of each set and then when going up a break I tried to be very concentrated with service games. I tried to be intense with each shot and I’m very happy with the performance and to be in the final again. It’s a very similar circumstance to last year as we have already played in the round-robin. I just try to play the best I can tomorrow. From last year to now I feel I have more experience and have grown as a player. Hopefully it will be a good day after a very positive week and a very positive year. Sinner on his win.
