  "text": "Defending champion Iga Swiatek cruised past China's Zheng Qinwen in straight sets to set up an Indian Wells semi-final with Russian teenager Mirra Andreeva.Zheng beat Swiatek on the way to winning gold at last year's Paris Olympics - but was no match for the Pole in their first meeting since.The world number two claimed the first set 6-3 and eased into a 5-1 lead in the second before bad weather led to play being suspended.Zheng, 22, improved after the delay and won two straight games before Swiatek closed out the match 6-3 6-3.\"It was a weird match with all the breaks and everything, but I wanted to be composed and really focused and I'm glad that I did that,\" Swiatek said.The 23-year-old, who is chasing a record third title at the Californian event having won in 2022 and 2024, will face 17-year-old Andreeva in the last four on Friday after she beat Ukraine's Elina Svitolina 7-5 6-3.The Russian stunned Swiatek in the quarter-finals on her way to becoming the youngest player to claim a WTA 1,000 title in Dubai last month.",
