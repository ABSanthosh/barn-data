Jan-Lennard Struff overcame Denis Shapovalov 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(5) to earn the winning point for Germany, which reached its first Davis Cup semi-final since 2021. The No. 43 in the PIF ATP Rankings Struff prevailed in a two-hour, seven-minute battle despite Canada’s Shapovalov firing 27 aces. Earlier, Daniel Altmaier edged Gabriel Diallo in a 75-minute opening set en route to a 7-6(5), 6-4 triumph. “Denis was playing amazing, coming out firing,” said Struff, who had served for the match at 5-4 in the third set. “It was a very tough match. He was serving so well. It was incredible. Second serves at like 180 km/h. It was tough to return. The court is very fast. “I had my chance [in the third set]. I broke him and served for the match. I didn’t play the best game, but he was there and hit some winners. Even in the tie-break, I went up 4/3 and he then he hit a forehand winner. An incredible match… I’m just happy to get over the line at the end.” STRUFF GETS IT DONE! 🇩🇪@Struffitennis seals the tie for Team Germany after a remarkable comeback against Shapovalov! 😱@DavisCup | #DavisCup pic.twitter.com/0DSurVrDgg— ATP Tour (@atptour) November 20, 2024 Germany faces a big European derby in its semi-final on Friday, when it will take on the Netherlands. “It will be amazing,” said Struff of the Netherlands tie. “It’s a big step for us to go from the quarters to the semis.

I think to win it in the end was key for that match.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
