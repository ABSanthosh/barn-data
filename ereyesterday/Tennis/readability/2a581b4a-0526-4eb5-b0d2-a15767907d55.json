  "text": "Cameron Norrie maintained his focus to beat British rival Jacob Fearnley in a French Open third-round match disrupted by loud fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium.Norrie, 29, was replaced by 23-year-old Fearnley as the British number two earlier this year, but laid down his authority in a 6-3 7-6 (7-1) 6-2 win.His reward is a meeting with former world number one Novak Djokovic in the last 16.Bangs were heard throughout the majority of the all-British match as PSG fans geared up for their football team's Champions League final against Inter Milan in Munich.\"It was hard managing the fireworks next door - that was the toughest part for both of us,\" said Norrie, who is ranked 81st in the world.\"I was putting my bag down and the umpire said, 'There's just a couple of fireworks. We'll just play on'.\"I was thinking it was just going to be a few in the warm-up, but it was at the most random times.\"Norrie - playing at his best level for a while after a couple of difficult seasons - used his experience to take control against his fellow Scot.The former world number eight managed to subdue French Open debutant Fearnley, who described the noise as \"brutal\". On the distractions, 55th-ranked Fearnley added: \"It's far from ideal but that's life. I understand PSG playing is probably a bit more important than this match.\"It's definitely not a reason why I lost the match.\"Fearnley produced a double fault on match point as Norrie reached the fourth round of the clay-court Grand Slam for the first time. After British number one Jack Draper outclassed Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca, there will be two British men in the French Open last 16 for the first time since the Open era was introduced in 1968.Norrie and Fearnley may have never previously met on the ATP Tour, but they are well aware of each other, having trodden a similar path into the professional ranks.The pair both played United States college tennis at Texas Christian University, with the older Norrie often going back to offer wisdom to the younger cohorts.Norrie has been a shining example to them by maximising his abilities to forge an impressive career - reaching the Wimbledon semi-finals in 2022 on his way into the world's top 10.Fearnley did not make his ATP debut until last year, turning professional shortly after completing his kinesiology degree. At that point, he was still unranked but has since made one of the sharpest rises in ATP history.Fearnley had not played on clay professionally until last month and Norrie - who beat former world number one Daniil Medvedev in the first round - produced another confident display to win.\"I was really able to play consistent kind of vintage Norrie tennis,\" said the British number three.\"Just playing seven out of 10 for three and a half hours - or as long as I needed to do that. I did it again so I was really happy with the way I performed.\"Norrie shared a warm embrace with Fearnley at the net after a three-hour contest played in bizarre circumstances.Almost 50,000 football supporters were arriving at the Parc des Princes - over the road from Roland Garros - to watch the Champions League final on big screens.Norrie had to abort his serve when he led 4-1 in the second-set tie-break, but refocused to secure a commanding lead.As well as the fireworks, the players could also hear car horns tooting and police sirens during the opening two sets.The noise subsided in the third set - as the football match's kick-off time approached - and Norrie cruised to victory.",
