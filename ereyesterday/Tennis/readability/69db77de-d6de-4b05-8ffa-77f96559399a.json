  "description": "Stan Wawrinka is back at the Plava Laguna Croatia Open Umag, where he captured his maiden tour-level title in 2006. The Swiss won the championship match that year when his opponent Novak Djokovic retired at 6-6(1) due to breathing issues. Fast forward to 2025, the 40-year-old Wawrinka kickstarted his sixth appearance at the ATP 250 on Monday with a 6-4, 6-1 win against Ecuadorian qualifier Alvaro Guillen Meza. It marks Wawrinka's second tour-level match win of the season and first since Bucharest in March. \"I won my first ATP title here, so it's always going to be a special place,\" said Wawrinka, who was a finalist in Umag in 2023. \"I came here early to [adjust] to the conditions. It's never easy, but super happy with the win of course.\" The former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings will next face Damir Dzumhur in what will be their their fifth Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting (2-2).  In other Umag action, fifth seed Mariano Navone raced past Tomas Barrios Vera 6-1, 6-2 while Nikoloz Basilashvili downed sixth seed Roberto Carballes Baena 6-3, 6-4. Chun-Hsin Tseng overcame Giulio Zeppieri 7-5, 6-4 and Terence Atmane defeated 2019 champion Dusan Lajovic 6-3, 6-4. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
