  "text": "Day Five at Wimbledon served up another helping of grass-court tennis as the third round got underway. Carlos Alcaraz extended his winning streak to 21 matches with a tough four-set win over Jan-Lennard Struff, while Taylor Fritz powered past Alejandro Davidovich Fokina to reach the second week for a third time. Cameron Norrie continued to carry British hopes, Andrey Rublev looked sharp, and Nicolas Jarry backed up his Rune upset with another strong showing. And for the first time all week, every match on the schedule was completed on time, with no rain or fading light causing delays—a welcome change after several days of suspended play. With the bottom half of the draw stabilising slightly after a chaotic opening few rounds, eyes now turn to who can emerge from the pack and whether players like Fritz can capitalise to make the semi-finals, or one of the outsiders can do a Vladimir Voltchkov. Here’s everything that happened on Day Five at SW19. Day Five Wimbledon 2025 Round of 32 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Taylor Fritz (5) Alejandro Davidovich Fokina (26) 6-4 6-3 6-7(5) 6-1 Jordan Thompson Luciano Darderi 6-4 6-4 3-6 6-3 Karen Khachanov (17) Nuno Borges 7-6(8) 4-6 4-6 6-3 7-7(10-8) Kamil Majchrzak Arthur Rinderknech 6-3 7-6(4) 7-6(6) Nicolas Jarry (Q) João Fonseca 6-3 6-4 3-6 7-6(4) Cameron Norrie Mattia Bellucci 7-6(5) 6-4 6-3 Andrey Rublev (14) Adrian Mannarino (Q) 7-5 6-2 6-3 Carlos Alcaraz (2) Jan Lennard Struff 6-1 3-6 6-3 6-4 Fritz Foils Fokina Fifth seed Taylor Fritz avoided another five-setter on Friday, seeing off Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-4, 6-3, 6-7(5), 6-1 to reach Wimbledon’s fourth round., Usually, we see the Spaniard diving around the grass courts, but it was Fritz who mirrored Fokina’s tumbles around the net, and he needed two medical timeouts, one for a cut elbow after a failed chase for a drop shot in the second set and another for a foot blister. Despite losing a tight third-set tiebreak after failing to serve out the match at 5-3, Fritz regrouped, breaking early in the fourth to secure the three-hour, 12-minute win. Fritz has played well so far at Wimbledon. He’s known most for the typical American serve + forehand combo, but he’s a decent mover for his height, and maybe he doesn’t look as smooth as, say, Alcaraz, but he reaches a lot of balls out there. It’s getting pretty annoying having to stop all the time. I feel bad for my opponent when I keep having to stop all the time, but you can only really do it on grass. I’m just really determined to get some of these balls, and eventually, I’m going to win one of these points. Fritz on his diving volleys. Alcaraz Slips Past Struff Carlos Alcaraz is up to a 21-match win streak after battling past Jan-Lennard Struff 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 to make the fourth round at Wimbledon. Alcaraz hasn’t had it all his way so far at SW19, and he faced a stern challenge from Struff’s powerful game but prevailed in two hours and 25 minutes. Alcaraz dominated the first set, breaking twice with aggressive forehands and deep returns, but faltered in the second, as he wobbled on serve. Regaining control, he unleashed a lot of variety in the third and fourth sets, and his Wimbledon so far is somewhat reminiscent of Federer in 2010. That doesn’t end well, but Fed was carrying a thigh strain that year, so if Carlos can cut out the lapses that echo struggles seen in his five-set opener against Fabio Fognini, he’ll likely be in next Sunday’s final. I was suffering in every service game I did today. Love 30, break points down. It was stressful. He kept pushing me. I kind of survived and I am really happy that I got the break and it was done. I knew at the beginning it was going to be really difficult. That I would have to be really focused on every shot and on my service games and return. I think his game suits pretty well to the grass. Big serves. Approaching the net as much as he can. I am really pleased with everything that I have done today. Fighting, running, making great shots. I tried to make the opportunities he gave to me in the match and I am just proud with the way I won in four sets. Alcaraz on his win. Other Key Matches Cameron Norrie def. Mattia Bellucci 7-5, 6-7(4), 7-6(4), 6-3 Cameron Norrie kept British hopes alive on Friday, defeating Mattia Bellucci 7-5, 6-7(4), 7-6(4), 6-3 to reach the fourth round for only the second time in his career.  All the talk leading up to the tournament was of Draper, but Norrie is left to fly the flag, and he has an admirable approach to all his matches, refusing to roll over even when being outplayed. Here, he weathered early breaks and leaned on the Court One crowd’s support to secure a crucial break in the fourth set, closing out the match after a competitive three-hour battle.  Andrey Rublev def. Adrian Mannarino 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 14th seed Andrey Rublev powered into the Wimbledon third round with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-4 victory over Adrian Mannarino. The Russian, who reached the quarterfinals in 2023, showcased his clean ball striking against a potential banana skin, as Mannarino has plenty of grass-court experience, but the Frenchman wasn’t able to counter Rublev’s offence. Nicolas Jarry def. Joao Fonseca 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4) Chilean qualifier Nicolas Jarry took out Brazilian João Fonseca 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(4) on Court 12 and the win puts him back inside the top 100. Jarry, who qualified with three straight-set wins and upset eighth seed Holger Rune in the first round (4-6, 4-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-4), used his powerful serve to dominate early, breaking Fonseca with baseline aggression. Fonseca, making his Wimbledon debut, fought back to take the third set with his gung-ho forehand, but Jarry looked stronger physically over the two-hour, 45-minute match to record the victory. Fonseca is explosive, and to make the third round at his first Wimbledon is impressive. If he can fine-tune his movement on the surface rather than trying to move on it like a clay court, then his game will be highly dangerous. Can it be learned? Maybe, but the best grass court players seem to intuitively know that small steps skipping around the ball are where it’s at.  Wimbledon 2025 Day Six Round of 32 Matches Jannik Sinner (1) vs Pedro Martinez Grigor Dimitrov (19) vs Sebastian Ofner Ben Shelton (10) vs Marton Fucsovics (LL) Brandon Nakashima (29) vs Lorenzo Sonego Marin Cilic vs Jaume Munar Flavio Cobolli (22) vs Jakub Mensik Alex de Minaur (11) vs August Holmgren Miomir Kecmanovic vs Novak Djokovic (6)",

I tried to make the opportunities he gave to me in the match and I am just proud with the way I won in four sets. \u003ccite\u003eAlcaraz on his win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Key Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3.jpg\" alt=\"wimbledon recap\" width=\"2722\" height=\"1814\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3.jpg 2722w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-150x100.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2722px) 100vw, 2722px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%202722%201814\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3.jpg 2722w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3-150x100.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/wimbledon-recap-day-3.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCameron Norrie def.

If he can fine-tune his movement on the surface rather than trying to move on it like a clay court, then his game will be highly dangerous. Can it be learned? Maybe, but the best grass court players seem to intuitively know that small steps skipping around the ball are where it’s at. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWimbledon 2025 Day Six Round of 32 Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023.jpeg\" alt=\"wimbledon info\" width=\"1200\" height=\"812\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023.jpeg 1200w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-300x203.jpeg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-1024x693.jpeg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-768x520.jpeg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-220x150.jpeg 220w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-150x102.jpeg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201200%20812\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023.jpeg 1200w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-300x203.jpeg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-1024x693.jpeg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-768x520.jpeg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-220x150.jpeg 220w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023-150x102.jpeg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/wimbledon-round-2-2023.jpeg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJannik Sinner (1) vs Pedro Martinez\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrigor Dimitrov (19) vs Sebastian Ofner\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBen Shelton (10) vs Marton Fucsovics (LL)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrandon Nakashima (29) vs Lorenzo Sonego\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarin Cilic vs Jaume Munar\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFlavio Cobolli (22) vs Jakub Mensik\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAlex de Minaur (11) vs August Holmgren\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMiomir Kecmanovic vs Novak Djokovic (6)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
