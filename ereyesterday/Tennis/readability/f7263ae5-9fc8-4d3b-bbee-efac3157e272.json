  "text": "Day Five at Roland Garros saw several top seeds advance, a couple of five-set battles, and one major upset. Jannik Sinner continued his strong start with a straight-sets win over Richard Gasquet in what was the Frenchman’s final match at the tournament. Alexander Zverev dropped the opening set before finding his level, while Arthur Fils fought through injury and a complete fourth-set collapse to edge Jaume Munar in five. The biggest surprise came from Alexander Bublik, who came back from two sets down to knock out ninth seed Alex de Minaur.  There was also a collapse from Jakub Mensik, who let a two-set lead slip against qualifier Henrique Rocha. Here’s a complete look at all the key results and performances from Day Five.

Richard Gasquet 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 Jannik Sinner decisively ended Richard Gasquet’s career at Roland Garros on Thursday, defeating the Frenchman 6-3, 6-0, 6-4 to advance to the third round. In his 22nd Roland Garros appearance, 38-year-old Gasquet couldn’t match Sinner’s powerful groundstrokes and precise shot-making in the one-hour, 58-minute match.  Gasquet’s only real success came at 3-5 in the first set when he fashioned three break points when Sinner was serving out the set, but he couldn’t convert and wasn’t able to see another chance on the Italian’s serve. Sinner now faces Jiri Lehecka in the third round after the Czech advanced by defeating Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 6-3, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2. Lehecka can compete, but he’s not the most resilient physically so I’m not sure I see him being able to live with Sinner. Arthur Fils def Jaume Munar 7-6(3), 7-6(4), 2-6, 0-6, 6-4 In a dramatic five-set epic, Arthur Fils, fueled by a passionate French crowd, battled through a supposed back injury to defeat Jaume Munar. The French No. 1 took the first two sets via tight tie-breaks, but a third-set injury left him struggling. Down a break in the fifth set and barely mobile, Fils unleashed ultra-aggressive play to clinch a four-hour, 25-minute victory. Was it a back injury or simply a cramp that he recovered from? Because in that fifth set, he moved with no issue. I find Fils hard to watch at the best of times, and when you pair him with a French Crowd who can get rather annoying, it’s a hard watch. Munar didn’t handle that well either; the atmosphere got to him, and he let Fils off the hook. Alexander Zverev def Jesper de Jong 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3 Third seed Alexander Zverev overcame an early setback to defeat Jesper de Jong in four sets on Court Simonne-Mathieu. After dropping the first set, Zverev found his rhythm, hitting 43 winners and breaking serve seven times in a three-hour match.  I didn’t have high expectations for Zverev, and while it’s still very early in the tournament, he’s played decently so far. Flavio Cobolli next. Alexander Bublik def Alex de Minaur 2-6, 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 The shock upset of the day saw Alexander Bublik stage a stunning comeback from two sets down to defeat ninth seed Alex de Minaur. While neither player is known for their clay court exploits, De Minaur is hard to beat on all surfaces, and when he comfortably took the opening two sets, few would have thought Bublik had the means to find a way back. Bublik, however, is having his best season on the surface, and when the Aussie’s first serve didn’t land with any regularity, he took control. Bublik will next face Portugal’s Henrique Rocha, which is very winnable and making the fourth round at Roland Garros isn’t something you’d have predicted. Henrique Rocha def Jakub Mensik 2-6, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 Qualifier Henrique Rocha rallied from two sets down to defeat Jakub Mensik, joining compatriot Nuno Borges in the Roland Garros third round. I had Mensik making the quarter finals here, but we’ve seen several times in his young career that 2-set leads are no guarantee, and he already has 3 or 4 losses in Grand Slams after being comfortably ahead. Novak Djokovic def Corentin Moutet 6-3, 6-2, 7-6(1) Novak Djokovic defeated Corentin Moutet to advance to the third round. Playing on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Moutet’s crafty drop shots and versatile play tested Djokovic, but the Frenchman couldn’t capitalise, with Novak saving a critical set point in the third set to secure a three-hour, five-minute victory. The Serbian has an impressive record against French players, and so far in Paris, he’s looking in pretty good form.  Forty-three winners today and 73% behind his first serve, so I like his chances of making the latter stages. Mentally I had to stay concentrated and prepared for a match like that. Corentin is a player who has great speed, it was a great battle, especially the third set. I saved a set point… At that moment, anything is possible. I found a shot to stay in the set, a good service. I think in general I played well, I managed to stay calm on court, which wasn’t easy at times. Novak on his win. Jack Draper def Gael Monfils 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5 Jack Draper emerged victorious against Gael Monfils in a four-set match on Court Philippe-Chatrier. As you’d expect, the fifth seed faced a raucous French crowd and a resilient Monfils, who saved an astonishing 11 break points in the fourth set alone. Despite trailing 2-5 in the fourth and facing two set points, Draper showed his mettle to break back and capitalise on Monfils’ fatigue. This victory marks Draper’s first Roland Garros third-round appearance and means there are three Brits in the third round for the first time since 1968. Who will go furthest?

Down a break in the fifth set and barely mobile, Fils unleashed ultra-aggressive play to clinch a four-hour, 25-minute victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWas it a back injury or simply a cramp that he recovered from? Because in that fifth set, he moved with no issue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI find Fils hard to watch at the best of times, and when you pair him with a French Crowd who can get rather annoying, it’s a hard watch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMunar didn’t handle that well either; the atmosphere got to him, and he let Fils off the hook.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlexander Zverev def Jesper de Jong 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThird seed Alexander Zverev overcame an early setback to defeat Jesper de Jong in four sets on Court Simonne-Mathieu.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter dropping the first set, Zverev found his rhythm, hitting 43 winners and breaking serve seven times in a three-hour match. \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI didn’t have high expectations for Zverev, and while it’s still very early in the tournament, he’s played decently so far.

Playing on Court Suzanne-Lenglen, Moutet’s crafty drop shots and versatile play tested Djokovic, but the Frenchman couldn’t capitalise, with Novak saving a critical set point in the third set to secure a three-hour, five-minute victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Serbian has an impressive record against French players, and so far in Paris, he’s looking in pretty good form.  Forty-three winners today and 73% behind his first serve, so I like his chances of making the latter stages.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eMentally I had to stay concentrated and prepared for a match like that. Corentin is a player who has great speed, it was a great battle, especially the third set. I saved a set point… At that moment, anything is possible. I found a shot to stay in the set, a good service. I think in general I played well, I managed to stay calm on court, which wasn’t easy at times. \u003ccite\u003eNovak on his win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJack Draper def Gael Monfils 6-3, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eJack Draper emerged victorious against Gael Monfils in a four-set match on Court Philippe-Chatrier.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs you’d expect, the fifth seed faced a raucous French crowd and a resilient Monfils, who saved an astonishing 11 break points in the fourth set alone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite trailing 2-5 in the fourth and facing two set points, Draper showed his mettle to break back and capitalise on Monfils’ fatigue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis victory marks Draper’s first Roland Garros third-round appearance and means there are three Brits in the third round for the first time since 1968.
