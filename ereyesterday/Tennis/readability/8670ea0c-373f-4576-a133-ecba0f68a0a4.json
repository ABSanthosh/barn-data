  "description": "Lorenzo Musetti smiles, visibly emotional. In the stands, his partner and the mother of his child is in tears. For the Italian, his triumph on Friday is more than just a win that has catapulted him into the semi-finals of the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. Musetti claimed his first victory over Stefanos Tsitsipas in their sixth Lexus ATP Head2Head clash to progress to his first ATP Masters 1000 semi-finals. He beat the three-time champion 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 with some brave serving, saving 14 of the 17 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. The Italian’s repertoire of shots is unique. He has an unusual technique that he likes to describe as ‘vintage’, with a textbook one-handed backhand that goes against the grain in today’s game. However, it is something Musetti is very proud of and he has no plans to change it any time soon. Quite the opposite, in fact. He says he still has plenty of fine-tuning left to do. “I think my game is a little different to others because of the one-handed backhand and I really like to mix it up and cut the ball... particularly here on clay I think I can vary it more,” he told ATPTour.com during the Latin American swing on slow courts. “Now I think the modern game is more about serving and the first shot... or serve and return. But that’s not the way I play.” Musetti takes pride in offering a different style. “I think people prefer a more vintage game like mine or like players with a one-handed backhand,” he added. “Now speed and physique make the game faster so I don’t think the slow, more technical game, so to speak, will be back in the near future,” said the Italian, who chose Wawrinka as his current favourite one-handed backhand. What about his own, though? “I’m not going to include myself in the list because I haven’t finished my career yet and I think I can improve it,” he said with a smile. “I’ve seen Henry Bernet [This year's Australian Open junior champion] and of course I like to see a junior with a one-handed backhand... I’m a fan of the one-handed backhand, but it doesn’t help you in the modern game, that’s the reality. It can complicate things for you, I think. But on the other hand, aesthetically, I think a one-handed backhand is better.” So far, Musetti has climbed to No. 13 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and he could break into the Top 10 for the first time if he manages to win the biggest title of his career.
