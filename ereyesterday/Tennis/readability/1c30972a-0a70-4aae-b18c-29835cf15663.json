  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Raducanu became emotional during her second-round match in Dubai on TuesdayA man who \"exhibited fixated behaviour\" towards British tennis player Emma Raducanu was detained and given a restraining order, Dubai Police said.A visibly upset Raducanu was seen hiding behind the umpire's chair two games into a second-round defeat at the Dubai Tennis Championships on Tuesday.Raducanu had spotted the man in the first few rows of the stand during her match against Karolina Muchova.The 22-year-old was approached by the same man, who gave her a letter and took a photograph, in a public area close to the tournament on Monday.Dubai police said the man was detained before Raducanu decided not to press charges.\"Following Raducanu's complaint, Dubai Police detained a tourist who approached her, left her a note, took her photograph, and engaged in behaviour that caused her distress,\" a police statement read.\"While Raducanu later chose to drop the charges, the individual signed a formal undertaking to maintain distance from her and has been banned from future tournaments.\"What happened to Raducanu and what is 'fixated behaviour'?Raducanu was approached by the man close to the Dubai tournament site on Monday - the day between her first-round and second-round matches.The man was deemed to have \"exhibited fixated behaviour\", according to the WTA in a statement on Tuesday.In psychological terms, this phrase is used to describe obsessive, unhealthy and unwanted behaviour.Raducanu was given a letter by the man, which sources in Dubai told BBC Sport included his name and telephone number, that she opened later in her hotel.Raducanu informed the WTA about her concerns and tournament security teams were notified on Tuesday afternoon.However, the man was still able to enter the small stadium where Raducanu played Czech opponent Muchova later that evening.Image source, Sky SportsImage caption, Emma Raducanu alerted umpire Miriam Bley to the man in the crowdRaducanu became very emotional after seeing the man - who sources close to the player said she had seen a \"number of times previously\" - and almost hid behind the umpire's chair in a distressing scene.After she told umpire Miriam Bley what the issue was, the man was taken out by security.Raducanu managed to regain composure and resumed the match, which she lost 7-6 (8-6) 6-4.On Wednesday, having left Dubai, she said she was \"doing OK\" after the \"difficult circumstances\".More on this story",
