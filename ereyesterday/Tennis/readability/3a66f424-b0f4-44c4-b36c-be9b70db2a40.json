Like Wednesday, a couple of matches could not be completed, with Mario Navone vs Learner Tien and Quentin Halys vs Pablo Carreno Busta suspended until Friday. Of the completed matches, there isn’t much to discuss, with perhaps the main story being Nick Kyrgios having to retire with a wrist problem when he trailed Botic van de Zandschulp. Are we looking at another Del Potro-type scenario?  With no seeds in action, every match essentially looks like a coin flip on paper, so there were little in the way of upsets or surprises.

Day Two 2025 BNP Paribas Open Round of 128 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Matteo Arnaldi Aleksandar Kovacevic 6-3 5-7 6-4 Rinky Hijikata Alexander Shevchenko 6-1 6-3 Jakub Mensik Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-4 7-6(6) Mario Navone Learner Tien 7-5 6-4 Joao Fonseca (WC) Jacob Fearnley 6-1 1-6 6-3 Jenson Brooksby (PR) Benjamin Bonzi 1-6 7-5 7-5 Dusan Lajovic Li Tu (Q) 6-2 6-0 Matteo Gigante (Q) Sebastian Baez 3-6 6-1 6-4 Botic van de Zandschulp (LL) Nick Kyrgios (PR) 7-6(7) 3-0 RET Mackenzie McDonald (WC) Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 2-6 6-3 6-2 Hugo Gaston (Q) Luciano Darderi 6-3 6-3 David Goffin Lorenzo Sonego 6-4 7-5 Nuno Borges Arthur Rinderknech 6-1 5-7 6-2 Gael Monfils Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4 6-4 Adam Walton (Q) Giulio Zeppieri (Q) 7-5 6-1 Quentin Halys Pablo Carreno Busta (Q) 6-3 6-4 Krygios Retires Mid-Match Nick Kyrgios’ return to Indian Wells ended in disappointment on Thursday as he was forced to retire from his opening-round match against Botic van de Zandschulp. The Dutchman led 7-6(7), 3-0 when Kyrgios could no longer continue due to a right wrist injury, sending Van de Zandschulp through to a second-round clash with five-time tournament champion Novak Djokovic. I had seen some clips of Kyrgios clutching his wrist during training earlier this week, so the retirement was not a surprise. Since undergoing surgery in September 2023 due to a full rupture of the scapholunate ligament, he’s been absent from the tour, and apart from his match in Brisbane, where I thought he looked good, his season hasn’t looked too promising. I wasn’t too confident that I was going to be able to play today, to be honest. Two days ago in practice, I had to stop because I felt pain in my wrist. I thought I could still take the court, but it just got progressively worse… I started feeling sharp pain in my wrist. This process has been one of the biggest challenges of my life. For my tennis career, it’s by far the biggest. The amount of work I put in, just to still have so much discomfort in my wrist… that’s why I got a bit emotional at the end. This is one of my favorite tournaments. After the Australian Open, all I did was rehab, train, and try to get ready for this event. I was two days out, having a great training session, and literally on the second-to-last point, I hit a forehand and felt a sharp pain. I had to stop playing. We’ll go back to the drawing board as a team and try to figure out a way to get through these matches. I would have loved to finish that match, even if I lost, just as a building block. But if I’m not even finishing matches, that’s a concern. Kyrgios on his injury. Fonseca Foils Fearnley The establishment hype train has gotten ahold of Joao Fonseca as their new pin-up, and he’s been the talk of the town so far this season. That’s somewhat justified given his win in Buenos Aires, and he took full advantage of a wildcard into the event, overcoming a stern opening-round challenge from Jacob Fearnley to claim his maiden BNP Paribas Open victory. The Brazilian prevailed 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in a topsy-turvy battle, rallying from 1-3 down in the final set to reel off five straight games and secure his second ATP Masters 1000 match win. Fonseca started strongly, but Fearnley, who has also flown up the rankings this season, responded with a five-game streak in the second set. He then broke early in the third; it looked like the tide had turned in his favour. Fonseca, however, refused to back down. A costly double fault at 3-3 handed the Brazilian a break back, and another unforced error due to a missed volley at 3-4, 40/4,0 gave Fonseca the decisive edge. It was a great debut. It was very difficult to play here. It was windy, and I think it’s the biggest court I’ve played on so far. I’m really excited about the way I played today. I stayed focused even when I was a break down in the third, and I’m happy with how I fought. Fonseca on his win. Other Matches of Note Gaël Monfils defeated Jan-Lennard Struff 6-4, 6-4 to claim his 10th win of the season. He will face 24th seed Sebastian Korda in the second round. Mackenzie McDonald upset Alejandro Davidovich Fokina 2-6, 6-3, 6-2. The American wildcard, fresh off a Challenger final in San Diego, will next face 25th seed Francisco Cerúndolo. Matteo Gigante rallied past Rio champ Sebastián Báez 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to advance and you rarely see clay courters perform well in Indian Wells.

I was two days out, having a great training session, and literally on the second-to-last point, I hit a forehand and felt a sharp pain. I had to stop playing. We’ll go back to the drawing board as a team and try to figure out a way to get through these matches. I would have loved to finish that match, even if I lost, just as a building block. But if I’m not even finishing matches, that’s a concern. \u003ccite\u003eKyrgios on his injury.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eFonseca Foils Fearnley\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw.jpg\" alt=\"fonseca iw\" width=\"879\" height=\"495\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw.jpg 879w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-390x220.jpg 390w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-150x84.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 879px) 100vw, 879px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20879%20495\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw.jpg 879w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-390x220.jpg 390w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw-150x84.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/fonseca-iw.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003eThe establishment hype train has gotten ahold of Joao Fonseca as their new pin-up, and he’s been the talk of the town so far this season.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat’s somewhat justified given his win in Buenos Aires, and he took full advantage of a wildcard into the event, overcoming a stern opening-round challenge from Jacob Fearnley to claim his maiden BNP Paribas Open victory.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Brazilian prevailed 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in a topsy-turvy battle, rallying from 1-3 down in the final set to reel off five straight games and secure his second ATP Masters 1000 match win.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp data-start=\"1380\" data-end=\"1676\"\u003eFonseca started strongly, but Fearnley, who has also flown up the rankings this season, responded with a five-game streak in the second set.

A costly double fault at 3-3 handed the Brazilian a break back, and another unforced error due to a missed volley at 3-4, 40/4,0 gave Fonseca the decisive edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt was a great debut. It was very difficult to play here. It was windy, and I think it’s the biggest court I’ve played on so far. I’m really excited about the way I played today.
