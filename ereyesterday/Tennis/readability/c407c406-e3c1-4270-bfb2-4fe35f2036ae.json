  "text": "The top half quarter-final matches at the 2025 BNP Paribas Open are set after Daniil Medvedev, Holger Rune, Arthur Fils and Tallon Griekspoor all progressed on a rain-affected Tuesday at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden. All four of the day’s matches were impacted by rain in some form, Medvedev having to deal with the brunt of it after a 4-hour delay, but he produced a high-quality display to see off Tommy Pauk 6-4 6-0. Holger Rune also produced a rock-solid performance, handily seeing off the in-form Tsitsipas in straight sets to make back-to-back quarter-finals in the desert. Tallon Griekspoor and Arthur Fils were the other winners, the former outlasting Yosuke Watanuki, while Fils ended Marcos Giron’s run, Day Seven 2025 BNP Paribas Open Round of 16 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Tallon Griekspoor Yosuke Watanuki (Q) 7-6(4) 6-1 Holger Rune (12) Stefanos Tsitsipas (8) 6-4 6-4 Arthur Fils (20) Marcos Giron 6-2 2-6 6-3 Daniil Medvedev (5) Tommy Paul (5) 6-4 6-0 Medvedev Flies Past Paul Daniil Medvedev collected one of his most impressive wins in a while, delivering a dominant performance against Tommy Paul on Tuesday night at the BNP Paribas Open, cruising to 6-4, 6-0 victory. The Russian had to deal with a four-hour rain delay and took to the court in his tights and undershirt to deal with cooler conditions. However, he started in red-hot form, winning the first four games of the match. Paul could hit back, playing some aggressive tennis, but after levelling at 4-4, he was broken when serving to stay in the set. From there, Medvedev took complete control, reeling off six more straight games to bagel the 10th seed who couldn’t find a way through him from the baseline, ultimately committing 31 unforced errors. Medvedev will next face Arthur Fils in the last eight. The Frenchman also dealt with some rain delays before taking out another home favourite, Marcos Giron, 6-2, 2-6, 6-3. We’ve actually had up and down matches so far that we’ve played. The first one was really close, then he beat me easy and now I managed to beat him a bit easier. I’m happy with my game. It’s not easy to play here. Breaks of serve — of course we still win more serves than we we lose — but breaks of serves don’t mean much here. So even when he came back in the first, I was like, ‘Try pushing, try going further.’ I managed to raise my level during the match, so I’m pretty happy about it. Medvedev on his win over Paul. Rune Ends Tsitsipas’s Run Stefanos Tsitsipas was one of my dark horses for the Indian Wells title, but Holger Rune had other ideas, taking out the Greek 6-4, 6-4. Like Medvedev, it was one of his best performances in a while, and he played aggressively to dominate in most areas of the court. I hadn’t realised before the match, but Rune led the H2H 3-0, so he enjoys the matchup, and it showed last night as he maintained his perfect record. Tsitsipas has looked rock solid since Dubai, but he had few answers. While he played well at the start of both sets, saving a couple of break points, whenever his groundstrokes dropped short, Rune took charge. The Dane also does a very good job of returning his serve, limiting him to just 57% points won, compared to 71% on his delivery. I also think slow, heavier conditions made the Greek’s game less effective, especially on the serve + 1 type play, as his serve didn’t penetrate, and Rune could load up on the returns. After earning his 16th career Top 10 win and first on outdoor hard courts, Rune will face Griekspoor in the quarterfinals after he defeated Yosuke Watanuki. I think it was an extremely good match from my side from start to finish,” Rune said. “I stayed very committed on my game plan and mentally I was very good. I think that made the difference, how composed I could start. Because Stef is back in shape I think it is fair to say. It was a cool battle. The tweener is the first thing I am going to check when I check my phone. That was better than I expected. I think my returning was very good and I focused on my court positioning because when you give Stef too much space on the forehand he is very dangerous. I had to really take control of the point. I have had good success against him the past but that didn’t mean it would [happen again]. I really took charge of the points and was really committed to my game. Rune on his win. Other Matches Tallon Griekspoor advanced to his first Masters 1000 quarterfinal by defeating Japanese qualifier Yosuke Watanuki. The first set was a tight battle, with Griekspoor edging it in a tiebreak, 7-6(4). After a rain delay, the Dutchman dominated the second set 6-1, as Watanuki’s energy appeared to wane. France’s 20th seed, Arthur Fils, overcame local favourite Marcos Giron in a three-set battle. Fils powered through the first set 6-2, leveraging his powerful serve and aggressive play to overwhelm Giron early. Giron, a Thousand Oaks, California native, has been riding a wave of support after upsetting Casper Ruud earlier this week and fought back in the second set, winning 6-2 as Fils struggled to maintain his rhythm. The deciding set was closely contested, but Fils regained control, breaking Giron’s serve to secure a 6-3 victory after 2 hours and 15 minutes.

The deciding set was closely contested, but Fils regained control, breaking Giron’s serve to secure a 6-3 victory after 2 hours and 15 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHighlights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eIndian Wells 2025 Day 8 Round of 16 Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1.jpg\" alt=\"indian wells stadium 1\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1.jpg 1360w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201360%201020\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1.jpg 1360w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1-150x113.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/indian-wells-stadium-1.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrandon Nakashima (32) vs Ben Shelton (11)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eJack Draper (13) vs Taylor Fritz (3)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrancisco Cerundolo (25) vs Alex de Minaur (9)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eGrigor Dimitrov (14) vs Carlos Alcaraz (2)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eFollow Us\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.google.com/publications/CAAiEIWj_HbxAgWPwe_H8PACjy0qFAgKIhCFo_x28QIFj8Hvx_DwAo8t?ceid=GB:en\u0026amp;oc=3\" title=\"Google News\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/themes/tennis-theme/assets/images/google-news.svg\" alt=\"Google News\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"120\" height=\"22\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20120%2022\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://flipboard.com/@perfecttennis/perfect-tennis-o1gl0gp8y\" title=\"Flipboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/themes/tennis-theme/assets/images/flipboard.svg\" alt=\"Flipboard\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"152\" height=\"30\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20152%2030\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\n\t\n\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/author/perfect/\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cimg src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png\" width=\"180\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png 2x\" alt=\"Jonathan\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20180%20180\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png 2x\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/perfect-tennis-avatar.png\"/\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\tEditor of Perfect Tennis and a big fan of Roger Federer, I\u0026#39;ve spent countless hours watching and analysing his matches.
