  "text": "Raducanu's Rome run ended by classy GauffImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emma Raducanu has lost both of her matches against Coco Gauff, having also been beaten at the 2023 Australian OpenEmma Raducanu's encouraging Italian Open run came to an end in the last 16 as world number three Coco Gauff proved too much of a step up in class.Raducanu, ranked 49th in the world, lost 6-1 6-2 on the Rome clay to American Gauff.For the first time in her career, the British number two had won three clay-court matches in a row to reach the fourth round in the Italian capital.But any hopes she could cause a shock against 21-year-old Gauff were soon extinguished.Like Raducanu in 2021, Gauff's sole major victory so far came on the hard courts of the US Open two years ago, but on Monday she emphasised why she is also a force on the red dirt.Gauff, who reached the French Open final three years ago, returned superbly from the start and also dug deep in service games when required.\"Emma is a tough opponent no matter what surface and always tough to play - so I'm happy with how I played,\" Gauff, a finalist on the Madrid clay last week, told Sky Sports.\"My level is getting better every match and Madrid was a step in the right direction.\"Today I think my forehand was a big weapon, set me up for a lot of short balls and a lot of good points.\"Raducanu, looking for plus points after her defeat, said: \"I just know that every day I'm trying to be the best version of myself, I'm trying to win the day, and I'm trying to get back to that.\"I didn't win on the match court today but I'm going to find a way to win the day still today. It was a tough one at the office, I just have to take a lot of positives.\"Why Raducanu will take positives to French OpenClay is a surface which does not come naturally to Raducanu.Like most British players, the 22-year-old Briton had less exposure to the red dirt in her formative years and lacks experience on these courts as a professional.Raducanu's meeting against Gauff was only the 21st clay-court match of her career - compared to 81 on hard courts and 20 on the grass.Therefore, it is no surprise she is still - by her own reckoning - finding her feet on the surface.Beating Australian teenager Maya Joint, Swiss lucky loser Jil Teichmann and Russia's Veronika Kudermetova to reach the Rome last 16 represented solid progress.Facing Gauff was a different proposition - and proved to be a reminder of the gap which exists between Raducanu and the world's best.While Raducanu's movement has improved on the clay, Gauff's high-bouncing returns and weight of shot proved difficult to cope with.Raducanu did regularly manage to get herself into the points, but the American's outstanding athleticism meant it was difficult for the Briton to dictate them.Nevertheless, Raducanu will head to the French Open - which starts on 25 May - in a positive frame of mind.Since bringing Mark Petchey into her coaching team on an informal basis, Raducanu has cut a more relaxed, happier figure at tournaments and it has allowed her game to flourish.She has won eight of her 11 matches with Petchey in her corner, working alongside Raducanu's long-time ally Jane O'Donoghue.How long the partnership will last remains uncertain.Tennis commentator Petchey and O'Donoghue - who is taking a sabbatical from her job in finance - do not appear to be long-term solutions, even if Raducanu will be keen to maintain what is proving to be an encouraging dynamic.Battle for British number one hots upFollowing a tricky few seasons marred by physical and mental difficulties, Raducanu's steady resurgence has moved her back into the world's top 50.If she had beaten Gauff, the former world number 10 would have reclaimed the British number one ranking from Katie Boulter after the Italian Open.Raducanu is currently 49th in the WTA standings, but another win would have pushed her into the top 40 - and above Boulter, who lost in the Rome first round.Boulter, who took over as the nation's leading women's player in July 2023, recently told BBC Sport that she doesn't \"feel any pressure\".But it is not just Raducanu who is closing in.It is a three-way battle that also features Sonay Kartal, who has surged up the rankings over the past year and reached a career-high 59th, pushing Boulter and Raducanu.Stearns and Sabalenka go throughAlso in Rome, Naomi Osaka's eight-match winning streak was ended by American Peyton Stearns.World number 42 Stearns won 6-4 3-6 7-6 (7-4) to reach the quarter-finals, overcoming a bout of on-court illness and an interruption from Italy's national air force display team roaring overhead.Italian sixth seed Jasmine Paolini beat Jelena Ostapenko 7-5 6-2, eighth seed Qinwen Zheng was a 7-5 6-1 winner against Bianca Andreescu, and world number one Aryna Sabalenka defeated Marta Kostyuk 6-1 7-6 (10-8).Russians Diana Shnaider and Mirra Andreeva also progressed to the last eight, while Ukraine's Elina Svitolina was a 6-4 6-2 victor against American Danielle Collins, who beat Iga Swiatek in the previous round.More on this story",
