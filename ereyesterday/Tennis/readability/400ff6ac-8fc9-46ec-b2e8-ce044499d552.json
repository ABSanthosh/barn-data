  "description": "Fifth seed Tallon Griekspoor continued his indoor prowess Thursday at the Open Occitanie in Montpellier, where he spoiled home favourite Richard Gasquet's final appearance at the ATP 250 with a 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 victory against the three-time champion. Boasting 25 indoor wins since the start of the 2023 season, Griekspoor trails only the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Jannik Sinner (33), for most on the ATP Tour. The 28-year-old Griekspoor was tested for two hours and three minutes by former No. 7 Gasquet, 10 years his senior. Griekspoor fought off six break points in the deciding set, including four at 4-4 that would have allowed Gasquet to serve for the match had he converted. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I got away with that,‚Äù Griekspoor said in his on-court interview. ‚ÄúI guess I was a little bit lucky there. A lot of second serves there as well, just a little bit lucky there. It went my way. Happy with the win in the end and happy to get another chance to come back tomorrow.‚Äù [ATP APP] Into the quarter-finals, the Dutchman will next meet countryman Jesper de Jong, who upset third seed Flavio Cobolli 6-3, 7-6(2).

Gasquet, who made six consecutive Montpellier finals from 2013-18, is set to retire at this year‚Äôs Roland Garros. He was making a record 13th appearance in Montpellier, where he owns a tournament-record 29 match wins.
