  "description": "Novak Djokovic reached another historic milestone on Saturday by capturing his 100th tour-level title with a triumph at the Gonet Geneva Open. The 37-year-old joined fellow ATP No. 1 Club members Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to achieve this feat. With his victory in Geneva, he also became the first man in the Open Era to win titles in 20 different seasons, further cementing his dominance in the sport. Only five men have captured more than 80 tour-level titles: Connors, Federer, Djokovic, Ivan Lendl and Rafael Nadal. Titles Leaderboard  Jimmy Connors  109  Roger Federer  103  Novak Djokovic  100  Ivan Lendl  94  Rafael Nadal  92 ATPTour.com looks at the three men to have hit a century. Jimmy Connors, 109 Connors was the first man in history to reach the 100-titles mark, achieving that feat in 1983 when he captured his fifth and final US Open crown at the age of 31. Still a dominant force on the ATP Tour at that time, he would go on to amass a record-setting 109 titles, including eight majors. Through his remarkable ability to maintain his high level deep into his career, Connors famously reached the semi-finals at the 1991 US Open aged 39. The American’s aggressive baseline game, built on flat, laser-like groundstrokes, was revolutionary for its time. His 109th tour-level title came in Israel in 1989, and he officially brought an end to his prolific career at the age of 43 in 1996. Roger Federer, 103 Federer’s journey to 100 tour-level titles was marked by dominance, resilience, and an uncanny ability to evolve with the game. The Swiss maestro lifted more than 10 trophies in three consecutive seasons from 2004-06, which was during his record 237-week reign at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. During his stellar career, Federer won 20 major titles, 28 ATP Masters 1000 titles and six Nitto ATP Finals trophies. His 100th tour-level crown came in Dubai in 2019 before he went onto triumph at three further tournaments that year, fittingly winning his last crown in his native Basel. Novak Djokovic, 100 By claiming a maiden Olympic gold medal in 2024, Djokovic closed in on joining the exclusive 100-titles club, but remained agonisingly at 99 until he rallied to victory in the Geneva final. It further showcased the 37-year-old’s extraordinary longevity. As well as his seven Nitto ATP Finals titles and 40 ATP Masters 1000 crowns, Djokovic holds the record for the most weeks spent at No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings (428). He took sole ownership of that record across the men’s and women’s games by eclipsing Stefanie Graf with his 378th week at No. 1 on 27 February 2023. With 100 titles and counting, Djokovic remains poised to add to his impressive collection and move closer to both Federer and Connors before he retires.   [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
