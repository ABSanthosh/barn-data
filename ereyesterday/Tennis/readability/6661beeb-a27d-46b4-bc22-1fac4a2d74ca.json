  "description": "Novak Djokovic has arrived at Wimbledon, ready to launch his bid for a record-tying eighth title at the grass-court major. The Serbian, set to make his 20th consecutive appearance at Wimbledon (tournament not held in 2020), completed a training session Monday and even shared a laugh with Aryna Sabalenka when crossing paths with the WTA No. 1 courtside. A finalist the past two years — only falling short to Carlos Alcaraz on both occasions — the 38-year-old will aim to go one step further and tie Roger Federer’s mark of eight Wimbledon crowns. Djokovic could also join Federer in another slice of history. The 24-time major champion is aiming to become the second male to win 100 matches at two different Slams. Having recorded his 100th match win at Roland Garros earlier this month, Djokovic now looks to improve upon his standout 97-12 career record at SW19. Federer notched 105 victories at Wimbledon and 102 at the Australian Open. At No. 6 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Djokovic’s most recent outing was a semi-final showing at Roland Garros. The Belgrade native fell in straight sets to Jannik Sinner, who now leads Djokovic 5-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. Djokovic, who secured his 100th tour-level title in May at the ATP 250 in Geneva, first lifted the Wimbledon trophy in 2011, with his latest triumph coming in 2022. The former No. 1 relished a 34-match winning streak at the All England Club spanning from 2018 to the 2023 final, during which Alcaraz won a five-set instant classic to end Djokovic’s reign. Wimbledon main-draw action runs from 30 June-13 July. The main draw will be made Friday, 27 June at 10 a.m. local time.         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Novak Djokovic (@djokernole) [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
