  "description": "As Joao Fonseca jogs on a treadmill, he receives instruction from his coach Guilherme Teixeira. But the direction given had nothing to do with physical fitness or even forehands and backhands. “Focus on reading books. Let’s try to finish this book by Sunday. Set a goal to do that because it will take you away from other things,” Teixeira said in Portuguese, as featured in our new ‘Journey To Jeddah’ video series, which includes behind-the-scenes footage of Fonseca and his team. One of the most exciting young superstars in tennis, the Brazilian is not leaving any stone unturned in his pursuit of success. The 18-year-old is full of immense potential and he already carries himself with a poise beyond his years. “I think I have great maturity and that’s because of this sport,” Fonseca said. “For sure, I’m growing up fast.” As fast as he is ‘growing up’, the Brazilian is equally rising in the PIF ATP Rankings, in which he is currently the youngest player in the Top 150, an impressive feat for a player who began the season at World No. 730. Fonseca’s meteoric climb kickstarted with a dream quarter-final run in February at his home tournament, the ATP 500 event in Rio de Janeiro. In just his second tour-level match, Fonseca raced past fellow #NextGenATP star Arthur Fils 6-0, 6-4. The match captured everything fans love about Fonseca, from his fearless shotmaking to infectious youthful energy. “He has a little bit of that childlike flair,” said analyst Blair Henley. “He might go for shots that you’re thinking, ‘Hmm, that’s maybe not the shot that I would choose to go for — maybe not the safe shot, but that’s what makes him so fun to watch’.”   Ignited by a lightbulb moment in 2023, which Fonseca discusses in the full video above, the teenager was aiming to be amongst the sport’s top eight 20-and-under players for the season and qualify for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The former junior No. 1, who won his first ATP Challenger Tour title in Lexington, Kentucky in August, has done just that and earned his place in Jeddah. “To play with the best eight players under 20,\" Fonseca said. \"It’s a dream to play with those guys in this tournament.” The Brazilian’s journey this season has been one of breakthroughs and growth, yet he sees it as just the launching pad. “My coach says a lot to me, ‘With talent and hard work, the sky's the limit,’” Fonseca said. .videoWrapper { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; /* 16:9 */ padding-top: 25px; height: 0; } .videoWrapper iframe { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }",
