  "text": "Raducanu gives coach '11 out of 10' after win over XuMedia caption, GB's Boulter battles to big win over BadosaBritish number one Emma Raducanu said she would give her coach Mark Petchey an \"11 out of 10\" after she secured a comfortable victory over compatriot Mimi Xu to progress to the second round at Wimbledon.Raducanu swiftly wrapped up the 6-3 6-3 win against 17-year-old Xu, who was making her maiden Grand Slam appearance.The Welsh teenager showed glimpses of the potential that earned her a wildcard in this year's main draw at SW19.But Raducanu quickly settled into her rhythm on Court One and showcased some of the free-hitting style she has enjoyed at the grass-court warm-up events.The 22-year-old has previously struggled to settle on a coach but brought Petchey - a well-known figure in British tennis circles who has previously worked with Andy Murray - into her team on a casual basis at the Miami Open in March.The result of that partnership, as well as the return of childhood coach Nick Cavaday - who stepped aside for health reasons in January - has appeared pivotal for Raducanu as she looked at ease and comfortable in sweltering conditions at the All England Club.\"I'd give him 11 out of 10,\" she said of Petchey.\"He's been everything the last few months for me. I've really enjoyed being around him. He's helped me so much on all fronts, tennis, off-court.\"Victory comes after a successful opening day for the British players with victories for Sonay Kartal, Arthur Fery, Cameron Norrie, Billy Harris and qualifier Oliver Tarvet.Sterner tests await Raducanu with a meeting against former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in round two but she smiled and celebrated with the adoring home crowd after wrapping up the win.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Raducanu is currently ranked 40 in the world and regained her title as British number one at Queen's Currently ranked at number 40 in the world, Raducanu regained her position as British number one at Queen's earlier this month.Generally looking happier and more relaxed, the 2021 US Open champion has reached two WTA quarter-finals this year and returned to the world's top 40.But, after a difficult build-up which included an emotional tournament at Eastbourne last week and having to pull out of the Berlin Open because of an ongoing back issue, Raducanu said she \"does not expect much\" at Wimbledon.But she quickly looked at home in front of a home crowd eager to support both sides with cries of \"come on Britain!\" from the stands.An immediate break of serve gave Raducanu a foothold in the match and more break points followed.But Xu, who is ranked just outside the top 300 in the world, fended them off in a lengthy third game, much to the delight of the Welsh fans in attendance, willing on their first player to enter the Wimbledon main singles draw in 20 years.Xu held her own and settled into the match but a slew of mistakes eventually handed Raducanu the first set.The second set began in much the same fashion, with an early break of serve from Raducanu.But this time Xu responded with a break of her own and a topsy-turvy encounter followed as neither player could hold onto their serve.Raducanu eventually held at 5-2 and that laid the foundations for her to book her place in the second round for the fourth time in her career.Raducanu jokes with crowd at 'favourite tournament'As was the case at Queen's earlier this month, Raducanu has appeared more relaxed and happy during this grass-court swing.Much of that seems to be down to the decision to bring back Petchey and Cavaday during a difficult period for Raducanu where she was targeted by a stalker during a match in Dubai.She was left in tears and hiding behind the umpire's chair at the tournament in February and has since said she is \"wary\" of going out.At Queen's Raducanu said she is happier when she can be \"free and expressive\" on court while her partnership with compatriot Katie Boulter in the doubles was evidence of a more content and care-free Raducanu.It was a welcome sight for the home fans after a period of injury struggle and uncertainty.Those smiles were on display again in her opening round match at Wimbledon, which she called her \"favourite tournament by far\".After comfortably sealing the first set, Raducanu even turned litter picker when she retrieved a champagne cork that had popped onto court, laughing and smiling at the crowd.\"It was a first!\" she said after.\"Pretty entertaining. I'm glad they [crowd] were having a good time. It loosened me up a bit at the end of the first set. I can't not laugh at that.\"More on this story",
