The #NextGenATP Brazilian Fonseca prevailed 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 in a topsy-turvy battle against Great Britain‚Äôs Fearnley. In windy conditions, the 18-year-old trailed 1-3 in the deciding set but then reeled off five straight games to earn his second ATP Masters 1000 match win and his first on a hard court. Putting his foot on the gas üöò Huge hitting from Joao Fonseca! @BNPPARIBASOPEN | #TennisParadise pic.twitter.com/xyQMrWN2pS ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 6, 2025 ‚ÄúI think it was a great debut,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúIt was very difficult to play here. It was windy, and I think it‚Äôs the biggest court I played on so far, so I‚Äôm just very excited about the way that I played today. I‚Äôm very happy with the way that I fought. I was a break down in the third, things were not very good for me, and I continued focusing on my game, so I‚Äôm very happy.‚Äù With his two-hour victory in Indian Wells, Fonseca set an intriguing second-round clash with 13th seed Jack Draper, whom the Brazilian will aim to upset to continue his recent rapid rise: Within the past three months, Fonseca has triumphed at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF and lifted his maiden tour-level title in Buenos Aires, either side of upsetting Andrey Rublev for his first main-draw win at a major at the Australian Open. [HOT SHOT] Despite the blustery California desert conditions, Fonseca started quickly in his maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting with Fearnley. He broke the Briton in the opening game of the match and that proved enough for the Brazilian to claim the first set. Just one spot separates World No. 80 Fonseca and No. 81 Fearnley in the PIF ATP Rankings, and the latter soon gave a reminder of his own recent progress with a classy second-set showing. The Scot, who was outside the Top 500 a year ago, put together a five-game streak featuring some pure baseline hitting to level the match. Fearnley subsequently rode his momentum to an early break in the deciding set, but he then produced a couple of crucial errors on serve. Firstly, he double-faulted to hand Fonseca a break back for 3-3, and he later sent an easy volley long at 3-4, 40/40 in a game in which his opponent secured a second, decisive break of the set. Fonseca wrapped his seventh tour-level triumph of the season having won four of seven break points he earned, according to Infosys ATP Stats. His victory was greeted with delight by the Stadium 1 crowd, many of whom had gathered at the Indian Wells Tennis Garden to cheer on one of the ATP Tour‚Äôs brightest young stars. ‚ÄúI just love playing with a crowd, so the support from them is very nice,‚Äù said Fonseca. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an honour seeing kids inspired by me, so just being here with them makes me more excited to play.‚Äù Another #NextGenATP star, Jakub Mensik, enjoyed a more straightforward first-round win on Thursday afternoon in California. The 19-year-old Czech downed Tomas Martin Etcheverry 6-4, 7-6(6) to reach the second round for the second consecutive year. Currently third in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah behind Fonseca and American Learner Tien, Mensik will face 22nd seed Karen Khachanov next in Indian Wells. Other early winners on Day 2 included Jenson Brooksby, who downed Benjamin Bonzi 1-6, 7-5, 7-5 for his first tour-level win since the 2023 Australian Open, and Gabriel Diallo, who saved two match points before overcoming Zhang Zhizhen 2-6, 6-2, 7-6(7).
