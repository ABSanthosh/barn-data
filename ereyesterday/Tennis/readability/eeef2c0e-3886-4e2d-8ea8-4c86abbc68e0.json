Mensik on Tuesday visited JISTOTA School in his hometown of Prostejov, Czechia. The 19-year-old, whose brother Lukas is a student at the school, later paid tribute to the students and teachers he had met. [ATP APP] Mensik wrote on Instagram: “I’m living my dream - I play tennis matches at prestigious tournaments, meet legends I looked up to as a child and still admire today, travel a lot, and get to know fascinating places and cultures. I’m incredibly fortunate not only to do what I love but, most importantly, to be healthy! “I know not everyone is so lucky, and I’m reminded of this every day, not only because of my amazing brother, who has autism spectrum disorder, but also because of his classmates, whom I had the privilege of visiting during class today. “These incredible young people are true fighters, facing adversity daily with remarkable effort, perseverance, and positivity. They work hard on themselves, supported by their incredible teachers and assistants, much like I work with my own team.” pic.twitter.com/XEkN1MMSNI— Jakub Mensik (@mensik_jakub_) December 10, 2024 True to the spirit of the holiday season, Mensik also made a call for kindness. “I deeply admire the dedication of everyone involved, whether students or educators, and I’m grateful to contribute in my own way - whether it’s supporting their rehabilitation, providing aids, or helping them experience moments that bring them closer to their dreams,\" he wrote. “I have immense respect for everyone at JISTOTA School, which cares for 76 pupils and students. Thank you, JISTOTA School, for the vital work you do. “This holiday season, let’s come together to make a difference. No matter how big or small, every act of kindness matters, and doing something is always better than doing nothing. Take a moment to support a cause close to your heart; even the smallest gesture can bring hope and joy to someone in need.” Mensik, who finished 2024 at a career-high No. 48 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will next compete at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, which begins on 18 December.
