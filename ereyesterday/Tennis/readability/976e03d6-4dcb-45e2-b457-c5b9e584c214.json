The 18-year-old won the Arizona Tennis Classic, becoming the second-youngest player from South America ‚Äî behind Juan Martin del Potro ‚Äî to win three ATP Challenger Tour titles. Fonseca defeated Alexander Bublik 7-6(5), 7-6(0) in an entertaining final that featured superb shotmaking from both players at the Phoenix Country Club. The Brazilian served for the opening set at 5-4 and again at 6-5, but was forced to a tie-break, during which he raised his first-serve percentage to gain an advantage. Fonseca and Bublik engaged in first-strike tennis, battling for court position and aiming for aggressive winners in front of a sellout crowd. The teen had two championship points on return at 5-4 in the second set, but Bublik saved them both with booming aces. The Kazakhstani wiped away Fonseca‚Äôs third championship point at 6-5, again with an ace, but the Brazilian quickly rebounded and flew through the second-set tie-break to earn a one-hour, 43-minute victory.
