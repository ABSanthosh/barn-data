  "description": "Joao Fonseca reached a new milestone in his soaring career on Saturday when he advanced to the IEB+ Argentina Open title match, becoming the youngest ATP finalist on clay since Carlos Alcaraz in 2021. The 18-year-old overcame Serbian Laslo Djere 7-6(3), 5-7, 6-1 in a heavy-hitting and dramatic semi-final, during which Fonseca relied on vocal Brazilian fans to push him over the finish line in Buenos Aires. \"Really special,\" Fonseca said when reflecting on the win. \"Today was really difficult, against a really good player. He went through qualies, so he's playing amazing tennis. We already knew how Laslo can play, he won an ATP 500 [in 2019]. So, I played my best. Today was with my heart. Today was with pain. And we got through. There is one match to go, so let's go for it.\" Fonseca served for the match at 5-3 in the second set, but played a loose game and was broken by the 29-year-old. Aiming to quickly rebound, the teenager held his first match point on return in the next game, but missed a backhand long to let slip his chance. Djere tallied four consecutive games, sending the match into a decider. It was another physical test for Fonseca, who in the quarter-finals saved two match points en route to a two-hour, 54-minute win against Mariano Navone.
