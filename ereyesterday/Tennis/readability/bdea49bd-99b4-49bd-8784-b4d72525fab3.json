  "text": "In the latest edition of Second Serve, our new weekly snapshot of the tours, BBC senior journalist Amy Lofthouse looks at how the start of the clay-court season has unfolded.Iga Swiatek is set for a mammoth few months.The world number two is defending 4,195 points during the clay-court season after her astonishing 2024, which saw her win every tournament on the surface bar the Stuttgart Open. Even then, she reached the semi-finals.Poland's Swiatek won both WTA 1,000 titles in Madrid and Italy, before picking up another 2,000 points from defending her French Open title.Simply put, she's defending 54% of her 7,276 points over the next six weeks - and world number three Jessica Pegula, breathing down her neck, is defending none.Clay is Swiatek's best surface, the slower conditions giving her more time on her pacey forehand, backed up by her superb movement around the court.But it's been a tricky year for Swiatek. She lost in the Australian Open semi-finals from match point up, was stunned at the Miami Open by Filipina teenager Alexandra Eala and has cut a stressed, irritable figure on court.Swiatek has also had to deal with an upsetting incident off the court, being verbally abused by an \"aggressive and taunting fan\" in Miami.A return to her favoured clay might provide a reset for her - as Carlos Alcaraz has shown.Like Swiatek, Alcaraz is the defending French Open champion. He too has had a mixed start to the year. He too had a surprise loss in Miami and, like Swiatek, has a tendency to be overly self-critical.The new Monte Carlo champion did not have it all his own way on his run to the title. His quarter-final against Arthur Fils was a tricky, tight encounter, and the Spaniard was second-best in the early stages of the final against Lorenzo Musetti.But Alcaraz found a way through and, ultimately, a way to win. That is something Swiatek can emulate this week in Stuttgart and beyond.Katie Boulter and Jodie Burrage teamed up in a brilliant doubles performance to secure Great Britain's place in September's Billie Jean King Cup Finals.Emma Raducanu is in talks with former player turned commentator Mark Petchy about appointing him as her new coach.The legendary Billie Jean King received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.There has been very little movement on the WTA side, with players either practising or competing at the Billie Jean King Cup, which does not offer ranking points.On the men's side, Lorenzo Musetti's Monte Carlo run has left him knocking on the door of the world's top 10.Owner of a one-handed backhand - one of the most beautiful sights in tennis - Musetti beat defending champion Stefanos Tsitsipas and 10th-ranked Alex de Minaur to reach the final. He will be hoping the thigh injury that hampered him against Alcaraz will not hold up his clay season too much.The Stuttgart Open, where the winner walks away with a new Porsche, is the big event on the WTA Tour this week.Seven of the world's top 10 are there, including Aryna Sabalenka, Jessica Pegula and Mirra Andreeva.Former US Open champion Bianca Andreescu, who has been plagued by injury since her 2019 win, is set to make her first appearance of the year at the Open de Rouen in France.On the men's side, Alcaraz heads up the Barcelona Open field, alongside defending champion Casper Ruud and Andrey Rublev, while Alexander Zverev is top seed at the Munich Open.British doubles pair Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool began their clay swing strongly, reaching the final of the Monte Carlo Masters.The duo won the first set but ultimately fell 1-6 7-6 (10-8) 10-8 to home favourite Romain Arneodo and France's Manuel Guinard.Henry Patten and Finnish partner Harri Heliovaara also reached the semi-finals in Monaco, losing to the eventual champions, while Giles Hussey triumphed at the ITF M15 in Monastir.Sonay Kartal, fresh from her impressive BJK Cup debut, is the eighth seed at the Open de Rouen, with Harriet Dart also competing.Cameron Norrie came through qualifying to reach the main draw in Barcelona. Jacob Fearnley lost in the last round but is into the main draw as a lucky loser, as is Billy Harris in Munich.Elsewhere, Lucy Shuker and Ben Bartram are among four Britons in the wheelchair singles and doubles at the Japan Open.With so many professional tennis tournaments taking place across the world, and across so many levels, it can be hard to keep up with everything from one week to the next.As part of BBC Sport's commitment to offer more for tennis fans, Second Serve will be your weekly round-up of the biggest stories in the sport.As well as the main talking point, you can see which ATP and WTA players are making significant progress - or struggling for form, how the British contingent are doing and what the next stops on the calendars are.You can also sign up to get the latest tennis news from BBC Sport delivered straight to your mobile phone.",
