  "description": "Ben Shelton has rapidly established himself as one of the ATP Tour’s most electrifying young stars in recent years, and his booming lefty serve is a major reason why. The 22-year-old American has put himself in the limelight by clocking jaw-dropping speeds off the racquet. But even Shelton learned on Saturday night at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells that raw power alone doesn’t always win the point. Tennis fans will remember Shelton’s firepower at the 2023 US Open, where he uncorked a 149 mph ace down the T — the fastest serve of the tournament — against countryman Tommy Paul. But in his second-round clash with Argentine Mariano Navone in Indian Wells on Saturday, Shelton took it a step further by hitting the 150 mph mark with a stinging serve through the middle. The problem? Navone’s reactions. Navone blocked the body serve with a chipped forehand return, allowing him into the point. Shelton continued on the front foot by pulling Navone out wide, but the Argentine landed a pinpoint backhand at his opponent's feet, quickly rushing up to an attempted half volley and picking Shelton off with a forehand winner. Shelton ultimately got the last laugh, however. The No. 12 in the PIF ATP Rankings claimed a 6-3, 6-2 victory over the Argentine and set a third-round meeting with 22nd seed Karen Khachanov, which will be their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head contest.
