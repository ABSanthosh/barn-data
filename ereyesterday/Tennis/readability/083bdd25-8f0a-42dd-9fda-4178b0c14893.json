  "description": "Just one day after news broke of Stefanos Tsitsipas’ new partnership with the former No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Goran Ivanisevic, the Greek star publicly shared his excitement. “I’m happy to begin a new chapter with Goran Ivanisevic joining my team as coach,” Tsitsipas wrote in a statement on Instagram Stories. “Goran’s experience, passion for the sport, and champion’s mindset are things I greatly respect, and I’m looking forward to the journey ahead with him by my side. I’m optimistic about what we can build together.” Ivanisevic was a standout player — earning his place in the International Tennis Hall of Fame — and also helped Novak Djokovic to great heights as the Serbian’s longtime coach. The 26-year-old Tsitsipas also thanked coaches Kerei Abakar and Dimitris Chatzinikolaou for their help. “I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude too Kerei and Dimitris for their dedication, support, and work over the past few months,” Tsitsipas wrote. “Working with them has been a meaningful chapter in my journey, and I’m deeply thankful for the effort and commitment they brought to the team.” Tsitsipas owns an 18-11 record this season according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. He is No. 26 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
