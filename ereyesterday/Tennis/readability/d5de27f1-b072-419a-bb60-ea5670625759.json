  "description": "The men's singles final between Novak Djokovic and Jakub Mensik was scheduled for not before 3 p.m. local time (EDT) on Sunday, but play was delayed due to rain. The women's doubles competitors completed their final just shy of 8:15 p.m. local time, leaving the men's singles final to complete the tournament. The women’s doubles final was scheduled first inside Hard Rock Stadium, but play was suspended in that match after three games due to rain. They resumed their clash just after 6:45 p.m. in Miami.  Both Djokovic and Mensik will be chasing a milestone title in Sunday’s clash at Hard Rock Stadium. By lifting the trophy, the 37-year-old Djokovic would become just the third man, after Jimmy Connors and Roger Federer, to lift 100 tour-level titles. It would also be a record seventh Miami triumph for the Serbian, who is currently tied with his fellow ATP No. 1 Club member Andre Agassi on six titles won at the Florida event. Meanwhile #NextGenATP star Mensik is aiming to become an ATP Tour champion for the first time at the age of 19. The Czech would be just the fourth player to win their maiden tour-level title at an ATP Masters 1000 event, and the first since 2001.
