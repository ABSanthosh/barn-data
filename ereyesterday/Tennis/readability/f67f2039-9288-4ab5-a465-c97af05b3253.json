  "description": "If Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz are to renew their rivalry at Roland Garros, it will not come until the final, setting the stage for a potential epic showdown on championship Sunday. The 23-year-old Sinner, aiming for his first Roland Garros triumph, is the top seed in Paris while defending champion Alcaraz will be seeded second, anchoring the bottom half of the draw. It marks the youngest top two seeds at a major since the 2006 US Open, when a 25-year-old Roger Federer and 20-year-old Rafael Nadal led the field. This fortnight will also mark the first time since 2005 Wimbledon (Federer, 23, and Andy Roddick, 22) that the top two seeds at a major are both 23 or younger. Last year, Alcaraz defeated Sinner in the Roland Garros semi-finals en route to becoming the youngest man to earn a major trophy on all three surfaces. To clinch the title, the Spaniard won a five-set final against Alexander Zverev. Alcaraz and Sinner’s latest chapter in their thrilling rivalry came on Sunday at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome. The 22-year-old Alcaraz defeated the World No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings 7-6(5), 6-1 in the final, ending the Italian’s 26-match winning streak. Alcaraz improved to 7-4 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, having won their past four encounters. The Roland Garros main draw will be made on Thursday 22 May at 2 p.m. local time.
