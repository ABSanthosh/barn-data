  "text": "Jack Draper overcame a slow start to beat Jenson Brooksby and reach the Indian Wells fourth round.Britain's Draper was 4-1 down in the first set but found his rhythm to beat the tricky American 7-5 6-4 in 26C conditions in California.Brooksby is now ranked 937 in the world as he makes his way back from a 13-month ban for missing three doping tests, and a lengthy shoulder injury.The two embraced at the net after the match, with Draper writing \"good to have a great player back\" on the camera lens.\"Jenson is a very different kind of player, he changes the spins and speeds very well, and makes life uncomfortable for all the players on the tour,\" said Draper.\"It was really difficult and I solved a bit of a puzzle out there.\"Draper, seeded 13th, will face former champion Taylor Fritz next after the American beat Chile's Alejandro Tabilo 4-6 6-3 6-1.Draper's only two losses this year have come against Carlos Alcaraz in the Australian Open fourth round - where he had to retire with injury - and the Qatar Open final against Andrey Rublev.He adapted well against Brooksby - an unorthodox player with a variety of shots to trouble most opponents.Draper was broken in his first service game of the match, with Brooksby targeting his backhand, but he adapted well to the American's tempo.After missing a break-back point at 4-2 on Brooksby's serve, Draper tossed his racquet away in frustration - but that seemed to refocus him and he took his next break opportunity to force the set back on serve.A smash at the net allowed Draper to break and serve for the first set, which he wrapped up with an ace.He kept the pressure on in the second, breaking early before serving out victory in one hour and 42 minutes.\"It wasn't my most clinical or cleanest performance, but it is part and parcel of being a tennis player and playing these kind of matches,\" added Draper.\"I feel I'm hitting the ball and feeling confident, but it is nice knowing you can win against a tough opponent despite not playing your best.\"Draper has also decided to play doubles in Indian Wells alongside Czech player Tomas Machac, explaining he believes it will enhance his singles game.\"I want to keep on being aggressive and keep improving my net game - playing doubles here and there at the right time of the year will only help,\" he said.Carlos Alcaraz, who is seeking to win the tournament for the third consecutive year, sailed through to the fourth round with a straight-set win over Denis Shapovalov.The Spaniard needed 93 minutes to wrap up a 6-2 6-4 win against the Canadian.\"I didn't feel as many nerves as I did in the second round,\" he said.\"I was more relaxed, I was calm, so could think much better - hopefully it will continue like this.\"The 21-year-old, who is seeded second, will face 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria in the next round.Dimitrov came through a gritty 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 7-6 (7-2) match against France's Gael Monfils to secure his spot.Elsewhere, ninth seed Alex de Minaur of Australia progressed thanks to a 6-4 6-0 win against Poland's Hubert Hurkacz.Argentina's Francisco Cerundolo knocked out Dutch lucky loser Botic van de Zandschulp 6-3 6-4 while American Brandon Nakashima eased to a 6-2 6-4 win against Italy's Matteo Arnaldi.",
