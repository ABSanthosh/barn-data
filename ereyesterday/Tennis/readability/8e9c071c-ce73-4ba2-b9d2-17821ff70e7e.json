But right now I feel it's time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal, and to rediscover the joy of simply living.\"Jabeur has been as high as number two in the rankings but has now dropped to 71st.A two-time Wimbledon runner-up, she retired from her first round match at the All England Club this year as she struggled on the tournament's hottest ever opening day.Following her Wimbledon exit, Jabeur said: \"I'm pretty sad, it really doesn't really help with my confidence and what I keep pushing myself to do, even though it has been a very tough season for me.\"She added she would rest and just \"try to disconnect a little bit from tennis\" and spend some time with her family.More on this story",
