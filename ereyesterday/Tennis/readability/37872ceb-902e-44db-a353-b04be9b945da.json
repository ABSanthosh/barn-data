  "description": "Just 22 months after winning the 1978 NCAA singles title while competing for Stanford University, John McEnroe ascended to the top of the tennis world. A player’s journey from college tennis to the sport’s biggest stages can take years — if it happens at all. But for McEnroe, the rise was meteoric. He found quick success at the pro level, becoming the fifth player to reach No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings on 3 March 1980. The fiery left-hander defeated rival Jimmy Connors in the Memphis final to leapfrog Bjorn Borg for the top spot. In historic fashion, McEnroe became the sport’s first dual No. 1, having been at the top of the doubles game for 49 weeks since 23 April 1979. “To look and go, ‘Oh my God, there’s not one person above me is not something when I was growing up that I was expecting to happen,\" said McEnroe. \"It was quite surprising to look at my name and below it be like Bjorn Borg and Jimmy Connors.\" McEnroe’s ascent to the pinnacle of tennis came following a standout 1979 season in which he won 10 singles titles and 17 doubles crowns that year — an Open Era record. McEnroe boasted a 98-12 singles record that season, including titles at the Dallas WCT Finals and the US Open, his first Slam singles trophy. The lefty reached the summit of men’s professional tennis on a record 14 different occasions until 8 September 1985. His fourth period at No. 1 — from 3 August 1981 to 12 September 1982 — was his longest at 58 weeks. McEnroe is seventh on the list of most weeks at No. 1 with 170 weeks. McEnroe held year-end No. 1 honours from 1981-84. \"It depends on the player, but the most important thing when I was playing was who's No. 1 at the end of the year. That was the most important. You were the best overall,” McEnroe said. “Your 12-month results were the best of anyone.\" Learn more about the ATP No. 1 Club",
