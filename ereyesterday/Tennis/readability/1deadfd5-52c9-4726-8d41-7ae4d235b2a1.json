  "description": "After clinching Davis Cup glory in 2023 and 2024, Italy’s connection with the historic teams event has been further strengthened by the news that the European country will host the Final 8 knockout stage from 2025 through 2027. The Final 8 is the pinnacle of the Davis Cup, which is staged annually and in which 157 countries competed in 2024. Last month, the No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings Jannik Sinner inspired Italy to its third Davis Cup crown (1976, 2023, 2024) with victory in Malaga, Spain. David Haggerty, ITF President, said: “We are delighted to partner with the FITP for the Davis Cup Final 8. Italy has a rich history in tennis and a proven ability to host world-class sporting events. “We would like to thank Malaga and Andalusia, as well as Tennium and ITF member nation the Real Federación Española de Tenis (RFET) for being such great partners in helping us to elevate the event to new heights these past three years. We are confident that over the next three years working with the FITP we can take the Davis Cup even higher, providing an unforgettable experience for players and fans alike.” Italian tennis has enjoyed a surge in recent years. As well as Sinner, who became the first Italian No. 1 in PIF ATP Rankings history in June, five other Italians finished 2024 inside the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Rankings: Lorenzo Musetti, Flavio Cobolli, Matteo Berrettini, Matteo Arnaldi and Luciano Darderi.
