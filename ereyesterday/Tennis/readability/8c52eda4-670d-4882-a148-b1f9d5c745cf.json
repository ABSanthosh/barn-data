Alcaraz was also nominated for the award alongside swimmer Leon Marchand, cyclist Tadej Pogacar and Formula One driver Max Verstappen. \"When you achieve your childhood dreams, it's an amazing feeling,\" Djokovic said before naming the winner. \"Winning the Laureus Sportsman of the Year is the highest honour you can be blessed with in sport globally, because you're elected and recognised by the greatest athletes in the history of sports, many of whom are present in this room this evening.\" Nadal, who retired last November, and Alcaraz shared a laugh together on the red carpet. Nadal is a two-time Laureus World Sportsman of the Year and in 2023, Alcaraz received World Breakthrough of the Year recognition. The ATP stars are in town for the Mutua Madrid Open. The main draw begins Tuesday for the women and Wednesday for the men. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
