  "description": "Novak Djokovic could have a chance at instant revenge against Matteo Arnaldi at the Gonet Geneva Open. The Serbian, seeded second, was put on a collision course with his Madrid conqueror with the reveal of the draw at the clay-court ATP 250. Djokovic will face the winner of Marton Fucsovics and Zizou Bergs in his opening match, and is seeded to meet Arnaldi in the quarter-finals. The eighth-seeded Italian will play Hugo Gaston in the first round and either Fabian Marozsan or a qualifier in the second round. A Djokovic-Arnaldi rematch would be just their second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting after Arnaldi's 6-3, 6-4 win last month in what was Djokovic's opener at the Madrid ATP Masters 1000. Following that defeat, the Serbian carries a three-match losing streak into Geneva, with opening-round exits in four of his past five events. He did not compete in Rome. Should Djokovic return to winning ways, he is seeded to meet third seed Tomas Machac in the Geneva semi-finals for the second straight year. The Czech prevailed in last year's semis, but Djokovic improved to 2-1 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head with a win at this season's Australian Open. View the Geneva singles draw Geneva top seed Taylor Fritz will face Jaume Munar or Quentin Halys in his opening match, with sixth seed Hubert Hurkacz and fourth seed Karen Khachanov potential opponents beyond that. After reaching the last 16 in Madrid, Fritz was knocked out by fellow American Marcos Giron in his Rome opener. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
