  "text": "British number one Jack Draper stormed into the quarter-finals of the Qatar Open with a dominant victory over Christopher O'Connell.Draper did not face a single break point and needed just 59 minutes to wrap up a 6-2 6-1 win against the Australian.The world number 16 is playing his first tournament since retiring injured from his fourth-round meeting with Spaniard Carlos Alcaraz at January's Australian Open.He broke serve in the first game of the match and again at 4-2 before serving out the opener, while O'Connell won just one game in the second.The 23-year-old will face Matteo Berrettini, who backed up Tuesday's straight-set win over Novak Djokovic with a 7-6 (7-4) 6-7 (6-8) 6-4 victory against Tallon Griekspoor.Draper remains on course for a semi-final encounter with Alcaraz, who beat Italy's Luca Nardi 6-1 4-6 6-3 later on Wednesday.Four-time major winner Alcaraz is now on a 12-match winning streak at ATP 500 events and will play Jiri Lehecka of the Czech Republic in the last eight.Elsewhere in Doha, Alex de Minaur claimed his 200th tour-level hard-court win with a 6-4 6-4 victory over Botic van de Zandschulp to set up a quarter-final against fifth seed Andrey Rublev, who beat Nuno Borges 6-3 6-4. World number six Daniil Medvedev defeated Zizou Bergs 6-2 6-1 and will face Felix Auger-Aliassime, after the Canadian was handed a walkover as Serbia's Hamad Medjedovic withdrew because of injury.",
