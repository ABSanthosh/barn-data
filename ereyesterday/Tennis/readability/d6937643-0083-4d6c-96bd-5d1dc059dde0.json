  "text": "From rivals to co-workers - Djokovic \u0026 Murray before they teamed upMedia caption, Djokovic practises in Melbourne with new coach Andy MurrayNovak Djokovic targeting Australian Open glory is nothing new - but there will be one major difference this time around as great rival Andy Murray joins his team.The 37-year-old Serb, who is chasing a record 25th Grand Slam singles title, announced the surprise appointment of long-time friend Murray in November.Djokovic shared countless memorable moments and numerous battles for the sport's biggest prizes with Britain's three-time major winner Murray, who retired from tennis last year.It is perhaps unsurprising that Djokovic - level with Australian Margaret Court for the most major singles titles in history - has credited Murray with \"bringing a fresh look\" to his tennis, given few know his game so intimately.Here are the standout moments which defined their epic rivalry. Australian Open 2011 - first Grand Slam final meetingImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Djokovic has won 10 of the past 16 Australian Open tournaments he has contestedAfter their first meeting on the ATP Tour in 2006, Djokovic won each of his first four matches against Murray before the Briton prevailed in the first two finals they contested at Cincinnati in 2008 and Miami in 2009.The first of their seven showdowns for a Grand Slam title arrived at the Australian Open in 2011, with both players aged 23.The final hinted at the seismic battles to come but, on this occasion, Djokovic regained the title in dominant fashion.He condemned Murray to a third defeat in major finals, claiming a 6-4 6-2 6-3 win in a tense encounter which had begun with a 15-minute opening game. Australian Open 2012 - Djokovic edges semi-final epicImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Djokovic won 20 of 28 hard court matches against MurrayThe next meeting between the two in Melbourne went the distance, and their five-set, near five-hour semi-final was one of their greatest tussles.Djokovic fought back from two sets to one down to claim a 6-3 3-6 6-7 (4-7) 6-1 7-5 victory, with Murray's progress one year after his straight-set loss clear.Murray had recovered from 2-5 down in the decisive fifth set but failed to take any of three break points that would have left him serving for the match.US Open 2012 final - Murray triumphs to end waitImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Murray beat Djokovic in the Olympic semi-finals in 2012 and in the US Open finalMurray at last ended Britain's 76-year wait for a male Grand Slam singles champion with a stunning victory over Djokovic in the 2012 US Open final. Then 25, Murray survived Djokovic's fightback from two sets down to win their latest five-set thriller 7-6 (12-10) 7-5 2-6 3-6 6-2, just six minutes shy of the five-hour mark.He became the first British man since Fred Perry in 1936 to win a major singles title - and it came just five weeks after he claimed Olympic gold, following an emotional loss to Roger Federer in the Wimbledon final earlier that summer.Wimbledon 2013 final - Murray prevails againImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Murray won both of his two career meetings with Djokovic on grassA year after becoming Olympic champion on Centre Court, Murray ended Britain's long wait for a Wimbledon champion with victory over then world number one Djokovic. The Scot eventually took his fourth championship point in a dramatic final game to win 6-4 7-5 6-4.Djokovic had beaten Murray to win the Australian Open title earlier in 2013 as the pair continued to go toe-to-toe for the major trophies.Australian Open 2015 final - Djokovic extends hard-court dominanceImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Murray lost five Grand Slam finals to Djokovic during his careerThere would only ever be one winner at the Australian Open, despite Murray's best efforts.Murray would end his career as a five-time Australian Open runner-up, losing four finals to Djokovic. The Briton could not hide his disappointment after a four-set final loss in 2015 as Djokovic continued his dominance of the Melbourne major. Murray would lose again to Djokovic in 2016 before, in what proved their last meeting in a major final, the Serb completed the career Grand Slam by beating Murray to win the French Open.Qatar Open final - world's top two meet for final timeImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Djokovic and Murray met 36 times, with Djokovic leading the head-to-head 25-11At the peak of their rivalry, Djokovic and Murray played out a gripping battle for the world number one spot in 2016.And it was Murray, crowned Wimbledon champion for a second time, who clinched it by beating his rival in the ATP Finals in London.The two played out another epic contest in Qatar at the start of 2017, hinting at another season of unmissable showdowns, but it would prove to be their final competitive match as Murray's injury struggles took their toll.Image caption, Djokovic's next title will be the 100th of his careerMore on this story",
