  "text": "Jannik Sinner successfully defended his Australian Open title on Sunday, landing his third Grand Slam commandingly with a 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-3 victory over Alexander Zverev. Sinner was ruthless from the baseline and did not face a single break point throughout the two-hour, 42-minute final. The Italian showed his extra firepower from the outset, which has propelled him to a 21-match winning streak on hard courts. Meanwhile, Zverev leaves Melbourne with his third loss in a Grand Slam final as he chases the elusive major. Australian Open 2025 Final Result Winner Loser Scoreline Jannik Sinner (1) Alexander Zverev (2) 6-3, 7-6(4), 6-3 Quick Match Recap A quick match to recap: Sinner dominated this one, and although Zverev kept the scoreboard close, he could never get on the front foot. From the outset, Sinner limited Zverev’s ability to dominate from the baseline, winning 85% of points on his first serve in the opening set. Sascha stayed near parity only because of his serve, which is statistically the second-best on tour. He saved numerous break points in the opening games. However, Zverev struggled to find a rhythm, and the pressure eventually took its toll when he dropped serve at the sixth break point he faced. In the second set, Zverev saved break points in game three and started to look more comfortable. When leading 5-4 and 6-5, he twice got to 30-30 on Sinner’s serve but couldn’t fashion a break point as the Italian finally forced a tie-break. Both players had won their previous tie-breaks in Melbourne, but Sinner capitalised on a fortunate net cord at 4-4 in the second set to take a two-set lead. Sinner’s relentless ball-striking in the third set proved too much for Zverev, who looked somewhat deflated as he committed 12 unforced errors and faded to a straight sets defeat. First of all, I would like to start with Sascha. Again a tough day for you, your whole team and family. You have an incredible team behind you and are an amazing player. Keep believing in yourself as all the players and coaches know how strong you are as a player and person. Keep it up and keep working hard as we all believe you can lift one of these very soon. We worked a lot to be in this position and it is an amazing feeling to share this moment with all of you. I know a part of the team is at home and my family, but it is amazing to share these feelings with you. I know Darren [Cahill] it is probably your last Australian Open as a coach and I am very, very happy to share this trophy with you. Everything started a little bit when I changed my combination of coaches and physio, I am very happy to have you all here. Sinner in the trophy presentation.

The first was that, based on what I saw in the semi-final, if Djokovic had been fit, he would have easily beaten Zverev. He forced a tiebreak even on one leg and could easily have won the opening set, creating more break points and only losing it with a botched routine volley. Zverev played way too passively, and while I was hopeful he only opted for that game plan due to Novak’s injury, it was the same story in the final. The second was Zverev talking about “getting a bit of luck” to win a Grand Slam finally. Talk like that didn’t fill me with confidence about how he would approach the match. Here is what Federer said last year: I’m not his coach, so I can speak freely. When I see him play, I see someone who plays far too passively, far too defensively in the decisive moments. He’s great in defense, but I think to win he has to look for the way forward. If he does that, he can achieve great things. To win a Grand Slam, you have to trust in your shots and play more offensively. He has to believe in this path. Every cell in your body has to feel that this is the only right way. The title doesn’t just come to you. Especially not the first one. Federer on Zverev. Look at how Madison Keys approached her final; like Zverev, she’s another player who should have several Grand Slams in her trophy cabinet yet had historically faltered. But she turned up and trusted her shots, going huge under pressure, and it paid off. It’s easier said than done, but I wanted to see Zverev play a hybrid-type game – where he is willing to engage in long rallies to test Sinner physically but one where he doesn’t just guide the ball in. He has to go big but into big targets. See how much Sinner has in the tank as he quickly grabbed his hamstring in set two and tried the end points. Instead, he continually hit his forehand short and played tentatively on that shot. Up at the net was a similar story; he played some poor volleys that should have been put away but didn’t look confident. Can he win a Slam? I hope so, but he will need to completely change his approach against players like Sinner, who won’t let him get away with guiding balls into the court. As for Sinner, he was rock solid and played the tennis brand that propelled him to number one in the world. He’s by far the best hardcourt player in the world at the moment, but I just cannot start championing a guy who failed two doping tests, no matter how many times I hear he was cleared or “it was only a billionth of a gram” bla bla bla. He failed two tests, and I don’t like the story or how it was handled—far too many red flags. What did you think of the final? Let me know in the comments.

Talk like that didn’t fill me with confidence about how he would approach the match. Here is what Federer said last year:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m not his coach, so I can speak freely. When I see him play, I see someone who plays far too passively, far too defensively in the decisive moments. He’s great in defense, but I think to win he has to look for the way forward. If he does that, he can achieve great things. To win a Grand Slam, you have to trust in your shots and play more offensively. He has to believe in this path. Every cell in your body has to feel that this is the only right way. The title doesn’t just come to you. Especially not the first one. \u003ccite\u003eFederer on Zverev.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLook at how Madison Keys approached her final; like Zverev, she’s another player who should have several Grand Slams in her trophy cabinet yet had historically faltered. But she turned up and trusted her shots, going huge under pressure, and it paid off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s easier said than done, but I wanted to see Zverev play a hybrid-type game – where he is willing to engage in long rallies to test Sinner physically but one where he doesn’t just guide the ball in. He has to go big but into big targets. See how much Sinner has in the tank as he quickly grabbed his hamstring in set two and tried the end points.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstead, he continually hit his forehand short and played tentatively on that shot. Up at the net was a similar story; he played some poor volleys that should have been put away but didn’t look confident.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCan he win a Slam? I hope so, but he will need to completely change his approach against players like Sinner, who won’t let him get away with guiding balls into the court.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs for Sinner, he was rock solid and played the tennis brand that propelled him to number one in the world. He’s by far the best hardcourt player in the world at the moment, but I just cannot start championing a guy who failed two doping tests, no matter how many times I hear he was cleared or “it was only a billionth of a gram” bla bla bla. He failed two tests, and I don’t like the story or how it was handled—far too many red flags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you think of the final?
