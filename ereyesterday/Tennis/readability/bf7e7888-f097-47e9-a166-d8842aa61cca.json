  "description": "The Fayez Sarofim \u0026 Co. U.S. Men's Clay Court Championship semi-final between top seed Tommy Paul and Jenson Brooksby has resumed following multiple weather delays. Brooksby, the former No. 33 in the PIF ATP Rankings, led Paul 7-6(5), 2-3 entering the most recent delay, which lasted more than three hours. The match was originally scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. local time and restarted after 7 p.m. in Houston.   Brooksby tallied five consecutive points from 2/5 in the first-set tie-break to win the opener. The 24-year-old displayed his superb defensive skills and shotmaking ability, redirecting the ball with ease. Brooksby committed just 10 unforced errors in the first set, compared to Paul’s 22. In an all-American Saturday lineup, Paul is aiming to extend his perfect 3-0 record in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Brooksby. Following the conclusion of the first semi-final, second seed Frances Tiafoe meets fourth seed Brandon Nakashima. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
