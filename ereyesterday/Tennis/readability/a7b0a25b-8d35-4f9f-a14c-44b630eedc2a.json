  "text": "Zheng into last four of Finals as Sabalenka losesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Zheng Qinwen needed just 67 minutes to beat Jasmine Paolini in RiyadhZheng Qinwen crushed Jasmine Paolini to reach the WTA Finals last four as an already-qualified Aryna Sabalenka lost to an inspired Elena Rybakina.China's Olympic gold medallist Zheng showcased her power in an easy 6-1 6-1 win that eliminated Italian Paolini.It left the 22-year-old with a 2-1 group-stage record, with her sole loss coming against Sabalenka on the first day of the tournament.Zheng is the second Chinese woman to reach the semi-finals of the tournament following the legendary Li Na in 2013.\"I didn't know what would happen when I came here,\" she said. \"I just told myself to enjoy it, especially because I am in a really difficult group.\"Sabalenka, who clinched the year-end world number one ranking earlier in the week, fell 6-4 3-6 6-1 to Rybakina in a big-hitting encounter.The Belarusian, 26, still finished the round-robin stage as the group winner, with her opponent already eliminated after losses to Zheng and Paolini.\"It's nice to finish the year with at least one win against the world number one. I’m just happy,\" said 2022 Wimbledon champion Rybakina.The placings in the second group have yet to be decided, with American Coco Gauff the only player to have secured her semi-final spot.One of Barbora Krejcikova, who plays Gauff on Thursday, or Iga Swiatek will advance alongside her.Poland's Swiatek had been due to play the already-eliminated Jessica Pegula, but the American withdrew on Wednesday with a knee injury and will be replaced by alternate Daria Kasatkina.Kasatkina, one of the few openly gay players on the WTA Tour, previously said she had been \"given guarantees\" about her safety should she compete in Saudi Arabia.The Russian had previously expressed reservations about playing in the country.The decision to hold the year-end tournament in Riyadh for the first time has been criticised by some because of Saudi Arabia's human rights record.Sabalenka falls apart against RybakinaImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Aryna Sabalenka (right) and Elena Rybakina have a compelling rivalry, with Sabalenka leading it 6-4Although Rybakina has missed out on the last four, her impressive win in Riyadh is a positive end to a season disrupted by injury and illness.Sabalenka is the most powerful player on the women's tour, especially on hard courts, but Rybakina is one of the few who can test her, given her own strong forehand and huge serve.The top seed was frustrated from the off, whacking her racquet against the court after a start that saw four breaks of serve in the first five games.An ugly missed forehand handed Rybakina the crucial break for a 5-4 lead, with the Kazakh promptly wrapping up the set with a cross-court winner.After a bathroom break - and a few words of frustration vented towards her coaches - Sabalenka cut down on the unforced errors in the second set, securing the crucial break with a series of brutal backhands.But the Australian and US Open champion fell apart in the deciding set, losing five games in a row as Rybakina served out a high-quality victory.Zheng 'finally shows off tennis I want to play'Crowds at the season-ending contest have appeared disappointing - Tim Henman was among those who criticised the low turnout for Iga Swiatek's opening match on Sunday - but Zheng has been a consistent draw.The world number seven, runner-up to Sabalenka at this year's Australian Open, overwhelmed Wimbledon and French Open runner-up Paolini with her huge forehand and solid serve.Zheng hit 24 winners and 12 aces during the 67-minute win, with the 28-year-old Paolini unable to match the powerful hitting.It is the first time Zheng has beaten two top-10 players at the same tournament, having overcome world number five Rybakina in three sets earlier in the week.Since her Olympics success in Paris, Zheng has won titles in Palermo and Tokyo, as well as reaching the quarter-finals of the US Open and the Wuhan Open final.\"Finally, I showed off some tennis I really want to play,\" she said.\"You are nervous but at the same time you feel confidence because you know your level - and I know how capable I am.\"More on this story",
