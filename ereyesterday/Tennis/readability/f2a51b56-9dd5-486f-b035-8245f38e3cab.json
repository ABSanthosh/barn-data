  "description": "Novak Djokovic and Goran Ivanisevic shared a warm reunion Tuesday at Wimbledon. The Serbian — who previously worked with Ivanisevic for six years — was on court practising with Stefanos Tsitsipas, the 2001 Wimbledon champion's newest charge. Djokovic and Tsitsipas were among the stars hitting at Aorangi Park, continuing their preparation for the grass-court major. The 38-year-old Djokovic was coached by Ivanisevic from 2018 until March 2024, working alongside Marian Vajda during the first four years of that span. Tsitsipas, No. 26 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is aiming to regain his best form. He confirmed in May that he would begin working with the former No. 2 Ivanisevic, who was in Halle with the 26-year-old last week. Tsitsipas will look to improve upon his career-best fourth-round appearance (2018, 2023) at Wimbledon, where last year he reached the second round.

A 100-time tour-level titlist, Djokovic will be making his 20th consecutive appearance at the All England Club (tournament not held in 2020). The 24-time major champion boasts a 97-12 match record at SW19, where he last lifted the trophy in 2022. The past two years Djokovic has fallen to Carlos Alcaraz in the championship match. Both Djokovic and Tsitsipas will learn their place in the draw during the draw ceremony, which will be held on Friday, 27 June at 10 a.m. local time. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
