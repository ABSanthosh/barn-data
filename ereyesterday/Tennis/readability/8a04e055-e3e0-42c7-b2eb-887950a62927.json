  "description": "Marton Fucsovics’s physicality and fight has never been in doubt, but it is once again on full display this Wimbledon. The 33-year-old Hungarian was nearly on his way out of London after falling short in the final round of qualifying last Thursday. Yet once he received the call later that evening notifying him of Borna Coric’s withdrawal, Fucsovics grabbed the opportunity with confidence. Since then, his main-draw campaign at the grass-court major has been anything but ordinary. On Friday, Fucsovics made history as the first lucky loser in the Open Era to reach the third round at Wimbledon with consecutive five-set wins, against Aleksandar Kovacevic and Gael Monfils, who served for the match in the fourth set. “When I lost in the final round of quallies, I had a tough opponent and a very bad day. I didn’t play my best tennis,” Fucsovics told ATPTour.com. “But when I got the chance to play in the main draw that evening, I knew I belonged here. I know I belong here and in the Top 100. I knew I could play without any pressure.” Last year, Fucsovics ended his six-year wait for a second ATP Tour title by triumphing in Bucharest, but he suffered wrist and lower back injuries to stall his momentum. Despite finishing the season as the World No. 105, he got engaged in December, which helped by providing stability and joy off the court. With his run to the third round at Wimbledon, Fucsovics is now up 17 spots to No. 88 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. His clash with Monfils was especially brutal, testing not only his endurance but his nerve. The Frenchman served for the match at 5-4 in the fourth set, but Fucsovics clawed back to win a tie-break and force a decider, just as play was suspended due to darkness. Momentum was his, but he was forced to wait. When action resumed on a charged Court 18 on Friday morning, Fucsovics returned with hunger and determination, even hitting a ‘tweener volley to win the point late in the fifth before closing out a milestone victory. “I was confident yesterday, and when I went to bed I said ‘I will win this match, whatever happens’,” said Fucsovics, the former World No. 31. “I was very positive, very motivated, so I thought I could turn it around. I had a good sleep last night, and I was ready to go to court. I was very motivated and I really wanted to win this match.” Wimbledon holds a special place in Fucsovics’ journey. It was where he lifted the boys’ singles trophy in 2010 and where he reached the quarter-finals of the main draw in 2021 — his best result at a Grand Slam tournament.

Despite his narrow qualifying defeat to Chris Rodesch, he arrived at the All England Club in good form, having reached the quarter-finals at the ATP 250 in Stuttgart, where he fell to eventual champion Taylor Fritz. On Saturday, with a fourth-round spot at SW19 on the line, Fucsovics faces another American: World No. 10 Ben Shelton. “Wimbledon is one of my favourite Grand Slams,” said Fucsovics. “I have nothing to lose, and I have had very good preparation in the last weeks. I’ve been working for these moments over the past few months, because I had a couple of injuries last year. I was struggling, but I really wanted to get back in the Top 100 and play in the big matches in the Grand Slams.” The 22-year-old Shelton showed his potential on the surface with a fourth-round finish at Wimbledon last year, but Fucsovics will hope to draw on his own grass-court pedigree to shift the balance when they take to No. 1 Court in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. “I think the grass helps my serve. I’m not a big server, but I can mix it up very well and place the serves,” said Fucsovics of his game. “I’m moving very well, I have a good slice, I can come to the net… I’m an all-around good player.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
