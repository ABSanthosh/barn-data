  "description": "Alexandre Muller became just the third player to win an ATP Tour title having lost the first set in every match played on Sunday when he triumphed at the Bank of China Hong Kong Tennis Open. With his victory against Kei Nishikori, the Frenchman became the first First-Time Winner on the ATP Tour in 2025. The 27-year-old, who is set to rise to a career-high No. 56 in the PIF ATP Rankings, spoke with ATPTour.com about his victory. [ATP APP] What does it mean to you to win your first ATP Tour title? I am very happy. I made a lot of sacrifices since I was very young. I am very happy with my team. It has been a great preseason and I think I worked very hard for this title. You have battled back from behind consistently this week. How have you kept your belief in matches and what has been the key to the turnarounds? I was a little tired on the courts but I think the key was to stay calm between and keep the energy for myself. I stayed calm, focused on my game and tried to adapt. You were competing in your second ATP Tour final today. How beneficial was it to have prior final experience from 2023? It was quite a long time ago but I was trying to think about my first final. Taking some experience from this match. It helped me a little bit during the tough moments today and I was focused on every point. You will rise to a career-high in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday. How pleased are you with your start to the year and what are some of your longer term goals looking into 2025? It will be my best ranking so I am very happy about that too. Now I just need to continue like this and focus every week. I don’t want to stop here. I want to win more and more and I need to keep moving. How would you describe yourself as a player, and how would you describe yourself off the court? On the court I would say I am a solid baseline player, trying to be aggressive. Off court I am calm and I don’t have any problems with anyone. I like to relax and spend time with my family. What are your biggest hobbies outside of tennis? I like to play golf with my girlfriend and my coach. I like to follow other sports and football. Could you take a moment to acknowledge some of the key figures in your life and career who have helped you to reach this milestone? I started to play tennis with my dad but he was not a player. I started tennis with my dad and the federation and coaches have helped. How will you celebrate this milestone moment in your career? In the player lounge eating and we just opened one bottle of champagne and I will have some time off tomorrow in Hong Kong to visit the city and then tomorrow night I will fly to Auckland.
