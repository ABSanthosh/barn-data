Every day, I have more expectations about my game, [and with] 12 sets played, 12 sets won, everything is solid and positive,\" Djokovic said.The 38-year-old Serbian had a pair of three-match losing streaks this season but seems to be in top form lately, including collecting his 100th title at the Geneva Open the week before play began in Paris. He also beat Norrie in Geneva.\"He was solid today, and he didn't give me anything,\" Norrie said. \"Defending well, serving well, returning well and very sharp.\"Next up for Djokovic is a matchup against No. 3 seed Alexander Zverev on Wednesday for a berth in the semifinals. Zverev advanced Monday when his opponent, Tallon Griekspoor, quit in the second set with an abdominal strain.\"He definitely knows how to play tennis. He definitely knows what it means to be on the big stage and to play big matches,\" Zverev said about Djokovic. \"There is no doubt about that.\"Djokovic improved to 100-16 at the French Open. Nadal, who retired at the end of last season, went 112-4 while winning a record 14 championships at the clay-court major.In other action, No. 62 Alexander Bublik surprised No. 5 Jack Draper 5-7, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 and next meets No. 1 Jannik Sinner, a 6-1, 6-3, 6-4 winner over No. 17 Andrey Rublev on Monday night. Sinner has won 18 consecutive Grand Slam matches.Sinner actually began somewhat slowly against Rublev under the lights at Court Philippe-Chatrier. Well, for four points, anyway. Rublev got two break points at 15-40 in the opening game, but Sinner erased those and was on his way.He faced only one other break point the rest of the match and saved it, too.Sinner finished the first set with 10 winners to just three unforced errors and kept the pressure on Rublev.Sinner is a three-time major champion who won the US Open last September and the Australian Open this January. Now he'll try to get to the semifinals at Roland-Garros for the second consecutive year.",
