  "description": "Fifth seed Nicolas Jarry saved a match point Tuesday at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open, where the Chilean edged home hope Elias Ymer 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(7). In a dramatic finish, Jarry was leading 8/7 in the deciding-set tie-break when he surged forward and hit a backhand volley winner before balancing on his toes to avoid touching the net. The chair umpire confirmed that the ball had bounced twice before Jarry reached over.The 29-year-old Jarry, who saved a match point at 6/7 in the deciding-set tie-break, tallied three consecutive points to advance after two hours, 26 minutes. “The end was very difficult for both. We were playing great points,” said Jarry, who improved to 2-0 against Ymer in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “We were both very mentally strong, not giving any chances. I’m happy that in the end, I was able to be a little bit more aggressive. I served very well in the tie-break and didn’t give him many opportunities.” [ATP APP] Making his tournament debut, Jarry trailed by a set and a break, but quickly rebounded and held his nerve in a six-deuce game at 3-3 in the second set. The World No. 34 in the PIF ATP Rankings confidently struck his hefty forehand in pressure moments and drew errors from Ymer’s backhand. Up next for Jarry is Miomir Kecmanovic, who spoiled Cameron Norrie’s return from injury with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The Serbian won 62 per cent of his second-serve return points, compared to Norrie’s 31 per cent, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Norrie was competing in his first ATP Tour match since suffering a forearm injury in July. British qualifier Jacob Fearnley earned his first tour-level win on hard court by defeating Corentin Moutet 6-2, 7-6(5). Fearnley, 23, has been one of the most dominant players on the ATP Challenger Tour this season, claiming four titles at that level and making his Top 100 debut last month. The former Texas Christian University standout is on a 13-match winning streak across all levels. Laslo Djere cruised past Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-0 to set a second-round meeting with fourth seed and 2021 champion Tommy Paul. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
