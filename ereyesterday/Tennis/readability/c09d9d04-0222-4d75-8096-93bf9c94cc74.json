Another factor, perhaps, has been the interest in Emma Raducanu's comeback.\"I know I can get to where I want to,\" said Boulter, who did not reach the third round of a Grand Slam tournament in 2024.\"I'm not going to give you any numbers to tell you what my targets next year are, but I'm aiming high.\"The Wimbledon winner leading the way in doublesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Henry Patten is 14th in the world doubles rankings, above compatriots Joe Salisbury, Neal Skupski, Lloyd Glasspool and Jamie MurrayEight years ago Henry Patten was working at Wimbledon as an IBM data collector on the outside courts.Now, the 28-year-old is the SW19 men's doubles champion.It has been a stunning rise for a player who began the year well outside the top 100 and had little ATP Tour pedigree. Then he linked up with Finland's Harri Heliovaara. They claimed the title in Marrakech in their first tournament together, before triumphing in Lyon and Stockholm either side of Wimbledon.\"It has been a year of firsts and there are so many things which I'm proud we've been able to achieve,\" says Patten, who made his Davis Cup debut in September.The ranking risersFew outside of British tennis circles would have heard of Jacob Fearnley or Sonay Kartal before this year.Little over a year ago, 23-year-old Fearnley was unranked in the professional game. He finished the season as a top 100 player. Winning four ATP Challenger titles led to the fifth biggest climb in the men's rankings since 2000.Kartal's rise has also been sharp.The 23-year-old began the year outside the top 250 and feared she would miss the rest of the season because of illness. After several hospital visits, Kartal was given the go-ahead to return in April. Now the world number 85 is celebrating the best year of her career after winning a maiden WTA title.Like Fearnley, the reward is direct entry into a Grand Slam main draw for the first time at the upcoming Australian Open.The 30-time Grand Slam championImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alfie Hewett has won 30 Grand Slam titles - nine in singles and 21 in doublesEven with a wealth of success behind him, Alfie Hewett felt the pressure as he aimed to finally land the Wimbledon wheelchair men's singles title and complete a career Grand Slam.Hewett overcame the \"heavy weight\" on his shoulders to beat Spain's Martin de la Puenta and secured another doubles triumph alongside Gordon Reid on the \"best day\" of his life.With one career ambition ticked off, the 26-year-old fulfilled another by winning Paralympic gold with Reid in Paris.\"To be sitting here with the two things we targeted at the start of the year is something I'm very proud of,\" Hewett told BBC Look East.\"I'm not sure what the next chapter is - I'm going to continue playing for sure, but I just want to enjoy it.\"The juniors providing hope for the futureThe task for British tennis is developing the next generation of talent and avoiding another 35-year wait for a Grand Slam singles champion.The performances of the British juniors this year - across singles, doubles and team events, external - have provided optimism.Mika Stojsavljevic, who turned 16 last week, won the US Open girls' singles title, while 17-year-old Mimi Xu and 18-year-old Charlie Robertson reached the last four in New York.Henry Searle, 18, who won the Wimbledon boys' singles in 2023, and 15-year-old Hannah Klugman, winner of the prestigious Orange Bowl junior championships last year, have continued making strides.\"Success in junior tennis is definitely a strong indicator of long-term potential but, of course, it is no guarantee,\" said Iain Bates, the LTA's head of women's tennis.\"Seeing younger players reaching the back end of junior Slams is a sign of the health of the pathway.\"More on this story",
