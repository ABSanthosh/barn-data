The weather also forced the cancellation of Alexander Zverev’s clash with Arthur Fils, leaving their quarter-final spot unresolved, while Jakub Mensik advanced to his first Masters 1000 quarter-final without hitting a ball after Tomas Machac’s withdrawal. Check the highlights and recap below from Matteo Berrettini’s tiebreak heroics to Sebastian Korda’s gritty win over Gael Monfils. Day Seven 2025 Miami Open Round of 16 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Jakub Mensik Tomas Machac Walkover Taylor Fritz (3) Adam Walton (LL) 6-3 7-5 Matteo Berrettini (29) Alex de Minaur (10) 6-3 7-6(7) Sebastian Korda (24) Gael Monfils 6-4 2-6 6-4 Nokak Djokovic (4) Lorenzo Musetti (15) 6-2 6-2 Francisco Cerundolo (23) Casper Ruud (5) 6-4 6-2 Grigor Dimitrov (14) Brandon Nakashima (31) 6-4 7-5 Djokovic Delivers Musetti Masterclass Novak Djokovic powered into the Miami Open quarter-finals on Tuesday evening, delivering a 6-2, 6-2 masterclass against 15th seed Lorenzo Musetti. Djokovic is seeking a record seventh Miami title, but this is the first time he’s made the last eight since 2016 and the first time he’s done so at Hard Rock Stadium. I like how Novak is hitting the ball this week, especially his backhand. He turned a sluggish start into a clinic, winning nine straight games from 0-2 to seal the one-hour, 23-minute victory. Musetti made the quarterfinals last year, and he came out firing, breaking early. However, once Novak found his groove, he could dictate from the baseline and establish a much stronger court position. He faced zero break points after dropping his opening service game while breaking Musetti seven times. Next up: Sebastian Korda, who battled past Gael Monfils 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 earlier in the day. Playing in front of his home crowd, Korda let a lead slip and saw play suspended by rain while up a break in the third, but the 23-year-old held firm upon resumption.  I was starstruck! It was amazing to see first DelPo, obviously a long-time friend and a rival, so happy to have him around and get his support from the box. It was amazing, it was [the] first time to have DelPo in the box, so I want to thank him really for coming. And Serena, that was a surprise. I didn’t know. Actually, when I had that down-the-line passing shot, I pointed to her and asked her whether it was okay. She kind of said, ‘Yeah, it was fine’. If Serena says it was fine, then it was amazing by everyone else’s standards. So yeah, great to have them He had a really good start of the match. First couple games I started a little bit slow and then I knew that if I give him time, he’s going to make his shots. He loves kind of running around his backhand, hitting forehands. But he is so talented, he can play any shot in the game on any surface. It was tough, particularly in the first seven, eight games of the match. But I think breaking his serve to come back to 2-all and break right away at 3-2, it was a momentum shift and I tried to use that. Djokovic on his win over Musetti. Cerundolo Conquers Ruud Francisco Cerundolo avenged his loss to Casper Ruud at the 2022 Miami Open on Tuesday, conquering the fifth seed 6-4, 6-2 to storm into his third quarter-final in four appearances at the hard-court Masters 1000. Cerundolo has played very well during the Sunshine Double, and his 87-minute triumph indicated that he has no intention of slowing down as he heads into Wednesday’s quarter-final. The Argentine was the stronger player from the outset, breaking at 3-3 with his fourth break point before holding firm to take the first set. He then turned on the afterburners in the second, racing to a 5-1 lead with a barrage of winners. A three-hour, 30-minute rain delay prevented him from sealing the deal there and then, but it didn’t derail his rhythm, as he returned unfazed to capture it 6-2. Ruud, who’s not quite up to his level from a few years ago and keeps seeing his serve getting ripped apart on the return, had no answers for Cerundolo’s relentless baseline pressure, managing just one break-point chance in the match. The clay season is going to be vital for him. Next up for Cerundolo: 14th seed Grigor Dimitrov, who opened Tuesday’s schedule on Grandstand with a 6-4, 7-5 victory over Brandon Nakashima. I like the city. I like Miami. I always found it good since the first time I came here. A lot of Argentinian fans and Latin Americans. I spend a lot of good-quality time outside the court and that is probably something that inspires me to play well. I’m super happy. It’s always difficult when you’re playing a really good match, controlling the game, and you have to stop for rain. It’s not easy, but I was chill and came back to the match confident and played a really good service game. I’m super happy to get back-to-back Masters 1000 quarter-finals in the U.S., on hard courts. It’s a great achievement Cerundolo on his win. Other Matches Of Note Elsewhere, Matteo Berrettini edged out 10th seed Alex de Minaur in a 6-3, 7-6(7) in another rollercoaster. Berrettini saved three set points at 4-5 in the second set, squandered three match points when leading 6-5, saved three more set points from 3-6 in the tie break, and converted his fifth match point to take it 9-7. The Italian’s two-hour, one-minute win sets up a quarter-final clash with Taylor Fritz, who dispatched lucky loser Adam Walton 6-3, 7-5. Fritz, the third seed, improved to 21-0 against players outside the Top 80 since 2024, and he’s looking in better shape after his forehand wobbled in Indian Wells. Sebastian Korda outlasted Gael Monfils in a 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 battle that spanned two hours and 11 minutes, with a rain delay adding to the tension. Korda, the 24th seed, took the first set with a single break, but Monfils, who’d spent over six hours on court across his three prior matches, roared back to level the match, feeding off the Butch Buchholz crowd’s energy. In the third set, Korda broke early, but play was suspended with him leading 4-3. Upon resumption, the American held firm, closing the match without facing a break point in the decider. Korda, who withdrew from doubles due to his wrist (supposedly), faces Djokovic next, so it will be interesting to see if that plays a part or if it was doubles playing second fiddle as usual. In a tightly contested match, Grigor Dimitrov overcame 31st seed Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-5. The 14th seed, a 2024 finalist, broke Nakashima late in the first set with a well-constructed point, then weathered a storm in the second, using his all-court game to make the difference, as he struck 28 winners, breaking at 6-5 to seal the match after one hour and 52 minutes.

It’s a great achievement \u003ccite\u003eCerundolo on his win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eOther Matches Of Note\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5.jpg\" alt=\"miami open day 5\" width=\"1360\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5.jpg 1360w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1360px) 100vw, 1360px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%201360%201020\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5.jpg 1360w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5-150x113.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/miami-open-day-5.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\u003cp\u003eElsewhere, Matteo Berrettini edged out 10th seed Alex de Minaur in a 6-3, 7-6(7) in another rollercoaster.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBerrettini saved three set points at 4-5 in the second set, squandered three match points when leading 6-5, saved three more set points from 3-6 in the tie break, and converted his fifth match point to take it 9-7.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Italian’s two-hour, one-minute win sets up a quarter-final clash with Taylor Fritz, who dispatched lucky loser Adam Walton 6-3, 7-5. Fritz, the third seed, improved to 21-0 against players outside the Top 80 since 2024, and he’s looking in better shape after his forehand wobbled in Indian Wells.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSebastian Korda outlasted Gael Monfils in a 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 battle that spanned two hours and 11 minutes, with a rain delay adding to the tension. Korda, the 24th seed, took the first set with a single break, but Monfils, who’d spent over six hours on court across his three prior matches, roared back to level the match, feeding off the Butch Buchholz crowd’s energy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the third set, Korda broke early, but play was suspended with him leading 4-3. Upon resumption, the American held firm, closing the match without facing a break point in the decider. Korda, who withdrew from doubles due to his wrist (supposedly), faces Djokovic next, so it will be interesting to see if that plays a part or if it was doubles playing second fiddle as usual.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a tightly contested match, Grigor Dimitrov overcame 31st seed Brandon Nakashima 6-4, 7-5. The 14th seed, a 2024 finalist, broke Nakashima late in the first set with a well-constructed point, then weathered a storm in the second, using his all-court game to make the difference, as he struck 28 winners, breaking at 6-5 to seal the match after one hour and 52 minutes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHighlights\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\u003ch2\u003eMiami Open 2025 Day 9 R16 \u0026amp; Quarter Final Matches\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1.jpg\" alt=\"mimai open day 1\" width=\"680\" height=\"510\" srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1.jpg 680w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1-150x113.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-old-src=\"data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=\u0026#39;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#39;%20viewBox=\u0026#39;0%200%20680%20510\u0026#39;%3E%3C/svg%3E\" data-lazy-srcset=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1.jpg 680w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1-150x113.jpg 150w\" data-lazy-src=\"https://www.perfect-tennis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/mimai-open-day-1.jpg\"/\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eRound of 16: Alexander Zverev (1) vs Arthur Fils (17) \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrancisco Cerundolo (23) vs Grigor Dimitrov (14)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSebastian Korda (24) vs Novak Djokovic (4)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
