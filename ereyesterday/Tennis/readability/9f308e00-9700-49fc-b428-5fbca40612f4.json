  "description": "Joao Fonseca made quite the impression with his main-draw debut at a major. Can the #NextGenATP Brazilian repeat the trick at Roland Garros? The 18-year-old will take on 30th seed Hubert Hurkacz on debut at the clay-court Grand Slam in Paris, where he is bidding to back up his second-round run as a qualifier at January’s Australian Open. Competing as the No. 65 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fonseca is hoping to rekindle some fond memories from his junior career in the French capital. “Well, my first main draw appearance, I'm feeling really good,” said Fonseca at his pre-tournament press conference. “I had some really good matches here in Paris. It's strange, because I came here my first time in three years, so it's like déjà vu sometimes. I went to Suzanne Lenglen, and that was where we stayed in juniors. It was my first time here in Philippe Chatrier. I’m happy to play my first match here as a pro.” Having triumphed at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Fonseca charged into the Grand Slam spotlight with a stunning straight-sets first-round upset of then-World No. 9 Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open. His classy performance instantly escalated the hype surrounding the Brazilian teenager, and that only increased further when he lifted his maiden ATP Tour title in February on the clay of Buenos Aires. “I think that was the biggest stadium that I ever played,” recalled Fonseca of his victory against Rublev at Melbourne Park. “It was my first Top-10 player that I played against. The crowd was huge. I learned how to play on those stadiums. It was an experience for me. My first main draw [at a major]. “I think after Australia a lot changed. Now I'm a bit more experienced on those type of circumstances.” Fonseca is 10-7 for the 2025 season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. His start to the year unquestionably represents a breakout stretch for the Brazilian, but he acknowledges the importance of keeping his feet on the ground in the early stages of his career. “I'm just enjoying my career life. I'm reaching some good things,” said Fonseca. “I'm young, so I'm learning every week. How do I manage? I will try my best. I try to focus on my routine, what I need to do, focus on good people on my side helping me achieve good things. “I'm learning every week how to adapt. But yeah, things are getting on their own path. Yeah, just focus on my routines and play my tennis.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
