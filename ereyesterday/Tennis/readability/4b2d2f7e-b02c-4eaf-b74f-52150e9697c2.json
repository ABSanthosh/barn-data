Alcaraz’s aim for more history \u0026 continued rivalry with Sinner If Alcaraz lifts his maiden Australian Open title, the Spaniard will become the latest player to achieve a ‘Career Grand Slam’, claiming all four major titles in his career. At World No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings, the 21-year-old is aiming to return to the very top of the game. He will also seek a three-peat in Indian Wells and also at Wimbledon in 2025. This upcoming season is sure to provide more thrilling clashes between Alcaraz and his great rival Sinner. Alcaraz went 3-0 against the Italian in 2024, improving to 6-4 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the Italian. They split the season’s four majors, with Alcaraz completing the rare Roland Garros-Wimbledon double. Alcaraz became the sixth man in the Open Era to complete the feat, joining Rod Laver, Bjorn Borg, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Djokovic. With three consecutive top-three year-end finishes to his name, Alcaraz will begin the year ready to compete for the biggest titles. Fonseca headlines #NextGenATP stars seeking to make a splash One of the most thrilling aspects of each season is discovering the sport's next breakout stars. Just days ago, 18-year-old Joao Fonseca won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Alcaraz and Sinner are two other champions of the event who triumphed at the 20-and-under season finale aged 18.   Nineteen-year-old Jakub Mensik was named Newcomer of the Year following a season in which he reached his first tour-level final, finished inside the Top 50 of the PIF ATP Rankings and qualified for the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Mensik will be aiming for a return trip to Jeddah in 2025. Other 20-and-under stars to keep an eye on include Shang Juncheng, Learner Tien, Nishesh Basavareddy and Martin Landaluce. Shang scored his first tour-level title in Chengdu this past season. Tien became the fourth American to win three ATP Challenger Tour titles before his 19th birthday, joining Taylor Fritz, Andy Roddick and Sam Querrey. The lefty also reached the championship match in Jeddah. Medvedev’s mission Medvedev has spoken tongue-in-cheek about his dislike for clay and since he won his first title on that surface — Rome in 2023 — he has been seeking a 21st tour-level trophy. The World No. 5 reached two finals in 2024 (Australian Open, Indian Wells) and now looks to go one step further to again leave a tournament as champion. Medvedev has reached the Australian Open championship match in three of the past four years. Is 2025 his time to finish on top in Melbourne and end his title drought in the first month of the year? Despite not lifting a trophy in 2024, Medvedev did enjoy a consistent season, qualifying the Nitto ATP Finals for the sixth consecutive year. [ATP APP] Major milestone? Top 10 stars Alexander Zverev, Taylor Fritz, and Casper Ruud have each come within one win of capturing a major title. As the new season unfolds, the prospect of turning those near-title finishes into career-defining triumphs looms large. Ruud has reached three major finals while Zverev has twice finished runner-up. Fritz was a finalist at his home Slam in 2024. Zverev, the No. 2 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, captured a career-best 69 tour-level match wins in 2024, second most behind Sinner. The German lifted the trophy at the ATP Masters 1000 events in Rome and Paris, marking his biggest triumphs since a severe ankle injury in 2022.
