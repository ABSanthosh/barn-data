  "text": "The BNP Paribas Open quarterfinal lineup is locked in after the bottom half of the draw played their round of 16 matches on Wednesday. Carlos Alcaraz continued his dominant title defence charge by dispatchingGrigor Dimitrov in just over an hour, while Jack Draper stunned home favourite Taylor Fritz for his biggest win of the season. Ben Shelton made history as the youngest American quarterfinalist since Andy Roddick (2004) and Francisco Cerúndolo upset Alex de Minaur to reach the last eight for the first time.  All eight men are back in action tomorrow in Thursday’s quarter-finals  Day Eight 2025 BNP Paribas Open Round of 16 Results Winner Loser Scoreline Ben Shelton (11) Brandon Nakashima (32) 7-6(6) 6-1 Jack Draper (13) Taylor Fritz (3) 7-5 6-4 Francisco Cerundolo (25) Alex de Minaur (9) 7-5 6-3 Carlos Alcaraz (2) Grigor Dimitrov (14) 6-1 6-1 Alcaraz Demolishes Dimitrov Carlos Alcaraz proved deadly on Wednesday, dismantling Grigor Dimitrov 6-1, 6-1 in windy conditions to move within three wins of a historic Indian Wells three-peat. I had a feeling that Dimitrov wouldn’t offer much resistance, as his track record this season has been plagued with retirements, which points to physical issues. A lengthy match vs Monfils certainly didn’t help his cause. Alcaraz, however, has been flying, and he delivered his sharpest performance of the week under the lights on Stadium 1, dropping just two games and saving the three break points to progress in 1 hour and 14 minutes. Breezy! Up next, he faces Francisco Cerúndolo, who defeated Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-3 earlier in the day. It’s really difficult playing against Grigor. He’s a really talented player. He can do whatever he wants with the ball. Today with the conditions, it was really tough for both. I had to survive. I always say in these conditions, you have to survive no matter what. I’m very happy that I was able to play long rallies. I got a good rhythm, even with the conditions, so I’m just really happy to get through. I’ve watched his [Cerundolo’s] matches. I know he’s playing great. I don’t know which one his is best surface, I don’t know if it’s clay or hard. He plays really well on every surface. That shows the player he is. He’s a really complete player, he can play really good tennis on every surface. I have to be really focused  on that, I have to be ready. I think I’m getting better and better. I love Indian Wells, I love this court. So I’m just ready to take the challenge. Alcaraz on his win and upcoming match. Draper Foils Fritz Jack Draper landed one of his biggest wins of the season, knocking out former champion Taylor Fritz 7-5, 6-4 to reach the BNP Paribas Open quarterfinals for the first time. Fritz hasn’t been playing well in recent weeks, and I thought his forehand has looked “off” in Indian Wells. Even a fresh haircut didn’t change his fortunes, as Draper, whose game suits these conditions, took command of the match by winning seven straight games from 4-5 in the first set to 4-0 in the second. Fritz fought well, but he was never able to get on top from the baseline as  Draper won 91% of points behind his first serve (32/35) and closed out the match in 79 minutes. I felt great. It is the best match I have played here so far in the three years I have been here. I was happy with the way I was sharp. I moved great and competed well. There were a few moments here and there which I was brave, which I spoke to my coach about before the match. When you have chances against these types of players. Taylor is such an amazing player, so to come through in the way I did I am very proud of that. Draper on his win over Fritz. Other Matches Ben Shelton defeated fellow American Brandon Nakashima 7-6(6), 6-1. The 22-year-old continued his perfect record against the 32nd seed, improving to 4-0 in the H2H, averting. The first set was a tight affair, but Nakashima made some tame errors at the back end of the breaker, which allowed Shelton to take command. Francisco Cerúndolo usually is more at home in Miami, where he’s a former semi-finalist, but he reached the last eight in Indian Wells for the first time, upsetting ninth seed Alex de Minaur 7-5, 6-3.
