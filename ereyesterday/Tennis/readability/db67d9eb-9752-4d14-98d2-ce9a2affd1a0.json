  "description": "Joao Fonseca joined illustrious company by triumphing on Sunday at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The Brazilian joined Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz as the only 18 year olds to win the event and was brimming from ear to ear following his four-set final win against Learner Tien. Fonseca was proud of his undefeated run in Jeddah, but insisted it was just the start. “If you told Joao at the start of the year that he did all the things he did this year, he would think it is amazing,” Fonseca said. “It is amazing how I have improved physically and mentally. I have been very strong mentally, winning matches against Top 50, Top 20 players. I am proud of myself, but of course I want more. My dream is to become No. 1. Of course, now after winning Next Gen, I want to enjoy it this week and relax and celebrate with my family. I want to enjoy the moment and I am very pleased and thankful for this year.” Fonseca started the season outside the Top 700 in the PIF ATP Rankings but finishes 2024 at No. 145, having demonstrated big-match mentality on home soil in Rio de Janiero in February when he advanced to the quarter-finals at the ATP 500 event. His opening-round win that week against Arthur Fils was his maiden tour-level win. Fonseca’s winning mindset was in play all week in Jeddah, where he beat top seed Fils and third seed Jakub Mensik in five sets in Blue Group play. He then crucially saved one set point in the final against Tien to avoid falling two sets behind.  “I talk with my coach that I like to play big matches in difficult circumstances,” Fonseca said. “I like playing the big guys. I like when I have a difficult match in a big stadium. I love the pressure. I belong on the stage of tennis where you have to be brave, where you have to go for the shot. I think I have improved a lot.” Since Sinner (2019) and Alcaraz have gone onto win the event, the Italian and Spaniard have both gone on to win multiple majors and rise to No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Fonseca feels he can do the same. “It is a good pressure,” said Fonseca, who also won his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title in 2024 (Lexington). “By winning Next Gen, it shows I am on the right path. I hope I can do the same or even better than what they have done and are doing and are going to do. I look forward to playing with them and I hope I can compete in big matches at Grand Slams. It is where I want to go.” Learn more about Fonseca Fonseca was supported by lively fans all week at the King Abduallah Sports City. The 18-year-old loved the crowds all week in Jeddah. “It was amazing all week. Seeing people from other countries cheering for you. People don’t need to cheer for me but they are,” Fonseca said. “I am very happy with that. I like to entertain. In important moments I need help from the crowd I try to entertain. It was nice to see Brazilian fans here too. There was a group here all week. It was amazing to see them cheering for me and the country.” [ATP APP] Fonseca has grown up watching tennis. The Brazilian attended the ATP 500 in Rio de Janeiro when he was younger, often waiting courtside to gain autographs. Now, Fonseca is the one signing his name for fans and inspiring the next generation. “Three years ago I was the one asking for autographs and now kids are asking me and I need to get used to it,” Fonseca said. “When I walk in Rio, sometimes a kid will ask for my autograph and that is crazy. It is very nice that I am inspiring kids to play tennis.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
