Now 43 and happily retired, the 20-time Grand Slam champion recently spoke on behalf of his Roger Federer Foundation at a breakfast event in Johannesburg, where he urged local leaders to ensure that every child in South Africa has access to early childhood development services by 2030. “It’s a joyful experience to walk into vibrant classrooms filled with children learning, reading, and playing, just as children everywhere should be allowed to do,” Federer said during his speech. “Witnessing them grow into nurses, teachers, and computer programmers fills me with hope.” Roger Federer examines a creative playground element at a primary school in Mpumalanga.

It demanded much from me, but I was fortunate to have guidance and opportunities. That’s what I want to provide for others, a chance for growth and success,” said Federer, whose mother is from South Africa. “Through our foundation’s work in South Africa, we’ve been able to offer quality preschool education to more than 300,000 children. However, 1.3 million children are still waiting for opportunities such as playgrounds to play, building blocks and books to learn, but most importantly passionate and knowledgeable educators.” [ATP APP] Federer closed his speech by emphasising the importance of a collective effort. “We want to learn from others, like in tennis, where accepting guidance and new strategies leads to unexpected victories. Look beyond current actions and extend your reach,” Federer said. “We now know 1.3 million children need places to learn and grow, and they need them by 2030. This ambitious goal, comparable to my seemingly impossible tennis achievements, is the right goal.” Did You Know? Established in 2003, the Roger Federer Foundation is active in Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Switzerland. Its focus is on early learning, empowering educators through a tablet-based system that gives them the knowledge and tools they need to teach better as well as to mobilise parents and communities to contribute. The Roger Federer Foundation also advocates for SDG 4.2 — “by 2030 ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for school” at both the governmental and global level.
