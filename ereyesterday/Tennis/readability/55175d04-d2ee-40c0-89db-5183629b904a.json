The 26-year-old played explosive tennis in front of an electric crowd in Paris and capitalised on Khachanov‚Äôs physical limitations in the closing stages of the third set to become the fifth Frenchman to reach the title match at the indoor hard event. \"It is amazing to do it in Paris at my favourite tournament. It is a dream,\" Humbert said. \"It was a little bit difficult compared to the previous matches.

The 15th seed won the title in Metz last year and then triumphed indoors in Marseille in February. Chasing his seventh tour-level title, Humbert will meet Alexander Zverev in the championship match on Sunday. Earlier this week, Humbert upset Carlos Alcaraz. The Frenchman, who hit 35 winners against Khachanov, is up four places to No. 14 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will rise to a career-high No. 11 on Monday if he wins the title. Khachanov was competitive until 3-2 in the third set, when he received a medical timeout for a leg injury. The No. 21 player in the PIF ATP Rankings lost serve in the seventh game of the third set and was unable to move in the final two games of the two-hour, 48-minute match. [ATP APP] Humbert is the first Frenchman to reach the final in Paris since Jo-Wilfried Tsonga lost to Roger Federer in the 2011 title match. The last Frenchman to win the crown was Tsonga in 2008. Humbert will aim to take his standout 6-1 record in finals into Sunday's meeting with Zverev. The lefty, who lost his first ATP Tour final in Tokyo last month to Arthur Fils, is level at 1-1 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Zverev. Earlier this year Humbert lifted trophies in Dubai and Marseille, while Zverev clinched the crown at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome. Khachanov is a former champion in Paris, having won the biggest title of his career in the French capital in 2018. The 28-year-old earned an impressive straight-sets win against Grigor Dimitrov in the quarter-finals but ran out of steam against Humbert. Khachanov finishes his year holding a 37-22 record, lifting trophies in Doha and Almaty. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
