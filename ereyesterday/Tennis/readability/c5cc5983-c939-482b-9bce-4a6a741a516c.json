  "description": "Learner Tien’s breakout 2025 season will include a maiden main-draw appearance at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The ATP Masters 1000 announced Tuesday that #NextGenATP Tien has received a wild card for the 2025 edition of the event, to be held from 19-30 March at Hard Rock Stadium. The 19-year-old, who reached the championship match at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, has risen to a career-high No. 68 in the PIF ATP Rankings ahead of his upcoming main-draw debut at another Masters 1000, the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Tien reached the fourth round on event debut at January’s Australian Open, where he defeated Daniil Medvedev en route, and he notched his second Top 5 win of the season last week in Acapulco, where he downed World No. 2 Alexander Zverev. In 2023 in Miami, Tien fell in the first round of qualifying on his event debut to Jan-Lennard Struff; he did not compete at the event last year. Two other Americans, Christopher Eubanks and Eliot Spizzirri, have also received wild cards for Miami. A former World No. 29, Eubanks reached the quarter-finals as a qualifier at Hard Rock Stadium in 2023, while former college standout Spizzirri will be making his Masters 1000 main-draw debut. Chinese star Wu Yibing and #NextGenATP Italian Federico Cina were the other two wild cards announced on Tuesday. It will be former ATP Tour titlist Wu’s first ATP Tour event since last October, while 17-year-old Cina is set to make his tour-level debut. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
