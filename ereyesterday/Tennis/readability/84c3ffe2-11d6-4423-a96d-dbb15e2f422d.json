Holger Rune and Frances Tiafoe participated in an exhibition on a floating court in Acapulco’s St. Lucia Bay as one of the ATP Tour’s iconic pre-tournament activities returned after 10 years. It was not an experience Tiafoe will forget in a hurry. “It was incredible. I’ve never done that before,” said Tiafoe. “I’ve never left the hotel here in Acapulco before, so to see all the cliffs and everything, to see how scenic Acapulco is was amazing. I think that’s definitely the best picture you can probably have. I hope Holger enjoyed it as well. It’s probably one of the best experiences I had playing tennis.” The iconic floating court sits in the middle of Acapulco's St. Lucia Bay. Photo Credit: Mextenis.

Jarry and Etcheverry, who met in the final at the ATP 250 in 2023 (the Chilean won), enjoyed playing mini tennis, taking in a folkloric dance performance and tasting local food. \"I really like it at home, with family, friends and most of the people who support you throughout the year, so it's special,\" Jarry said. \"I hope to enjoy it a lot, to be able to play my best tennis round by round, then we'll see what the future brings.\" Nicolas Jarry and Tomas Martin Etcheverry help kick off the Movistar Chile Open on Sunday.

I lost the final two years ago after a great match there with Nico,\" Etcheverry said. \"I'm happy to be back this year. The crowd is incredible, I love playing here and I always have a lot of encouragement.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
