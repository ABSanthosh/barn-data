  "description": "Fans are arriving from near and far in Jeddah for the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The 20-and-under event has already produced plenty of memorable moments on the court this week, with sublime shotmaking, group-stage upsets and plenty of unique moments thanks to the innovative set of rules in play. While some of those enjoying the action from the stands are seasoned tennis fans, the tournament has also attracted newcomers to the sport. “It is fun here; I like the weather and the fan zone,” Omar Binsawad from Jeddah, who was attending Thursday’s evening session (featuring top seed Arthur Fils) with his nine-year-old son, told ATPTour.com. “I’m really excited to experience tennis for the first time, and to bring my son to see a sport other than football. I want him to see other opportunities in other sports. It looks lovely here. “I’m not that big a fan of tennis. I play padel, which is a little bit different, but it’s great that tennis activities are here in Jeddah now, so it’s an opportunity for us, and an opportunity for my son to see other sports. I think he might like it.” Fans play minitennis on Thursday in Jeddah.

They also have the chance to meet some of the ATP Tour stars competing in Jeddah: On Thursday, Alex Michelsen signed autographs for fans after he sealed his semi-final spot with victory against Luca Van Assche.

Although they are all passionate about playing the sport, watching elite-level tennis in Jeddah was a novel experience for some members of the party. “It’s the first time ever I watched tennis live,” said Alfie. “[Roger] Federer is my favourite player ever, but here my favourite is Shang Juncheng. The fan zone is cool. I like it here.” Members of Tennis Club Makkah in Manila, the Philippines, pose for a photo at the Jeddah fan zone.

He did not hesitate when asked which of the Spaniard’s attributes he most admired. “Federer and Nadal, ‘Fedal’, are my favourite players. Nadal was so fearless. The way he played was so full of energy and full of power. With all his technique and energy, he was amazing,” said Alfie, although he also acknowledged he had a unique personal reason to being drawn to lefties such as the Spaniard and Chinese #NextGenATP star Shang. “I like left-handers, because my weakness [when I play] is playing left-handers!” Billy, who was recently elected as the club president of Tennis Club Makkah, added: “This is the second time members of the club have come to Jeddah. We were here for the Next Gen finals last year. We are all from the Philippines and love to play tennis. Now we are here. The stadium is amazing, and the weather is great.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
