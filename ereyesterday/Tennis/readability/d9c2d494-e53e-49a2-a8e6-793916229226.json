Gasping for air at times in the latter stages of the match, last yearâ€™s finalist Dimitrov found enough energy to fight off Cerundolo 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) after two hours, 48 minutes. Cerundolo will rue his missed backhand return while holding match point at 6-5 in the decider.GRIGOR DIMITROV!!! HOW HAVE YOU DONE THAT?! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯@MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen | @GrigorDimitrov pic.twitter.com/vaVptitPcrâ€” ATP Tour (@atptour) March 27, 2025 Dimitrov had his own missed opportunities in the beginning stages, letting slip seven set points in the opener, one of which he missed by dumping a routine backhand volley in the net. But that did not discourage Dimitrov from moving forward, instead only fuelling his determination. He took a more aggressive baseline position in the second set and converted all eight of his net points. Playing with great variety by mixing backhand slices with his trademark one-hander, Dimitrov began to dictate rallies. He did not drop a point behind in his first serve (11/11) in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Trailing 0-3 in the decider, Dimitrov mounted another comeback to become the fifth man to reach multiple Miami semi-finals after turning 30 (Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors, Roger Federer, John Isner). He improved to 12-1 in deciding-set matches at the ATP Masters 1000 event in south Florida. Up next for the 14th seed will be six-time champion Novak Djokovic or American Sebastian Korda.Having arrived in Miami defending his finalist showing from last year, Dimitrovâ€™s run to the last four has him No. 18 the PIF ATP Live Rankings.
