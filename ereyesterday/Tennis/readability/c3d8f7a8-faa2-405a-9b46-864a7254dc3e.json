  "text": "Emma Raducanu and Katie Boulter combined once again to lead Great Britain into the Billie Jean King Cup semi-finals at the expense of defending champions Canada.British number two Raducanu, playing for only the second time in almost two months following a foot injury, opened the quarter-final tie with a 6-0 7-5 win against Canada's Rebecca Marino.Boulter, the British number one, then sealed her nation's place in the last four of the women's team event by beating Leylah Fernandez - who Raducanu beat in her shock 2021 US Open triumph - 6-2 6-4 later on Sunday. Anne Keothavong's team will move on to a semi-final tie against Slovakia, who beat 2022 runners-up Australia, on Tuesday (11:00 GMT).Britain - who also have Harriet Dart, Heather Watson and Olivia Nicholls in the squad - came into the 12-nation finals as the second lowest-ranked team.But with Raducanu and Boulter yet to drop a set in Malaga, belief continues to increase that Britain can win the event known as the 'World Cup of Tennis' for the first time.\"We're not looking too far ahead,\" said Keothavong.\"Myself and all the other staff members are doing our best to instil the belief that the players, this team, can do it.\"We're in it to win it. I've got every bit of faith and belief in the players.\"In Boulter and Raducanu, Britain have pedigree that ranks among the most substantial in the competition.British number one Boulter, who has moved into the world's top 25 after a season in which she won two WTA titles, was the third-highest ranked singles player left in at the quarter-final stage.Former Grand Slam champion Raducanu also ranked third among the number two players.So, while reigning champions Canada are second in the world, there was no reason for Britain to have an inferiority complex going into the best-of-three tie.The presence of Gaby Dabrowski - the doubles world number three and recent WTA Finals champion - did give reason for Britain to be wary of a doubles decider, though.It felt imperative that Raducanu opened with a win against 103rd-ranked Marino and the first set, where there was a huge gulf of quality between them, required ruthlessness.The second required patience and resilience. Raducanu was forced to save seven break points before taking Marino's serve in the 11th game.\"It was an incredibly difficult match because the dynamics were so different in each of the sets,\" said Raducanu, 22.Raducanu, who has now won her past four singles matches for Britain, laid the platform for Boulter to seal the deal against 31st-ranked Fernandez.Playing on a fast hard court which suits her excoriating style, Boulter ran away with the first set when Fernandez's service game disintegrated with a flurry of double faults.The confidence of Boulter, built up over the finest season of her career and maintained in a team environment in which she thrives, carried into the second set.She surged into a 4-0 lead before nerves kicked in. But with vocal British support rallying her, Boulter got over the line on her fourth match point to spark jubilant celebrations among the Union Jack-clad contingent.\"Emma makes it really easy for me to come out and have a swing,\" said Boulter, 28.\"I really wanted to come out and have a go at the defending champs. I'm really pleased with myself.\"Before a ball was hit on the Costa del Sol, Keothavong was not afraid to talk up her team's chances of upsetting the odds and lifting the trophy on Wednesday.While Keothavong's team reached the semi-finals on home turf in Glasgow in 2022, there is a different level of belief given the firepower Britain possess.Raducanu and Boulter will be favourites to win their singles matches in the semi-final, but Slovakia are not to be underestimated after reaching the last four for the first time since being crowned champions in 2002.The United States, albeit shorn of their leading stars Coco Gauff and Jessica Pegula, were their first victims before Australia were brushed aside on Sunday.Viktoria Hruncakova, ranked 241st in the world, won 7-5 6-7 6-3 against Kimberly Birrell before 43rd-ranked Rebecca Sramkova crushed Ajla Tomljanovic 6-1 6-2.If Britain beat Slovakia, their final opponents will be Poland or Italy - showing why they were among most people's pre-tournament favourites.That is where Britain will face players of greater repute. Poland have the tournament's biggest threat in five-time major champion Iga Swiatek, while Italy are led by world number four Jasmine Paolini, with both having also provided winning contributions in the doubles.\"I definitely wouldn't be here if I didn't believe we could win the tournament,\" said Boulter.\"We've always got a great chance. We're going to keep believing, keep trusting it, and keep enjoying it.\"I don't think there is any pressure. We're just enjoying ourselves.\"",
