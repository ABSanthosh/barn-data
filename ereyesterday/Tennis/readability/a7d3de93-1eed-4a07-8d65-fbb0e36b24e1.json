The world No. 1, who fell to Alcaraz in a five-hour, 29-minute Roland Garros epic last month, delivered a typically Sinner-esque performance on Centre Court, ending the Spaniard’s 24-match winning streak in a 3-hour, 4-minute encounter.

In the first set, both guys started solidly, and Sinner got the first break at 2-2. However, Alcaraz was able to hit back, leveraging his aggressive forehand to target Sinner’s forehand side, rushing the Italian in baseline exchanges. His trademark tactical variety, including frequent drop shots, disrupted Sinner’s rhythm, and that got him fired up as he sealed the set with a stunning defensive backhand block on the stretch, fending off Sinner’s heavy groundstrokes in a quality exchange. Everything changed at the start of the second set as Sinner broke Alcaraz in the opening game, saved a critical break point in his next service game, and slowly found his rhythm. Alcaraz began showing signs of frustration, while Sinner grew more confident in his game. By the third set, Sinner was in full control. His first serve percentage climbed to 84%, making it harder for Alcaraz to get any foothold in return games. Carlos also continued to struggle with his serve, missing too many first serves and throwing in some costly double faults. Sinner broke him at 4–4 and served out the set with authority. In the fourth, Sinner broke again early, this time with a pair of stunning backhand winners. Crucially, when serving at 4–3 and facing break points, Sinner could have had flashbacks to the Roland Garros collapse, but he stayed aggressive. He hit a 110 mph second serve to save one of the break points, then hit a clean jump backhand winner to help hold serve. At 5–4, on match point, Sinner unleashed his fastest serve of the match, 137 mph down the T to clinch the title. So, a deserved win for Sinner, as he played the cleaner match. After the opening set, he was in that relentless attacking mode. Carlos played in a more subdued manner than I expected him to, and was passive for long stretches. The Slams have the “In Attack” metric on their stats, and Sinner almost doubled his % from set one compared to the final three. It’s mostly emotional, because I had a very tough loss in Paris,. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter how you win or how you lose at important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that, and that’s exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just kept working. This is for sure one of the reasons I am holding this trophy here. I am just so grateful that I am healthy and have great people around me, and holding this trophy means a lot. It’s so difficult to play against you, but we have an amazing relationship off the court and on the court, we just try to build up, and to do that we need the best teams in the world. Keep going, keep pushing and you are going to hold this [trophy] many times. You already have two [titles]! It’s so special. Seeing my parents here, my brother, my whole team, it’s amazing. Actually a special thanks to my brother, because there is no Formula 1 race this weekend, that’s why he is here. Sinner on his win. It’s difficult to lose. It’s always difficult to lose, even if it is in the final, but first of all I have to congratulate Jannik once again. It is a really well-deserved trophy [after] an unbelievable two weeks here in London for you, playing great tennis. For your team as well. I know that there are a lot of family and a lot of friends watching you here, so it’s just an amazing team around you. I’m really happy for you. So just keep it going, and I’m really happy to be able to build a really good relationship off the court but then a good rivalry on the court. It makes me improve every day, so thank you very much and congratulations. I’m really proud about everything I’m doing. At the beginning of the season, I struggled a bit on the court and off the court, but then suddenly I just started to really enjoy being on court again, being happy again, and that excitement I have every time step on the court is thanks to my team, my family and lot of friends. I am happy that I have them here. Without them it wouldn’t be possible to stand here right now- It’s a great journey so far which I’m really proud about. I just want to keep it going. Alcaraz on the final. What did you guys think of the final? Do you think it is a good look for tennis that both this year’s champions failed doping tests in the last year?

the world, and I thought Sinner’s performance was impressive as he didn’t dwell on his French Open final loss and effectively showed he had learnt some lessons from Paris.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the first set, both guys started solidly, and Sinner got the first break at 2-2. However, Alcaraz was able to hit back, leveraging his aggressive forehand to target Sinner’s forehand side, rushing the Italian in baseline exchanges.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis trademark tactical variety, including frequent drop shots, disrupted Sinner’s rhythm, and that got him fired up as he sealed the set with a stunning defensive backhand block on the stretch, fending off Sinner’s heavy groundstrokes in a quality exchange.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEverything changed at the start of the second set as Sinner broke Alcaraz in the opening game, saved a critical break point in his next service game, and slowly found his rhythm. Alcaraz began showing signs of frustration, while Sinner grew more confident in his game.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy the third set, Sinner was in full control. His first serve percentage climbed to 84%, making it harder for Alcaraz to get any foothold in return games. Carlos also continued to struggle with his serve, missing too many first serves and throwing in some costly double faults. Sinner broke him at 4–4 and served out the set with authority.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the fourth, Sinner broke again early, this time with a pair of stunning backhand winners. Crucially, when serving at 4–3 and facing break points, Sinner could have had flashbacks to the Roland Garros collapse, but he stayed aggressive. He hit a 110 mph second serve to save one of the break points, then hit a clean jump backhand winner to help hold serve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt 5–4, on match point, Sinner unleashed his fastest serve of the match, 137 mph down the T to clinch the title.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, a deserved win for Sinner, as he played the cleaner match. After the opening set, he was in that relentless attacking mode.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCarlos played in a more subdued manner than I expected him to, and was passive for long stretches. The Slams have the “In Attack” metric on their stats, and Sinner almost doubled his % from set one compared to the final three.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s mostly emotional, because I had a very tough loss in Paris,. But at the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter how you win or how you lose at important tournaments, you just have to understand what you did wrong and try to work on that, and that’s exactly what we did. We tried to accept the loss and just kept working. This is for sure one of the reasons I am holding this trophy here. I am just so grateful that I am healthy and have great people around me, and holding this trophy means a lot. It’s so difficult to play against you, but we have an amazing relationship off the court and on the court, we just try to build up, and to do that we need the best teams in the world. Keep going, keep pushing and you are going to hold this [trophy] many times. You already have two [titles]! It’s so special. Seeing my parents here, my brother, my whole team, it’s amazing. Actually a special thanks to my brother, because there is no Formula 1 race this weekend, that’s why he is here. \u003ccite\u003eSinner on his win.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s difficult to lose. It’s always difficult to lose, even if it is in the final, but first of all I have to congratulate Jannik once again. It is a really well-deserved trophy [after] an unbelievable two weeks here in London for you, playing great tennis. For your team as well. I know that there are a lot of family and a lot of friends watching you here, so it’s just an amazing team around you. I’m really happy for you. So just keep it going, and I’m really happy to be able to build a really good relationship off the court but then a good rivalry on the court. It makes me improve every day, so thank you very much and congratulations. I’m really proud about everything I’m doing. At the beginning of the season, I struggled a bit on the court and off the court, but then suddenly I just started to really enjoy being on court again, being happy again, and that excitement I have every time step on the court is thanks to my team, my family and lot of friends. I am happy that I have them here. Without them it wouldn’t be possible to stand here right now- It’s a great journey so far which I’m really proud about. I just want to keep it going. \u003ccite\u003eAlcaraz on the final.\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat did you guys think of the final?
