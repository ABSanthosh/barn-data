  "description": "The upgraded Dallas Open is being held at The Star, the world headquarters and practice facility of the NFL’s Dallas Cowboys. It is only fitting that Cowboys have stopped in to check out the ATP 500 event. Pro Football Hall of Famer DeMarcus Ware, a Cowboys legend who won the Super Bowl with the Denver Broncos, was thrilled to meet Yoshihito Nishioka on Thursday after the Japanese lefty advanced to the quarter-finals. “I’m here at the tournament. Dallas, you guys, come out to the Dallas Open,” Ware said. “It’s an amazing event and we’re having a good time, so just come on out.” Ware twice led the NFL in sacks and earned a spot in the Pro Bowl nine times. Nishioka is not a big American football fan, but was honoured to meet the all-time great. “I’m really sorry, I don’t watch that much American football. But after I met him, I heard he was playing the Super Bowl and [thought], ‘Oh, that’s amazing’,” Nishioka said. “Usually I cannot meet [someone like] him, so this is a really amazing moment for me. I wanted a picture as well!” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
