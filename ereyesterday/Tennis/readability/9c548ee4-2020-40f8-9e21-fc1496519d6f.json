  "text": "Novak Djokovic has credited Andy Murray with \"bringing a fresh look\" to his game as he prepares for his first tournament since naming his long-time rival as his new coach.Djokovic, the men's record 24-time major winner, will begin his 2025 season at the Brisbane International against Australian Rinky Hijikata next week.The Serb, 37, will be without Britain's three-time Grand Slam champion Murray, who retired from tennis in August, in Brisbane before they unite prior to the Australian Open, which starts on 12 January.\"He has a unique perspective on my game as one of the greatest rivals I've had. He knows the pros and cons of my game,\" Djokovic said of Murray.\"He played until recently on the tour, so he knows all the other best players currently in the world, the youngsters, and the weaknesses and strengths in their game. I look forward to it, I really do.\"I think he's bringing a fresh look to my game and I'll be able to benefit from that, no doubt, on the court. But also that champion mentality he has, I'm sure we'll match very well.\"Djokovic announced in November that he will work with Murray until the conclusion of the Australian Open before making a decision on any longer-term partnership.The Olympic gold medallist will aim to win his 100th ATP singles title in Brisbane before chasing a record-extending 11th Australian Open title.Victory at Melbourne Park next month would see Djokovic, currently level with Margaret Court on 24, achieve the outright record for most Grand Slam titles.Following a 2024 season in which Djokovic failed to win one of the four annual majors - only the second time that has happened since 2010 - he is planning a busier schedule in 2025 after dropping to world number seven.\"I'm planning to play a few more tournaments than I did last season,\" Djokovic said.\"Hopefully the level is also going to go up and as a consequence I'll be able to hopefully win a few tournaments and get my ranking higher.\"Djokovic will partner Nick Kyrgios in the men's doubles in Brisbane.A day after the Australian called the high-profile doping cases involving Grand Slam winners Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek \"disgusting\", Djokovic questioned how those cases have been handled.Italian men's world number one Sinner faces the threat of a possible suspension after he twice tested positive for an anabolic steroid - but was cleared of fault - in March, while Swiatek served a one-month ban for a failed test caused by contamination in August.The treatment given to Sinner and Swiatek has led to accusations of double standards, with Simona Halep claiming \"completely different approaches\" were taken to those cases compared to her own.\"It's not a good image, not a good look for our sport,\" Djokovic told Sky Sports.\"I believe that in the last 20-plus years that I've been playing on the professional tour that we've been one of the cleanest sports. \"I'm just questioning the way the system works really and why certain players are not treated the same as other players. The issue is the inconsistency, the transparency.\"We've been kept in the dark with Jannik's case. I'm not questioning whether he took the banned substance intentionally or not - I've known Jannik since he was very young, he doesn't strike me as somebody that would do such a thing - but I've been really frustrated, as most players [have].\"",
