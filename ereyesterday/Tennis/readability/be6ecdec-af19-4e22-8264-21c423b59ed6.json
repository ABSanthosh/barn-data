  "description": "It felt as if it was a full-circle moment for Richard Gasquet on Monday at the Moselle Open. The 38-year-old, who made the first of his 33 ATP Tour finals in Metz, secured a thrilling opening-round comeback against Thiago Monteiro to stay alive in his final campaign at the tournament. Gasquet saved a match point to prevail 4-6, 6-4, 7-6(6) and record his first tour-level win since May. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important for me to play here, it‚Äôs the last time I‚Äôm playing in Metz, so I want to do well,‚Äù said Gasquet, who is retiring at the conclusion of Roland Garros 2025. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big honour for me [to receive a wild card]. ‚ÄúI am really happy with the way I played, the way I felt, so it‚Äôs a big win for me.

Elsewhere, Cameron Norrie battled from the brink of defeat to record his first tour-level win since July.

The 33-year-old's triumph in the pair‚Äôs maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head series was his first tour-level win since reaching the semi-finals in Metz as a wild card in 2023. Aiming to emulate that success, Herbert will next battle countryman Quentin Halys in the second round. Seventh seed Jan-Lennard Struff got his campaign underway with an inspired comeback triumph against Alexander Shevchenko.
