  "text": "Daniil Medvedev battled cramp as he took just under three hours to beat Karen Khachanov in a gruelling first-round match at the Monte Carlo Masters.Russia's Medvedev prevailed 7-5 4-6 6-4 against compatriot Khachanov in a match that saw 17 breaks of serve.Ninth-seed Medvedev hobbled to the net at the end to shake hands with Khachanov and waved to the crowd, then immediately asked for the physiotherapist for treatment to his legs.There were a combined 36 break points during the two hour and 51 minute match, with Medvedev saving eight of them and Khachanov 11.Former US Open champion Medvedev has dropped out of the top 10 after a difficult start to the season.He has not won a title since the Rome Masters in 2023, which was also on clay, and hasn't reached a final since Indian Wells last year.Medvedev has frequently said he does not like playing on clay, external and reminded the crowd after his victory against Khachanov, saying: \"It's the first match on clay - it's not my favourite surface.\"I don't think Karen hit one ace and he's a big server. So, it was pretty slow, but I'm happy with my level in general and looking forward.\"Medvedev will face France's Alexandre Muller in the second round.Seventeen of the men's top 20 singles players will feature in Monte Carlo, including Novak Djokovic, Carlos Alcaraz and Britain's Jack Draper.",
