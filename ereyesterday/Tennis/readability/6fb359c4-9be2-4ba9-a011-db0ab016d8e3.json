  "description": "A host of the ATP Tourâ€™s biggest stars will return to action this week with ATP 500 events taking place in Doha and Rio de Janeiro, respectively. World No. 3 and recent Rotterdam champion Carlos Alcaraz will lead the field at the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha. Two-time Doha titlist Novak Djokovic will also feature in a stacked field at the hard-court event, which has been upgraded to an ATP 500. Alexander Zverev, the No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings, and Joao Fonseca continue their quest for success on the South American clay as they lead the charge at the Rio Open presented by Claro. ATPTour.com breaks down five things to watch at each event. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN DOHA: 1) Alcarazâ€™s Doha Debut: The 21-year-old Spaniard will this week make his debut at the ATP 500, where he will be the top seed. Alcaraz holds a 9-1 record this season, including a run to the Australian Open quarter-finals and his first indoor title in Rotterdam. Pitted in the same half of the draw in Doha, Alcaraz would have the possibility to avenge his loss to Djokovic in Melbourne if the two reach the semi-finals. 2) Djokovic Aims For 100th Crown: A two-time titlist in Doha, Djokovic is bidding to join Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to clinch 100 tour-level titles. The Serbian will have his work cut out from the outset when he faces 10-time ATP Tour champion Matteo Berrettini in the first round. Djokovic will also accompany former World No. 7 Fernando Verdasco on the doubles court in the Spaniardâ€™s final ATP Tour event. 3) De Minaurâ€™s Doha Quest: After falling to Alcaraz in the Rotterdam final earlier this month, second seed and World No. 6 Alex de Minaur could have the opportunity to earn revenge in Doha. The Australian trails the Spaniard 0-3 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series, and a fourth meeting at ATP 500 level awaits if both are able to reach the championship match. 4) Medvedev, Rublev Among Former Champions: Top 10 stars Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev triumphed in Doha in 2023 and 2020, respectively. Defending champion Karen Khachanov and two-time winner Roberto Bautista Agut are also in the hunt for more glory at the Qatari event. 5) Arevalo \u0026 Pavic Chase First Title In 2025: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic clinched ATP Year-End Doubles No. 1 team presented by PIF honours in 2024, and will be seeking their first title of the new season as top seeds in Doha. The Salvadoran-Croatian duo reached the semi-finals in Adelaide and Rotterdam, and the quarter-finals at the Australian Open. [ATP APP] FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN RIO: 1) Zverev The Man To Stop: Top seed Zverev will aim to bounce back quickly from his quarter-final exit in Buenos Aires last week, where he was defeated by the eventual runner up Francisco Cerundolo in three sets. The German reached his third major final at the Australian Open last month, but will now look to reignite his best form on the clay, where he has won eight of his 23 tour-level titles. 2) More Musetti Magic? Top 20 star Lorenzo Musetti will open against a qualifier in his bid to win a third ATP Tour title, and first since 2022. The Italian was forced to withdraw due to a calf injury prior to his quarter-final clash in Buenos Aires last week and aims to retrieve the level that helped him clinch the bronze medal at the Paris Olympics last year. 3) In-Form Fonseca: Fonseca burst onto the scene 12 months ago in Rio, where he defeated Arthur Fils and Cristian Garin en route to the quarter-finals. The 18-year-old returns to his hometown this week as an ATP Tour champion, having made history in Buenos Aires on Sunday. Fonseca clinched his first tour-level title to become the youngest South American champion in the ATP Tour era (since 1990), and will look to emulate that form on home soil, where he faces Alexandre Muller in the first round.

Sebastian Baez won his maiden ATP 500 title in Rio last year, when he dropped just one set en route to his fifth tour-level crown. The Argentine returns in 2025 with just one tour-level win to his name this season, seeking a big response to his second-round exit at his home ATP 250 in Buenos Aires last week. 5) Former Champs Gonzalez/Molteni Headline Doubles: For the second straight week, Maximo Gonzalez and Andres Molteni will compete as the top seeds. The 2023 Rio champions will aim to reclaim the title and respond to their first-round loss in Buenos Aires last week. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
