Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "A pair of crucial tie-break sets bookended a dramatic quarter-final tie on Wednesday at the Davis Cup Final 8, where Germany moved past Canada 2-0 in Malaga. Jan-Lennard Struff overcame Denis Shapovalov 4-6, 7-5, 7-6(5) to earn the winning point for Germany, which reached its first Davis Cup semi-final since 2021. The No. 43 in the PIF ATP Rankings Struff prevailed in a two-hour, seven-minute battle despite Canada‚Äôs Shapovalov firing 27 aces. Earlier, Daniel Altmaier edged Gabriel Diallo in a 75-minute opening set en route to a 7-6(5), 6-4 triumph. ‚ÄúDenis was playing amazing, coming out firing,‚Äù said Struff, who had served for the match at 5-4 in the third set. ‚ÄúIt was a very tough match. He was serving so well. It was incredible. Second serves at like 180 km/h. It was tough to return. The court is very fast. ‚ÄúI had my chance [in the third set]. I broke him and served for the match. I didn‚Äôt play the best game, but he was there and hit some winners. Even in the tie-break, I went up 4/3 and he then he hit a forehand winner. An incredible match‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just happy to get over the line at the end.‚Äù STRUFF GETS IT DONE! üá©üá™@Struffitennis seals the tie for Team Germany after a remarkable comeback against Shapovalov! üò±@DavisCup | #DavisCup pic.twitter.com/0DSurVrDgg‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) November 20, 2024 Germany faces a big European derby in its semi-final on Friday, when it will take on the Netherlands. ‚ÄúIt will be amazing,‚Äù said Struff of the Netherlands tie. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a big step for us to go from the quarters to the semis. For sure we want to win and go to the final now. Netherlands played an amazing match yesterday beating Spain here in front of a home crowd. So we expect a very tough opponent. Germany and the Netherlands is a little bit of a rivalry. We will try everything. They have amazing fans as well, so looking forward to the match on Friday.‚Äù Captain Michael Kohlmann was delighted as his team moved one step further forward in its bid for its fourth Davis Cup crown, and its first since 1993. ‚ÄúI think if Daniel had lost that first set of the day, the tie was a completely different one,‚Äù reflected Kohlmann on Altmaier‚Äôs opening win. ‚ÄúDaniel was up a break, lost his serve again straightaway and had so many chances in the set, but couldn‚Äôt convert. I think to win it in the end was key for that match.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rafael-nadal-retirement-charity-work-foundation",
    "description": "To celebrate the end of Rafael Nadal's historic career at this week's Davis Cup Final 8, ATPTour.com is publishing a series of articles paying tribute to the Spaniard. View our #RafaSiempre series. Being a great athlete goes far beyond the results achieved in competition. Rafael Nadal understood this from the beginning. He involved himself in numerous social projects and created the Rafa Nadal Foundation in 2010, a platform that has enabled him to use sport as a source of aid, helping children and young people towards a quality future. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always believed that for personal and professional development, opportunities are essential,‚Äù explained Nadal in a report from the foundation published on its 10th anniversary. ‚ÄúIn 2010, we understood that I was in a position in which I could help create them, and that was when we decided to launch this life project. I honestly never imagined that we would be able to create the organisation that the Rafa Nadal Foundation is today.\" [ATP AWARDS] Throughout all these years, the Rafa Nadal Foundation has provided for countless children, establishing a wide range of programmes such as the NETS project (Nadal Educational Tennis School) in India, the ‚ÄòMore Than Tennis‚Äô meetings (where athletes with intellectual disabilities get together from schools all across Spain), the Olazabal and Nadal golf tournaments, the opening of foundation centres in Palma, Valencia and Madrid, charity races, and countless other initiatives. Today, the foundation has several active projects such as ‚ÄòPlay All‚Äô, which directly benefits socially vulnerable children and teenagers and seeks to provide access to tennis for those for whom it is difficult to participate in the sport. ‚ÄòStudy\u0026Play‚Äô is another of the current projects. It endeavours to offer young people who play a sport regularly and with dedication the opportunity to combine practice and competition with their education, by accessing scholarships granted by US universities. Photo Credit: Rafa Nadal Foundation As well as the work carried out through his foundation, Nadal has never hesitated to roll up his sleeves and collaborate in various causes over the years. For example, the Spaniard participated in the ‚ÄòMatch for Africa‚Äô, an exhibition he played with Roger Federer on 21 December, 2010. First, the Spaniard and Swiss faced each other in the Hallenstadion in Zurich, Switzerland, in an event to raise money for the Roger Federer Foundation, which supports education, transport and food for children in Africa. The following day, Nadal and Federer played again in the Caja M√°gica in Madrid. This time the money raised went to the Rafa Nadal Foundation. In 2020, Nadal and Federer participated in the sixth edition of ‚ÄòMatch for Africa‚Äô. It took place on 7 February in Cape Town, South Africa, the country of birth of Federer‚Äôs mother and the focal point of his charity foundation. Before facing each other in singles, Nadal and Federer joined Trevor Noah (presenter of ‚ÄòThe Daily Show‚Äô) and Bill Gates in a doubles match. The event drew a crowd of 51,954, raising 3.5 million dollars for children‚Äôs education in Africa. Photo Credit:¬†Ashley Vlotman/Gallo Images/Getty Images In 2018, during the floods in Sant Lloren√ß des Cardassar, which caused 13 deaths and damaged almost 300 buildings in Mallorca, Nadal immediately got to work, grabbing a broom and helping evacuate the water alongside the other residents, helping the local population. He also donated one million euros to the victims. Nadal was also actively involved during the health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Spanish tennis player joined forces with basketball player Pau Gasol and the Red Cross to raise 11 million euros for people affected by the pandemic, buying medical materials, building infrastructure and contributing to the most vulnerable families. Simply put, the legacy the Spaniard leaves in his wake as he retires from the game transcends that of his titles and sporting success. Editor's note: This story was translated from ATPTour.com/es.
