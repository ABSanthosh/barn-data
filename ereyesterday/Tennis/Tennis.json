    "description": "Jannik Sinner suffered a potentially damaging fall in the early stages of his fourth-round clash at Wimbledon against Grigor Dimitrov, who was forced to retire, while up two sets to none, due to injury. In the first game of the match, the top-seeded Sinner attempted to reach a deep backhand and subsequently fell to the ground, landing on his extended right arm. The 23-year-old then dropped his serve for the first time in the campaign in the ensuing game and took a medical timeout to receive treatment after five games of the second set. Sinner had reached the fourth round at Wimbledon for the loss of just 17 games ‚Äî equalling the Open Era record set by Jan Kodes in 1972 ‚Äî but he was put under extreme pressure by Dimitrov in the early stages. The Bulgarian dropped just three of 34 service points in the first set, and caused havoc with his craft and guile, often executing slice and drop shots. Due to the fading light, the roof on Centre Court was closed after the second set, adding a delay of approximately 10 minutes. With Dimitrov serving at 1-2 in the third set, he attempted to hit a low backhand volley, swiping across his body to do so. After missing the shot, he immediately reached for his pectoral muscle. The Bulgarian then won the game on the next point, but quickly showed that he was in severe pain following his serve and was forced to retire. Sinner's run was in jeopardy, but the Italian is into the quarter-finals at Wimbledon for the fourth consecutive year. The No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings will next face 10th seed Ben Shelton, against whom he holds a 5-1 Lexus ATP Head2Head advantage. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Moving house can be stressful at the best of times. For Flavio Cobolli, a forced change of accommodation unexpectedly disrupted his fortnight at Wimbledon, but the Italian remains alive at the grass major after he overcame Marin Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(3) to reach his first major quarter-final. \"Now I'm really emotional because this is a day that I never forget, for sure,\" said Cobolli in his post-match press conference. \"I played a really good match today. I'm very proud of myself, about my attitude on the court. I think I believe since the first point of the match to win today. I am really, really happy.\" admin really went and said let me cook‚Ä¶ üßë‚Äçüç≥welcome to your first Grand Slam quarter-final Flavio‚Ä¶ ‚ù§Ô∏èHe advances with a 6-4 6-4 6-7 7-6(3)win over Cilic‚Ä¶@wimbledon | #Wimbledon | @cobollifla pic.twitter.com/G4rRaOMhTA‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) July 7, 2025 Unable to stay longer at the house he rented for the start of the grass-court major, Cobolli had been on the hunt for new digs, ideally not too far from the All England Club, ahead of his third-round clash with Jakub Mensik. ‚Äú[I had] to move house. The lady didn't renew our contract,‚Äù Cobolli, who had also struggled to sleep in his original accommodation as a heatwave hit London, told Eurosport in Italian before his Saturday meeting with Mensik. ‚ÄúWe didn't complain... We didn't have anything to deal with the heat, but I spoke to many players, and the situation is the same for everyone. ‚ÄúIt wasn't a problem with the house, but when you find yourself unable to sleep like I did, you always try to find a solution. But now she's kicked us out and we hope to find a house. The hotels, they're far away here. I went to dinner in Chelsea, it took me an hour and twenty minutes. A hotel is the last resort.\" Cobolli‚Äôs house-search was ultimately successful, and the change of base has done nothing to halt his winning charge at SW19. After defeating Mensik in straight sets, the 23-year-old on Monday overcame Cilic 6-4, 6-4, 6-7(4), 7-6(3) to set a last-eight meeting with seven-time champion Novak Djokovic. ‚ÄúI had some problems with my first house, but now I found a great solution,‚Äù Cobolli told ATPTour.com after defeating Cilic. ‚ÄúI slept well. I have a great relationship with the guy that I rent the apartment. Now I'm in good shape.‚Äù Competing at a career-high No. 24 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Cobolli has enjoyed a personal-best season in 2025. He lifted his first two ATP Tour trophies in Bucharest and Hamburg, respectively, and he is up five spots to No. 19 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings as a result of his Wimbledon run so far. The scenes after Cobolli completed his victory against Cilic, during which the Italian converted three of eight points he earned against the big-serving Croatian, were emotional. Cobolli‚Äôs father and coach, Stefano Cobolli, shed tears in the stands on No. 2 Court. ‚ÄúIt is something that I dreamt of since when I was young, since when I started to play tennis,‚Äù reflected Cobolli in his post-match press conference. ‚ÄúEveryone in my family, on my team, told me every day that I was born to play matches like this because they saw me really cold, electric on the court. They always told me that I live for this kind of match. ‚ÄúI think it is true because I really love to play against a big player, against a legend of our sport. I like to play on this kind of stage, this kind of tournament. I really love to play here in Wimbledon. I love to play on grass.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
