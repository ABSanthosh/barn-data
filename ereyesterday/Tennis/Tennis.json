    "title": "Meet Manuel Guinard: From 'really not good' to the ATP Tour",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/guinard-adelaide-2025-feature",
    "description": "Manuel Guinard enjoys Australia so much that he departed France on 18 December for the start of his season. which did not begin until the Brisbane International presented by Evie. The country could become even more meaningful for the Frenchman on Wednesday when he tries to reach his second ATP Tour singles quarter-final. Guinard, a lucky loser, will play top seed Tommy Paul at the Adelaide International. “I really love these kind of matches, because I want to know where I am compared to these kind of players. I've been watching Tommy Paul on TV. I just want to know how it's going to go, how it's going to be, where I am, if I can compete,” Guinard told ATPTour.com. “[I want to see if] I take a 6-1, 6-1 [loss], we'll see.” The 29-year-old is the No. 261 player in the PIF ATP Rankings and made his lone tour-level quarter-final in 2022 at Lyon, where he fell to Holger Rune. An alternate in Adelaide qualifying, Guinard lost in the final round to Yannick Hanfmann, but will have an opportunity to make his mark at the ATP 250 event. He is certainly acclimatised to the Australian weather. “In France, it's minus one [degrees]. In Australia, it's 35 and we've got 10 hours jetlag. So the body when we arrive in Australia, the body is completely [messed up],” said Guinard, who spent time ahead of the season in Brisbane with friend and doubles partner Arthur Rinderknech. They visited Moreton Island and more while training hard, too. “The body needs time. It's not like we arrive and then we visit and it's vacation. We have to do our job and and we need to get the body ready to compete and to be at its maximum.” [ATP APP] Guinard began playing tennis at a young age because his mother is a tennis coach. However, the 6’6” right-hander also played basketball until 13. “I was not good [at tennis] — really not good when I was young, so until 18, let's say 19, and then I wanted to be a tennis coach, because my my level was not that good. I took the tennis coach exam for one year. And then after that, I earned some money with that, with the tennis lessons,” Guinard said. “Some people helped me financially. So it was good for me, because I could play [as a professional for] one year, two years, three years. And then I started to improve my my level and my ranking, and then I've been 134, in singles, 66 in doubles.” Fellow Frenchman Victor Wembanyama has taken the basketball world by storm. How close was Guinard to joining his countryman? “I was kind of good at basketball also. I was tall, I was athletic. I was 12, and I was playing with some guys who were 16. I was taking it seriously,” Guinard said. “But then I was like, ‘Let's take the easy way’, because my mother knew some good [tennis] academies, and she knows some people could help me and stuff. So I decided to go this way.” Around the age of 14, Guinard spent time at an academy in France and was doing school at home. His ranking was “not good” at the time, but he wanted to give himself the best chance to maximize his potential. His coaches helped him not just with tennis, but improving as a person and with school. “They really coached me the way I am. I love the game and they took me like this with all the positive things, but also the negative. And they pushed me like this,” Guinard said. “Those people, I admire them a lot because without them, I couldn't be there. And then my parents supported me a lot.” A lover of many sports, Guinard also enjoys biking and playing padel. But on Wednesday he will take the court to do what he does best against Paul. “Tennis is a strange sport because everybody's playing good. And you can see some players 300 can beat players Top 100,” Guinard said. “It's pretty cool, actually, because we can compete with some guys like this and then improve our level also.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Basavareddy’s big decision: How #NextGenATP star is relishing life as a pro",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/basavareddy-2025-turning-pro-feature",
    "description": "Making big life decisions can be tough for anybody, let alone for someone still in their teens. Yet Nishesh Basavareddy is remarkably composed when he speaks about his thought process before opting to leave college and turn pro in early December. The 19-year-old, who spent two years competing for the Stanford University Cardinals before a late-2024 surge helped him charge to a spot at the season-ending Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, feels his increasing success made his decision inevitable. “I think over the course of the summer and the fall there was a lot of thought, but I knew that if I qualified [for Jeddah] and with me also having a main-draw wild card for the Australian Open, that just made the decision a lot easier,” Basavareddy told ATPTour.com. “Knowing that I was going to be playing the bigger tournaments and getting close to the Top 100, that made it a pretty easy decision then, but it was never easy to leave behind college tennis and my team at Stanford.”         View this post on Instagram                       A post shared by Nishesh Basavareddy (@nishesh05) While the decision to attend college or not in the first place is one that many young people face, choosing to leave further education to pursue success in the dog-eat-dog world of elite sport is not. Student athletes are in a somewhat unique position, especially given that there are no guarantees when it comes to a pro sports career, the early days of which can be especially rocky and represent a stark contrast to the relative stability of college life. It is for that reason that Basavareddy sought guidance from more experienced heads before making the switch. “I was definitely talking to people about the decision,” he recalled. “James, my agent, the coaching staff, and Rajeev [Ram] really helped me a lot. He left after a semester at the University of Illinois, so he helped me kind of understand what to expect if you do this and turn pro. But they were all supportive of my decisions, so that made it easier to make a decision.” The overwhelming catalyst for Basavareddy’s move was a stunning stretch of form on the ATP Challenger Tour after the 2024 US Open. He won of 28 of 34 Challenger matches from September to November, lifting titles in Tiburon and Puerto Vallarta in the process. Having started the year as the No. 457 in the PIF ATP Rankings, he ended it at No. 138. “I feel like having consistent results at Challengers post-US Open definitely gave me a belief that that’s something I can replicate month after month, and at each tournament,” said Basavareddy. “I think that's probably where I saw the most improvement in my game, just the steady improvement throughout the year in a lot of aspects of my game.” Basavareddy earned his first tour-level win and maiden triumph against a Top 50 opponent by defeating Shang Juncheng in Jeddah. He has carried that confidence into the 2025 season, during which he has already qualified for his first ATP Tour main draws in Brisbane and Auckland, respectively. In Brisbane, he pushed Gael Monfils to three sets before falling in the first round. On Tuesday in Auckland, Basavareddy raced past Francisco Comesana 6-2, 6-2 to set a second-round clash with defending champion Alejandro Tabilo. Although he is now facing top-level opponents on a weekly basis and focusing on the first full year of his pro career, Basavareddy is not likely to forget his college days in a hurry. The Carmel, Indiana native understands the role his time at Stanford has played in his development. “When I finished high school, I was only 17, so I was still young, and now with the Challenger wild cards and everything, I was sort of able to skip a step and didn’t have to play [ITF World Tennis Tour] Futures, really,” he explained. “I was able to get a lot of high-level competition for two years in college, so I think it was definitely beneficial because I was able to get straight into the Challengers this summer and then go off from there. “I think that was a huge benefit, and also just meeting a lot of great people, that was a lot of fun.” [ATP APP] The social joy of college life aside, Basavareddy will for now also miss out on another off-court benefit of being a student athlete: earning a degree. Yet completing his studies in Data Science remains a goal for the American, even if he has to wait until his pro tennis career is over, meaning he is not worrying about what he has left behind. “While I'm out on Tour, I won't be studying, just because Stanford doesn’t allow online classes,” said Basavareddy. “But once I'm done, I'm definitely planning on going back and finishing my degree. I have about 15 months left. “Obviously [turning pro is] a big step in my life but knowing that I always have college to fall back on [helped]. I think that was one of the reasons why I went to college in the first place. So I still have that, if I ever need a degree or want to do something outside of tennis, or post tennis. But being on Tour now, I would say the feeling is more excitement than anxiety.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
