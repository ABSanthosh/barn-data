Just 13 days removed from his triumph at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, the Brazilian returned to the winner's circle Saturday at the ATP Challenger Tour 125 event in Canberra, Australia. Fonseca downed American Ethan Quinn 6-4, 6-4 in the Workday Canberra International final, extending his match winning streak to 10. Only one other past Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF champion won his next event at any level: Jannik Sinner, currently No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian won the Ortisei Challenger the week after lifting the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF crown in 2019.

The #NextGenATP star turned pro in February, shortly after his dream run in Rio de Janeiro, where backed by home support, Fonseca became the second-youngest ATP 500 quarter-finalist since the series began in 2009. The teenager‚Äôs first Challenger title came in August, when he triumphed in Lexington, Kentucky to become the youngest Brazilian champion at that level. Fonseca was dominant en route to both Challenger title runs, not dropping a set in either Lexington or Canberra. Sinner also won the Lexington Challenger title the same year he was crowned champion at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. In other Challenger action Saturday, Japan‚Äôs Shintaro Mochizuki began his season in style, claiming the BNC Tennis Open in Noumea, New Caledonia. The 21-year-old defeated Moerani Bouzige 6-1, 6-3 in the final to win his second Challenger title and first on hard courts. Mochizuki is up to No. 170 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

The former World No. 14 ousted second-seeded Frenchman Gregoire Barrere 7-6(5), 7-5 in the final, securing his fourth Challenger title and first since August 2020. ‚ÄúI had a tough year in 2024, I got injured at the beginning of the year in Brisbane,‚Äù Karatsev reflected. ‚ÄúIt takes me a while to get back. We worked a lot with the team on the recovery, we made a good preparation. Of course, [winning] the first tournament of the year gives you some confidence, having matches already. You just have to keep pushing.‚Äù Aslan Karatsev in action at the Bangkok Open 1. Credit: The Lawn Tennis Association of Thailand [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "One of the beauties of sport -- and tennis in particular -- is its continual capacity to surprise. For instance: The Czech Republic and Kazakhstan, seeded eighth and ninth, respectively, reached the semifinals at this frenetic United Cup. But at the end of another dramatic day, it was the two top seeds -- the United States and Poland -- advancing to Sunday‚Äôs final in Sydney. Second-seeded Poland took care of Kazakhstan 3-0 and later the top-seeded USA followed with a 3-0 victory against the Czech Republic. Poland, a finalist last year before losing to Germany, looks to take the final step in this spirited 18-nation competition. The Americans, winners of the inaugural event two years ago, are intent on winning two of three titles. The final awaits üí´Team USA will battle it out for the title against Team Poland tomorrow...üá∫üá∏ x üáµüá±#UnitedCup pic.twitter.com/OExajKZAQy‚Äî United Cup (@UnitedCupTennis) January 4, 2025 A marquee WTA match will kick off proceedings in Sunday‚Äôs final: World No. 2 Iga Swiatek versus No. 3 Coco Gauff. Both players have won all six of their singles and doubles matches -- and their last meeting, at the WTA Finals in Riyadh, went to Gauff. The men‚Äôs match features the No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Taylor Fritz, opposite No. 16 Hubert Hurkacz. Fritz was trailing Tomas Machac 6-7 (4), 6-5 in Saturday‚Äôs semi-finals when the Czech Republic player abruptly retired with cramp. Machac, who led 5-3 in the second, actually served for the match. ‚ÄúPoland‚Äôs got a great team,‚Äù U.S. captain Michael Russell said. ‚ÄúI think keys to the match are coming out and fighting like Coco and Taylor did so well today. It‚Äôs going to come down to maybe a few points, but we have a great bench behind us, too, so it will be fun.‚Äù Swiatek‚Äôs 7-6 (5), 6-4 victory over Kazakhstan‚Äôs Elena Rybakina in the semi-finals was a scintillating display of performance under pressure. Swiatek converted her fourth set point to finish off the 72-minute opening frame. Earlier, Hurkacz defeated Alexander Shevchenko 6-3, 6-2 in a scant 59 minutes. Swiatek -- who was wearing a wrap on her right thigh -- has now won 14 of the 15 matches she‚Äôs played at the United Cup. She holds a commanding 11-2 lead in the head-to-head. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs playing great,‚Äù Swiatek said of the 20-year-old Gauff. ‚ÄúI think at this stage she‚Äôs developing every month, and it‚Äôs going to be also a nice challenge. I can kind of play without expectations and just push for more as I did today.‚Äù Fritz has won three of the four matches he‚Äôs played against Hurkacz, most recently a 7-6 (2), 6-4 round of 16 win last year in Madrid. ‚ÄúI think Hubi is tough,‚Äù Fritz said. ‚ÄúI think one thing going for me is I think I served really well today. I have been serving well the whole tournament. So that‚Äôs something I‚Äôm definitely going to need against him.‚Äù Fritz was part of the 2022 United Cup championship team; Gauff is playing for the first time.
