Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Stefanos Tsitsipas and Goran Ivanisevic have parted ways, the 26-year-old Greek announced on Instagram Wednesday. \"Working with Goran Ivanisevic was brief but an intense experience and a truly valuable chapter in my journey,\" Tsitsipas wrote in a statement posted on his Instagram story. \"I'm thankful for the time, effort and energy he dedicated to me and my team.\" Tsitsipas, who fell out of the Top 20 of the PIF ATP Rankings in June, has tallied a 19-13 season record, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his best result being a title run in Dubai. Ivanisevic joined Tsitsipas' team after Roland Garros and travelled with the 12-time tour-level titlist to Halle and Wimbledon.¬† \"As we are now following our separate ways, I have only respect for Goran¬†‚Äî not just for what he's achieved in tennis, but also for who he is as a person,\" Tsitsipas said. \"I wish him nothing but the very best moving forward.\"Struggling to find his consistent best this year, Tsitsipas will look to return to form during the North American hard-court swing.Tsitsipas last competed at Wimbledon, where he retired in the first round due to a back injury. Frenchman Valentin Royer led Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-2 when Tsitsipas could not continue. That defeat only added to Tsitsipas' disappointing Slam results this year. The two-time major finalist lost in the opening round of the Australian Open and in the second round of Roland Garros. Tsitsipas is in danger of falling outside the Top 30 for the first time since July 2018.Tsitsipas is next scheduled to play the National Bank Open Presented by Rogers in Toronto, where main-draw action begins 27 July. The Athens native, 24th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is aiming to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals for the sixth time in his career. He won the prestigious season finale in 2019.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Taylor Fritz made a winning return to hard courts on Wednesday at the Mubadala Citi DC Open, where he opened his Washington campaign in style. The top seed delivered a commanding display to move past Aleksandar Vukic 6-3, 6-2 and record his first win on the surface since reaching the Miami semi-finals in March ‚Äî his most recent hard-court appearance. Fritz won 88 per cent (29/33) of first-serve points and saved the only break point he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats, in a typically clinical serving display. Taylor is all business üíº The perfect start for the top seed @Taylor_Fritz97 on home soil as he defeats Vukic 6-3 6-2! @mubadalacitidc | #MubadalaCitiDCOpen pic.twitter.com/SJV2jeJe2k ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) July 23, 2025 The No. 4 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, Fritz arrived in Washington after a career-best grass-court season, during which he won titles in Stuttgart and Eastbourne before reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon. A former semi-finalist in Washington, Fritz will next face Matteo Arnaldi after the Italian beat countryman Lorenzo Sonego 7-5, 7-5. Fritz, last year‚Äôs runner-up at the Nitto ATP Finals, is seventh in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Daniil Medvedev, who reached the 2019 Washington final, was also victorious on Wednesday in D.C. The eighth seed bounced back from his opening-round defeat at Wimbledon by rallying past Reilly Opelka 3-6, 7-5, 6-1. Opelka stunned Medvedev in ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch last month, but Medvedev earned some quick revenge to improve to 5-2 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and move to a 24-14 record on the season. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough to play against Reilly, you need to have a good feel on his serve,‚Äù said Medvedev, who will next face Wu Yibing. ‚ÄúYou have to guess a little bit, but you don‚Äôt want to overguess it, like I did in ‚Äòs-Hertogenbosch. He got in my head and made 24 aces‚Ä¶ Today was better and I managed to get more looks on his serve.‚Äù Watch Medvedev vs. Opelka Highlights:¬† Alex de Minaur recorded his first win in Washington since reaching the 2018 final by moving past Buyunchaokete 7-6(5), 6-2.
