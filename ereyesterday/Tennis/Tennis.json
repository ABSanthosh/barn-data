Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "On Thursday, the Carlos Alcaraz Foundation officially opened its Los Pies en la Tierra (Ones Feet on the Ground) exhibition, which seeks to highlight the importance of equal opportunities for children. On an emotional evening on the patio of the Carcel Vieja building, where the exhibition can be visited free of charge from 14 December to 15 February, Los Pies en la Tierra was inaugurated at an event that was attended by Carlos Alcaraz, Beatriz Garfia, the foundation’s director, and Jose Ballesta, the mayor of Murcia. Los Pies en la Tierra is a call for all citizens to take pause for thought. Through the story of the life of Alcaraz, a boy with a normal childhood which allowed him to follow his path and chase his dreams, the exhibition underlines the fact that very close by there are many boys and girls who are much less fortunate, faced with obstacles that hinder their development and condition the rest of their lives. [ATP APP] “I was just like any other kid, growing up in El Palmar, in an average family, running around in the park with his friends, who went to the local school, without enjoying any luxuries,” said Alcaraz. “I was passionate about sport and tennis in particular, but it was a very normal childhood. Today we are here, feeling very fortunate and grateful and we would like to do our part by taking action for children.” “The goal of this exhibition is to show a reality, that of a very challenging childhood. It is a reality that to us may be invisible or distant, but in fact it is very close. This is about raising awareness of that, of the importance of this stage of human life,” said Beatriz Garfia, the foundation’s director. “And because, individually or collectively, we have a lot to say, we have the capacity to influence. Every small gesture counts and can make the difference to children’s lives.” After Alcaraz officially opened the exhibition by cutting the ribbon, which was symbolically hanging over a tennis net, guests had the opportunity to enjoy a guided tour of the exhibition, led by the tennis player himself and his family. Los Pies en la Tierra was conceived for visitors of all ages, and it provides an interactive experience through video games, activities, and questions. It includes some of Alcaraz’s most important trophies as well as a few surprise items the tennis player has donated. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "To mark the end of the 2024 season, ATPTour.com highlights five moments to remember from the ATP Challenger Tour season. Schwaerzler’s historic ‘surprise’ #NextGenATP Joel Schwaerzler entered the record books at the Macedonian Open, where he became just the fourth player to win a title at that level while holding the junior No. 1 ranking. Nick Kyrgios, Taylor Fritz and Wu Yibing also accomplished the feat. “I was kind of surprised,” Schwaerzler said. “I knew I could win matches there but to actually win the tournament is something different.” The 18-year-old, who won this year’s Roland Garros boys’ doubles event alongside Norway’s Nicolai Budkov Kjaer, finished the season at No. 330 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Schwaerzler is the fourth-youngest Austrian winner in ATP Challenger Tour history. Mejia wins Challenger title in memory of late father Nearly seven years on since his father’s passing, Mejia celebrated a career milestone in April, when he won his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Following his triumph, Mejia was enthusiastic, yet emotional, as he pointed to the sky. \"Papá, papá,\" he uttered. “Every single day that goes by, I mention him, I think about him, I dream about him in my sleep because I think about him the whole time,” said the No. 219 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. “It's been the toughest battle for me to realise and know that he is physically gone forever. I feel that he's close to me every single day of my life. That's one thing that will keep me going forever because that strength he gave me is unconditional. “I think when I lifted the trophy, I was also looking to the sky as a sign of relief… I wanted to look at my dad, obviously pointing the trophy to him.” Read ATPTour.com's feature: Mejia wins Challenger title in memory of late father: ‘The pain never goes away’.

As the central African country continues to recover and rebuild, tennis is playing a small but important part of the healing process. The ATP Challenger Tour spent two weeks (26 February-10 March) in the capital city Kigali, making Rwanda the seventh African country to host an event at that level. Rather than trying to erase the dark chapter from history, the tournament adopted an alternative approach: promoting education and honouring the fallen through visits to the Kigali Genocide Memorial. More than 20 players visited the memorial. “Rwanda took a risk to organise the first big tournament in this part of the world,” tournament director Arzel Mevellec said. “It’s a very important symbol. Rwanda is a small country but with big events now. Soccer, NBA Academy Africa, and now Rwanda is on the world map of tennis and I think that’s the beginning of something huge. Rwanda can be proud about that.” Rwanda is the seventh African country to host an ATP Challenger Tour event. Credit: Rwanda Tennis Federation Champions hailing from college ranks The college pathway continues to be a vital stepping stone for many players to find success on the ATP Challenger Tour and beyond. A single-season record 27 different players with college tennis experience won titles this year, led by four-time winner Jacob Fearnley, who helped TCU capture the 2024 NCAA D1 men’s tennis championship in May before making quick progress on the Challenger Tour. The four-time ITA All-American finished the season at No. 99 in the PIF ATP Rankings, a vast improvement upon his No. 646 ranking at the start of the year. The 2023 NCAA singles champion Ethan Quinn captured his maiden Challenger title in Champaign, his final tournament of the year. Tristan Boyer (Stanford), Federico Agustin Gomez (Louisville), Alexander Ritschard (Virginia), Learner Tien (USC) and Valentin Vacherot (Texas A\u0026M) all claimed three Challenger titles. [ATP APP] Vacherot’s dominant start to season Vacherot started the season on one of the hottest Challenger runs in recent memory. The 26-year-old won his first 15 Challenger-level matches of the year, claiming three titles. It was the longest winning streak to start a Challenger season since 2017. Vacherot was crowned champion in back-to-back weeks in Nonthaburi, Thailand and triumphed a month later in Pune, India. A shoulder injury unfortunately hindered Vacherot’s standout season in which he did not compete in any tournaments after the US Open. Vacherot tallied a 21-3 season record (Challenger level) and held the second-highest winning percentage on the ATP Challenger Tour this year (87.5 per cent), only behind Fearnley (27-3, 90 per cent).
