It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Novak Djokovic will face a home challenge in his first match of the new season. The 37-year-old will begin his pursuit of a 100th tour-level title at the Brisbane International presented by Evie against Australian Rinky Hijikata. Djokovic will be appearing in the ATP 250 event for the first time since 2009. It will be his first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting against Hijikata, the No. 73 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. Djokovic has not competed since reaching the Rolex Shanghai Masters final in October. The top seed could face former World No. 6 Gael Monfils in the second round. The Frenchman will begin his season against a qualifier. [ATP APP] Nick Kyrgios will make his highly anticipated return against big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, the Most Improved Player of the Year in 2024 ATP Awards. It promises to be a showdown full of big serving between two of the best servers on the ATP Tour. Kyrgios will be in tour-level action for the first time since Stuttgart in June 2023. The Australian won the Brisbane title in 2018 and most recently played the tournament in 2019. Defending champion Grigor Dimitrov, who also triumphed in Brisbane in 2017, is the second seed. The Bulgarian will open against a qualifier. A first-round match to watch will be home favourite Jordan Thompson, the eighth seed, taking on Matteo Berrettini. The Italian is fresh off a year in which he claimed Comeback Player of the Year honours. Berrettini won the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting at the 2019 US Open. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Gao, Zhang light up Perth with contrasting United Cup victories",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/china-brazil-perth-2025-friday",
    "description": "Gao Xinyu notched a major upset at the United Cup in Perth, overcoming Beatriz Haddad Maia 5-7, 6-4, 7-5 to give China an initial 1-0 lead over Brazil in the opening rubber of the Group E tie. The three-hour, 22-minute epic, which was the longest WTA singles match in tournament history, thoroughly contrasted Zhang Zhizhen’s 6-3, 6-0 triumph over Thiago Monteiro, which sealed the tie in China’s favour. The No. 45 in the PIF ATP Rankings breezed past the Brazilian in just 54 minutes to improve to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series.  \"After the China Open, I played a lot of matches, and I lost in the final set,” explained Gao. “I had a lot of opportunities, but I didn't take them. So today, in the final set again, I was thinking ‘Please, let me win one time, at least’.” In Gao’s show-stopping comeback, both players battled physical adversity. Gao required a medical time-out in the second set and resumed play with her left thigh heavily strapped, and the 27-year-old was in visible discomfort at times. Haddad Maia was afflicted by cramps when serving up 4-3 in the third set, resorting to several underarm deliveries and ultimately getting broken.    Nonetheless, both players put on a thriller for the RAC Arena crowd. No.175-ranked Gao, a replacement for Olympic gold medallist Zheng Qinwen, owned just one previous tour-level win in her career, and this was her first encounter with a Top 50 player. She had only notched one prior Top 100 win, all the way back in 2017 over Veronica Cepede Royg in Beijing qualifying that year. But despite the gulf in experience, she went toe-to-toe with No.17-ranked Haddad Maia throughout and emerged with a career-best win. \"I have no idea what's going on right now,\" said Gao in the on-court interview. \"My brain was empty and my whole body was cramping.\" Though Haddad Maia imposed her authority early with an immediate break, Gao settled into her groove and fired a trio of clean winners to break back and level at 5-5. She also held two points to force a tiebreak, but the Brazilian slammed down four consecutive unreturned serves to escape with a tight first set. But Gao's tactics came to the fore in the second set as she pulled Haddad Maia off court with sharp angles and used high forehands to reset points before picking her moments to strike. Still, as the match headed into a decider Haddad Maia seemed to have the physical advantage -- until cramps struck in a dramatic eighth game. Haddad Maia was able to move more freely by the next game, but Gao was in no mood to let her lifeline go. At 30-30 in the final game, she defied a net-rushing Haddad Maia with an excellent lob, then sealed victory as a Haddad Maia forehand sailed out. It was a fitting win for a player who hit the headlines last September for losing a 4-hour, 15-minute marathon against Sara Sorribes Tormo in Beijing, the fourth-longest WTA match of the Open Era.   Zhang later tied the bow on a statement start to China’s second United Cup campaign. The Chinese No. 1 male player offered no let up in a clinical performance, during which he won 87 per cent (26/30) of points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys ATP Stats. “I can understand how much pressure [Gao] took [off],” Zhang said. “I had a lot of pressure in the same situation last year. I won a tough three-setter, and Qinwen had a high ranking. It was because of my team, they did a great job.” Zhang then teamed up with United Cup debutant Zhang Shuai to make it a clean 3-0 sweep on day one in Perth, recovering from a break deficit in the second set to prevail 6-4, 7-5 against Carolina Alves and Rafael Matos. China’s opening day triumph offers promise for what is to come for the Asian nation at this year’s United Cup. On its debut in 2024, Zhang and WTA No. 5 Zheng led China to the quarter-finals, but with reigning champions Germany lurking in their Group this year, the win over Brazil might just prove pivotal in its quest to emulate that form.
