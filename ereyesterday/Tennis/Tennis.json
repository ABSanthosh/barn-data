Let‚Äôs take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Camilo Ugo Carabelli earned one of the most memorable and dramatic wins of his career at the Movistar Chile Open on Tuesday. The Argentine fended off three match points and staged a thrilling deciding-set comeback, edging past 2023 champion and home favourite Nicolas Jarry 5-7, 6-3, 7-6(9). Jarry will rue his first match point at 5-4 in the third set when he missed a routine backhand volley in the net. The 25-year-old Ugo Carabelli won four consecutive points from 2/5 in the deciding-set tie-break, including a dramatic exchange at 3/5 when Jarry celebrated prematurely, shouting \"Vamos!\" ‚Äî believing the point was over ‚Äî only for the Argentine's forehand to clip the baseline and sail past the seventh seed. ‚ÄúI feel very happy. Very difficult match with Nico,‚Äù Ugo Carabelli said. ‚ÄúHe served so stong. I feel tired, but I won and I‚Äôm so happy.‚Äù Camilo spoils the party! üëÄ@camilougo saves 3‚É£ MPs as he knocks out Jarry in a hard-fought three set showdown 5-7 6-3 7-6 (9)! üò± @chile_open | #MovistarChileOpen pic.twitter.com/1rPRPQHDyg ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) February 25, 2025 Ugo Carabelli, who is at a career-high No. 69 in the PIF ATP Rankings, reached his first tour-level semi-final last week in Rio de Janeiro. He will aim to continue his form against Brazilian Thiago Monteiro, who escaped Juan Manuel Cerundolo 6-3, 3-6, 7-6(2). Tuesday marked Ugo Carabelli and Jarry‚Äôs first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, though they clashed four times on the ATP Challenger Tour and once at a tour-level qualifying event. Jarry had won four of those five meetings. The 29-year-old Jarry held a match point last week in Rio de Janeiro against Francisco Comesana before the Argentine stormed back and eventually reached the semi-finals. Ugo Carabelli's close friend Tomas Martin Etcheverry also advanced, cruising past Frenchman Hugo Gaston 6-2, 6-3. The fifth seed will next meet 2021 champion Cristian Garin. Portugal's Jaime Faria, who is making his Top 100 debut this week, ousted eighth-seeded Italian Luciano Darderi 6-3, 6-4. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
