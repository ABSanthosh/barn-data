    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/de-minaur-reaction-australian-open-2025-wednesday",
    "description": "Alex de Minaur‚Äôs run at the Australian Open may be over, but he feels he has plenty more to show on tennis' biggest stages. The 25-year-old World No. 8, who was at his highest career seeding at a Grand Slam, broke new ground in Melbourne by reaching the quarter-finals at his home major for the first time. A fan favourite inside Rod Laver Arena, De Minaur strung together four impressive victories before falling to top seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner on Wednesday night. Sinner appeared a man on a mission with his 6-3, 6-2, 6-1 victory. Despite defeat, however, De Minaur was quick to address the positives of his campaign and dismiss any suggestions that he may have reached his peak. ‚ÄúThe positives‚Ä¶ how I handled everything,‚Äù reflected De Minaur after his one-hour, 48-minute quarter-final defeat to Sinner. ‚ÄúThe fact that I came in this year [in the] Top 10, with a lot of expectation, a lot of pressure. Obviously the whole country wanted me to do well. I wanted to do well here. ‚ÄúI thought I handled it really well to put myself in this position. I would have loved to do more today, but this is what happens sometimes in tennis. Look, the negative is after playing some great tennis on home soil and gaining so much, you feel like you just have been slapped across the face, to be honest, to finish off like that. ‚ÄúI still don't think this is my ceiling. I still think I've got more in the tank. So I'll be searching for that.‚Äù A phenomenal run at home Demon, you should be so proud üá¶üá∫ ‚ô•Ô∏è #AO2025 pic.twitter.com/qBRyWxQ0iB ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) January 22, 2025 After Wednesday‚Äôs defeat to Sinner, De Minaur trails the Italian 0-10 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. It was never an easy task for the Australian, who was heading into his maiden last-eight clash at the Australian Open against a man who had won 18 consecutive matches at hard-court majors. Although the comprehensive manner of De Minaur‚Äôs defeat will sting, he can reflect on another impressive Grand Slam campaign of his own. He has now reached the quarter-final stage at each of the past four major tournaments, but is eager for more. ‚ÄúIt's pretty tough right now for me to sit here after this defeat and tell you that I believe I can go all the way,‚Äù De Minaur said when asked if he believes he can go deeper at Grand Slams. ‚ÄúBut saying that, I do think that there are opportunities out there. ‚ÄúTennis is so much about matchups, right? I think right now my worst matchup on Tour is probably Jannik. There's a head-to-head that doesn't lie. If I'm on a different side of the draw, different little section, then who knows? I genuinely think I'm going to give myself opportunities, and I don't think my peak is making quarter-finals in a Slam. ‚ÄúI see other players that have made it further, have made semis, have made finals, and I do believe that I can be amongst them, right? If they have been able to accomplish that, then why not me?‚Äù The confidence that Sinner exuded throughout his quarter-final clash with De Minaur was palpable. The Italian struck cleanly from the baseline and hardly offered his opponent a look in, saving the only break point he faced in the match, according to Infosys Stats. De Minaur has often been on the receiving end of this over the past three months. The Australian drew Sinner in his Nitto ATP Finals debut match in November, and was also beaten by the Italian in the semi-finals of the Davis Cup a week later. As a player who has notable experience across the net from Sinner, De Minaur was asked for his thoughts on the World No. 1. ‚ÄúHe's built this aura up from beating everyone,‚Äù De Minaur said. ‚ÄúIt's not like he's just had a good week here or a good week there. He's just beaten everyone. I think the best way to describe it is the fact that he was able to last year, play Novak here and play pretty flawlessly, and, again, give him not too many games, right? Novak out here is probably the best player to have ever played on these courts, right? ‚ÄúThe fact that he's got this top level that he can do this to players, it's pretty tough. You go into the match, and you know it's going to be a battle, it's going to be tough, you're going to try different things. But then you're an hour and 30 in, and you're struggling to win games, and you're trying to find ways to get on the board. It's pretty surreal.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/djokovic-zverev-australian-open-2025-sf-preview",
    "description": "Novak Djokovic pushed through the pain on Tuesday at the Australian Open to overcome Carlos Alcaraz and keep alive his hopes of winning a record-extending 25th major. Physically depleted after his three-hour, 37-minute battle against the Spaniard, the question is whether the Serbian can back up that victory when he takes on Alexander Zverev in his 50th major semi-final on Friday. ‚ÄúThe extra day with no match comes at a good time,‚Äù said Djokovic on Tuesday following his four-set win against Alcaraz. ‚ÄúI have to assess the situation tomorrow when I wake up. I will try to do as much as I possibly can with my recovery team, with my physio today, tomorrow, the next few days. Probably skip training tomorrow. I'll see if I'm going to train in two days or not. ‚ÄúI'll take it day by day. Now it's really about recovery. I'm concerned. I am, to be honest, physically. But if I manage somehow to be physically good enough, I think mentally, emotionally I'm as motivated as I can be.‚Äù Djokovic, who had his upper left leg taped during his win against Alcaraz, is chasing a record-extending 11th Australian Open title and famously won the hard-court event in 2023 when managing an injury. The next force standing in the way of a 100th tour-level title for Djokovic is Zverev, who beat Tommy Paul in four sets to reach his ninth major semi-final. Only Djokovic (13) has reached more Slam semi-finals than the second seed since 2020. The German is still chasing his first major title, though, but will come into the match relatively fresh, having dropped just two sets en route to the last four. ‚ÄúI'm going to prepare myself for a tough battle,‚Äù Zverev said looking ahead to the semi-finals. ‚ÄúI'm going to prepare myself for a very intense and high-level match. I know I have the level. I've beaten [him] before. Hopefully I can do that again.‚Äù Djokovic, coached by Andy Murray, leads Zverev 8-4 in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series. This will be just their second meeting since 2021 and fourth at a major. Djokovic beat the German in the quarters at Roland Garros in 2019 and in Melbourne in 2021 and in the semi-finals at the US Open in 2021. Standing deep behind the baseline and happy to grind away, World No. 2 Zverev is playing close to his best in Melbourne and has been back at the top of the game since last year following a horrific ankle injury in 2022. He will look to turn the match against the 37-year-old Djokovic into a physical battle on Rod Laver Arena. However, temperatures in Melbourne are expected to be around 20 Degrees Celsius on Friday and the cooler conditions could suit Djokovic, who is the third oldest AO semi-finalist in history behind Ken Rosewall and Roger Federer.
