    "description": "Stan Wawrinka spoiled Nishesh Basavareddy's 20th birthday on Friday, when the 40-year-old earned a 7-6(8), 6-3 victory against the American to reach the semi-finals of the Open Aix Provence CrÃ©dit Agricole. The Swiss rode his momentum following a marathon first set to book his first semi-final ticket at any level since last October at the ATP 250 in Stockholm. Wawrinka held set point on return at 5-4, but was forced to a tie-break, during which he saved two set points before closing out the opener. The wild card finished the match having won 80 per cent of his first-serve points, compared to Basavareddy's 66 per cent, according to Infosys ATP Stats.Last 4 standing in France! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·#ATPChallenger | @OpenduPaysdAix pic.twitter.com/LgJThE5wvAâ€” ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) May 2, 2025 Borna Coric also advanced to the last fourÂ with a 7-5, 6-4 win against Mariano Navone, continuing his Challenger resurgence and remaining on course for a final showdown with Wawrinka. \"I thought this was the best match I've played on clay so far this year,\" said Coric, who is aiming for a season-leading fourth Challenger title. \"I was really happy with my performance, I was serving good, I was playing from the baseline great. I had a small drop off in the second set, but overall I'm really happy. I need to recover well and use some ice as it was obviously a long match, but I'm looking forward to tomorrow.\" While it may be tempting to look ahead to a championship match featuring fan favourites' Wawrinka and Coric, the three-time major champion will first have to get past Coric's countryman Borna Gojo while the 28-year-old faces Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse in the semi-finals.Buse led Reilly Opelka 7-6(4), 2-3 when the American was forced to retire due to a right hip injury. Gojo defeated Valentin Vacherot 6-2, 6-3. Michelsen, Kecmanovic set Top 50 semi-final in Estoril It's not often an ATP Challenger Tour event features a semi-final consisting of two Top 50 players, but Alex Michelsen and Miomir Kecmanovic have ensured this feat at the MIllennium Estoril Open. Michelsen, seeded second, dispatched Luca Nardi 6-3, 6-4 in a dominant baseline performance to reach his first clay semi-final at any level while Kecmanovic overcame home favourite and third seed Nuno Borges 6-0, 6-7(5), 6-4. Italian qualifier Andrea Pellegrino, World No. 237, followed his biggest career win against Felix Auger-Aliassime in Thursday's second-round action with another standout victory, fighting off seventh seed Nicolas Jarry 7-6(0), 5-7, 6-1. Pellegrino's semi-final opponent will be Aleksandar Vukic, who raced past Bernabe Zapata Miralles 6-1, 6-1. A full crowd enjoys quarter-final action in Estoril.
