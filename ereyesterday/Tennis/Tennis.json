Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "title": "Remembering Mark Darby, longtime ATP supervisor",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/mark-darby-obituary",
    "description": "Mark Darby, a longtime member of the tennis family who served the ATP Tour as a supervisor from 1990 until his retirement in 2017, passed away Friday at his home in Florida at the age of 68. A proud father of triplets — Caroline, Connor and Ryan — Darby dedicated his life to tennis and made an immeasurable impact on the sport through his knowledge, integrity and dedication to helping those around him. Known for his composure and attention to detail at tournaments, no aspect of an event was too small for Darby to help ensure the best possible experience for all involved. Above all, he was a mentor and a friend to countless people throughout the industry. Darby was a distinguished tennis player himself, having played for Pennsylvania State University, qualifying for the NCAA Championships in 1978. He climbed into the Top 500 in both the PIF ATP Rankings and the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings. But the Rochester-born Darby made his mark as an official, who developed a reputation as a humble man whose work spoke for him and the results of those efforts earned respect around the world from players, tournaments and other members of the tennis community. Darby spent a brief stint as a supervisor for the USTA, also serving as deputy referee for the US Open, before beginning his career at the ATP Tour.

Former World No. 4 Todd Martin, who after his playing career became a tournament director, reflected on Darby’s legacy upon hearing the news. “Mark Darby was proof that tennis players weren’t the only ferocious competitors on the ATP Tour,” Martin said. “His competitiveness revealed itself in pursuing fairness for each Tour Member and relentlessly exploring the issues a relative start-up league needed to solve. ‘Darbs’ also had a strong tennis game and fairly sharp elbows when battling for rebounds in early morning pick-up basketball games. “His poise accented by a subtle chuckle in response to both astute observations and inane complaints was disarming, especially for those of us who had shared the basketball court with him. Mark exuded authenticity in all he did. We have lost a great man in Mark Darby.” The former Penn State Nittany Lion was proud of his alma mater and also was a big basketball fan who loved the Los Angeles Lakers and chatting with colleagues and friends about the wider sports world. Outside of his successful career as an official, Darby was a family man who cared greatly about his children. In 2017, with his triplets in high school, the long-time supervisor retired to maximise the time he was able to spend with his children. Darby remained connected to the tennis world, serving as the referee in Miami following his retirement from the ATP Tour. He also returned to the US Open as deputy referee in 2018. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “Mark was a stalwart of the ATP officiating community for decades, earning immense respect through his expertise and unwavering commitment to the sport. His impact on the game and those around him was profound — not just as an official but as a mentor and friend. “Mark was a constant presence during my own playing career, commanding the utmost respect from everyone in the game. His legacy will endure in the standards he set and the many officials he helped guide along the way. We are deeply saddened by his passing, and our thoughts are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time. Rest in peace, Mark.\"",

    "title": "Scouting Report: Alcaraz makes Rotterdam debut; Fritz, Ruud lead field in Dallas",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/dallas-rotterdam-2025-scouting-report",
    "description": "The indoor hard-court action on the ATP Tour heats up this week with two ATP 500 events in Rotterdam and Dallas, respectively. Carlos Alcaraz will make his debut at the ABN AMRO Open in Rotterdam, where the No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings is chasing a first title since triumphing at the China Open in Beijing last October. At the Dallas Open, Top 10 stars Taylor Fritz, Casper Ruud and defending champion Tommy Paul will all feature in the first edition of the tournament since its upgrade to ATP 500 level. ATPTour.com breaks down five things to watch at each event. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN ROTTERDAM 1) Alcaraz’s Debut: Competing as the top seed on his debut in Rotterdam, Alcaraz will be eager to bounce back from the quarter-final defeat suffered to Novak Djokovic at the Australian Open. The four-time major winner has proven a menace on various surfaces, but is yet to reach a tour-level championship match indoors. Alcaraz’s bid to break that record in Rotterdam could also prove pivotal in his quest to gain ground on No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings Alexander Zverev, who is 1,020 points ahead of the Spaniard but is not in action this week. The Spaniard will seek revenge for his second-round defeat to Botic van de Zandschulp at the US Open last year when he faces the Dutchman in his Rotterdam opener.  2) Top 10 Stars In Action: Daniil Medvedev, the 2023 Rotterdam champion, returns after missing last year’s edition through injury. The 20-time tour-level titlist will be joined by fellow Top 10 stars Alex de Minaur and Andrey Rublev in the field. De Minaur reached the final at last year’s edition while Rublev clinched the title in 2021. 3) Felix, Stan Among Former Champs: Montpellier winner Felix Auger-Aliassime will hope memories of his title run in Rotterdam in 2022 —his first tour-level crown— will help him maintain his red-hot from on the indoor courts. The 39-year-old wild card Stan Wawrinka, who claimed the title in 2015 and reached the final in 2019, is back for his seventh appearance in Rotterdam. 4) Home Hopes: Tallon Griekspoor reached consecutive semi-finals in Rotterdam in each of the past two years, falling to Jannik Sinner on both occasions. The top-ranked Dutchman will aim to progress further in 2025 and is joined by countryman Botic van de Zandschulp in the main draw. 5) Arevalo/Pavic Headline Doubles: Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic will have their sights set on a first title of the 2025 season when they headline the doubles action in Rotterdam. The 2024 Year-End ATP Doubles No. 1 team presented by PIF reached the semi-finals in Adelaide and the quarter-finals at the Australian Open. [ATP APP] FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN DALLAS 1) Fritz Ready To Fire: Fritz is yet to claim an indoor title on the ATP Tour, but after his impressive end to the 2024 season, the top seed is a real contender in Dallas. The World No. 4 reached the championship match at the Nitto ATP Finals in November, and will be eager to shake off his disappointing third-round exit to Gael Monfils at the Australian Open. 2) Paul’s Title Defence: Fittingly, Paul’s first tournament as a Top 10 player will be a title defence in Dallas. The 27-year-old has won three tour-level titles on indoor hard courts and will bid to add to his count when he attempts to successfully defend his crown from 12 months ago, when he defeated Marcos Giron in an all-American final. Watch highlights of the 2024 Dallas Open final: 3) Can Ruud Claim Indoor Glory? If Ruud can reignite the form that has propelled him to the semi-finals at the Nitto ATP Finals in each of his three appearances, he will fancy his chances at claiming a first indoor title in Dallas. After his campaign at the United Cup and his second-round exit to Jakub Mensik at the Australian Open, the Norwegian holds a 3-1 record in 2025, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. 4) American Threats At New Venue: Since the event moved to Dallas from New York in 2022, two of the three champions have been American, and the trend may just continue. Ben Shelton, Frances Tiafoe and Alex Michelsen round up the five seeded Americans in the field. The first edition of tournament as an ATP 500 also features a venue upgrade to The Ford Center at The Star, the practice facility for NFL team Dallas Cowboys.  5) Lammons/Withrow Top Seeds: Nathaniel Lammons and Jackson Withrow are making their team debut at the Dallas Open, though the top seeds will face fierce competition from the rest of the field. Shelton will team with World No. 7 Horacio Zeballos on the doubles court while 2023 champion Jammie Murray returns alongside Australia's John Peers. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
