It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Both Carlos Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev have a chance to finish the week at No. 2 in the world. According to the PIF ATP Live Rankings, Alcaraz has the edge in the battle, leading Zverev by 165 points. However, the Spaniard is not guaranteed to maintain the No. 2 spot, which he took from the two-time Nitto ATP Finals champion last Monday following the Rolex Monte-Carlo Masters. If Zverev wins the BMW Open by Bitpanda on Sunday in Munich, Alcaraz would need to lift the trophy at the Barcelona Open Banc Sabadell to keep No. 2. If Zverev emerges victorious in Munich and Alcaraz falls to Holger Rune in Barcelona, Zverev would lead Alcaraz by five points on Monday. Both men are well clear of the players below them. Current live No. 3 Zverev is 2,760 points ahead of No. 4 Taylor Fritz. PIF ATP Live Rankings (as of 19 April)  Player  Points  Player  Points  1) Jannik Sinner  9,930  6) Jack Draper  3,820  2) Carlos Alcaraz  8,040  7) Alex de Minaur  3,585  3) Alexander Zverev  7,875  8) Andrey Rublev  3,490  4) Taylor Fritz  5,115  9) Holger Rune  3,310  5) Novak Djokovic  4,120  10) Daniil Medvedev  3,290 Rune, who plays Alcaraz in the Barcelona final, will make his return to the Top 10 for the first time since April last year. The Dane is up four spots to live No. 9. He cannot overtake Andrey Rublev for No. 8 with the ATP 500 title. However, Rune would move to within 10 points of the 27-year-old if he earns the crown. Ben Shelton, who takes on Zverev for the Munich trophy, is live No. 13. With a win Sunday, the lefty will climb to No. 12, tying his career-high PIF ATP Ranking. The former college tennis standout is also moving closer to a Top 10 breakthrough. If Shelton triumphs at the German ATP 500, he would trail No. 10 Daniil Medvedev by only 100 points and is defending a total of 100 points at the ATP Masters 1000 events in Madrid and Rome. Former World No. 2 Casper Ruud will drop five places to No. 15 on Monday after falling to Rune in the Barcelona quarter-finals. The Norwegian was the defending champion at the Spanish event.
