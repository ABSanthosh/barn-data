    "description": "When required to provide for Greece at the United Cup, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Maria Sakkari rarely miss. The 26-year-old Tsitsipas pulled double duty Saturday in Perth to seal a 2-1 victory for Spain in Group C action. In a nervy winner-takes-all mixed doubles rubber, it was the Greek duo who held their nerve, defeating Sergio Martos Gornes and Yvonne Cavalle Reimers 4-6, 6-3, 10-6 to knock Spain out of the tournament. \"We came clutch when we had to; that tie-break was very good from our side,\" Sakkari said. \"It's always amazing to play alongside Stefanos and create good moments on the court.\" ‚ÄúThere isn‚Äôt a single Greek night without some drama,‚Äù said Tsitsipas. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm super grateful that I have a fighter like Maria beside me. She never disappoints, she delivered until the end.‚Äù Comeback complete üò§@steftsitsipas and @mariasakkari def. Cavalle-Reimers/Martos Gornes 4-6 6-3 [10-6] to deliver a special victory for Team Greece.#UnitedCup pic.twitter.com/6Z4OQwJHN9 ‚Äî United Cup (@UnitedCupTennis) December 28, 2024 Sakkari made amends for her earlier singles loss by finding her best tennis in the latter stages of the Match Tie-break. The 29-year-old stood firm, holding two serves from 7-6 against the oncoming Martos Gornes, striking a winner past the Spaniard to bring up three match points, which they converted at the first attempt. Greece will aim to finish top of Group C when it faces Kazakhstan on Monday. Tsitsipas had earlier kept Greece in the tie with his 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 win over Pablo Carreno Busta. After experiencing a slight dip in form, which left him trailing a break in the deciding set, Tsitsipas recovered to keep his country alive. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy that I found a way,‚Äù said Tsitsipas, who improved to 6-1 in United Cup singles. ‚ÄúIn a position where you are doubting your choices but somehow trying to find a way, that‚Äôs the moment that I am most proud of. I just hope to come out here and represent Greece in the best possible way.‚Äù ‚ÄúI did [finish strongly], I fought it through. In some situations I was struggling to get back into the match. Pablo played such good tennis in the third set, so I had to come up with something. Any player here is a top tier player, so I am not expecting anything other than that.‚Äù An error-strewn ninth game from Tsitsipas in the second set gifted the Carreno Busta his first break of serve, undoing all of the Greek‚Äôs efforts form the first set, in which which he won 83 per cent (15/18) of points behind his first serve, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Needing a win to keep Greece in the tie, the former No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings reignited some bruising tennis to bully his way past the Spaniard. ¬† This after World No.54 Jessica Bouzas Maneiro had defeated former No.3 Sakkari 6-2, 6-1 to give Spain an initial 1-0 lead over Greece. Bouzas Maneiro, 22, bounced back from a straight-sets loss to Elena Rybakina in her opener to ease past Sakkari in a 72-minute clinic. \"I'm super super happy with my performance today,\" Bouzas Maneiro said on court. \"Yesterday was tough for me, the first match, but I felt really well today.\" In their first career meeting, Bouzas Maneiro dominated the baseline exchanges to earn the third tour-level Top 50 win of her career. She notched her first two last season, first by ousting defending champion Marketa Vondrousova in the first round of Wimbledon, and then notching another Grand Slam stunner over Katie Boulter at the US Open. Sakkari entered the new season at No.32 on the PIF WTA Rankings after shutting down her 2024 campaign after the US Open due to a shoulder injury. Playing her first match since her first-round retirement in New York to Wang Yafan, Sakkari struggled to find the consistency needed to bother Bouzas Maneiro. Maneiro broke Sakkari's serve in all but one service game, converting seven of 13 break points. Sakkari served at just 45 percent in the match and misfired on 29 unforced errors. Fittingly, Bouzas Maneiro broke Sakkari's serve to seal the match, firing a confident forehand winner to earn triple match point and converting on a backhand winner that clipped the line.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/fritz-gauff-feature-perth-2025",
    "description": "Taylor Fritz and Coco Gauff arrive in Perth off the back of stellar finishes to the 2024 season looking to translate that form into team success for USA at the United Cup. Fritz capped a standout year, in which he made title-match runs at the US Open and Nitto ATP Finals, by reaching a career-high of No. 4 in the PIF ATP Rankings, while Gauff continued to hit new heights. In Riyadh last month, the 20-year-old World No. 3 became the youngest player to win the prestigious WTA Finals since Maria Sharapova in 2004. On Sunday they will unite to lead Team USA onto court against Canada in their opening Group A clash. ‚ÄúI'm super pumped to have Coco as my partner,‚Äù Fritz told ATPTour.com in Perth. ‚ÄúIt's great playing mixed and knowing I can fully trust the person that I'm playing with. She's won a lot in doubles and she's obviously an incredible doubles player.‚Äù [ATP APP] Although Gauff boasts an impressive doubles resume - nine tour-level titles including the 2024 French Open - mixed is a different game. Fritz and Gauff found that out at the Paris Olympics, where they notched just one win. Yet despite their underwhelming cameo in the French capital, Team USA is no stranger to success on the international stage, underpinned by the key role Fritz played en route to the inaugural United Cup title in 2023. ‚ÄúI think a big key to our team's success in 2023 was the team chemistry and the vibes,‚Äù said Fritz, who won seven of his eight matches during their title run. ‚ÄúIn these team events, energy is a really underrated factor in teams playing well. ‚ÄúEnjoying everyone's company, that's something that our team has always done well.\" Team USA at the 2025 United Cup in Perth. Photo: Tennis Australia After failing to progress to the knockouts last time out in Perth, Team USA will be keen to reignite that team atmosphere this week in Perth. As the leading man and woman, Fritz and Gauff will look to Danielle Collins and Desirae Krawczyk on the bench for that extra burst when they need it. Yet judging from their vibrant media-day antics, it doesn‚Äôt seem that they will have much trouble finding it. ‚ÄúDanielle is definitely the most feisty,‚Äù Gauff said with a laugh. ‚ÄúShe has already told me some of the things she would try to pull if she was to step out on the court. She‚Äôs a great sub, I played some points with her and she was playing great.‚Äù ‚ÄúDes really [has been] a cheerleader the last two years,‚Äù Fritz added. ‚ÄúShe's a great team member for someone who hasn't played in the last two years. She's always done an amazing job on the bench.‚Äù Fritz and Gauff will have a shot at avenging their Olympics loss to Felix Auger-Aliassime and Gabriela Dabrowski when they face Team Canada in their opening Group A tie. Starpower is one thing they will have on their side, belief is another. ‚ÄúFom knowing Taylor, I feel that our approach is very similar, mindset-wise,‚Äù said Gauff. ‚ÄúI think the belief factor that I have, he has the same - that‚Äôs the biggest [similarity]. Some guys I see, they may believe in themselves, but I think Taylor [really] does. ‚ÄúI think if things get pretty tense, I'll definitely look to the bench for energy, and I'll be right there cheering Taylor on [in the singles] when I can. I think I'm excited and looking forward to that.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
