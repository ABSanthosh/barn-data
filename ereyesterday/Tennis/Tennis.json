It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Learner Tien’s breakout 2025 season will include a maiden main-draw appearance at the Miami Open presented by Itau. The ATP Masters 1000 announced Tuesday that #NextGenATP Tien has received a wild card for the 2025 edition of the event, to be held from 19-30 March at Hard Rock Stadium. The 19-year-old, who reached the championship match at the 2024 Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, has risen to a career-high No. 68 in the PIF ATP Rankings ahead of his upcoming main-draw debut at another Masters 1000, the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells. Tien reached the fourth round on event debut at January’s Australian Open, where he defeated Daniil Medvedev en route, and he notched his second Top 5 win of the season last week in Acapulco, where he downed World No. 2 Alexander Zverev. In 2023 in Miami, Tien fell in the first round of qualifying on his event debut to Jan-Lennard Struff; he did not compete at the event last year. Two other Americans, Christopher Eubanks and Eliot Spizzirri, have also received wild cards for Miami. A former World No. 29, Eubanks reached the quarter-finals as a qualifier at Hard Rock Stadium in 2023, while former college standout Spizzirri will be making his Masters 1000 main-draw debut. Chinese star Wu Yibing and #NextGenATP Italian Federico Cina were the other two wild cards announced on Tuesday. It will be former ATP Tour titlist Wu’s first ATP Tour event since last October, while 17-year-old Cina is set to make his tour-level debut. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/jacquet-challenger-2025-feature",
    "description": "After battling a significant hamstring injury and the mental challenges that came with it last season, Kyrian Jacquet recently celebrated back-to-back ATP Challenger Tour titles, proving that resilience and a renewed mindset can turn setbacks into triumphs. Flashback to 2023, when the Frenchman finished the year by claiming his first Challenger title, building momentum for the year ahead. But in Jacquet’s third event of the 2024 season, at the Quimper Challenger, he desperately lunged for a ball and suffered a large, 10 centimetre tear in his hamstring. “I couldn’t sit, struggling with every movement I did. I couldn’t do anything,” Jacquet told ATPTour.com. “For three weeks it was horrible and then the pain was less than the beginning, but still big. I did physio every day, I had to use a boot compression with ice. It was really tough. I was playing really well and then doing four months out, seeing everyone play when I was not able to play… Mentally, it was tough.” If there was any silver lining, doctors said the hamstring was not ruptured, which would have forced Jacquet out for twice as long. Sidelined for four months, Jacquet used the off-court time to refine his mentality, embracing meditation and breathing techniques. “I tried to improve everywhere outside the court,” Jacquet said. “We are still doing it with my coach. It takes like 30 minutes [each day]. We do breathing — inhaling five seconds, exhaling five seconds — for five minutes. We do meditation, visualisation, things like that. I try to do it when I can. It’s a good thing for my game, I’m more calm in my matches.” A year later, Jacquet’s hard work has paid off. The 23-year-old won two consecutive Challenger titles in as many weeks during the Indian hard-court swing. “I’m happy to play two weeks in a row without injuries, without problems. It’s always good to win one, but to win two is amazing,” said Jacquet, who shortly after his title runs hit a career-high No. 152 in the PIF ATP Rankings. “With my coach, we said, ‘Every day is a final!’ It worked, so we were happy about it.” Another key change for Jacquet last year was that he returned to his hometown Lyon from Paris, where he previously trained with the French Tennis Federation at Roland Garros for four years. Jacquet is now based at the All In Academy, which is spearheaded by former World No. 5 Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Thierry Ascione. Jacquet began playing tennis aged four alongside his father, who would play at the local club on weekends. Jacquet also played football “until eight or nine”, before deciding to focus solely on tennis. “I think at 14 years old, I knew I wanted to be professional. I stopped normal school and did school online at my club. I was playing two times a day,” Jacquet said. “I always wanted to be professional because I don’t like to do sports just for fun. I always want to win, have trophies.” Now, Jacquet is doing just that — living his dream while adding to his trophy collection. Kyrian Jacquet is crowned champion in New Delhi, India.
