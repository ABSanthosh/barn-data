The Argentine saved two match points in the deciding set before converting the first of his own to seal a 6-3, 4-6, 7-6(6) victory after two hours and 41 minutes. In his first professional indoor match, Navone found success at the net, claiming 88 per cent (7/8) of points in the contest when advancing forward, according to Infosys ATP Stats.

Monteiro, the first Brazilian to compete in the main draw in Antwerp tournament history, was imperious behind his first serve in the third set, but came unstuck by the resilience of Navone in an absorbing tie-break. [ATP APP] Sixth seed Tomas Martin Etcheverry kickstarted his debut campaign in Antwerp with a well-fought win over wild card Richard Gasquet. The Argentine struck cleanly from both wings to prevail 7-6(4), 6-4, rattling off three consecutive games to seal victory in one hour and 48 minutes. Roberto Carballes Baena cruised past Dominik Koepfer 6-4, 6-0 to advance to the second round. The Spaniard dropped just three points behind his first serve throughout the second set.
