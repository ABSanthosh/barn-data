    "description": "Tallon Griekspoor tied the bow on a stirring night of Davis Cup drama on Friday, propelling the Netherlands into the history books with their semi-final triumph over Germany. The 28-year-old dug deep on Friday evening in Malaga to overcome Jan-Lennard Struff 6-7(4), 7-5, 6-4, securing the Dutchmen‚Äôs maiden final in the country‚Äôs 104-year history in the competition. In a serving masterclass from both players, it was Griekspoor who held his nerve to seal a 2-0 victory against three-time champions Germany. ‚ÄúWe have been talking about this [moment] for two or three years,‚Äù said Griekspoor. ‚ÄúWe came here all the time with unbelievably tough draws, but we believed in ourselves so much. We always felt like this was possible. To do it now feels unbelievable. I am so happy for the team, and for Holland. ‚ÄúI just tried to focus on my own game. I felt like he was playing unbelievable tennis, I didn‚Äôt do much wrong in the first set. I‚Äôm super proud of myself, super proud of the effort and very happy to get the win in the end.‚Äù The Dutch army makes history! üëè@DavisCup | #DavisCup | @KNLTB pic.twitter.com/GV6Bz91C6D ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) November 22, 2024 Griekspoor utilised the fast indoor courts to full effect with an explosive display, firing 25 aces and winning 83 per cent (54/65) of points behind his first delivery. Struff played his part in a thrilling encounter, but the German will rue the two break points he let slip in a crucial eighth game of the second set.¬† Earlier, Botic van de Zandschulp got the Netherlands up and running with a dramatic 6-4, 6-7(12), 6-3 win over Daniel Altmaier, converting on his 10th match point. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure actually [how I did it], I didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore on those match points,‚Äù said Van de Zandschulp, who improved to 2-0 in singles this week after his quarter-final win over Rafael Nadal on Tuesday. ‚ÄúIn the second set, I had 4-2 15-40, I felt like if I had made the double break there, it would be game, set and match. In the tie-break, he handled some of the match points quite well, actually. ‚ÄúI had the toughest match of my life on Tuesday, so everything that comes next is a little bit easier.‚Äù 10 Match points and 2 hours and 42 minutes later.. @Boticvdz pulls through an epic battle against Altmaier 6-4 6-7(12) 6-4!@DavisCup | #DavisCup | @knltbtennispic.twitter.com/cq2M5f4jVg ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) November 22, 2024 Leading a set and 4-2 in the pair's maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, Van de Zandschulp appeared to be cruising to victory but Altmaier, the No. 88 in the PIF ATP Rankings, found a late burst of energy to ignite hopes of a comeback. Assisted by some inspired tennis, the German saved five match points a thrilling second-set tie-break before forcing a decider. Despite the shift in momentum, Van de Zandschulp steadied himself to earn the opportunity to serve out the match at 5-3. Keeping with the theme of the clash, however, the Dutchman let slip four further match points before eventually sealing victory after two hours, 42 minutes on his 10th attempt.¬† The Netherlands await either reigning Davis Cup champions Italy or Australia, who face off in the other semi-final on Saturday.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/quinn-champaign-challenger-2024-feature",
    "description": "Ethan Quinn has thoroughly enjoyed his first full season as a professional, whether it was winning his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title in his final tournament of the year or indulging in two off-court passions: visiting coffee shops and antique stores. The #NextGenATP American turned pro in June 2023 shortly after winning the NCAA singles title while competing for the University of Georgia. While in Athens for a memorable 16 months, Quinn became a coffee-shop enthusiast in part thanks to Georgia‚Äôs assistant coach Will Reynolds. ‚ÄúWhen we were on the road, at like 6 a.m. he would go and find a local coffee shop wherever we were at. Often times I‚Äôd just ask him, ‚ÄòHey, can I join?‚Äô‚Äù Quinn told ATPTour.com. ‚ÄúBy doing that, I just started to enjoy going to these local places. I felt like it was just better than buying this corporate coffee. The quality was better, the people really cared about conversing with you rather than just being a factory giving out coffee.‚Äù[ATP APP] It was also in college when Quinn began exploring antique stores ‚Äî a hobby he has since brought with him while travelling across the world. ‚ÄúMy mom got a house in Athens during my college time and the way she furnished the house was by going to antique stores, so I would go with her and I thought it was really cool going to all these different markets and little stores,‚Äù Quinn said. ‚ÄúBeing able to furnish everything, whether it was a cheaper price, that was also nice, but also those unique pieces you would find. I thought it was really cool just having your own character, your own identity in these pieces you‚Äôd find.‚Äù Quinn‚Äôs latest collector‚Äôs item is a shiny piece of hardware, which he won after a dominant run at last week‚Äôs Champaign Challenger. The Fresno, California native downed Nishesh Basavareddy 6-3, 6-1 in the all-American #NextGenATP final. ‚ÄúIt means a lot to finally be able to get that reward for the hard work and the struggles I've gone through this year,‚Äù Quinn told commentator Mike Cation. ‚ÄúNow going into the offseason, it gives me a little pep in my step. I can go into my offseason knowing that what I‚Äôm doing is working.‚Äù Ethan Quinn is crowned champion at the ATP Challenger Tour 75 event in Champaign, Illinois. Credit: Paine Schwartz Partners Challenger At a career-high No. 204 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Quinn has quickly soaked in lessons learned in his first full season on the road. He has already been introduced to the travel hurdles that come with the job, including one which turned into an unforgettable bit of fortune. ‚ÄúAfter Newport, I was flying to Atlanta and my flight got delayed 12 hours in one hour increments,‚Äù Quinn said. ‚ÄúThere was a man that I met in the lounge who was talking to his brother and he was like, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm chartering a jet.‚Äô And I asked him, ‚ÄòHey, do you have any extra seats for me and my coach to get on the plane with you. I play a tournament that starts tomorrow. Is there any way you can help me get onto the flight? I would really appreciate it.‚Äô ‚ÄúHe ended up charging us a much cheaper fee than what it would‚Äôve been. I was really fortunate to meet this man and get into this tournament. If I hadn‚Äôt made it, it would‚Äôve been a really unfortunate week.‚Äù It may have been a lesson in adapting to your circumstances, something that Quinn has also developed on court this year as he no longer competes for the Georgia Bulldogs. ‚ÄúOne thing my coach was able to put into a term that I understood was now that I‚Äôm not competing for Georgia, I‚Äôm competing for a different team and I guess that team would be the ‚ÄòE.Q.‚Äô team,‚Äù Quinn said, referring to his initials. ‚ÄúIt took me a little bit to recognise that. I was leaving Georgia, I was leaving that team there. Now I‚Äôm playing for my own team. ‚ÄúNot just compete for yourself, but for everyone else you have been working so hard with in the shadows. I know at the start of my career, I thought it was very lonely out on the tour because everyone is not really your friend, you are competing against each other. But once I was able to realise that everyone wants the best for you, especially within your team, I was able to enjoy the whole process a little bit more.‚Äù[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
