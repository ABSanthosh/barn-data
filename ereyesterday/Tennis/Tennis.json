    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/scouting-report-hamburg-geneva-2025",
    "description": "The European clay-court swing continues on the ATP Tour this week ahead of Roland Garros, with a host of stars in action across two tournaments. Former champion Alexander Zverev has accepted a wild card to lead the field at the Bitpanda Hamburg Open, where #NextGenATP star Jakub Mensik will also make his debut at the ATP 500. Top 10 stars Novak Djokovic and Taylor Fritz will compete at the Gonet Geneva Open, where the latter is the top seed at the ATP 250. ATPTour.com looks at five things to watch at each event. [ATP APP] FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN HAMBURG 1) Top Seed Zverev: After dropping to No. 3 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Zverev enters as the top seed in Hamburg, where he lifted the trophy in 2023 and finished runner-up last year. The German is 24-9 on the season and triumphed on home soil in Munich for his first trophy of the year. He will aim to find that form again this week. A hometown return ‚≠êÔ∏è Hamburg native and 2023 champion @AlexZverev will play at home üî• #BitPandaHamburgOpen | @hamburgopenatp pic.twitter.com/ynEwMY6BGr ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) May 16, 2025 2) Can Former Champ Rublev Rekindle Spark? Andrey Rublev is at his lowest ranking since January 2020, the year in which he triumphed in Hamburg. Owning a 11-11 record on the season, the 27-year-old will be eager to rediscover his spark after an opening-round defeat to Fabian Marozsan in Rome. 3) #NextGenATP Mensik‚Äôs Debut: Mensik has enjoyed a stirring start to the 2025 season, and will aim to continue his form this week upon debut at the ATP 500. The 19-year-old Czech, who is 4-1 vs. Top-10 players this year, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, defeated Djokovic in the Miami final in March to claim his maiden tour-level title. 4) Davidovich Fokina Aims To Bolster Turin Chances: The sixth-seeded Alejandro Davidovich Fokina has been a serious contender in 2025. With finals in Acapulco and Delray Beach, as well as a run to the semi-finals in Monte-Carlo, the Spaniard is 14th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. He will aim to keep pace with a strong showing in Hamburg. 5) Heliovaara/Patten Eye First ATP 500 Crown: Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten enter as the top seeds, where they will continue their pursuit of a maiden title at ATP 500 level. The reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champions are second in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. FIVE THINGS TO WATCH IN GENEVA 1) Djokovic Chases 100th Title: Making a late entry into the ATP 250 in Geneva, Djokovic continues his pursuit of a landmark 100th tour-level crown. A victory would place him alongside Jimmy Connors (109) and Roger Federer (103) as the only men to reach triple-digit titles in the Open Era. Djokovic is seeded for a quarter-final meeting with Matteo Arnaldi, who prevailed in their maiden Lexus ATP Head2Head clash in Madrid. 2) Fritz Looks To Reset: World No. 4 Taylor Fritz has had a disrupted season due to an abdominal injury that kept him off court for a month between his semi-final run in Miami and his return in Madrid. Now healthy, the American is keen to regain his rhythm following an opening-round defeat to countryman Marcos Giron in Rome. The top-seeded Fritz starts against Jaume Munar or Quentin Halys. 3) Can Machac Go One Better? Riding a career-high No. 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Tomas Machac arrives in Geneva after an impressive start to the season, highlighted by his maiden title at the ATP 500 in Acapulco. As last year‚Äôs runner-up, the Czech will look to replicate ‚Äî and ideally surpass ‚Äî his deep run from 2024, when he sunk top seed Djokovic in the semi-finals before falling to Casper Ruud in the final. 4) Former Champ Jarry: Nicolas Jarry has this week dropped outside of the Top 100 for the first time since February 2023, but will hope to reignite fond memories of his time in Geneva to spark an uplift in form. The Chilean, who reached the final in 2019 and triumphed in 2023, owns an impressive 8-1 record at the Swiss ATP 250. 5) Will Arevalo/Pavic Continue Momentum? Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic, first in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Rankings, will headline the doubles action. After a stellar start to the season, in which they completed the coveted 'Sunshine Double', the duo will aim to sustain their momentum ahead of their title defence at Roland Garros.
