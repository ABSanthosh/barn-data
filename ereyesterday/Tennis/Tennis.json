Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Which ATP Challenger Tour player will make their breakthrough this season? Recent history has shown that the first two months of the year can be a key indicator of rising stars. In 2024, Frenchman Arthur Cazaux won a Challenger title in the opening week before reaching the third round of the Australian Open. His countryman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard claimed a Challenger title in February and finished the year at No. 31 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Arthur Fils won his maiden Challenger title in week two of the 2023 season before embarking on a standout season. The year prior, Jack Draper lifted the trophy in his first three of five outings. Which player will join the list of early-season breakthroughs in 2025? [ATP APP] The action begins this week as the ATP Challenger Tour covers ground from Oceania to the outskirts of Bangkok. Three tournaments will take place beginning Monday: the Workday Canberra International (Canberra, Australia), the Open SIFA Nouvelle-Caledonie (Noumea, New Caledonia) and the Bangkok Open 1 (Nonthaburi, Thailand). Players to watch in Canberra, the highest level of tournament (Challenger 125) in week one, include Brazilian Joao Fonseca, who last week won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. Fellow teenager Martin Landaluce, Frenchman Luca Van Assche, Briton Jacob Fearnley and American Christopher Eubanks are also competing. Hugo Gaston is the top seed. View the ATP Challenger Tour calendar by clicking here. Tournaments will be featured on six continents in the first two months of the Challenger season, including a three-week Africa swing beginning 17 February, with the Republic of Congo and Rwanda to stage. Other countries hosting in the opening two months include Brazil, Argentina, Portugal, France, the United States and Great Britain. The ATP Challenger Tour’s stakes are higher than ever this season, following the recent announcement of a record $28.5 million in ATP Challenger Tour prize money for the 2025 season – up $6.2 million year on year and 135 per cent since 2022. Fans can watch all ATP Challenger Tour matches live and on demand at Challenger TV. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

Look, kid from Canberra gets to play with the greatest of all time in his hometown in front of the fans is pretty special.
