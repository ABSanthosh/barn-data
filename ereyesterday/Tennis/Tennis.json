It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Letâ€™s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Grigor Dimitrov saved a match point to survive Francisco Cerundolo on Wednesday at the Miami Open presented by Itau, where the Bulgarian claimed a gritty 150th match win at ATP Masters 1000 level and advanced to the semi-finals. Gasping for air at times in the latter stages of the match, last yearâ€™s finalist Dimitrov found enough energy to fight off Cerundolo 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(3) after two hours, 48 minutes. Cerundolo will rue his missed backhand return while holding match point at 6-5 in the decider.GRIGOR DIMITROV!!! HOW HAVE YOU DONE THAT?! ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯@MiamiOpen | #MiamiOpen | @GrigorDimitrov pic.twitter.com/vaVptitPcrâ€” ATP Tour (@atptour) March 27, 2025 Dimitrov had his own missed opportunities in the beginning stages, letting slip seven set points in the opener, one of which he missed by dumping a routine backhand volley in the net. But that did not discourage Dimitrov from moving forward, instead only fuelling his determination. He took a more aggressive baseline position in the second set and converted all eight of his net points. Playing with great variety by mixing backhand slices with his trademark one-hander, Dimitrov began to dictate rallies. He did not drop a point behind in his first serve (11/11) in the second set, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Trailing 0-3 in the decider, Dimitrov mounted another comeback to become the fifth man to reach multiple Miami semi-finals after turning 30 (Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors, Roger Federer, John Isner). He improved to 12-1 in deciding-set matches at the ATP Masters 1000 event in south Florida. Up next for the 14th seed will be six-time champion Novak Djokovic or American Sebastian Korda.Having arrived in Miami defending his finalist showing from last year, Dimitrovâ€™s run to the last four has him No. 18 the PIF ATP Live Rankings.

    "description": "Jakub Mensik is only 19 years old, but has already proven a force on the ATP Tour. Everything is adding up for the Czech #NextGenATP star, who will face Arthur Fils in the quarter-finals of the Miami Open presented by Itau. ATPTour.com caught up with the teen about his favourite rivalry, the goal he is chasing, his greatest success and more. Who is your greatest rival? What makes them so tough? [I don't have one] yet, because, I played just a couple of guys more than once. I know there are plenty of guys my age, little bit older, but yeah, for now, I, I don't have any rivalry [like] let's say, I don't know, Sinner and Alcaraz. What is your favourite tennis rivalry and why? For now, it's obviously Jannik and Carlos, because they are just three years older. Actually, Jannik is four years. But for the future, I can play with them plenty of matches. So of course, them, because I [am] close to them [in age], my game style is also very close. Â  What has been the most unique moment in your career? Probably playing the quarter-finals against my idol Novak Djokovic in Shanghai.... Once I was beating the good players, Andrey [Rublev] , Grigor [Dimitrov], and moving there, and I was like, 'Okay, well, if I win this match, I can play against him'. It happened. So, after that, when I had the day off, I was super nervous, but very excited. It is different when you're watching him and when you're playing against him. Everything [went] not like in my expectations. What is the biggest number or accomplishment you have been chasing and how long have you been pursuing it? If we are talking about this season, I would like to reach the Top 30. I think it's just a good goal â€” a good set goal â€” because last year it was Top 200, Top 80. I reached Top 50. But then it's very tough to go higher and higher. So I think if I will be in the Top 30, Top 25 at the end of this year, it's pretty good. I like the way of my game and my improvement. What has been your greatest success? Biggest success so far, I don't know, being on ATP Tour for one year, to be stable there, and to play against the best players in the world, and to beat them. Of course, I have plenty of good results in the tournaments â€” Shanghai, Grand Slams. So obviously, my level of improving is there, and that's the success and I'm still always improving. What is the greatest difficulty you have had to overcome? Struggling with the injury last year with my elbow. What is your favourite tournament to play and why? Indian Wells. Itâ€™s super nice. There you receive a car, you can play golf there. Of course [I play golf], I do actually, since two years ago. And Iâ€™m playing only [at] the tournaments. What has been the coolest off-court experience you have been able to enjoy because you are a professional tennis player? During the Next Gen in Jeddah, we had a party on the boat from the ATP... In Jeddah, we were having fun together, which was kind of out of topic and something different. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
