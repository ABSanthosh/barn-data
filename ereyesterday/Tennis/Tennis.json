It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/griekspoor-pellegrino-bastad-2025-wednesday",
    "description": "Tallon Griekspoor survived an early scare in his campaign at the Nordea Open in Bastad, where he saved five match points to defeat Italian qualifier Andrea Pellegrino on Wednesday afternoon. The second-seeded Dutchman struggled to cope with Pellegrino’s variety and touch for much of their second-round clash, but ultimately found a late spark to triumph 4-6, 7-6(6), 6-3. Griekspoor, who is now 6-1 in opening-round matches on clay this year, reeled off four straight points from 3/6 in the second set tie-break and pulled clear in the decider to seal a two-hour, 11-minute win. “An unbelievably tough match, he really made it difficult for me,” said Griekspoor, who is into his 23rd ATP Tour quarter-final. “He probably deserved the win in the second set, I got a little bit lucky with the match points. He didn’t really look too confident on those points, I just tried to make him play. I did need a bit of luck, because he was the better player.” Griekspoor, who captured his third ATP Tour title on the Mallorca grass last month, set a quarter-final meeting with countryman Jesper de Jong. The Dutchman defeated eighth seed Vit Kopriva 7-6(3), 7-5 on Wednesday morning and will take a 1-0 Lexus ATP Head2Head lead into his meeting Griekspoor, whom he defeated in Montpellier in February. “We played earlier this year and I lost, so I’m definitely looking forward to some revenge there,” said Griekspoor, who won 16 of 19 net points against Pellegrino, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Earlier, Austrian qualifier Filip Misolic continued his run in Sweden by overcoming Elmer Moller 6-3, 3-6, 7-5 in two hours, 41 minutes. Misolic, who is up six spots to a career-high No. 99 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, will take on third seed Nuno Borges for a spot in the quarter-finals. Botic van de Zandschulp ended Swedish wild card Mikael Ymer’s campaign with a 6-4, 6-1 victory and, by joining Griekspoor and De Jong, he ensured it was the first time since Rotterdam 2023 that three Dutchmen reached the second round of the same ATP Tour event. After recording his second ATP Tour win on clay this year, Van de Zandschulp will next face fifth seed Camilo Ugo Carabelli, who moved past Cristian Garin 6-4, 6-4. Luciano Darderi blitzed the last remaining Swede in the draw, Elias Ymer, 6-2, 6-2 to book his spot in a fourth clay-court quarter-final of 2025. The 23-year-old Italian, who triumphed in Marrakech earlier this year, holds a perfect 15-0 record on the surface against players outside the Top 100. Darderi will face fourth seed Sebastian Baez for a place in the last four after the Argentine rallied past #NextGenATP qualifier Nicolai Budkov Kjaer 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in two hours, five minutes.

    "description": "Casper Ruud made a winning return to Tour on Wednesday at the EFG Swiss Open Gstaad, where the two-time champion moved past Swiss wild card Dominic Stricker 7-5, 7-6(6) to reach the quarter-finals. Competing for the first time since his second-round exit at Roland Garros, the Norwegian struck 28 winners and saved two set points in the second set, rallying from 4/6 in the tie-break to eventually advance after one hour and 46 minutes. Ruud is 1-1 against Stricker in the pair’s Lexus ATP Head2Head series. \"It was a very tough match against Dominic. We have played one time before. Of course I was seeking some revenge but he is a really good player, a young player,\" Ruud said in his on-court interview. \"He plays aggressive, fearless and I knew I had to be on it from the beginning. This is my first match in a few weeks and I am happy to be back.\" The top seed Ruud has fond memories at the ATP 250 clay-court event in Gstaad, where he lifted the trophy in 2021 and 2022. The No. 13 player in the PIF ATP Rankings holds a perfect 9-0 record at the event, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss index, and will next meet Juan Manuel Cerundolo or David Goffin. Rudd, ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, is seeking his second title of the season after winning his maiden ATP Masters 1000 crown in Madrid. In other action, Peruvian qualifier Ignacio Buse downed Pole Kamil Majchrzak 1-6, 7-5, 6-1 to reach his first tour-level quarter-final. The 21-year-old is the youngest Peruvian to reach the last eight at a tour-level event since Alejandro Aramburu in Bari in 1989. Buse will next play Roman Andres Burruchaga after the Argentine beat German lucky loser Patrick Zahraj 4-6, 6-4, 6-1. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
