    "description": "Fifth seed Nicolas Jarry saved a match point Tuesday at the BNP Paribas Nordic Open, where the Chilean edged home hope Elias Ymer 2-6, 6-4, 7-6(7). In a dramatic finish, Jarry was leading 8/7 in the deciding-set tie-break when he surged forward and hit a backhand volley winner before balancing on his toes to avoid touching the net. The chair umpire confirmed that the ball had bounced twice before Jarry reached over.The 29-year-old Jarry, who saved a match point at 6/7 in the deciding-set tie-break, tallied three consecutive points to advance after two hours, 26 minutes. “The end was very difficult for both. We were playing great points,” said Jarry, who improved to 2-0 against Ymer in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. “We were both very mentally strong, not giving any chances. I’m happy that in the end, I was able to be a little bit more aggressive. I served very well in the tie-break and didn’t give him many opportunities.” [ATP APP] Making his tournament debut, Jarry trailed by a set and a break, but quickly rebounded and held his nerve in a six-deuce game at 3-3 in the second set. The World No. 34 in the PIF ATP Rankings confidently struck his hefty forehand in pressure moments and drew errors from Ymer’s backhand. Up next for Jarry is Miomir Kecmanovic, who spoiled Cameron Norrie’s return from injury with a 6-4, 6-4 victory. The Serbian won 62 per cent of his second-serve return points, compared to Norrie’s 31 per cent, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Norrie was competing in his first ATP Tour match since suffering a forearm injury in July. British qualifier Jacob Fearnley earned his first tour-level win on hard court by defeating Corentin Moutet 6-2, 7-6(5). Fearnley, 23, has been one of the most dominant players on the ATP Challenger Tour this season, claiming four titles at that level and making his Top 100 debut last month. The former Texas Christian University standout is on a 13-match winning streak across all levels. Laslo Djere cruised past Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-0 to set a second-round meeting with fourth seed and 2021 champion Tommy Paul. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Thomas Muster’s iconic 1995 Roland Garros trophy is set to be auctioned off for charity as part of the ‘Champions of Vienna’ campaign. It marks a significant highlight of the ‘Official Tennis Experience’ at the Wiener Stadthalle, the home of the Erste Bank Open (21-27 October). The ATP 500 tournament is celebrating its 50th anniversary, coinciding with the auction, running from October 9 to November 3, 2024. All proceeds will go towards the Ö3 ‘Christmas Miracle’ charity, which supports the LICHT INS DUNKEL emergency aid fund for families in need.  “When I held the trophies in my hand again, many things came back to me. Now my trophies are going to someone who may have been watching at the time, and you can do something good at the same time,” Muster said. “It's not so easy to give it all away, because there are a lot of emotions and memories behind the trophies.” Thomas Muster wins Roland Garros in 1995.

In addition to Muster’s trophies, the exhibition features items from stars like Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner. Guests at the pre-opening on October 8 included former stars Jurgen Melzer, Stefan Koubek, and Alexander Peya, with large crowds gathering not just to see the trophies, but the whole experience. [ATP APP] “There are lots of other things,” Muster added. “Everything has been beautifully prepared. It was certainly a lot of work to put it all together and get it ready.” The exhibition aims to highlight the rich history of tennis in Vienna but also incorporates modern elements like VR experiences to showcase the future of the sport. Tickets for the ‘Official Tennis Experience’ are available at www.championsofvienna.com, while bidding for Muster’s trophies is live on www.aurena.at until November 3.
