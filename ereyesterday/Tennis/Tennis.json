Jarry and Etcheverry, who met in the final at the ATP 250 in 2023 (the Chilean won), enjoyed playing mini tennis, taking in a folkloric dance performance and tasting local food. \"I really like it at home, with family, friends and most of the people who support you throughout the year, so it's special,\" Jarry said. \"I hope to enjoy it a lot, to be able to play my best tennis round by round, then we'll see what the future brings.\" The seventh-seeded Jarry and fifth-seeded Etcheverry ate empanadas de pino and sopaipillas — typical Chilean cuisine — at the Centro Cultural de Las Condes before the start of the tournament.  \"The truth is that I really like playing here. I lost the final two years ago after a great match there with Nico,\" Etcheverry said. \"I'm happy to be back this year. The crowd is incredible, I love playing here and I always have a lot of encouragement.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
