    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/rune-indian-wells-2025-final-reaction",
    "description": "Holger Rune's run at the BNP Paribas Open was brought to an abrupt end by Jack Draper on Sunday in the Indian Wells title round. While the Dane was happy to reach his second ATP Masters 1000 final, he was left wishing he had done more with his chances in the one-sided match. While he accepted that Draper deserved his 6-2, 6-2 victory in their second Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting, Rune was disappointed that he did not attack the Briton more in their title tilt. \"I think I could have done my part better. Like the opportunities I had to play aggressive just weren't good enough,\" he explained. \"I think it's a matter of fact that I haven't committed ‚Äî I mean, I have been playing well in this tournament, been playing tactically very wisely ‚Äî but I haven't played, like, fully committed to my aggressive game still. \"I think that's what was the reason why I lost today... Jack was playing extremely well, but the few chances I had to make it difficult for him, I didn't quite take them, because I wasn't really trusting every shot of my game today.\" Hold your head up high ‚≠êÔ∏è Congratulations on a great week, @holgerrune2003 üëè @BNPPARIBASOPEN | #TennisPardise pic.twitter.com/k5dPTkvDWc ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) March 16, 2025 In that sense, Rune hopes to take a lesson from Carlos Alcaraz, whose Indian Wells three-peat bid was ended on Saturday by Draper. \"I think actually seeing Alcaraz play yesterday ‚Äî of course it was unfortunate for him ‚Äî but I kind of like the way that he lost that match in a way, because he went out swinging,\" Rune said of his fellow 21-year-old. \"He's so committed to his game, and I think that's the reason why he's 21 and with four Grand Slam titles and a bunch of Masters titles. I think that's because he's so committed to his game style, and the same, [Jannik] Sinner has done well, and I think this week that's what Jack has been doing incredibly well.\" Rune was competing in his second ATP Masters 1000 final after a three-set victory against Novak Djokovic at the 2022 Rolex Paris Masters. After falling short on Sunday, his mind wandered back to that breakout run. \"What I thought straightaway after the match today was, 'Do you remember how I played in Paris 2022?' I told myself that and I answered to myself, 'Yes, and that's how I want to play,'\" Rune said. \"That was way more committed to my tennis. I think when I was stressed there, my reaction was to step more in and come more to the net and be even more aggressive. Now my reaction was, OK, I'm stressed, I'm going to fall three meters behind the baseline. A¬†player like Jack who is full of confidence, just beat Carlos yesterday, you cannot give him this time to play. He's going to make you move side to side and he's going to hit winners. \"I think in my mind it's very clear what I need to practise on... and what I have to do better in Miami. It's really to play way more aggressive.\" While Rune fell short of a return to the Top 10 in the PIF ATP Rankings for the first time since last April with his final defeat, he is looking forward to the second leg of the Sunshine Double with optimism: \"That's always a good feeling to feel like you can do stuff better and still I reached the finals,\" the Dane said of his Indian Wells run.

Fonseca defeated Alexander Bublik 7-6(5), 7-6(0) in an entertaining final that featured superb shotmaking from both players at the Phoenix Country Club. The Brazilian served for the opening set at 5-4 and again at 6-5, but was forced to a tie-break, during which he raised his first-serve percentage to gain an advantage. Fonseca and Bublik engaged in first-strike tennis, battling for court position and aiming for aggressive winners in front of a sellout crowd. The teen had two championship points on return at 5-4 in the second set, but Bublik saved them both with booming aces. The Kazakhstani wiped away Fonseca‚Äôs third championship point at 6-5, again with an ace, but the Brazilian quickly rebounded and flew through the second-set tie-break to earn a one-hour, 43-minute victory.
