    "description": "Max Purcell and Jordan Thompson are the fourth doubles team to qualify for the Nitto ATP Finals in Turin. They join Marcelo Arevalo/Mate Pavic, Marcel Granollers/Horacio Zeballos and Simone Bolelli/Andrea Vavassori in the field. The Australians have enjoyed a standout season, including a run to their first major title together at the US Open, where they lost just one set en route to the trophy. In New York, Purcell and Thompson became the first men from their country to win the US Open doubles crown since Todd Woodbridge triumphed with Swede Jonas Bjorkman in 2003. [ATP APP] The victory came on the back of heartbreak. Purcell and Thompson made the Wimbledon final, in which they earned three championship points before falling short to Harri Heliovaara and Henry Patten. The qualifiers have also claimed trophies in Dallas, Los Cabos and Houston this season. Although it did not contribute to his qualification with Purcell, Thompson won the Madrid ATP Masters 1000 title with Sebastian Korda. Purcell, 26, was an alternate at the Nitto ATP Finals in 2022 with Matthew Ebden. Thompson, 30, will be at the season finale for the first time. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Youth was served on Saturday at the Swiss Indoors Basel. Specifically, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard served 17 aces as he continued his breakout season with a 7-6(6), 6-4 upset of Holger Rune.¬† The Frenchman beat his fellow 21-year-old to improve to 4-1 against Top 20 players in the PIF ATP Rankings and advance to his biggest career final at the ATP 500. He will next meet 22-year-old Ben Shelton, after the American defeated 20-year-old Arthur Fils. \"It's amazing to be in the final. I played a good match today. It was difficult against Holger, but I found the key to win this match,\" said Mpetshi Perricard. \"Inside of me there was a lot of emotion, but I tried to calm it down. It's nice to be in the final and I hope to get the win.\" [ATP APP] After beginning the season outside the Top 200, the Frenchman is up to No. 37 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings this week, setting him up for a career high. He entered the week at No. 50 in the PIF ATP Rankings.

It is also the second semi-final lineup with four players younger than 23, with the previous instance six years ago in Washington courtesy of Alex de Minaur, Andrey Rublev, Stefanos Tsitsipas and Alexander Zverev. Saturday's youth movement also extended to Vienna, where Jack Draper beat Lorenzo Musetti in a matchup of 22-year-olds. This guy is going places üå™Ô∏è@MpetshiG's magical run in Basel just got even better as the young French star reaches his FIRST 500-level final!#SwissIndoorsBasel pic.twitter.com/YmNK8yqyx0 ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) October 26, 2024 In the Basel semi-finals, Mpetshi Perricard never faced a break point and won 87 per cent (33/38) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. After an opening set without a break chance for either man, the first 13 points of the tie-break went to the server. Mpetshi Perricard saved a set point at 5/6 before snatching the tie-break with its first mini-break. The Frenchman capitalised on a a loose Rune service game to break at the start of set two and showed no signs of tension as he cruised through his next five service games to seal the victory. Now with 87 aces in his four Basel wins, Mpetshi Perricard has not lost a service game game in the tournament. He's also won four of his five tie-breaks on the week, including a third-set tie-break against Denis Shapovalov in the quarters. After winning his first Lexus ATP Head2Head matchup against Rune, Mpetshi Perricard will bid to improve to 2-0 against Shelton in the final. \"It's always 50/50 when you step on the court. Yeah, I won [against him], but one time and it was on grass,\" the Frenchman said, referencing his Queen's Club win earlier this year. \"Now it's a different match. We are in the final, it's going to be tough. \"There is a lot of emotion because both of us want to get the title. I will try my best, he will try his best, but at the end there is only one winner. It's going to be fun.\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
