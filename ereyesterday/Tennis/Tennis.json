It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic met in a blockbuster quarter-final at the Australian Open, won by Djokovic in four sets. The superstars could meet in the last eight again at the BNP Paribas Open. When the Indian Wells draw was made on Monday, the big news was that two-time defending champion Alcaraz could play five-time tournament winner Djokovic in the quarter-finals. But both men will have to be ready to roll early in the event with tricky draws. Djokovic could take on Nick Kyrgios in the second round. The Australian, who played Djokovic in the 2022 Wimbledon final, will open against a qualifier. Alcaraz will begin his title defence against Frenchman Quentin Halys or a qualifier. The Spaniard has never played Halys. The first seeded opponent the 21-year-old could battle is in-form 27th seed Denis Shapovalov, who claimed his maiden ATP 500 crown in Dallas. If the Alcaraz-Djokovic blockbuster comes to fruition, it would be their ninth Lexus ATP Head2Head showdown. Djokovic leads their series 5-3. Top seed Alexander Zverev is pursuing his first Indian Wells trophy. He will be keen to get on track at the season's first ATP Masters 1000 event, having won four of his past seven matches. The German will face Tallon Griekspoor or Miomir Kecmanovic in the second round. Big-serving 29th seed Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard is a potential third-round opponent for Zverev. Third seed Taylor Fritz has fond memories in the desert, having won the title in 2022. The third seed will try to add to his Indian Wells resumé, beginning with his second-round clash against Argentine Sebastian Baez or a qualifier. Fritz owns a 20-7 record at the BNP Paribas Open according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index. The American has not fallen short of the Round of 16 since 2019.  A first-round match to watch pits wild card Joao Fonseca against Briton Jacob Fearnley. Fonseca has been the talk of the tennis world, having won the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in December, upsetting Andrey Rublev at the Australian Open and earning his first tour-level title last month in Buenos Aires. Outside the Top 500 in the PIF ATP Rankings this time last year and still in college, Fearnley is now World No. 81 and making his tournament debut. The winner between Fonseca and Fearnley will play 13th seed Jack Draper. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "American Eliot Spizzirri claimed his maiden ATP Challenger Tour title Sunday at the San Diego Open, where he defeated former No. 37 Mackenzie McDonald 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in the final. A runner-up in Tiburon, California last October and in Cleveland, Ohio this January, the third time was the charm for Spizzirri, who is now at a career-high No. 144 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Spizzirri finished back-to-back years (2023, 2024) as the No. 1 player in the ITA singles rankings, competing for the University of Texas. The 23-year-old graduated last May and has since made a splash on the Challenger circuit.    The Connecticut native needed a deciding set in four of his five San Diego matches. He also partnered Tyler Zink to win the doubles trophy at the Challenger 100 event. Spizzirri and Zink have enjoyed success together, highlighted by their title run at the 2019 US Open boys' doubles event. In other Challenger action, former World No. 12 Borna Coric captured the 4° Città di Lugano, his first title at any level since his surprise run at the 2022 ATP Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati. Seeded second, Coric ended top seed Raphael Collignon’s nine-match winning streak 6-3, 6-1 in the final. Collignon won last week’s Pau Challenger to make his Top 100 debut. Coric was unbroken all week, fending off the 10 break points he faced, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Borna Coric is crowned champion at the ATP Challenger 75 event in Lugano, Switzerland.

Holt won the Nonthaburi Challenger in January and finished runner up at last week’s Pune Challenger. Brandon Holt triumphs in Bengaluru, India. Credit: Deepthi Indukuri The 26-year-old, who is the son of former WTA No. 1 Tracy Austin, is closing in on his Top 100 debut; currently at No. 111 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Holt boasts a 22-5 season record across all levels. Frenchman Valentin Royer won the Rwanda Challenger to lift his second trophy at that level. The 23-year-old downed Slovakian qualifier Andrej Martin 6-1, 6-2 in the clay-court final. Following his triumph, Royer is at a career-high No. 151.
