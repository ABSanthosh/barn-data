    "description": "Jannik Sinner returns to action at the Internazionali BNL d‚ÄôItalia in Rome not with bold predictions, but with quiet curiosity and a sense of purpose. The 23-year-old Italian is set to compete in his first event since winning the Australian Open in January, after completing a three-month period of ineligibility in a case resolution agreement with WADA. While the anticipation surrounding his return to the capital builds, Sinner, who has never progressed past the quarter-finals at the Italian ATP Masters 1000, is keeping his expectations to a minimum. ‚ÄúIt's a very, very low expectation tournament in general, talking results wise,‚Äù said Sinner, who faces Mariano Navone or wild card Federico Cina in his opening match. ‚ÄúFor me, what's missing is the complete feedback of where my level is. That's going to come slowly with time. After the first round match, I'm going to have a better picture of myself, where I am at. ‚ÄúIt's very strange feeling again in the beginning to be around so many people and attention. But it's nice to be back, me and my team are very happy.‚Äù Despite his absence from the ATP Tour, Sinner has maintained his spot as the No. 1 player in the PIF ATP Rankings. The Italian, who remains unbeaten in his previous 21 tour-level matches, claims not to have been casting a watchful eye on Tour proceedings as his peers continue to build momentum. Sinner has, however, been keeping tabs on the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin, in which he currently sits at fourth after claiming his third major title at the Australian Open. ‚ÄúTo be honest, I was barely looking at any match, especially in the beginning,‚Äù Sinner said of his absence. ‚ÄúOf course I saw the results because it's normal, but the tennis itself, I was not watching as much. I started again from Madrid, trying to study and then trying to understand some of the players which are very interesting to see. ‚ÄúFor me, what's most important is the Race To Turin, which gives you a better picture of how players [are] in that moment. Now I'm happy in the position I am, but I would be happy even if I'm No. 3 or No. 4 in the world, to be honest, I'm just happy to be back here. I'm happy to play again in front of the fans.‚Äù Fans in Rome have been forced to wait 24 months for Sinner‚Äôs return to the capital after he withdrew from last year‚Äôs tournament with a hip injury. The 23-year-old was unsurprisingly greeted with raucous cheers as he passed over the bridge at the Foro Italico on his way to Monday‚Äôs press conference. Sinner owns a 9-5 record in Rome, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index, with his best result coming in his quarter-final run in 2022, when he lost to Stefanos Tsitsipas. Following the draw ceremony, the Italian is seeded to set a quarter-final clash with Casper Ruud, who is fresh from claiming his maiden Masters 1000 trophy in Madrid. The 19-time tour-level champion, Sinner will look to quickly build some rhythm as he heads into the remainder of the European clay-court swing. ‚Äú[They have been] very long months, but I was glad to share some great moments with my family, with my friends,‚Äù said Sinner. ‚ÄúWe were practising very hard, especially in the gym in the beginning, coming back to court again. ‚ÄúIt was good, but I could feel that I'm not playing for quite a long time. The body still has to adjust, the blisters in hands‚Ä¶ They didn't come again because you're not used to it anymore, but all good, I'm just very happy, very curious to see where I am at.‚Äù Jannik Sinner practises with Jiri Lehecka on Monday in Rome. Photo:¬†TIZIANA FABI/AFP via Getty Images. After his media duties, Sinner then offered fans a glimpse of the preparation that has been going on behind the scenes. Met with a chorus of ‚ÄúOle, Ole, Ole, Sinner‚Äù from the buzzing crowd in attendance at Campo Centrale, the home favourite practised with World No. 38 Jiri Lehecka. While there were inevitable signs of rust, including a framed forehand sent into the upper stands during the warmup, Sinner also unleashed his trademark power with a barrage of groundstrokes. Yet Lehecka was able to go toe to toe with Sinner during the practice set, and it was the Czech player who broke first for a 4-3 lead. Nevertheless, the Foro Italico remained in hysteria. ‚ÄúWe love you, Jannik,‚Äù shouted one Italian teenager, summing up the mood. Sinner has cultivated a deep connection with the Italian public over the past two years, notably after becoming the first player from his country to reach No. 1 in the history of the PIF ATP Rankings in June 2024, and leading Italy to consecutive Davis Cup titles in 2023-24.
