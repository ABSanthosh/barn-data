    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz reached his first ATP Tour semi-final of the season on Friday at the ABN AMRO Open, where he overcame Spaniard Pedro Martinez 6-2, 6-1 to maintain his impressive record against countrymen. After being pushed to three sets against Botic van de Zandschulp on his debut in Rotterdam, Alcaraz dispatched Andrea Vavassori for just the loss of three games in the second round. The 21-year-old built on that clinical win with a comprehensive display against Martinez, who was pulled from side to side for the majority of the 71-minute clash. \"I played really good tennis today, a really high level. And I have done the right things again,\" Alcaraz said. \"I was really focused before the match, on my things, on my own tennis. I tried to put everything in today. Being aggressive, pushing him to the limit every point. I think I did the perfect match and I am happy to keep improving every day. Hopefully in the semi-finals I will be even better.\" [HOT SHOT] Alcaraz has now won his past 12 matches against countrymen and is the fourth Spaniard to reach the last four at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, joining coach Juan Carlos Ferrero (2004), Rafael Nadal (09’) and Pablo Carreno Busta (’20). Chasing his first title since Beijing in October, the top seed will meet Pole Hubert Hurkacz on Saturday evening in his 33rd tour-level semi-final. Martinez was aiming to advance to his first tour-level semi-final in his fifth attempt. However, he was unable to cope with Alcaraz’s power in front of a capacity crowd in the Ahoy Arena. Alcaraz fired 17 winners in the first set according to Infosys ATP Stats and did not face a break point in the pair’s first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. The 27-year-old Martinez defeated Roberto Bautista Agut and Holger Rune this week and is up to No. 40 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings. In the final match of the day, Hurkacz guaranteed his return to the Top 20 in the PIF ATP Rankings on Monday by overcoming 2021 Rotterdam champion Andrey Rublev 6-7(5), 6-3, 6-4. The eighth seed fired 17 aces en route to a two-hour, 27-minute quarter-final win against Rublev. Hurkacz now leads the fourth seed 4-2 in the pair's Lexus ATP Head2Head series and will return to the Top 20 after dropping out for the first time since April 2021 on 27 January. Into his 21st tour-level semi-final and first since Halle in June, Hurkacz is aiming to capture his ninth ATP Tour title this weekend. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Marcelo Arevalo and Mate Pavic continued their perfect start to the ABN AMRO Open on Friday afternoon, but the top seeds were forced to pull through two tough sets to book their semi-final spot in Rotterdam. Arevalo and Pavic prevailed 6-4, 7-6(4) against Hugo Nys and Edouard Roger-Vasselin at the indoor hard-court ATP 500. They rallied from 0-3 to claim the opening set before clinching a 97-minute win by prevailing in a second-set tie-break. With victory, the joint No. 1s in the PIF ATP Doubles Rankings improved to 2-0 in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series against Nys and Roger-Vasselin, following their Adelaide quarter-final triumph last month. Awaiting Arevalo and Pavic in the semi-finals at Rotterdam Ahoy will be Sander Gille and Jan Zielinski. Third seeds Simone Bolelli and Andrea Vavassori were also straight-sets winners in Rotterdam on Friday. The Italian pair overcame qualifiers Jakob Schnaitter and Mark Wallner 7-6(3), 6-3, having won 86 per cent (32/37) of points behind first serves en route to victory, according to Infosys ATP Stats. Bolelli and Vavassori will look to continue their impressive start to 2025 when they take on Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool for a spot in the championship match. They reached the final at January’s Australian Open and are currently second in the PIF ATP Live Doubles Teams Rankings. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
