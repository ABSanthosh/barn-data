    "description": "On the court, Roger Federer often made what seemed impossible, possible. Now, the Swiss legend wants to take that same can-do spirit into South African classrooms. Now 43 and happily retired, the 20-time Grand Slam champion recently spoke on behalf of his Roger Federer Foundation at a breakfast event in Johannesburg, where he urged local leaders to ensure that every child in South Africa has access to early childhood development services by 2030. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a joyful experience to walk into vibrant classrooms filled with children learning, reading, and playing, just as children everywhere should be allowed to do,‚Äù Federer said during his speech. ‚ÄúWitnessing them grow into nurses, teachers, and computer programmers fills me with hope.‚Äù Roger Federer examines a creative playground element at a primary school in Mpumalanga. Credit: Hanro Havenga/Roger Federer Foundation A former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, who collected 103 tour-level titles, Federer drew analogies between his professional tennis career and his philanthropic mission. ‚ÄúI worked tirelessly to achieve success in tennis. It demanded much from me, but I was fortunate to have guidance and opportunities. That‚Äôs what I want to provide for others, a chance for growth and success,‚Äù said Federer, whose mother is from South Africa. ‚ÄúThrough our foundation‚Äôs work in South Africa, we‚Äôve been able to offer quality preschool education to more than 300,000 children. However, 1.3 million children are still waiting for opportunities such as playgrounds to play, building blocks and books to learn, but most importantly passionate and knowledgeable educators.‚Äù [ATP APP] Federer closed his speech by emphasising the importance of a collective effort. ‚ÄúWe want to learn from others, like in tennis, where accepting guidance and new strategies leads to unexpected victories. Look beyond current actions and extend your reach,‚Äù Federer said. ‚ÄúWe now know 1.3 million children need places to learn and grow, and they need them by 2030. This ambitious goal, comparable to my seemingly impossible tennis achievements, is the right goal.‚Äù Did You Know? Established in 2003, the Roger Federer Foundation is active in Lesotho, Malawi, Namibia, South Africa, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Switzerland. Its focus is on early learning, empowering educators through a tablet-based system that gives them the knowledge and tools they need to teach better as well as to mobilise parents and communities to contribute. The Roger Federer Foundation also advocates for SDG 4.2 ‚Äî ‚Äúby 2030 ensure that all girls and boys have access to quality early childhood development, care and pre-primary education so that they are ready for school‚Äù at both the governmental and global level.

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/delray-beach-2025-qfs-friday",
    "description": "How much things can change in a week! Alex Michelsen will be saying that after ousting former champion Cameron Norrie 7-6(3), 7-5 at the Delray Beach Open on Friday, avenging last week‚Äôs Dallas loss to the Briton. The American fought off a second-set scare, facing three consecutive set points on serve at 4-5. Yet in those key moments, the California native stayed ahead in rallies and used sharp angles with his backhand, forcing Norrie to hit from an uncomfortable range. ‚ÄúI told myself, 'Find a couple of first serves, you haven‚Äôt been broken the entire match, so why start now?‚Äô‚Äù Michelsen reflected on his 0/40 hold late in the second set. ‚ÄúI played a couple great points to get out of it and then I got very fortunate to get that break point at 5-5 and then played a great game at 6-5. Lucky to get out of that second set.‚Äù Michelsen then broke Norrie‚Äôs serve at 5-5 in the second set with a stroke of luck ‚Äî the American hit a backhand that dribbled over the net cord on break point, allowing him to serve for the match. The third seed avoided repeat drama in his ensuing service game, closing the one-hour, 38-minute match.The smile says it all üòÅ[3] Alex Michelsen reaches the Final Four 7-6(3) 7-5 past Norrie @DelrayBeachOpen | #DBOpen pic.twitter.com/26RltAVaUO‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) February 14, 2025 Last week, Norrie beat Michelsen 2-6, 7-6(1), 6-1 at the indoor ATP 500 in Dallas. Michelsen‚Äôs 32 winners in Florida were too much for the lefty to overcome. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs tough to play someone twice in two weeks,‚Äù Michelsen said. ‚ÄúI think Cam is a great player, a great competitor. His backhand is world class, I tried to stay away from that as much as I could. I didn‚Äôt do that amazing last time I played him, but this time I made some adjustments and the game plan worked well.‚Äù By advancing to his fifth tour-level semi-final, the 20-year-old secured his 50th tour-level match win, joining Delray Beach top seed and World No. 4 Taylor Fritz as the only active American men to record 50 victories before turning 21. Michelsen is up to No. 33 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings, three spots ahead of his career high. Michelsen, who is also in the doubles semis alongside Mackenzie McDonald, will next meet seventh seed Miomir Kecmanovic, who dismissed fifth seed Marcos Giron 2-6, 6-4, 6-2.‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt easy, but I tried to stay aggressive, try to go for even bigger shots and luckily it paid off,‚Äù said Kecmanovic, who earned his 100th tour-level hard-court win, becoming the fourth Serbian man in the Open Era to achieve that feat. Kecmanovic improved to 2-0 against Giron in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series and coincidentally, both wins came in the Delray Beach quarter-final stage (2023, 2025).[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
