    "description": "Gael Monfils has long been a fans' favourite on the ATP Tour, thrilling crowds with his inimitable charisma, athletic play and battling spirit. The Frenchman hopes to conjure more more magic at Roland Garros, where he is competing in the main draw for the 18th time. ATPTour.com recently caught up with Monfils to discuss how it has all added up in his career for the former No. 6 player in the PIF ATP Rankings, from his rivals to his struggles and successes. Who is your greatest rival? I don‚Äôt have a greatest rival, just some players who I have never beaten. A rival means that you‚Äôve beaten him, but I never beat Novak. I wouldn‚Äôt say he‚Äôs my greatest rival, but he is the person who I never beat. My rivals were all my French friends. I think about Richard Gasquet, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Gilles Simon. Richard, his tennis was amazing. His selection of shots, the backhand, his touch at the net. Just pure talent. What is your favourite tennis rivalry? I think the Big Four rivalries. There is not one, but it was great to see all of those rivalries mixed up between all of those guys. It was great to witness. What is the greatest difficulty or adversity that you've had to overcome? The Covid year was really tough, there were different vibes during that time. It was a different way of competing and everything, it was really tough.¬† ¬† What has been your greatest success? To have made it as a tennis player, that was my biggest success. What are your favourite tournaments to play? Of course Roland Garros and Paris-Bercy. They are in Paris, the two mean a lot to me. They are the two places where I have all my family and this is something amazing for me. ¬† What's been the most unique moment in your career? In 2004 when I lost to Lleyton Hewitt in Paris-Bercy, it was quite a unique moment. It was the first time I fell to the World No. 2, in a night session in Paris, the second of my life. It was unique in that way because I really loved it, even though I lost the match. Everything was super new for me, I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. I saw the crowd involved [and I was] playing in front of a lot of people. That was quite unique for me. What has been the biggest number or the biggest accomplishment that you‚Äôve been chasing? To make it. There is an interview of me on YouTube when I was 11. At that moment, you‚Äôre very pure. I said ‚ÄòMy dream would be to be in the Top 10‚Äô, and I made it. If I reflect back, I didn‚Äôt say anything else but I wanted to be in the Top 10. So, I made it in that way. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/tsitsipas-gigante-roland-garros-2025-wednesday",
    "description": "Italian qualifier Matteo Gigante captured his maiden Top 20 win on Wednesday at Roland Garros, where he upset former finalist Stefanos Tsitsipas 6-4, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4 to reach the third round at a major for the first time. Tsitsipas entered the clash holding a 27-8 record at the clay-court Slam. He was a set away from winning the title in Paris four years ago and advanced to the quarter-finals in 2023 and 2024. However, the three-time Monte-Carlo champion was unable to use his vast experience and clay-court pedigree to his advantage against Gigante, who is competing in just his second major main draw. GLORIOUS FROM GIGANTE üëèThe qualifier captures his biggest ever win with a 6-4 5-7 6-2 6-4 win over Tsitsipas üî•@rolandgarros #rolandgarros #gigante pic.twitter.com/CmPgP3O5Sa‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) May 28, 2025 The 23-year-old Italian pushed Tsitsipas off balance with his heavy forehand and array of backhand angles, while he crucially saved all eight break points he faced in the fourth set to seal victory in the pair‚Äôs first Lexus ATP Head2Head meeting. Into the third round of a major for the first time, Gigante is up 37 spots to No. 130 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings and will next play American Ben Shelton. Meanwhile, Tsitsipas has fallen to No. 25 in the Live Rankings and is set to drop out of the Top 20 for the first time since August 2018. The 26-year-old‚Äôs latest defeat further highlights his struggles in the past 18 months. Tsitsipas fell out of the Top 10 in February 2024 and has failed to advance beyond the fourth round in seven of the past eight majors he has played. The former Nitto ATP Finals champion lifted the trophy at the ATP 500 event in Dubai earlier this year, but is 17th in the PIF ATP Live Race To Turin. Tommy Paul escaped the same fate as Tsitsipas with a gutsy 4-6, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 win against Marton Fucsovics. The Hungarian led 5-3 in the fourth set and was just two points away from improving to 3-0 in the pair‚Äôs Lexus ATP Head2Head series, but was unable to dispatch Paul, who earned just the second win of his career from two-sets-to-love down. By reaching the third round, Paul has matched his best result in Paris (R3, 2024). The 28-year-old will next meet Karen Khachanov after the 24th seed also prevailed in five sets on Wednesday. The 29-year-old defeated Sebastian Ofner 7-5, 3-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-2. Paul is up two spots to 10th in the Live ATP Rankings. The American arrives in the French capital in good form, having advanced to the semi-finals at the ATP Masters 1000 event in Rome. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
