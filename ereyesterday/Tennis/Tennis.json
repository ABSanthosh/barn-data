It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "description": "ATPTour.com highlights five players on the ATP Challenger Tour to watch in 2025. Martin Landaluce Joining the likes of Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz in the record books is not an easy feat, but that is just what Landaluce did in 2024, when he became the fifth Spaniard since 2000 to win a Challenger title at age 18 or younger. Tommy Robredo and Nicolas Almagro, former Top 10 players in the PIF ATP Rankings, also accomplished the feat. Landaluce, who won his maiden Challenger title in Olbia, Italy in October, finished ninth in the PIF ATP Live Race To Jeddah, one spot shy from qualifying for the eight-player Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF. The teenager looks to continue his rapid rise and compete at the 20-and-under event in 2025. Joao Fonseca The Jeddah champion’s Challenger days may be drawing to an end should he continue his Saudi Arabia form. The 18-year-old, No. 145 in the PIF ATP Rankings, is ready to step up and compete against the biggest stars in the sport. Before he makes that transition, Fonseca will be one of the players to beat on the ATP Challenger Tour, including this week at the Workday Canberra International. The Brazilian claimed his maiden Challenger title in August in Lexington, Kentucky. Learner Tien The American began the 2024 season at No. 453 in the PIF ATP Rankings before embarking on a standout season, in which he boasted a 35-9 Challenger-match record and reached the final in Jeddah. Now at World No. 122, Tien earned three Challenger titles, all coming on home soil. He also reached the quarter-finals at the ATP 250 event in Winston-Salem as a qualifier. The 19-year-old lefty, who is the youngest American in the Top 200, is one to watch as he closes in on his Top 100 debut. [ATP APP] Gabriel Debru Debru became the third-youngest Frenchman to win multiple Challenger trophies, joining former Top 10 stars Richard Gasquet and Gael Monfils. The 19-year-old lifted the trophy at the Troyes and Como Challengers in 2024 and will aim to build upon those early experiences. The 2022 Roland Garros boys’ singles champion is currently No. 253 in the PIF ATP Rankings. Alexander Blockx The Belgian was a consistent threat for deep runs in 2024, making at least the semi-finals in three of his final five tournaments, including a title run at the Kobe Challenger. Despite being hindered by injury for part of the season, Blockx was a six-time semi-finalist at the Challenger level. With one year left to qualify for the prestigious Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF, Blockx will be poised for a breakthrough season.[NEWSLETTER FORM]",
