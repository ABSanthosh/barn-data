    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz hit 15 drop shots in his first-round win over Giulio Zeppieri at Roland Garros, while Fabian Marozsan reeled off 13 to defeat Luca Nardi in his opener at the season‚Äôs second major. The Spaniard and Hungarian will now be on opposite sides of the net on Wednesday. What can fans expect from the encounter? There is little doubt. It will be the battle of the drop shots. ‚ÄúOf course I study my opponents a bit and I know that he really likes drop shots,‚Äù said Alcaraz, No. 2 in the PIF ATP Rankings. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to be ready for that, and to pressure him if he tries to do it. I guess it‚Äôll be a drop shot battle, but we‚Äôll see. It‚Äôll be interesting. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve lost a match to him previously and I have to be well prepared for his game, which is attacking and with a lot of drop shots. I have to be alert and we‚Äôll see who does them better. ‚ÄúThe drop shot is not an easy shot. It‚Äôs difficult to do, because there‚Äôs always a risk you won‚Äôt make the right contact with the ball, which means your opponent gets an easy shot. What I always try to do is see when my opponent is furthest from the baseline, which is the ideal situation for a drop shot. In the event that he gets to that ball I have several options, a lob or a pass. Normally a drop shot is unplanned, something I feel inside. It‚Äôs not premeditated.‚Äù Alcaraz and Marozsan will break their 1-1 tie in their Lexus ATP Head2Head series. The Spaniard triumphed in their most recent outing, at Indian Wells last year. But in 2023, Marozsan stunned Alcaraz in Rome. The Hungarian won the third-round encounter in straight sets, catching the Murcia native off guard. ¬† ‚ÄúMy goal in that tournament was to win one match in qualifying and I ended up reaching the last sixteen,‚Äù Marozsan recalled. ‚ÄúI was only thinking of winning a few games and I managed to beat Carlos.‚Äù The four-time major champion Alcaraz is bidding to defend his Roland Garros title, but first he will be focused on the task at hand. He will need to outfox Marozsan in the drop shot showdown. Editor's Note: This story was translated from ATPTour.com/es. [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/monfils-roland-garros-2025-fall",
    "description": "Gael Monfils suffered a scary fall on Tuesday in the early stages of his first-round match at Roland Garros, but showed his fighting spirit in a courageous comeback at his home Slam. The 38-year-old rallied past Hugo Dellien 4-6, 3-6, 6-1, 7-6(4), 6-1 in a dramatic battle that marked Monfils‚Äô third two-sets-to-love comeback and first since the 2015 Australian Open. Monfils earned his 40th match win at the clay-court major, tying Yannick Noah for most victories at the event among Frenchmen in the Open Era. For a moment in the early stages, it did not seem like the match would last long. During the fifth point, Monfils chased down a forehand when he tripped and crashed into the sidewall. Monfils let go of his racquet while falling onto the clay, with his right knee slamming into the court signage. He remained seated on the court, grimacing in pain while the chair umpire checked on him.That‚Äôs that Gael Monfils energy üï∫He weathers the storm from two sets down to overcome Dellien 4-6 3-6 6-1 7-6(4) 6-1 üî•.#rolandgarros #monfils #frenchopen #tennis pic.twitter.com/xEffA8wi2m‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) May 27, 2025 Fans inside Court Philippe-Chatrier held their breath while Monfils took a medical timeout and received treatment on his right knee and both hands. The No. 42 player in the PIF ATP Rankings dropped serve the following game and eventually fell to a 5-2 deficit. Yet Monfils fought his way back to get back on serve before Dellien secured the first set 6-4 inside Court Philippe-Chatrier. Dellien faced physical struggles of his own as the match wore on. The 31-year-old, hampered by cramps, struggled to move freely in the third set. Monfils fought back into the match and brought the home crowd alive with his vintage defence and shotmaking skills. After holding his nerve in the fourth-set tie-break, Monfils raced to 5-0 lead in the fifth set. He showed no signs of physical ailment beyond the first set, closing out the dramatic win after three hours and 35 minutes. The victory marked Monfils‚Äô 12th five-set win at Roland Garros. Monfils will next face fifth seed Jack Draper. The Briton leads their Lexus ATP Head2Head series 1-0. Monfils improved to 17-7 on the season, according to the Infosys ATP Win/Loss Index.",
