This special collaboration gives every tennis fan the chance to claim free, official memorabilia from our flagship event - and have their love for the sport be recognised. Here’s what you need to know: What is Momentum? Momentum is an eight-day experience where fans claim Traces: digital memorabilia from the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals (10-17 November). What is a Trace, and why would I want one? Traces are digital memorabilia that tell the story of the Nitto ATP Finals. Each of the 15 singles matches will have its own Trace, with a unique design created from official match data. Each is a keepsake that allows fans to relive showdowns between the world’s greatest players. Because they are time-limited, they are also a way for fans to prove: “I was there!”. How many Traces will there be? Momentum will feature 15 Match Traces, corresponding to the 15 singles matches at the 2024 Nitto ATP Finals. There is also a Tournament Trace, which is claimable upon joining the experience. Each account will be limited to one claim of each Trace. All Traces are free to claim. When can I claim Match Traces? Each Match Trace will be claimable for 24 hours only, on match day. There will be eight claim windows in total, corresponding to the eight days of the tournament (10-17 November). Each window opens and closes at midnight in Turin (6pm ET, 11pm UK, 12am CET).

    "description": "Denis Shapovalov continued his dominant Belgrade Open run on Friday to advance to his first ATP Tour final since his Vienna runner-up finish in October 2022. The Canadian qualifier eased to a 6-2, 6-1 victory against fourth seed Jiri Lehecka to advance to his seventh tour-level final and his fifth on indoor hard courts. The 25-year-old has lost just one set and one break point in his four main-draw victories this week. With an aggressive game plan in the semi-finals, he did not allow Lehecka a break chance, winning 96 per cent (25/26) of his first-serve points, according to Infosys ATP Stats. \"Against a guy like Jiri, if you don't go after him, he's going to dictate the court,\" Shapovalov said after spoiling the Czech's 23rd birthday. \"So for sure I was trying to play my game, play aggressive, really take it to him from the beginning.\" [ATP APP] Up 17 places to No. 61 in the PIF ATP Live Rankings this week, Shapovalov will move to the brink of the Top 50 if he can beat home favourite Hamad Medjedovic in their first Lexus ATP Head2Head matchup in Saturday's final. The Canadian will be playing for his second ATP Tour title (Stockholm 2019). ... and then there were ✌️#BelgradeOpen pic.twitter.com/mrTjBAWLEW — ATP Tour (@atptour) November 8, 2024 Medjedovic advanced to his first tour-level final by coming through an all-Serbian battle against Laslo Djere, 6-2, 3-6, 7-6(2). The Belgrade wild card won the title at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF last year and is seeking to once again close his season with a trophy. The 21-year-old is the third-youngest Serbian to reach his first ATP Tour final after Novak Djokovic (Amersfoort 2006) and Miomir Kecmanovic (Antalya 2019) both played their first finals at 19. While Medjedovic will enjoy the backing of his home crowd in Saturday's championship match, Shapovalov has also felt plenty of support from the Serbian fans this week. \"I didn't know I had so many Serbian fans,\" the Canadian said. \"I think it's because I lose to Novak every time, so maybe they like me!\" [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
