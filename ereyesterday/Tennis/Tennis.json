It pulls opponents out of position, opens the court up for you to hit into, exposes their usually weaker backhand side, and forces them to run twice as far for the next shot - if they even get it at all. Let’s take a deep dive into how YOU can develop this powerful weapon, step by step in this special episode of the Essential Tennis Podcast.",

    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/atp-challenger-tour-prize-money-soars-december-2024",
    "description": "The ATP has announced a record $28.5 million in ATP Challenger Tour prize money for the 2025 season – up $6.2 million year on year and 135 per cent since 2022. The increases are the result of major Challenger Tour reforms delivered under OneVision – ATP’s long-term strategic plan – to expand the number of players able to make a sustainable living from tennis. A central driver of prize money increases has been the formation of Tennis Data Innovations (TDI) and the successful commercialisation of Challenger Tour rights. Calendar enhancements have helped drive growth, through the introduction of premium Challenger 175 events and a rise in the number of higher category Challenger 100 and 125 events. Under OneVision, ATP has established a dedicated Challenger Tour team with new leadership to oversee growth and new revenue opportunities. Significant investment in marketing, headlined by the launch of the Challenger Tour’s ‘On The Rise’ brand campaign, has played an important role in enhancing the visibility and commercial appeal of the Tour. ATP Chairman Andrea Gaudenzi said: “Creating a sustainable player pathway to the ATP Tour is vital for the future of our sport. Since 2022, we’ve invested in significant reforms on the Challenger Tour. The results have been clear: record-breaking prize money, year on year increases and most importantly, more players inside the Top 250 provided with greater financial compensation at this level.” [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "description": "Jakub Mensik’s rise up the PIF ATP Rankings has happened at lightning speed, but the #NextGenATP Czech has not lost perspective when it comes to appreciating where he comes from and what he has. Mensik on Tuesday visited JISTOTA School in his hometown of Prostejov, Czechia. The 19-year-old, whose brother Lukas is a student at the school, later paid tribute to the students and teachers he had met. [ATP APP] Mensik wrote on Instagram: “I’m living my dream - I play tennis matches at prestigious tournaments, meet legends I looked up to as a child and still admire today, travel a lot, and get to know fascinating places and cultures. I’m incredibly fortunate not only to do what I love but, most importantly, to be healthy! “I know not everyone is so lucky, and I’m reminded of this every day, not only because of my amazing brother, who has autism spectrum disorder, but also because of his classmates, whom I had the privilege of visiting during class today. “These incredible young people are true fighters, facing adversity daily with remarkable effort, perseverance, and positivity. They work hard on themselves, supported by their incredible teachers and assistants, much like I work with my own team.” pic.twitter.com/XEkN1MMSNI— Jakub Mensik (@mensik_jakub_) December 10, 2024 True to the spirit of the holiday season, Mensik also made a call for kindness. “I deeply admire the dedication of everyone involved, whether students or educators, and I’m grateful to contribute in my own way - whether it’s supporting their rehabilitation, providing aids, or helping them experience moments that bring them closer to their dreams,\" he wrote. “I have immense respect for everyone at JISTOTA School, which cares for 76 pupils and students. Thank you, JISTOTA School, for the vital work you do. “This holiday season, let’s come together to make a difference. No matter how big or small, every act of kindness matters, and doing something is always better than doing nothing. Take a moment to support a cause close to your heart; even the smallest gesture can bring hope and joy to someone in need.” Mensik, who finished 2024 at a career-high No. 48 in the PIF ATP Rankings, will next compete at the Next Gen ATP Finals presented by PIF in Jeddah, which begins on 18 December.
