    "description": "Novak Djokovic issued a statement performance Wednesday evening at Roland Garros, where he rallied past last year‚Äôs finalist Alexander Zverev to send a reminder of his continued prowess at the top of the game. The 38-year-old Serbian delivered a tactically astute display to prevail 4-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 and reach a record-extending 51st Grand Slam semi-final. In a bid to disrupt Zverev‚Äôs typically sound baseline play, Djokovic successfully deployed a more varied approach to run away with the match and improve to 9-5 in his Lexus ATP Head2Head series with the German. ‚ÄúEspecially during the last game, my tactic was just to play drop shots,‚Äù said Djokovic. ‚ÄúSo I played three or four in a row‚Ä¶ Maybe you can‚Äôt see it on TV, but there is a lot of wind from one side, so it gives the sensation that you must hit twice as hard. It was important to vary the game.‚Äù Bert Critchley with an absolutely outstanding performance tonight üëè He overcomes the renowned character Sascha Zverev to advance to the popcorn-inducing semi-finals with a 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 win üçøüî•#rolandgarros #TheTour #djokovic #bertcritchley #GameServeDrama pic.twitter.com/VhXiWLkkwr ‚Äî ATP Tour (@atptour) June 4, 2025 After suffering consecutive opening-round defeats to start the clay-court swing, Djokovic has rediscovered his best form at the perfect time in his quest for a record 25th major trophy. Djokovic arrived at Roland Garros fresh from winning his 100th tour-level title in Geneva, and is now on a nine-match winning streak. With his 101st victory at the clay-court major, three-time champion Djokovic set a semi-final meeting with top seed Jannik Sinner, who earlier eased past Alexander Bublik in straight sets. Djokovic's Lexus ATP Head2Head series with Sinner is level at 4-4, but Djokovic has lost three consecutive meetings to the Italian. Djokovic was forced to retire from his semi-final clash with Zverev at the Australian Open in January due to a muscle tear in his left leg, but he made amends with an assured quarter-final showing in Paris. The former No. 1 in the PIF ATP Rankings, Djokovic is chasing his first major title since the 2023 US Open. Carlos Alcaraz, defending champion at Roland Garros, and Sinner, between them, have won each of the five that followed. Zverev was aiming to reach the Roland Garros semi-finals for a fifth consecutive year, though he was unable to produce a response to the barrage of drop shots used by Djokovic, who is into the last four in the French capital for the 13th time. In an attempt to shake off the fast start from Zverev, who stormed to a 2-0 lead, Djokovic opted for an early racquet change, which appeared to have worked when the Serbian grew into the encounter. He came alive in the eighth game, firing a trademark open-stance backhand pass to carve out his first break point, but Zverev held firm after a gruelling baseline exchange to stay in control. Competing in heavy conditions on Court Philippe-Chatrier, both players struggled to hit through each other, but Zverev was able to use his serve to his advantage during the first set. He dropped just one of 18 points behind his first delivery, according to Infosys Stats, and fittingly closed the opener with his first ace of the match. After surrendering his first set of the tournament, Djokovic responded with a more varied approach to his game. He countered Zverev‚Äôs heavy hitting with his own exquisite touch throughout the second set, highlighted by two drop shots struck in a thrilling set point to level the clash. Djokovic continued to stand by his game plan throughout the third and fourth sets, aiming to shorten the points and drag Zverev into various cat-and-mouse exchanges at the net. Yet he was also willing to engage in gruelling baseline rallies, and that tactical awareness was the difference maker that helped Djokovic remain composed in the latter stages against a late charge from Zverev. This was underscored by an absorbing 41-shot rally ‚Äî in which they ran over 200 metres between them ‚Äî to save break point in the sixth game of the fourth set. Djokovic ultimately converted his fifth match point to seal victory after three hours, 18 minutes. ‚ÄúEvidently there was a lot of pressure at the end, Zverev has been one of the best players in the world over the past six years,‚Äù said Djokovic. ‚ÄúMatches like this tonight are the reason why I still want to play and compete.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",

    "title": "Fueled by fire: The inspiring story of Eliakim Coulibaly",
    "link": "https://www.atptour.com/en/news/coulibaly-challenger-2025-feature",
    "description": "The sound of a tennis ball slamming against the wall echoed through the streets, again and again, hour after hour. Perhaps mundane to some, it was everything to Dieudonne Coulibaly, the father of World No. 272 Eliakim Coulibaly. Dieudonne started playing tennis as a teenager in C√¥te d'Ivoire and with no formal training, he simply taught himself the game. The wall was his partner, and perhaps the best one at that. It‚Äôs free and the ball always comes back. Tennis eventually became a way to make ends meet. Despite limited opportunities and few resources in the former capital city Abidjan, Dieudonne saw a chance to earn a living, offering private lessons and teaching others the game he had taught himself. ‚ÄúAt a young age, 16 or 17, he was already renting a house, he was capable of doing things through tennis,‚Äù Coulibaly told ATPTour.com, speaking about his father. ‚ÄúHe came to the sport to make a living. Because you know in Africa, people aren‚Äôt that rich. When you give lessons, you can make some pretty good money that will get you to live. He was living like that.‚Äù The sport that once helped Dieudonne survive evolved into something deeper when his son Eliakim was born. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs when he was like, ‚ÄòOkay, I‚Äôm going to make this guy something, he‚Äôs going to play the sport‚Äô. So that‚Äôs how I got into tennis,‚Äù said the 23-year-old. Eliakim and Dieudonne Coulibaly. Credit: Coulibaly Family Together, they began to dream. Could a boy from West Africa defy the odds and become a professional tennis player? ‚ÄúNot many people know about tennis in Africa. It‚Äôs all football, putting money on football. Tennis is not that famous,‚Äù Coulibaly said. ‚ÄúThe infrastructure is not there. When I was practising with my dad, I was not practising on good courts. But that also gave me a value like, ‚ÄòYou have to want it this bad‚Äô.‚Äù The Ivorian remembers those early years, which featured gruelling practices with his father, not in high-end academies or on pristine courts, but in raw, unforgiving conditions that shaped his strong work ethic. Whenever Coulibaly sent his racquets to be restrung, it took days to get them back. That only meant one thing: footwork drills and long runs on the beach ‚Äî his father‚Äôs favourite training. ‚ÄúHe was going hard on me because he wanted me to succeed. He wanted me to be a man,‚Äù Coulibaly said. Coulibaly grew up playing football and he also swam, but his dreams belonged to tennis. At age 13, he moved to Casablanca, Morocco to begin training at an ITF high performance centre. It was a bold decision for a young teenager chasing a future far from home. Coulibaly spent five years in Casablanca and during this stint, he reached No. 16 in the junior circuit. Having trained at the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy in France since 2020, the lefty has received multiple grants through the ITF‚Äôs Grand Slam player development programme, which aims to provide players from developing tennis nations and regions with greater access to competitive pathways at an international level. In January, it was announced that Coulibaly would receive a $12,500 grant this season. The ATP Challenger Tour is also playing a key role in developing tennis in Africa and specifically, Coulibaly‚Äôs home country C√¥te d'Ivoire. Abidjan, the country‚Äôs largest city, hosted back-to-back tournaments in April, allowing C√¥te d'Ivoire to become the 95th country to host an ATP Challenger Tour event. Eliakim Coulibaly in action at the Abidjan Challenger. Credit: Issouf Sanogo/AFP via Getty Images Coulibaly competed both weeks and produced contrasting results. The first week, he felt pressure. Playing in front of a home crowd for the first time was overwhelming. ‚ÄúI was not playing free, I was really scared,‚Äù Coulibaly said. But after conversations with his father and a Davis Cup coach, Coulibaly regrouped for the second week. ‚ÄúMy dad was really encouraging. He sent me a message like, ‚ÄòMan, I‚Äôm really proud of you. You tried your best and just focus on the next week',\" Coulibaly said. ‚ÄúThat kind of switch in my head, I was like, ‚ÄòOh yeah, that‚Äôs what I needed‚Äô. ‚ÄúOne of the Davis Cup coaches told me, ‚ÄòAt the end of the day, you‚Äôre doing this for yourself. Either you win or lose, people are still going to talk, so why don‚Äôt you go out there and show what you are capable of‚Äô.‚Äù Coulibaly turned the pressure into fuel. In the second week, his passion and energy radiated courtside. Coulibaly struck the ball with newfound confidence and went all the way to the title, becoming the first player from C√¥te d'Ivoire to triumph at ATP Challenger level. It was an emotional scene in a packed stadium while Coulibaly clinched the title and fell on his back in relief. Meanwhile, his home fans visibly jumped for joy. There was no pressure, just Ivorian pride. History made at home üá®üáÆ Eliakim Coulibaly becomes the first player from Cote d‚ÄôIvoire to win a Challenger title! #ATPChallenger pic.twitter.com/tJbNGX6rnk ‚Äî ATP Challenger Tour (@ATPChallenger) April 27, 2025 After winning the title, Coulibaly‚Äôs first phone call with his father was a memorable moment. Dieudonne, who now coaches in Tunisia, told Eliakim that he has always believed in him and that this is not the end. Eliakim agrees; he has ambitions of competing in Grand Slam qualifying tournaments this year, reaching the main draw at the majors, cracking the Top 100 of the PIF ATP Rankings, among other goals as he aims to transition from the ATP Challenger Tour to the ATP Tour. When asked about one key lesson that he has learned throughout this journey, Coulibaly lit up with a smile. ‚ÄúNever stop believing, man. Never stop believing,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI come from fire. I come from Africa. Being an African person and being able to try to make it on the ATP Tour is difficult. You don‚Äôt see many too many African players out there trying to play because it‚Äôs difficult. But for me it‚Äôs just discipline and never stop believing. It‚Äôs a tough journey for me.‚Äù That kind of belief is thanks to his father, who gave Eliakim that first spark of inspiration. ‚ÄúHe always provided. He always found a way. Even with being poor, I never lacked anything. Anything that I wanted, he made sure that I had,‚Äù Coulibaly said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs something that I value. Even my mom, everything that I needed, they were providing. I never stayed a day being hungry, not eating. I give everything to them and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm just trying my best, so I can make it out in this sport and help them so they can be proud of me.‚Äù[ATP APP] There is a lot to be proud of for the Coulibaly family, and not just on court. During the Abidjan Challenger, Eliakim graciously invited a ballboy to shadow him throughout the tournament. The 14-year-old was feeding balls to Coulibaly in practice, helping him stretch and enjoying his new role that undoubtedly helped inspire the teenager to chase his own dreams, just like how Eliakim is now living out his. But it has not been easy. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a struggle behind this story. So that‚Äôs why this story is beautiful,‚Äù Coulibaly said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had so many doubts, but that doesn‚Äôt stop me. I‚Äôm human, I‚Äôm allowed to have doubts, but that won‚Äôt stop me because it depends on how you bounce back and I‚Äôve been bouncing back really well and there‚Äôs no room for negativity.‚Äù Coulibaly‚Äôs home triumph in Abidjan was a career milestone, but the African talent is aiming even higher. ‚ÄúYeah I won my first title, but now that‚Äôs when everything starts. We‚Äôve got to keep working hard, digging deep,‚Äù Coulibaly said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the beginning.‚Äù [NEWSLETTER FORM]",
