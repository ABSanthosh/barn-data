    "description": "The cabins are located 1,650 metres above sea level, just outside the Ile Alatau National Park, 25 kilometres south of Almaty, on the northern slope of Trans-Ili Alatau in Kazakhstan. The client's family decided to build two guest cabins for their friends in order to showcase the magnificent highland landscapes of the Kazakh Tien Shan. The idea behind the project was to create a warm and welcoming place while safeguarding nature. Today, global trends celebrate high-end comforts, but this Central Asian land preserves ancient nomadic traditions. The clients and the architect, Arthur Kariev, believe that for the modern urban dweller, true luxury lies in creating an opportunity to enjoy nature without disturbing the ecosystem, retrace one's roots in everyday life, and spend quality time with the near and dear ones.",
