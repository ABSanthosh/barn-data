It captures the essence of a peaceful getaway while maintaining its urban context. The ground floor becomes an open plan, a terrace-like space where the complete opening of its windows allows the exterior to blend seamlessly with the interior. The heights of the public area are enhanced by a level change that separates the entrance and kitchen from the living and dining areas, maintaining a shared view while distinguishing the spaces through variations in elevation.",
