    "description": "A small, cozy restaurant in Copenhagen, featuring unique, raw furniture and objects, all handmade in Poland. Amator is a new, beloved spot for guests in the peaceful district of Copenhagen – Østerbro. It combines a café, a restaurant, and a venue for private dinners, which the owner, Mateusz Sarnowski, known as Mati Pichci, describes as a \"home dining room\" (in Danish: hjemme spisested). Mati's favorite dish, the classic omelet, is the centerpiece and iconic item on the menu. During the day, the kitchen serves breakfasts and lunches, offering light, flavorful dishes based on seasonal vegetables. Evenings are reserved for private and corporate candlelit dinners. Mati began his journey in Copenhagen five years ago as an intern at the renowned restaurant Noma, and his passion eventually led him to open his own place. He approached his friend, Adam Wierciński, founder of wiercinski-studio, to help bring his vision to life. The result of their collaboration is the first interior in Copenhagen designed by the Polish architect.",
