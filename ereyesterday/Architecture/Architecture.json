    "description": "The house embodies a subliminal connection with its surroundings. Sited amongst the ghats around a tranquil lake, this is a weekend home for a dancer and her family. Thoughtfully orientated, the homes unfold in a series of connected pavilions. Each pavilion has its own spatial purpose flowing to the next. Each space holds a unique perspective of the lake view. Designed to awaken with the pulse of nature; life in this home is therapeutic. Set along a north-south axis, the sun registers itself on the east and west-facing skin of the home. The solstice sun rays align with the deliberate color blocks on the living room wall, honoring the universe and time.",

Often, this does not happen due to the condition of the buildings, but because many homeowners see it as an easier and cheaper way to achieve a more modern home. However, demolition is rarely sustainable, which is why we need to rethink our existing houses, so they meet today's housing needs and dreams.",
