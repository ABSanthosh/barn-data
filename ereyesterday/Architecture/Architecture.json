    "description": "Situated in a residential condominium in Guarujá, a city about an hour and a half from São Paulo, this summer retreat takes advantage of the main view to create solutions that prioritize privacy and enjoyment of the living and leisure spaces. This beach house was commissioned by a long-standing client of the office, a couple who spends their vacations on the coast with their family and friends. During our first visit to the site, we understood that we should explore the back of the plot, which offers a view of the sea and where the access to the beach is located. On the other side, the front, accessed through an internal street of the condominium with constant traffic, needed to be more closed-off, while the side facades, in close proximity to neighboring properties, required visual protection. From this analysis, the image of a long, slender volume perpendicular to the access road, supported by slender eaves, emerged on the small plot corresponding to the buildable perimeter. Maintaining the horizontality of the proportion from the exterior and consequently reducing the overall height of the building, we worked with the idea of a half-level. This solution breaks the rigidity of the interior space and allows for different ceiling heights throughout the program.",
