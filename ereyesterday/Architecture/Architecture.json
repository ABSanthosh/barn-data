This is a house in which functions normally located outside the house, such as a piano school and telework, are included within the house. The house is not directly open to the neighborhood, but rather, like most houses, it is closed to the neighborhood, and we attempted to design a space where people can feel the town as our image in the house, and where the image of the town is continuously connected.",
