    "description": "The Cathedral School for Boys sits at the uppermost corner of the landmarked Grace Cathedral Close block, adjacent to the apse end of the Cathedral. The two-story addition designed by our office is connected horizontally to the original 1960s school building and sits on top of an existing concrete expansion from 2009. Our design consists of a steel structure with a glass and aluminum curtain wall: the new addition was light enough to land on the existing structure without foundation upgrades, and construction was sequenced to avoid interrupting the academic calendar. The addition contains open common spaces for large gatherings, small meetings, and quiet study, with spectacular views of the Cathedral transept and the downtown skyline. The project also included an interior renovation that created a new entry axis, leading directly from the front door to the new heart of school life.",
