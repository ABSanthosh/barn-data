    "description": "The Netherlands' largest coloured solar facade graces De Kikker community school in Amsterdam An icon of sustainability and innovation in Amsterdam. Amsterdam welcomes a new sustainable masterpiece: De Kikker community school, located in Nieuw-West, now features the Netherlands' largest coloured solar facade by Solarix. With 1,444 m² of facade panels in vibrant green and yellow tones, finished with textured glass, De Kikker blends a lively aesthetic with advanced solar energy generation. This innovative facade transforms the school into both a visual landmark and a milestone in sustainable energy solutions. Following an extensive renovation, the school building has been transformed into an iconic example of sustainability and innovation. The custom-designed facade panels by Solarix form the heart of this impressive project. Reinier Bosch, Creative Director \u0026 Co-founder of Solarix, explained: \"New generations deserve colourful and dynamic examples of sustainability. Let's show our children that a cheerful, colourful solar facade not only enhances schools like De Kikker but also contributes to their future and the planet's.\"",

    "description": "Overlooking the sea, a sand-colored volume mimetically accommodates itself amidst the lush green vegetation, in full integration with nature. Facing the Baleia beach, on São Paulo coast, JD House is the ideal spot  for a family composed of a couple and their 4 adult sons to meet  each other and rest. The clients, who are used to hosting friends and tend to visit the coast weekly, desired spacious and private  environments -- although still connected to the natural surroundings. To  achieve this, a large span in the living room was designed, with only one  circular pillar at its end, supporting the entire slab and the external cover  cantilever. The result brings a great visual permeability inside out:  both beach and dense lateral landscaping seem to penetrate the  residence, as interior and exterior are well connected. To solve this structural challenge, we designed a large inverted prestressed beam, which also serves as a guardrail for the upper floor suites.",
