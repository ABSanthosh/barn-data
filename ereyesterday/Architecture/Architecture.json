It is built from a pure volume, with a clear and clean geometry, where the gestures and openings on the facades reveal the visual permeability and the interior/exterior relationship through large openings. The openings thus result from the abstract absence of continuity/discontinuity of the façade, creating a house with a unique and purely abstract identity, which allows you to contemplate the Castle, the city of Torres Novas, and the Serra de Aire.",
