    "description": "This project began as a renovation of a significant early work by renowned Indonesian architect Andra Matin. Over the years, the building had undergone many uses and transformations, each adding layers of complexity to its structure. Reviving it required a careful balance between preservation and innovation. Many unforeseen challenges emerged as we peeled back its history, uncovering structural inconsistencies and outdated systems that needed upgrading. Our mission was not just to restore the building, but to reimagine its purpose-bringing it back to life as a cultural and community-driven destination as well as reviving the neighborhood of Kemang, the once cultural hotspot of Jakarta.",

    "description": "The Banco do Cajuais Visitors Center was a project carried out for the NGO Aquasis at Picos Beach, Ceará. The construction, completed in 2021, was designed as an exhibition space to showcase the institution’s projects. The growing demand for the NGO and the increasing use of the space by a diverse and expanding audience led to new needs and improvements to enhance the site's usability. Therefore, a growth plan for the complex was conceived, initially proposing the construction of an annex to the original building.",
