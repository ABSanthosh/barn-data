It was a long process, with a pandemic in between, and has recently re-opened to the community. We were challenged to renovate the existing grandstand building, as well as to integrate the new buildings for the CDUP, and it was this spirit of designing a cohesive whole that inspired the project, also because architecture should not and cannot break with the context, and must be relational in time.",
