Life took them to different situations and places in Brasil, and on different continents. In 2019, the life long friendship between these architects and their client created the opportunity for a reunion and collaborative project. The architects came together on a bank holiday weekend to conceive the project which was subsequently developed by Galeria Arquitetos under the coordination and supervision of Fernanda Neiva.",
