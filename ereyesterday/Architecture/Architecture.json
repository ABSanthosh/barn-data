    "description": "The project for Quintal Mogi, an establishment that encompasses a restaurant, café, and the sale of organic products, originated from the concept of the \"quintal\" itself—a space that evokes warmth, memories, affection, and simplicity, aiming to create a unique atmosphere for the location. Originally, the corner property was an old house that underwent various transformations over the years to accommodate different commercial uses. It had an unfavorable configuration, with improvised extensions, precarious roofs, various overlapping coverings, platforms, windows with limited visibility, and a completely closed facade facing the street. The first step was to promote the \"opening\" of the space by removing ceilings, unifying roofs, integrating spaces, and eliminating level differences.",
