    "description": "In this project, the main inspiration came from the need to create a home that is not only comfortable but also environmentally efficient. The core concept revolves around making the core of the house the central integration point for various structural elements, utility systems, MEP (mechanical, electrical, plumbing), vertical circulation, and building physics. This core was designed to extend from the first to the third floor, serving as a hub for natural light and air, enabling the stack effect. The stack effect creates a natural airflow where hot air rises, keeping the lower levels cooler.",
