Since 2019, a national and international network of educational institutions has been established, fostering an experience of exchange and joint production. This initiative revolves around the development of full-scale constructions through collective and community-building workshops, with the active participation of students and social actors. The team at Biblioteca Popular La Carcova serves as the primary liaison within the territory for the project's development.
