    "description": "Navigating the inherent challenges of a narrow house nestled between other buildings – typical of urban plots with limited frontage and depth – we embraced the opportunity to transform its ground floor. The goal was to create a space that not only significantly elevates its habitability but also deeply reflects the vibrant essence of its owner, Beta. A woman full of life, a dedicated yoga practitioner, and someone who cherishes moments spent entertaining friends and family, Beta's dynamic emotional and cultural background became the guiding inspiration for this renovation. Infusing her personality into the very fabric of her home was a truly rewarding endeavor.",
