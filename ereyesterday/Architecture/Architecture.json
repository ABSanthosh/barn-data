    "description": "Chinese architect and educator Liu Jiakun has been announced as the laureate of the 2025 Pritzker Architecture Prize, the highest honor in the architecture field. This prestigious award recognizes Jiakun, founder of Jiakun Architects (established 1999), for his ability to blend traditional Chinese elements with contemporary design and for his commitment to social equity in the built environment. Born in Chengdu, China, where he continues to live and work, he becomes the second Chinese architect to receive the accolade, following Wang Shu (2012). Jiakun joins a distinguished list of previous laureates including Riken Yamamoto in 2024, David Chipperfield in 2023, and Francis Kéré in 2022. The award ceremony will be held this spring at the Jean Nouvel-designed Louvre Abu Dhabi, with a global video release of the presentation this fall, followed by the 2025 Laureates' Lecture and Symposium in May.",

    "description": "Located in Prospect Heights of Brooklyn, the Fujianese restaurant Nin Hao has a given space that is 16 feet tall with abundant sunlight coming from its south and east-facing curtain walls. Therefore, the sense of transparency is omnipresent in this space. Two materials that interact with light differently were implemented surrounding the dining space -translucent Austrian curtains along the windows soften the sunlight, creating a gentle interplay between light and shadow. This filtered light, in turn, reflects off the polycarbonate-paneled wall on the opposite side, diffusing throughout the space and contributing to an atmosphere that feels airy, bright, and ever-changing.",
