    "description": "Situated within the tranquil and upscale neighborhood of the Thonglor area in Bangkok, the PLP City range presents an innovative mixed-use facility designed primarily as a state-of-the-art golf simulation center. The building's striking facade is crafted from a combination of concave and convex precast concrete panels, serving aesthetic and functional purposes. These uniquely shaped modules generate a dynamic interplay of shade and shadow throughout the day, ingeniously echoing the graceful arc of a golf swing and creating a visual representation of the sport itself. Steel elements accentuate the entrance and future retail spaces on the ground floor, purposefully designed to mimic the sleek form of a golf driver and featuring semi-reflective materials that enhance their modern appeal.",
