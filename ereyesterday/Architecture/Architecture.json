    "link": "https://www.archdaily.com/1022164/nldkx-apartment-ultra-studio",
    "description": "A room without an inhabitant. The term nLDK is widely used in the Japanese residential real estate market, where n stands for the number of bedrooms, L for the Living room, D for the Dining room and K for the Kitchen. For example, if a flat has two bedrooms, it would be described as a 2LDK. The description nLDK is very important for real estate market information, as people generally search for a room based on the number of n that is appropriate for their family size and income. For example, a couple with one child will often be looking for a floor plan with n≥2. The seller would then consider that at least 2LDK is necessary in an area where there are many families with children. This nLDK typology has emerged in the history of post-war housing supply, but its rigidity has been criticized in recent years.",

Positioned at the southeast corner of the intersection of Pudong Avenue and Dongfang Road, it resides in a significant urban node to the east of Lujiazui CBD's core area. To the east, between the Wind Tower and Qiancang Road, was the site of the historic Wu's Residence (Wu Miaosheng's Residence), a Heritage Architecture in Shanghai built in 1924. Adjacent to the south is the Chen's Residence, built in the 1930s, designated as a Cultural Relics Protection Site in Pudong.",
