A prevailing trend in modern renovation and construction favors thin, lightweight materials – often chosen for their superficial aesthetic and glossy veneer. Would it be possible to instead design with robust, minimally processed, and long-lasting materials?",

    "description": "The renovation of Casa Graviola was planned based on 4 main movements. The first step was to simplify the existing structure by demolishing the various extensions that surrounded the original house from 1991. The main body of the house was preserved and has striking features, such as the brick walls and the roof made directly from beams and ceramic tiles, dispensing with the use of slats, an old technique that directly refers to the Casa do Rio Vermelho by Jorge Amado and Zélia Gattai, a direct reference for this renovation.",

Designed by Estudio Ramos, this project is more than just another amenity, it’s a quiet architectural gesture that folds into its surroundings, encourages connection, and feels more like a shared living room than a formal facility. In a city where most clubhouses follow a one-size-fits-all formula, this one breaks the mold.",
