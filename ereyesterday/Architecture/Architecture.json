Set below street level, the house stands out for its volumetry, which subtly reveals a half level and the upper block. The L-shaped layout and the intelligent use of steel structure allow for large spans, creating a sense of openness and fluidity both internally and externally. The facade, a sophisticated blend of wood slats and dark tones combined with concrete slats, harmonizes with the surrounding landscaping, giving the composition a sense of lightness. Wide and slender eaves rest on the house's volume, surrounding the entire upper floor and becoming a key feature in both design and functionality.",
