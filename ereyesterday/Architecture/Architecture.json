It developed with the implantation of two golden rectangles and from then on, all spaces flowed naturally. The intersection of these rectangles gives rise to an interior courtyard with the function of dividing the social area from the private area and maximizing the use of natural light and panoramic views, promoting a strong connection between the internal spaces and the external landscape.",
