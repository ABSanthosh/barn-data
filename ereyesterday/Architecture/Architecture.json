    "description": "The Koba House is located in Gonçalves, in southern Minas Gerais, within the Mantiqueira Mountains, known for its cold high-altitude climate. The land, situated 1,450 meters above sea level, has a steep slope and covers an area of 3.7 hectares. Since we had already developed a project on the neighboring plot, we were well aware of the local conditions, including logistical restrictions, the availability of labor, and climatic peculiarities. From the beginning, we decided, along with the clients, to use local labor. The contractor, for example, lived in the same neighborhood as the construction site. Before starting the project, we analyzed which construction techniques were most familiar to the team, aiming to create something that respected the local technical vocabulary without replicating an already known design.",

    "link": "https://www.archdaily.com/1027759/birch-residence-table-architecture",
    "description": "The Birch residence is part of an early 20th-century development in the town of Saint-Lambert, Québec. The original building, with its generous architecture, featured ornamental woodwork and evoked the domestic elegance of the last century. However, the design, with its partitioned rooms, conflicted with contemporary living. The aim was to create fluid, uncluttered spaces that connect to the yard, addressing previous design shortcomings. A compact volume was also built at the rear to house the kitchen. The new interior layout is organized in two main axes: services and circulation, and living spaces. The kitchen is now the focal point, promoting a natural flow between the ground floor and the exterior. The house's features are reinterpreted with contemporary touches, such as stained wood veneers, trim work, larger openings, and new views toward the garden. The material palette blends the warmth of wood with the coolness of concrete. A prism of masonry, echoing the original materiality, the volume establishes a formal contrast with the turn-of-the-century building. At once alien and familiar, the extension stands out without confronting.",
