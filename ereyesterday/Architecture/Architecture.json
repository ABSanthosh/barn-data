The older brother owns the larger house, while his younger brother is the owner of the smaller one. Despite having their own families of their own, they still choose to be near each other and their parents, who are the grandparents of their offspring, as the focal point of the family, so that the grandparents can enjoy seeing their grandchildren grow up. In addition, on weekends their younger sister and her husband always visit. Up to ten people are living in this endearing gable house.",
