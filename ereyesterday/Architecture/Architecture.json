    "description": "Tanatap Heritage Garden is a small architectural intervention that transformed a once-mediocre vertical building, which stood as a barrier in Braga's heritage shophouse, into a creative melting pot that celebrates its historical significance. The project's main challenge from the outset was to apply primary methods for the adaptive reuse of an existing Dutch heritage shophouse structure, converting it into a restaurant and coffee shop situated in the middle of a block on Braga Street, Bandung. The shed, originally a warehouse, provided us with the opportunity to work with many original elements inherited from its previous uses, such as existing frames, walls, and facades.",
