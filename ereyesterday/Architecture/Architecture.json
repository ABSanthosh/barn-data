The renovated space seamlessly blends professional functionality with a quirky, colorful design that reflects the energy of its team and clientele. The building's façade remains largely unchanged, maintaining the charm of its commercial roots. However, the rear façade tells a different story: large openings flood the interior with natural light, particularly on the second floor, where the Parade team works. The entrance sets the tone with tiled flooring bearing the studio's name a modest yet personal touch.",
