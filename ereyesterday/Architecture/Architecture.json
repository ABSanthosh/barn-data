Reinventing an Avant-garde Project, the RDS House has undergone a remarkable transformation, merging history and modernity into an innovative renovation project. Originally designed in the 1960s by Am√©rico R. Campello to serve as the residence of the British Consul in S√£o Paulo, it was later adapted to become the British Consulate in the 1980s. Today, it has re-emerged as a sophisticated home for a 21st-century family.Campello's design, whose structure was considered innovative for its time, was altered and mischaracterized due to changes over the years. Our goal became to reinforce the original volume by restoring the wide and beautiful cantilevers, as well as expanding the internal spaces.",
