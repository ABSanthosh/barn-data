    "description": "This project is an expansion of the Chabad of Charleston's rapidly growing Preschool of the Arts. Shortly after completing the original building and launching the school, the program quickly outgrew the two classrooms to which it was designated. The leadership sought to double the attendance of the school while also maintaining the unique character of the site. Unfortunately, the open space on the 2.5-acre site was largely unbuildable due to the 11,000 SF existing building, the program's parking requirements, outdoor play area needs, extensive buffer yards, and protected wetlands.",

    "description": "For Os Espacialistas, geometry is the relationship of affection that humans establish with nature. Cella is a kind of space with anatomical, architectural, and sculptural qualities. At its core, it is a body (cell), a space (cell), and a material (cork). A division with walls, touch, and ground. A place for the body to stroll, speak, and play; to exercise the latent artistic reproductive system within us and transform imagination into a relational organ of poetic investigation. It is dreamily inhabited by a swarm of cubes, sown to be harves- ted, tossed, built, and moved from place to place.",
