    "description": "Feeling the Concept (Light and Form) - In this architectural creation, form and light converge in a dance, where materiality transforms into poetry etched in stone, muted tones compose a silent symphony, and textured surfaces whisper secrets to fingertips. As daylight pirouettes through carefully placed openings, patterns shift across floors and walls, creating an ever-evolving sonnet of illumination. Here, volumes and planes find a harmonious balance of solid and void, inviting contemplation on the delicate interplay of light and form; a quiet ode to space.",

The obligation to maintain a minimum setback of 1.50m on one of the lateral boundaries suggested a longer building oriented towards one of the neighbors.",
