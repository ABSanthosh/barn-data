    "description": "Glass Star, located in Seongjeong-dong, Cheonan, is an eyewear store that has remained in the same place for many years. With a diverse customer base, it offers a wide range of brands, from those favored by young customers to children's and sports eyewear. As a result, it is a welcoming space where people of all ages can visit, connect, and shop comfortably. Our journey began with a question: how can we effectively express the 'diversity' that defines Glass Star? Eyeglasses are a familiar object, yet when you think about them more deeply, they reveal something fascinating. Wiping a pair of glasses clears a blurry view, gradually brightening one's vision, as if unveiling an entirely new world within the frame.",

    "description": "The work is located on the coastal edge of Punta Hueso, Coquimbo region, Chile. It is a site where the coast, rocky formations, and the characteristic medium/low-height vegetation of the northern region prevail. The project is designed based on a grid of nine quadrants composed of eight peripheral wooden quadrants and one central circular concrete quadrant, which rises to serve as the access to the house through what we call a sculptural element, a project in itself like the spiral staircase. The house is elevated to protect the local flora in preservation while enhancing the completely unobstructed 360-degree views of its surroundings.",
