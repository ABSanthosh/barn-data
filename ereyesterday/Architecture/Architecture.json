    "description": "Blending into the Landscape – In the 1970s, as apartments became dominant in Korea, a quieter housing typology emerged: modest three-story brick homes built by small-scale contractors. With red bricks and white railings, these houses still shape the identity of many low-rise neighborhoods today. Wonderful Uman responds to this context by integrating into its surroundings rather than overwriting them. Its red-toned brick façade is slightly lighter than that of its neighbors, just enough to assert its presence while maintaining harmony with the streetscape.",

    "description": "Snow Peak Cafe, designed by KiKi ARCHi, is set inside a former red-brick warehouse in Suzhou, China. Once part of a cluster of industrial buildings from the 1950s, the structure has been reworked into a modern space for coffee, retail, and quiet conversation. Guided by Snow Peak’s “Embrace Your Nature” philosophy, the design keeps what’s essential, pares back what’s not, and lets the building’s character speak through thoughtful materials and a minimal layout.",

    "description": "Perched high on a rocky slope in Palm Beach, just 40 kilometers from Sydney, Australia, this modest home offers an antidote to over-designed living. Designed and built by CplusC Architects + Builders, this two-bedroom home isn’t about grandeur or excess, it’s about quiet immersion in the treetops. With a cargo net bay for lounging in the canopy and timber decks that dissolve the boundary between indoors and out, it’s a home that invites you to take a breath, slow down, and soak in the birdsong.",
