Designed by Zoboki Design and Architecture (ZDA), the new Richter Gedeon headquarters marks the beginning of a new era for the company. This building not only pays homage to Richter's history and tradition but also stands as an outstanding example of modern architecture, blending functionality, sustainability, and distinctive form. Richter's tradition and vision - The Richter Centre is located on the company's historical production site in Budapest, Hungary, that has been continuously expanded over the decades. Following a deliberate land use strategy, the company revitalizes its original factory sites, while gradually developing based on a long-term master plan created by ZDA 20 years ago. The new building, positioned centrally, next to the Chemical Research and Office Building, bridges the noble past of the company with its future developments.",
