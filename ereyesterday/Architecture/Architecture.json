    "description": "Nestled in the tranquil Bhabar region of Uttarakhand, adjacent to the Jim Corbett National Park, Whispering Arc is a contemplative retreat that merges human ingenuity with natural grace. Conceived as a four-bedroom farmstay, the project explores a delicate equilibrium between raw materiality, sustainability, and the poetry of place. The journey begins with a bold gesture: a red Corten steel gate that stands as both threshold and artwork. Set against the verdant landscape, its warm rusted tones mark the transition into a sanctuary where architecture feels rooted in the earth and open to the skies. This entry sets the tone for a project deeply attuned to its surroundings.",
