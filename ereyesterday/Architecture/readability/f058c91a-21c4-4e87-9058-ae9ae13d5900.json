Still, you don’t often see them in the pages of design magazines, and feature stories celebrate its importance or history. There isn’t anyone credited with the design of the first bidet, but we want to give the fixture some of the attention that it deserves. We’ll share some of the history, reflect on its place in our lives, and extol the other virtues of this instrument of hygiene. In a world that cares more and more about cleanliness, health, and wellness, we’ll discover that the bidet has a lot to say if we stop and listen to it, even if it tends to speak quietly—or rather, in gurgles.A story of prudery and redemptionThe hero of this story has long been portrayed in a pristine white uniform, although its outfits have been increasingly colorful in recent years—bidets are often stylish followers of fashion. Originally from France, a land synonymous with elegance and luxury, the bidet later made its way south into the homes of Italians, where it was embraced. But let’s first step back and start from the beginning, in the 17th century, when the bidet (then made of wood and elevated on legs) began to make its mark in refined aristocratic salons. It was a time when washing was considered suspect if not outright dangerous and the bidet offered a way to clean part of the body without option for a full shower or bath.This bidet from Ceramica Dolomite’s Oltre collection, created by designer Nilo Gioacchini, is distinguished by the geometric composition of its ceramic elements. It’s a combination of functionality and aesthetics that offers solutions for a variety of bathroom styles. Photo Courtesy of Ceramica DolomiteThe 17th century, with its powdered wigs and intense perfumes, was an era when nobles merely brushed their faces with a damp handkerchief and water was regarded with distrust. It is in this context that our “pony” (the original meaning of the French word) debuts, ready to bring a breath of freshness to a society that largely lacked it. At first it was adopted only in certain brothels, where prostitutes used it to clean themselves after amorous encounters.An elegant matching pair: A suspended toilet and bidet from Grohe’s Essence line. Photo Courtesy of GroheIt was used by many as a means of contraception, and thus began its career that straddled two worlds. It was viewed as a device that was too intimate to be welcomed into respectable homes and suited only for those places where rules of morality were more flexible and yet on the other hand it was also an essential tool for cleanliness.Then came the enormous leap following the bidet’s arrival in Italy. In the Protestant countries of northern Europe, the bidet was often viewed as nothing less than an emissary of the devil while in the Mediterranean it wasn’t judged so harshly and instead forgiven any purported sins. In the late 18th century, Maria Carolina of Habsburg-Lorraine, Queen of Naples, decided to make a bold decision for her time and installed a bidet in the Palace of Caserta. In her lavish neoclassical marble bath, the bidet was a novelty and it can still be seen there today. The widespread adoption of this bath accessory in more ordinary Italian homes didn’t occur until World War II, however.The saturated colors of the suspended sanitary ware from Ceramica Cielo's I Catini collection add a bold look to any bathroom.

There were difficult moments like an incident in 1900, when the Ritz Hotel in New York was forced to remove its bidets in response to protests by self-proclaimed guardians of morality. Yet, stoic and determined, the bidet carried on. It’s now conquering the United States as well, where it’s quickly becoming a must-have bathroom fixture.The Geberit AquaClean Alba is a multi-functional bidet that combines elegance and technology. Photo Courtesy of GeberitA very Italian throneThis supporting character in many bathrooms has long been seen as synonymous with Italy, where bidets are practically ubiquitous, and a particular approach to cleanliness. It may not be the first image that comes to mind when we think of the country, but Italians grow up with the knowledge that a splash of water can make a big difference. And bidets have also offered Italian designers a device where they can demonstrate their talents. They are carefully crafting entire lines of bathroom fixtures, imagining elegant shapes and harmonious proportions for sinks, tubs, and toilets. The bidet is often an integral part of these collections. Often they have been grounded on the floor, but today’s more popular style is to have it suspended, as light as air and elegantly discreet.Why experts say the bidet is a winnerIt may seem strange—perhaps even a bit excessive—but in Italy the law requires a bidet in at least one bathroom in an apartment. The legislation which went into effect in 1975 state provides that, “For each dwelling, at least one bathroom must be equipped with the following sanitary facilities: toilet, bidet, bathtub or shower, washbasin.” Even if it weren’t required by law, Italians immediately notice the bidet’s absence when it’s not there. Franesca Panzeri, a Milanese architect who has overseen many renovations, explains: “Even though bidets can be replaced with contemporary alternatives like bidet sprayers, my clients still prefer a complete bathroom set. The current trend, however, is to sacrifice a few precious inches of the bidet in favor of ever-wider showers. Eliminating the bidet completely can mean gaining two feet, if not more, to create a more spacious and open bathroom,” she explains. “I also find bidets useful aesthetically, because they help to define spaces. Paired with elegant faucets and other fixtures, the result is guaranteed to leave an impression.”Efi, Ceramica Flaminia’s historic series of toilets and bidets, includes a model that’s a good choice for bathrooms with limited space. Photo Courtesy of Ceramica FlaminiaThe Milan-based design duo Ludovica Serafini and Roberto Palomba discussed the central importance of the bidet in Italy with us: “The use of the bidet is so ingrained in Italian life that it’s a part of many jokes and idioms. We believe that the bidet is often misunderstood because of its very intimate use, making it a less common topic in everyday conversation. But we are made of both a body and a soul. Our bodies deserve respect and care. And there’s another important use: To wash your feet before going to bed!” These authorities on the subject say that “The most interesting thing for an architect is to design an object. Regardless of its use or our personal opinions about bidets, the key thing is to create something that has the same aesthetic dignity as the rest of the bathroom. In essence, it is a structure that contains water. The model we made for Flaminia, for example, which was designed many years ago, is a minimalist and simple object that found its place in the market precisely because we eliminated everything that was extraneous in a context like the bathroom. As Brancusi, the famous Romanian artist, once said, ‘Simplicity is complexity resolved.’“An important recent architectural change is that the reduction of space in the bathroom is pushing us to integrate the two functions, the bidet and the toilet, with new fixtures that combine them,” the pair continues. “Initially, there was a camouflage approach, in which the line of the bidet inconspicuously followed that of the toilet. Subsequently, thanks to technology, we now have innovative solutions such as special jets and handheld sprayers, which, in the Victorian era, would have been considered even more sinful—a reason to get out the pitchforks. In reality, these solutions allow us to optimize space and create small oases of well-being, even where it appears physically impossible to maintain both functions. Without going too far into all the excesses of Japanese toilets, bidets there include music, heating, and other new features.”Offset by antoniolupi is an elegant built-in unit that unifies the bathroom, concealing any recesses and protrusions into a perfect backdrop. An evolution of Anima Liquida, it also includes storage with compartments for towels and other items. A choice of finishes and colors allow for complete customization. Photo Courtesy of AntoniolupiBe that as it may, bidets remain indispensable in many spaces in Italy. Massimo Vismara, a Vice President at Ideal Standard International confirms this to us, explaining, “Despite the new jetted solutions, in Italy the bidet is undeniably important. Abroad, well, they don’t even know what one is! You also have to consider that in many markets, bathrooms are so small that a bidet would be an unthinkable luxury. In the U.S., however, although the products from the Italian company Ideal Standard don’t work for that market, the bidet is beginning to make inroads. Americans, however, prefer larger ones. It is a matter of different cultural norms, yes, but the bidet is proving itself indispensable.”Leonardo Dainelli of Dainelli Studio, also based in Milan, is absolutely convinced that a bidet is an essential element of a bathroom. He tells us, “Today the bidet is an embodiment of Italy as much as pasta and pizza! When a bathroom has a bidet in Italy, it feels natural for it to be there. When it is missing, it creates an unbridgeable void. As far as I am concerned, it is one of the first thoughts that goes through my head the moment I have to plan any trip abroad. We should create a committee to define its functional but more importantly its aesthetic and formal importance. In terms of elegance and symmetry, it will always be linked to its eternal neighbor, the toilet, and it may not get the same attention. But there’s more we could do to elevate it.”Matteo Cibic, art director of the Milan design brand and gallery Delvis Unlimited, is another fan of the bidet. He shares, “It’s my favorite object. It’s always been part of my life, offering ever new functions and experiences. As a child I would test my plumbing skills by plugging its holes and silently flooding the house. To this day I’ll still put rubber ducks in it and I’ve always considered it a great shelf for towels, books, and magazines. It is the most multifunctional object in a home, and it is the confidant of every family member. The fondest memory I have of a bidet is that I was using one when I found out I was going to be a dad.” Moreno Vannini, who worked for the Japanese studio Nendo, shares an especially poignant description for the bathroom installation: “The bidet offers a moment of reflection with ourselves.”Suspended bidet H830331 is part of a complete bathroom line inspired by Kartell’s iconic design combined with Laufen’s quality. Photo Courtesy of LaufenThere are, however, some who take a contrarian position. Designer Federica Biasi sees the bidet as an awkward intruder. “I don't love it; In fact, I find it clumsy and superfluous. After all, today there are Japanese toilets with integrated bidet sprayers, which solve the problem of hygiene with more grace and style and without taking up precious space. In short, out with the old bidet and in with a new era of minimalist and sophisticated cleanliness.” Sara Ricciardi, a designer who has partnered on projects with a number of Italian brands, shares Biasi’s feelings. “The traditional bidet is too hospital-like. It almost looks like a medical tool ready for emergency surgery,” she shares. “I can’t bring myself to like it, with that clinical look that takes away any trace of sensuality from the toilet. Much better is the understated elegance of Japanese toilet-bidets, which do their double duty in a discrete, delicate, and never awkward way.”At this point one wonders: Are we at the dawn of a new debate, like the one that has long pitted those who prefer showers over bathtubs? This new Italian clash may unfold around the bidet versus the bidet sprayers. And even as the latter gains ground, the simplicity and tradition of old-fashioned bidets may still have the last word.Traditional elegance: the Classic collection from Devon \u0026 Devon.
