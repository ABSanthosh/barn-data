  "text": "structure by ZXD Architects adopts panda form in chinaDesigned by ZXD Architects, Ya’an Panda Performance Center in Ya’an, China, reimagines the relationship between architecture and nature with a form inspired by the giant panda. Located near the Ya’an Bifengxia Base of the China Giant Panda Protection and Research Center, the project creates a ‘cradle’ for the preservation and celebration of biodiversity. Its dual-volume structure accommodates performance spaces and auxiliary facilities.The architectural form features two interconnected cradle-like shapes, evoking the image of a panda mother and cub. The larger volume, centrally positioned, houses the main performance hall, while the smaller volume accommodates dormitories, rehearsal spaces, and supporting functions. The volumes are unified by sloping green roofs planted with native vegetation, utilizing Ya’an’s abundant rainfall to minimize maintenance costs. Visitors enter the space through a sunken plaza, leading to an expansive lobby flanked by vertical green grids reminiscent of a bamboo forest, a symbolic nod to the pandas’ primary habitat and diet.image courtesy of ZXD Architectssemi-transparent facade shields Ya’an Panda Performance CenterAt the heart of the design by ZXD Architects is a 1,200-seat performance hall with an immersive stage that wraps around the audience. Before reaching the main hall, visitors pass through transitional spaces, including an auditorium for related exhibitions and performances. The facade of the building is composed of perforated aluminum panels designed to mimic the texture of panda fur. The panels feature a long-strip format with cantilevered edges, creating a feather-like effect that balances large-scale visual impact with intricate detailing. The double-layer staggered arrangement enhances the semi-transparency of the facade, while internal LED lighting adds dynamic effects at night.The green roof of the Ya’an Panda Performance Center is accessible via a staircase from the second floor, offering viewing platforms. Visitors can stroll amidst native vegetation, connecting visually and experientially with the distant forested mountains. This elevated experience fosters a profound sense of immersion in nature, reinforcing the central mission of the project: to create a harmonious cradle for wildlife and human engagement.Ya’an Panda Performance Center reimagines the relationship between architecture and natureits dual-volume structure accommodates performance spaces and auxiliary facilitiesthe architectural form features two interconnected cradle-like shapesevoking the image of a panda mother and cub",
