The dwelling emerges from a grassy, twelve-acre expanse with panoramic views of mountains and a lush landscape of coconut and palm trees. Even still, the team notes that the flat site lacked notable terrain features. This prompted the architects to create a structure that would respect and integrate with the natural environment. The design philosophy emphasizes a 25/75 ratio — 25% construction and 75% focus on nature.For Earthscape Studio, sustainability goes beyond planting trees. The firm prioritized a construction technique designed to reduce carbon emissions while creating a self-sustaining structure. The building employs an innovative ‘fold architecture,’ characterized by fluid forms and transitions with no seams.

Lime plasters flow across floors and built-in furniture, creating a cohesive interior while reducing indoor temperatures by nearly three degrees Celsius. The structure’s curved and organic forms evoke the experience of entering a cave, infusing the welcoming living space with an atmosphere of wild, cavernous nature.The design employs passive cooling strategies to enhance comfort in Coimbatore’s humid climate. Verdant landscaping hugs the structure, creating a natural insulation layer that reduces interior temperatures while contributing to the building’s structural integrity. Carefully placed windows and vent openings enable a stack effect, allowing cool air to flow in and hot air to escape. A linear bar opening offers sweeping views of tall coconut and palm trees, while the central courtyard allows natural light and ventilation to flood the interior spaces.Earthscape Studio’s Into The Wild blends with the verdant mountains of Mettupalayam, Indiafluid, continuous interiorsEarthscape Studio’s team redefines the approach to interiors, emphasizing built-in furnishings that seem to fluidly emerge from the architecture of its Into The Wild House.
