  "text": "anchor In the first edition of Archinect’s This or That challenge, we asked our audience over on Archinect’s Instagram to design their perfect architecture office. Followers weighed in on eight key considerations, from office layout to music sources, each time offered a choice between two options we often come across in our discussions with firms in the U.S. and beyond. Most our our Instagram followers want a small, cozy office. ALAO's Brooklyn office may appeal to them. Image credit: ALAOOur Instagram followers want a small, cozy office in an old building Our Instagram followers were clearly aligned when it came to the size of their ideal office, with 64% wanting a ‘small and cozy’ office over the 36% that wanted a ‘big and bustling’ environment. Followers also find charm in an aging structure, with 59% wanting their office to be in an ‘old historic’ building versus 41% that wanted a ‘new, modern’ building.  The love for old buildings is perhaps appropriate given that almost half of architecture billings come from the renovation, rehabilitation, extension, or preservation of existing buildings. Most of our Instagram followers wanted their ideal office in an old building. A Parallel's conversion of an abandoned Austin warehouse is a great recent example that our team loves. Image credit: Chase DanialOur Instagram followers want an open-plan office with clustered desks Given the many critical opinions voiced on open plan offices in recent years, it is perhaps surprising that 66% of our Instagram followers believe their perfect architecture office would be open plan, over the 34% who believe the office should be subdivided.  The theme of connection and unity was continued when we asked followers how they would like their desks arranged, with 58% wanting desks clustered together with colleagues, and only 42% wanting desks to be solo and apart. A slim majority of our audience wanted a minimalist office over an eclectic office. How does RIOS' Los Angeles office do on balancing both? Image credit: Jasper SanidadOur Instagram followers want a clean, minimalist office and an office pet When it comes to the decor and atmospheric vibe of the ideal office, our followers are slightly more divided. A narrow majority of 57% want their office to have a simple, minimalist vibe, while 43% believe the office should have an eclectic, cluttered atmosphere.  On the subject of non-human companions, however, followers were more united. A full 75% say yes to office pets, and only 25% say no. Most of our Instagram followers want an office pet in their ideal studio. Maggie from AAHA Studio approves. Image credit: Alec Mills PhotographyOur Instagram followers want to listen to music in the office, and through headphones Our final questions moved away from the visual and towards the audible. When asked what their ideal source of audio entertainment would be, 73% of followers told us they would listen to music, and only 27% would listen to podcasts. Meanwhile, in the most one-sided decision of our challenge, 78% said they would listen through headphones, and only 22% through communal speakers. Did our Instagram followers make the right call? Let us know your thoughts on the decisions in the comments below, as well as more thoughts on the design of your ideal architecture office.
