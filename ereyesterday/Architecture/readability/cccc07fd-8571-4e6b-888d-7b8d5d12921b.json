  "text": "CITANG STREET REGENERATION Blends Heritage with Green DesignIn the heart of Chengdu, Citang Street has undergone a regeneration project led by China Southwest Architectural Design and Research Institute Co., Ltd. (CSWADI), re-envisioning the historically significant neighborhood as a dynamic, layered public space that harmonizes Chengdu’s cultural heritage with the green expanse of People’s Park. Originally a central site in Chengdu’s modern cultural movement, Citang Street continues to reflect the architectural styles of western Sichuan, featuring buildings with centuries-old Republic of China-era design elements and traditional local craftsmanship.The regeneration approach emphasizes organic renewal, integrating the neighborhood’s historic structures with adaptable, green urban spaces that extend through new three-dimensional ‘sky streets.’ The design creates strong connections between the street and People’s Park by widening footpaths and transforming Citang Street into a one-way corridor to increase pedestrian accessibility. By demolishing the park’s boundary walls, the park’s greenery extends into Citang Street, blurring the line between the street and the natural landscape.all images by 404NF STUDIOExpanded pedestrian green corridors enhance accessibilityThe historic layout of Citang Street’s streets and alleys, based on Qing Dynasty planning, is retained, while the removal of non-original structures restores historical hutongs and pedestrian pathways. A modular timber structure inspired by ‘curium porcelain and kintsugi’ aesthetics connects old and new building components, drawing attention to the area’s heritage. The new framework enables contemporary functionality, supporting brand-new uses while preserving the district’s historical character.The three-dimensional design concept by CSWADI also utilizes vertical space, with layered green roofs, terraces, and a rooftop walkway that allows views over the surrounding heritage area. This multi-level greening strategy introduces a sense of spatial continuity, incorporating courtyards, walkways, and elevated green corridors as part of a cohesive, adaptable urban landscape.CSWADI merges sustainable renewal and historical preservationAt the northwest corner, a newly designed art gallery incorporates traditional Chengdu elements, taking cues from the former Half-Side Bridge that once stood nearby. The gallery’s exterior merges ceramic panels and hollow tiles, replicating the texture of traditional blue brick while creating a visual contrast between old and new. A layered brick design on the facade allows light to filter through, casting shadows that mimic the nearby sycamore trees.The Citang Street Regeneration project marks a blend of sustainable renewal and historical preservation, aiming to present Chengdu’s unique urban memory and Tianfu culture in a modernized format. With ongoing phases planned, Citang Street is set to continue its transformation, preserving its cultural legacy while accommodating contemporary urban life.",
