  "text": "airbnb’s beetlejuice residence offers a haunted experienceFollowing the release of American director Tim Burton’s comedy horror film Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Airbnb invites ghost hunters, art enthusiasts, and lifelong fans to live inside the Deetz family’s haunted residence. Located in Hillsborough Township, New Jersey, United States, Delia Deetz’s iconic home is open for a limited, exclusive Airbnb experience, allowing guests to immerse themselves in the surreal, haunting universe of the movie. From November 16 to 27, 2024 selected visitors can explore the Beetlejuice residence, encountering famed art and mysterious portals to The Afterlife. A ghostly art class and hidden rooms, including the Maitlands’ model town and the Waiting Room, await the lionhearted to explore.  With only ten sessions available—each three hours long and limited to six guests—this rare encounter offers a chance to fully immerse in the eerie ambiance of the Deetz residence. Each booking includes a complimentary one-night stay at a nearby Airbnb in Princeton, New Jersey.all images courtesy of AirbnbA guided tour by delia Deetz’s assistant awaits brave visitors Tim Burton’s heroine Delia Deetz returns 36 years after the Beetlejuice movie to open her artistically transformed home to the living, offering an experience rooted in her singular, posthumous vision with the support of the American company Airbnb. Each of the ten three-hour house tours begins with a guided entry by her longtime assistant, leading guests through spaces filled with her distinctive spooky sculptures and paintings. In the attic, visitors encounter the Maitlands’ meticulous model of Winter River, Connecticut. For the brave, Delia’s spirit guides an art class beyond the grave, where participants express their innermost fears on a shared canvas before taking a keepsake fragment. Overnight stays are nearby, ensuring guests avoid spiritual disturbances in the Deetz residence after hours.Airbnb invites ghost hunters, art enthusiasts, and lifelong fans to live inside the Deetz family’s residenceTim Burton revives supernatural chaos in his iconic film sequelTim Burton’s visionary style brings Beetlejuice back in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, the much-anticipated sequel featuring Michael Keaton in his iconic role.
