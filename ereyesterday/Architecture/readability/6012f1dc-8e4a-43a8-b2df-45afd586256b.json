  "text": "Actor Richard Gere has sold the Connecticut home he bought from musicians Paul Simon and Edie Brickell two years ago, Mansion Global reports. In an interview with Vanity Fair Spain earlier this year, the Pretty Woman star discussed his plans to relocate to Madrid with his wife, Spanish publicist Alejandra Silva. Gere offloaded the dwelling for $10.75 million—a slight loss from the $10.8 million the couple paid for the New Canaan pad in 2022.Two structures are situated on the nearly 32-acre estate: a five-bedroom, nine-bathroom English country-style main house dating back to 1938 and a three-bedroom, two-bathroom guest cottage. Simon used the latter space as a recording studio when he owned the home, which he and Brickell bought for $16.5 million in 2002. Other features of the sprawling plot include a swimming pool, terraced patios, gardens, woodland trails, a natural pond, and a waterfall.The red brick main home, which spans approximately 8,800 square feet, boasts three fireplaces, numerous picture windows that showcase the pastoral grounds, and intricate millwork throughout. Up a grand winding staircase are the abode’s bedrooms, each of which boasts its own full bathroom. The expansive powder blue primary suite is outfitted with a private balcony, a wood-burning fireplace, and a built-in cedar closet.Register TodayAD PRO's 2025 Interior Design Forecast is almost hereArrow“For me, going to Madrid is going to be a great adventure because I have never lived full-time outside the United States,” Gere told VF Spain in April. “For Alejandra, it will be wonderful to be closer to her family, her lifelong friends, and her culture. She was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so I think it is only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers,” he explained of the decision to move. The couple were married in 2018 and share two children, born in 2019 and 2020.",
