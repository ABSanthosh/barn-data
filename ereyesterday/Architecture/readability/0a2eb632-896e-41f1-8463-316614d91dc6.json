It’s easy, comfortable luxury that works for any kind of traveler, and the kind of place you’ll want to come back to.” Starts at $795 per night.Courtesy of Casona Roma NorteCasona Roma NorteThe newest boutique hotel in Mexico City, opened in fall 2024 just a mile from Chapultepec Park, Casona Roma Norte “perfectly reflects the spirit and character of the iconic Roma neighborhood,” Rabinor notes. “The building is stunning—officially recognized by Bellas Artes—and the renovation has preserved its historic charm while adding fresh, thoughtful touches.”Though it’s in walking distance to top restaurants like Contramar and Lardo, as well as other renowned cocktail bars and nightlife, the hotel itself offers a range of cuisines on-site with six eateries and bars, including a matcha and tea room, an “agave gallery” that serves traditional Mexican agave-based items and spirits, and a speakeasy that melds Mexican and Art Deco influences. Most notable is Holden, the rooftop bar and fine-dining restaurant that offers panoramic views of the city. Starts at $440 per night.Courtesy of Las AlcobasLas Alcobas, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Mexico CityThe cognoscenti are gravitating to Las Alcobas Mexico City, a popular option for elite travelers who appreciate intimate hotels. The Polanco property has 35 rooms and is full of noteworthy architectural touches such as custom-made Yabu Pushelberg rosewood furniture, original artwork by contemporary Mexican artists, leather wall panels with inlaid stitching, and a spiral staircase as a lobby centerpiece. Starts at $719 per night.Courtesy of Circulo MexicanoCirculo MexicanoCirculo Mexicano, from Mexican hospitality brand Grupo Habita, is located downtown (or in Centro Histórico) in a 19th-century residential building.

Also set on the rooftop terrace is the restaurant Comedor Mexicano, featuring a menu of local and seasonal ingredients. Starts at $250 per night.Courtesy of Ignacia Guest HouseIgnacia Guest HouseWe’re also fans of Ignacia Guest House, in Colonia Roma. The hotel is acclaimed for its striking interior design and architecture that combine contemporary with traditional. Its spaces are filled with furniture and art from names like Eero Saarinen, Serge Mouille, and Jonathan Adler. The gardens, laden with orange trees and native plants, are gorgeous, and you won’t ever forget the breakfast spread that includes sopes, tamales, salsas, freshly pressed juices, and breads just out of the oven. Starts at $490 per night.Photo: Fernando MarroquinSoho House CDMXWhile there is obviously no shortage of high-end hotels for elite globetrotters in this capital city, Soho House CDMX—which opened in late 2023 in Colonia Juárez—offers SH members a familiar stay. The first of this exclusive members-only club to open in Latin America, Soho House CDMX has taken over a historic private residence—a structure that reflects Baroque and French influences—and offers a familiar premium experience with the upscale design aesthetic, site-specific artwork, and high-end amenities members have come to expect—whether they’re in London, New York, or Mexico City. Standout elements of this house include an open-air swimming pool, a screening room showing new and classic movies, a tequila bar, and an underground vinyl listening room. Annual membership starts at $2,400.The back garden of the Metropolitan Cathedral, Plaza de la Constitucion, near the Zócalo Central Hotel.
