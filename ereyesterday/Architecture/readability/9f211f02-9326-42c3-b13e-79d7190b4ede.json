  "text": "The Riviera Maya is full of sparkling-white sand beaches, thriving nightlife, Mexican fusion restaurants…and all the best Tulum hotels and resorts, including an editor-approved jungle oasis and a White Lotus-esque spot where suites adjoin their own private pools. Each of these places combines modern amenities with proximity to pristine beachscapes and plenty of wellness opportunities—if sunrise yoga, bee venom facials, and midnight massages are your speed.Many of these places are located in the Zona Hotelera (or Hotel Zone) in the city, which is naturally home to several popular beach clubs made for dancing the night away. But there are more down-to-earth opportunities on your vacation if you stay closer to Playa Paraiso and Playa Ruínas, or want to take in the quieter jungle side of Tulum, which tends to be more focused on relaxation.While Quintana Roo, a Mexican state on the Yucatán Peninsula, is made for sprawling out along the Caribbean Sea for a romantic getaway, visits to archaeological sites such as Coba, plenty of options to explore local wellness therapies, and day trips for a dip in the crystal-clear lagoons are also pretty accessible. These Tulum hotspots are also under two hours from Cancun, and a 25-minute drive from Akumal. Just one word of advice? Make sure to request a late check-out so you don’t feel rushed when you inevitably decide to take one last trip to the plunge pool.Perks: Room service, 24-hour airport shuttle, breakfast included, poolside barStaying at Our Habitas, an AD-approved oasis built into the land and engulfed by the jungle, feels like you’re being hugged by nature. Associate visuals editor Shani Kravetz calls it a “jungle sanctuary” where “vegetation [is] artfully incorporated into floors and ceilings.”Made up of 32 luxury canvas tents, everything is connected by paths shaded in greenery. Each room also comes decked out with a king-size bed, air conditioning, and plenty of textured furnishings (from kilim rugs to coastal, wooden furniture) to enhance the coziness of your lodgings. Book one of the beachfront suites for waking up to the most premium seaside views, and be aware that showers are outdoors, as most are in this area, for the full “communing with nature” experience. Don’t expect to get bored here as there’s a stacked itinerary for guests. Between sunrise yoga, market visits, DJ sessions, and bike rides, the vibe is very much “party until the wee hours” before waking up to an early yoga alarm. From $249 per night.Perks: Bicycle rentals, spa, pool, breakfast includedBreezy bed canopies, hammock lounges, woven ceilings, and a massive tropical pool will keep you rooted to the property, but a stay here also gets you access to the Nü restaurant and the private beaches of sister properties Encantada and NEST Tulum. The interiors are a love letter to local artisans, and the atmosphere is all about keeping things incredibly chill—there aren’t TVs or phones in the room. Walking onto the property feels like stepping out of a massage, which you should also get at the spa on-site. Next-level experiences like the sound healing sessions, bee venom facial, cacao wrap, and midnight couple’s massage to harness lunar energy should all be on your list. From $430 per night.Perks: Room service, beach access, breakfast included, bicycle rentalsThe private stretch of beach might be the headliner, but the 13 accommodations—Tuluk rooms built using a Mayan method of hand-laid stone, wood, and chukum (boiled tree bark) walls—are a very worthy opener. Natural textures such as driftwood and thatch are dotted through the other spaces, and you’ll spot more than a few hand-carved pieces from local artists. NEST is a great hub for day trips: an afternoon swimming with turtles, a sunset cruise on the Caribbean, snorkeling crystal-water caves, or visiting the Tulum ruins. From $423 per night.Perks: In-room breakfast, snorkeling access, airport transportation, full-service spaA 20-minute drive from Tulum town, Encantada bridges the jungle and the sea on a quiet patch of the Yucatán Peninsula. Each of the eight suites is outfitted in rattan furniture, hanging beds, woven textiles and macrame from local artisans, and driftwood details. The private terraces set the scene for a picture-perfect breakfast among the birds. There isn’t a pool on-site, but the beach is steps away, and guests can bask poolside at the nearby Radhoo Tulum. If you’re staying longer than a weekend, look into the five-day culture lab workshops, which cover ceramics, painting, and photography lessons led by creatives in the community. From $902 per night.Perks: Beach access, pool, snorkeling access, conciergePala-style buildings house soaking tubs, terraces, elaborate rattan fans, and open-air bedrooms. The rooms are split—11 face the jungle, and 11 are situated on the beach for a “choose your own backdrop” situation—and there are three pools connected by sandy paths. Guests can learn about the surrounding landscape and its history, which involves cacao ceremonies at the spa and a look at the ancient Mayan farming techniques favored at the on-site restaurant, Nü. Should you book one of the elevated rooms, you won’t be disappointed by treetop views skimming the turquoise waters. Everything feels perfectly placed, especially the Mexican antiques dotted in the common areas. From $963 per night.Perks: Snack bar, airport transportation, yoga classes, welcome drinksLocated within the boundaries of the Sian Ka’an Biosphere—new developments are no longer allowed in the reserve—Casa Chablé is about as “remote” as you can get when it comes to this beach club destination. There are 10 rooms total: five suites with balconies in the Cara Principal, and five villas on the beach. Each room is a lesson in local art, where white-washed walls set the scene for ceramics and textiles. Guests are treated to a full-on immersion with nature, there aren’t any beach clubs or bar scenes to distract from the sunrises, ocean dips, and wildlife. From $997 per night.Perks: Breakfast included, private beach access, yoga classes, bicycle rentalsThere’s a three-night minimum for a stay at this chic beachside resort—but, honestly, that’s the minimum amount of time you’ll want to spend here. Steps from South Tulum Beach, this small boutique hotel encompasses eight, breezy suites decked out in luxury linens. The property was originally built by Austrian engineer, Carlos Schober, who finished construction when the only places to stay in Tulum were simple jungle cabanas. Olas honors that peace and quiet by presenting a space that feels more like walking into a friend’s home than a boutique hotel. Guests convene at the communal table at the center of the property for dinner and have the option of booking excursions of all kinds, such as boat tours through the nearby Sian Ka’an reserve. From $1,300 per night.The clear blue water of Cenote Dos Ojos isi ideal for swimming and snorkeling.Simon Dannhauer/Getty ImagesPerks: Sauna, yoga classes, scuba diving access, pet- friendlyIf you dream of your own White Lotus experience, book into the Muaré, where a temperature-controlled plunge pool accompanies every suite at this boho-leaning property. A neutral palette ties together all 26 rooms and common spaces are centered around a beautiful, jungle-lined communal pool. Muaré is located in La Veleta, which is mainly residential and feels miles away from the all-night parties of the coastal hotel zone.There are still plenty of beaches nearby though for sunbathing and cenotes for swimming (Gran Cenote, Dos Ojos, and Cenote Corazón should all be on your list). Be sure to pencil in some time for the healing centerm as it offers massages that incorporate traditional Mexican methods and ingredients. But you don’t have to be in the spa to feel like you’re taking in a big breath of fresh air. Against the jungle greenery, the hotel’s affinity for natural textures (linen, jute, stone, wood) reminds us that nature has a limitless range. From $420 per night.",
