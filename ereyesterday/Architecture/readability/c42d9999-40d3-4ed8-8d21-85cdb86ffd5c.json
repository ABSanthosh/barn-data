  "text": "Jessica Chastain’s New York apartment is up for grabs again, this time with a reduced price tag. The pre-war co-op is now up for grabs at $6.5 million; the actor previously listed the dwelling for $7.45 million in May 2024.Chastain’s four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bathroom apartment is located a block from Central Park—and it’s in the same building where legendary composer Leonard Bernstein once resided. It was there that the icon reportedly wrote the music for West Side Story. Chastain purchased the residence from composer and lyricist Adam Guettel in 2015 for $5.1 million. The Eyes of Tammy Faye star welcomed AD inside the abode in a 2017 home tour, where she shared that Guettel is one of her favorite composers.The roughly 3,200-square-foot pad was originally constructed in 1885. The unit is in the Osbourne, which is reportedly one of New York City’s first luxury apartment buildings. The sprawling abode retains its signature Victorian-era exteriors. Historic details include a Tiffany Studio–designed bay window with leaded glass transoms, restored mahogany wainscoting, intricate millwork, crown moldings, and oak parquet floors. Five wood-burning fireplaces are found throughout the space, with one uncovered in the primary bedroom during renovations.The Zero Dark Thirty star and her husband, Moncler executive Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, turned to designers Jesse Carrier and Mara Miller of AD100 firm Carrier and Company to update the home. The main bedroom is outfitted with Ralph Lauren furniture and wall coverings. Other amenities found in the expansive primary suite include mirrored closets and a copper soaking tub, which was inspired by the in-bedroom bathtubs at London’s Dean Street Townhouse restaurant. The home’s dining area features custom built-in window seating, and the adjacent eat-in kitchen boasts oak cabinetry, a custom island, luxury integrated appliances, and a rolling library ladder.Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.
