White structural supports outline the building on either side, while a variety of terraces cover the facades. According to Flordia-based architecture studio Behar Font \u0026 Partners, the tower's design was informed by the silhouette of a Tulip, the national flower of Turkey and home base of Okan Group. \"The 70-story ultra-modern skyscraper is an architectural gem and among the tallest buildings south of New York,\" said developer Okan Group. \"It is recognized for its fluted sculptured accents and crown.\" The building will contain a hotel, residences and officesThe tower will contain a 316-room Hilton hotel, 64,000 square feet (5,945 square metres) of office space, and 163 residences on its top floors. Amenities will include \"one the world's tallest rooftop pools\", located within the building's curved top, a wine lounge and a spa area. Interior renders show a palette dominated by white, with light oak cabinetry and stone countertops and floors. A palette of white walls, light wood furnishings and stone floors is pictured in interior renderings\"Okan Tower is the dramatic centrepiece of the Downtown Miami skyline,\" said the team. \"From here, the entire city seems to revolve around you.
