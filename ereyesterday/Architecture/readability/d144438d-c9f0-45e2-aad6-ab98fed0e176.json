  "text": "Sarıkaya enlisted Enis Karavil, one half of the Istanbul-based design studio Sanayi313, to realize her vision. “Serenay was specific about what she was looking for—maximalist and dramatic elements against a serene backdrop—and it completely aligned with our idea for the project,” says Karavil. “Her preference for open and flowing living spaces influenced the overall design.” By removing walls and false ceilings, he unified the space, revealing exceptionally tall rooms and structural columns that created a loft-like volume, which now opens out onto a light-filled sunken courtyard.Any person in the public eye will tell you that they need to compartmentalize life into what’s private and what’s shareable, and Serenay Sarıkaya’s home is designed to deliver in this respect. Connected by a striking spiral staircase, the upper level is her workspace, earmarked for fittings, meetings and collaboration with her team; downstairs is where the actor lets her hair down.“I wanted it to be my own space, my living area,” Sarıkaya explains of the latter. “When we were planning this part of the house, I told Enis, ‘I want my friends to come here, cook something in the kitchen, make music, and enjoy it like I do.’” As a result, this level was conceived as a multi- functional space anchored by a large, double-sided sofa, which is upholstered in a sassy leopard print. “I don’t know why, but I was obsessed with the idea of having everything else plain and only this couch as my signature piece—almost like an artwork in the middle of the house,” she says. “As soon as I get home, I find myself on it.”The actor’s search for a hero piece led to a bespoke double-sided couch in leopard print, which brings the open-plan space together. Sarıkaya wearing an Aya Muse dress and B.zero1 cuffs by Bvlgari. On one side of the couch is the bedroom, demarcated with floor-to-ceiling curtains serving as flexible space dividers instead of traditional walls. “This allowed us to enhance spatial and visual interconnectedness and, with the translucent fabric, create a sense of intrigue, perfectly capturing the film-noir atmosphere we wanted to achieve,” explains Karavil.A retro-futuristic kitchen in head-to-toe stainless steel holds court on the other side. “Serenay envisioned this space as a vibrant gathering place where she could entertain friends,” says the designer. “She also expressed a desire to have renowned chefs cooking for her guests, so we achieved the look and quality of a professional kitchen.” Contrasting elements such as leather-upholstered chairs, ashwood-clad walls, and a glossy black floor soften its raw, industrial appeal. Tipping a hat to Istanbul’s multicultural soul, antiques and vintage finds from markets around the world add yet another layer of sophistication.Bespoke stainless steel cabinetry creates the look, feel, and functionality of a professional kitchen. Paired with custom leather-upholstered chairs, the stainless steel kitchen is the heart of the home. “From my perspective, my house has a quiet elegance, a party vibe, and, at the same time, it feels like I’m in my safe zone,” says Sarıkaya. “I love it when friends come to visit for the first time and they say, ‘This is so Serenay!’”This story was originally published in AD Middle East’s October/November 2024 issue.",
