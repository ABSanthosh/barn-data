  "text": "Investment firm Yntegra Group has unveiled a floating padel court in Miami Harbor that was partially constructed using recycled steel from shipyards. Afloat offshore of Miami's Fisher Island, the padel ball court is partially made of recycled steel and operates engine and battery-free as part of Yntegra Group's \"commitment to innovation\". Yntegra Group has unveiled a floating padel court in the Miami Harbor\"As demand for ultra-luxury experiences soars, this sustainable, design-forward installation exemplifies Yntegra's commitment to innovation,\" said the team. \"The first-of-its-kind court features recycled steel from old shipyard materials, giving new life to maritime components. Its tranquil setting offers a serene escape for both physical activity and mental rejuvenation.\" The court is made with recycled steelThe padel court is comprised of a court, protective fencing, light posts and a thin strip that serves as a platform for observers. It measures 16 by 38 by 71 feet (5 x 11 x 21) and weighs 84 tonnes. As it is free of an engine or battery, it is moved into location by boat, and then anchored. \"Engine- and battery-free, the court reflects Yntegra's commitment to sustainability,\" said the team. The court will float in the Miami Harbor until next year, then it will be transported to the Rosewood Exuma hotel in the Bahamas, which is set to open in 2028. It will float in Miami Harbor until next yearFloating amenities have become more popular in recent years. In Manhattan, a team of designers and planners are testing on a floating swimming pool that will also filter water in the East River. Padel comes from Mexico and resembles tennis and pickleball, but has its own rules, techniques and international associations. Recently, Italian architect Fabio Novembre designed for playing the sport at Milan's CityLife development. The floating court debuted following Miami art week, a citywide event in early December that included Alcova Miami's second showing and a 3D-printed star installation by Carlos Betancourt and Alberto Latorre.
