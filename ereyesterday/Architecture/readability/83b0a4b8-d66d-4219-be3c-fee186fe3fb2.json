  "text": "Student Meadow by GORA reimagines riverside field in KnyagininoLocated along the Knyaginka River in Knyaginino, Russia, Student Meadow project by GORA (Gorshunov Stanislav) reimagines a former grazing and event field as a multi-functional public space. The design responds to the town’s demographic context, where approximately 20 percent of residents are university students, positioning education and student involvement at the core of the intervention. The site, formerly used for local football matches, community fairs, and the annual Nightingale Melodies festival, had become largely underutilized outside of festival periods and grazing seasons. GORA’s approach preserves the meadow’s open, natural character while introducing a flexible program that adapts to seasonal and daily changes in use.all images by Margarita SesorovaStudent-Led open space for art, learning, and community eventsGORA’s architectural team, led by Gorshunov Stanislav, organizes the landscape into distinct zones, with each section managed and curated by a specific academic institute from Knyagininsky University. This framework encourages active student participation in the ongoing development, programming, and maintenance of the space. During the day, the meadow functions as an open-air classroom and a setting for informal gatherings. At night, it becomes a platform for light installations, performances, and community events, extending the area’s usability into evening hours. A key architectural feature within the site is the pavilion known as the ‘Tower.’ Designed for research and observation, the Tower serves as a space for stargazing, lectures, seminars, and workshops. Its placement and form integrate with the meadow’s topography while supporting a variety of educational and cultural activities.Student Meadow was selected as the winning proposal in the 2021 Small Towns and Historical Settlements Competition. The project reflects a broader strategy of using landscape and architecture to activate underused urban areas, with a particular focus on community engagement and the educational potential of public space.Student Meadow by GORA reimagines a riverside field in Knyaginino as a multi-functional public spacethe project sits along the Knyaginka River, responding to the town’s strong student populationformerly a site for football matches and fairs, the meadow’s open character has been preservedthe Tower pavilion functions as a space for observation, lectures, and workshopsthe Tower integrates into the natural topography of the siteeach section of the meadow is managed by different academic institutes from Knyagininsky University",
