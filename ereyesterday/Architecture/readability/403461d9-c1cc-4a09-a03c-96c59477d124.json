  "text": "david altrath casts his lens on Lanzarote’s LandmarksThrough the lens of photographer David Altrath, the works of the Spanish artist César Manrique come alive, showcasing how his approach contributed to the formation and preservation of Lanzarote’s cultural and natural identity. Altrath’s frames take viewers on a journey through four iconic landmarks: Mirador del Río, Jameos del Agua, Casa del Volcán, and Casa Omar Sharif. Each image reflects Manrique’s belief in a symbiotic relationship between humans and the natural environment, immortalizing his influence on Lanzarote’s volcanic terrain.all images by David AltrathCésar Manrique’s Legacy of Reverence for the Volcanic LandscapeDavid Altrath’s series honors César Manrique’s legacy, capturing his dedication to creating harmony between humans and their surroundings. Born in 1919, César Manrique was a sculptor, architect, and environmentalist whose creations embody a commitment to sustainability and a deep respect for Lanzarote’s landscape. His philosophy of merging modernist design with traditional craftsmanship transformed the island into a living canvas, where art aims to preserve the natural world.At Mirador del Río, located atop the Famara cliffs, Manrique collaborated with architect Eduardo Cáceres and artist Jesús Soto to create a breathtaking viewpoint over the Chinijo Archipelago. Completed in 1973, the structure is carved into the rock, with its flowing organic forms framing views of nearby islands La Graciosa and Montaña Clara. Sculptural elements and stone facades amplify the natural beauty of the site, reflecting Manrique’s belief in architecture as a harmonious extension of the environment.the works of César Manrique contributed to the formation and preservation of Lanzarote’s identityhumans coexist with delicate ecosystemsJameos del Agua transforms a volcanic cave into an immersive cultural experience. Enhancing the natural features of the lava tube, Manrique introduced gentle design elements to complement its raw characteristics, creating a space where art and nature coexist. Illuminated pools, volcanic rock formations, and sublte interventions invite visitors to reflect on Lanzarote’s unique geology.Casa del Volcán, Manrique’s personal home and creative studio, embodies lava tunnels and volcanic formations into its structure. It’s a living example of how humans can coexist with delicate ecosystems, turning the raw beauty of the volcanic landscape into functional spaces. Altrath’s photography captures this fusion, highlighting Manrique’s vision that prioritizes sustainability while celebrating the natural environment.Originally designed for actor Omar Sharif, Casa Omar Sharif, also known as LagOmar, is carved into volcanic rock, with fluid lines and natural textures echoing the rugged terrain. Using light and shadow to emphasize its organic forms, the home feels like a natural part of its surroundings. It blends so effortlessly with the landscape that it’s hard to tell where the architecture ends and nature begins.Altrath’s frames take viewers on a journey through four iconic landmarkseach image reflects Manrique’s belief in a symbiotic relationship between humans and the natural environmentCésar Manrique’s philosophy transformed the island into a living canvasreflecting Manrique’s belief in architecture as a harmonious extension of the environment",
