  "text": "Architecture studio Urko Sánchez Architects has created a series of classrooms for a school in Nairobi, Kenya, which are wrapped in wooden logs to blend into their forested surroundings. Situated in clearings within the forest, the development by Urko Sánchez Architects contains a series of temporary classrooms designed as a \"small village\" for the existing Nairobi Waldorf School. Urko Sánchez Architects has added a series of classrooms to a school in Nairobi\"The main concept was to create a village for children hidden in the forest, fostering a strong connection with nature,\" the studio told Dezeen. \"The project prioritised cost-effective and reusable materials like wood, soil, and forest leaves to minimise environmental impact,\" it added. \"Classrooms were dispersed in forest clearings to preserve native trees and avoid disruption.\" Reusable materials were used to construct the classroomsThe 3,1620-square-metre project comprises several classrooms topped with overhanging wooden roofs, informed by the region's vernacular architecture. Among them is an existing, lofty structure, repurposed to accommodate additional classrooms and services, supported by a framework of tall logs. The structures are topped with overhanging roofsUrko Sánchez Architects designed the structures for a 10-year lifespan because of a lease on the site. This led it to use lightweight, cost-effective and reclaimed materials that could be repurposed in the future. This included the use of wooden logs of various heights, which wrap around the base of each classroom, and reclaimed roof tiles, which were repurposed and used to create paths around the site. Polycarbonate sheets encase some of the teaching spaces, creating transparent walls that also help draw light into their interiors. In a bid to offer both a natural aesthetic and promote biodiversity on the site, portions of the polycarbonate walls are filled with layers of reclaimed soil and forest leaves that act as \"living walls\". Polycarbonate panels were used for some of the walls\"The design addressed the temporary 10-year lease by prioritising cost-effective and quick construction methods,\" the studio said. \"Recycled materials were creatively repurposed, emphasising sustainability and collaboration,\" it added. \"Children, parents, and teachers participated in the soil filling process, fostering a sense of community.\" Sheltered corridors wind around the classrooms to provide access to the interiors, which offer children well-lit workspaces finished with earthy tones thanks to the use of natural materials. Natural materials create earthy tones within the classroomsUrko Sánchez Architects works out of studios in Madrid and Nairobi. Previous projects by the studio include a concrete compound in Djibouti designed as a home for vulnerable children. Other schools recently featured on Dezeen include an elementary school in northeast Vancouver built from mass timber and a cuboidal primary school in rural Austria designed as a \"village within the village\".
