Developments in this space included the completion of long-awaited projects, groundbreakings, and renovations. Other notable stories featured first-of-its-kind and record-breaking projects that could signal what the future of sports architecture could look like. Greener approaches to stadium design, along with a prioritization to integrate mixed-use schemes that, aside from sports, include public space, greater accessibility offerings, and even housing were common across projects this year. As part of Archinect's 2024 Year In Review, take a look at some of the best sports architecture and stadium projects in our news this year. Previously on Archinect: New photos of Populous' modular Cricket World Cup stadium ahead of June gamesPopulous designs modular Cricket World Cup stadium on Long Island In January, Populous released designs for a modular, 34,000-seat cricket stadium for the Men's T20 World Cup, which occurred this past June. Located in Nassau County, Long Island, the facility was built with reused portions of the grandstand structures made for the Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix last November. It also features a dropped-in pitch, which was first created in Australia and then cultivated in Florida. The stadium hosted nine events over a two week span.

Called the Al Davis Memorial Torch, the project was made in tribute to the former Raiders owner and coach. It was developed by MANICA Architecture and fabrication firm Dimensional Innovations (DI). A slew of other entities contributed design services to the project, including Purdue University and HNTB. The memorial stands at 93 feet and features 1,148 aluminum panels, which were robotically painted in silver and supported by 226 individual 3D printed carbon fiber blocks.

Originally constructed in 1971, the facility had been vacant since 2018. The firm's mission was to upgrade the building's energy efficiency and accessibility ratings, while preserving its aesthetic and spatial qualities. Work included the installation of acoustic wood panels, the addition of new seating and a state-of-the-art multisport floor for athletes, LED conversion of lighting fixtures, and new HVAC systems.

The $1.8 billion stadium stands out through a 38,375-square-foot wraparound LED Halo Board, the largest for indoor arenas worldwide, and a special 4,700-seat section of 51 uninterrupted rows called The Wall. It also features a distinctive interwoven red diagrid steel frame with diamond-shaped PTFE/ETFE panels that resemble a ball moving through a net. Image: PopulousDesigns of world's largest soccer stadium with distinct tented roof in Morocco unveiled Renderings of what will be the largest soccer stadium in the world were released in August. Designed by Oualalou + Choi and Populous, the 115,000-seat Grand Stade Hassan II in Morocco would be delivered in time for the 2030 FIFA World Cup. The stadium's design references a traditional Moroccan social gathering known as a moussem, which is reflected through its grand tented roof.

The project set out to improve accessibility, the fan experience, wayfinding, operational efficiency, and the team facilities. Perimeter concessions areas were reconfigured and a series of new atrium volumes were installed. Additionally, more ADA-compliant seating, along with ADA platform lifts, were added. This project is expected to add at least 25 years to the stadium's lifespan. Image courtesy HOKHOK debuts modular vertiport design for future flying car race series HOK unveiled designs for a vertiport structure for what will be the world's first flying car racing series. Called Skydeck, the vertiport is for Airspeeder, an electric flying vehicle racing series based in London. The structure will be able to accommodate 10 teams with up to 20 flying cars. The design is modular and features solar-powered infrastructure, in addition to virtual tracks.

The 25,000-seat stadium will be all-electric and will be built using local materials. The project will also anchor a larger mixed-use redevelopment plan that includes public space, affordable housing, a hotel, and a public school. Construction of the stadium is expected to be completed for the 2027 season.

The structure was built and designed by real estate investment venture Yntegra Group. Most of the court was built with recycled steel and it can be operated without battery or an engine. The structure will continue to float in Miami until May 2025 before being relocated to the Bahamas to spread knowledge of the game there.

The project set out to improve accessibility, the fan experience, wayfinding, operational efficiency, and the team facilities. Perimeter concessions areas were reconfigured and a series of new atrium volumes were installed. Additionally, more ADA-compliant seating, along with ADA platform lifts, were added. This project is expected to add at least 25 years to the stadium\u0026#39;s lifespan.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/94/94611575b9775af3f0d889dc0b993b9a.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=1028\" data-size=\"1028x578\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/94/94611575b9775af3f0d889dc0b993b9a.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\" srcset=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/94/94611575b9775af3f0d889dc0b993b9a.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514 1x,https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/94/94611575b9775af3f0d889dc0b993b9a.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\u0026amp;dpr=2 2x, https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/94/94611575b9775af3f0d889dc0b993b9a.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\u0026amp;dpr=3 3x\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eImage courtesy HOK\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://archinect.com/news/article/150449056/hok-debuts-modular-vertiport-design-for-future-flying-car-race-series\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOK debuts modular vertiport design for future flying car race series\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHOK unveiled designs for a vertiport structure for what will be the world\u0026#39;s first flying car racing series.
