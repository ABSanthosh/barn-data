Today’s stadiums, arenas, and training centers are being reimagined as inclusive, multifunctional spaces that serve both athletes and the broader community. Though once positioned as isolated urban monuments, such structures are now integrated parts of the urban spaces, designed to foster connection, promote well-being, and activate public life. Whether through adaptive reuse, sustainable materials, or open-access design, they reflect a growing commitment to architecture that is both socially responsive and environmentally conscious. These winning projects from the 13th A+Awards present highlights how sports architecture can be a catalyst for urban regeneration, cultural identity, and civic pride. From Budapest’s National Athletics Center to Academia Atlas in Mexico, these spaces are designed not just for spectatorship but for participation. OPEN ARENA | National Athletics Center By NAPUR Architect, Budapest, Hungary Popular Choice Winner, Stadium and Arena and Popular Choice Winner, Sustainable Sports and Recreation Building, 13th Architizer A+Awards Commissioned by the Hungarian State, the National Athletics Center is the flagship project of the Budapest Southern City Gate development. Designed by NAPUR Architect Ltd., the stadium and surrounding park were built on the former Vituki industrial site. The project includes a pedestrian and bicycle bridge to North Csepel and a new Athletics Training Center. The stadium’s design pays homage to athletics, “the queen of sports,” with a white crown-like structure. According to its designers, this symbolic form aims to evoke classical ideals of strength and grace, while its clean geometry and open layout reflect modern values of accessibility and openness. As a multifunctional civic space, the center not only hosts international competitions but also serves as a public park and gathering place, anchoring the district’s transformation into a vibrant urban hub. SAP Garden By 3XN, Munich, Germany Jury Winner, Stadiums and Arenas, 13th Architizer A+Awards SAP Garden, designed by 3XN, is a sports arena located next to Munich’s Olympic Stadium. Built on the site of the former Olympic Velodrome, it hosts EHC Red Bull Munich and Bayern Munich basketball teams. The arena accommodates up to 11,500 spectators and includes three additional ice rinks, VIP lounges, retail, restaurants, and a rooftop terrace. Designed as a year-round destination, it remains active even on non-game days, offering public access and training facilities. Shaoxing University Stormproof Playground By UAD (Zhejiang University), Shaoxing, China Popular Choice Winner, Gyms and Recreation Centers, 13th Architizer A+Awards Located in the northwest corner of Shaoxing University, this stormproof playground addresses the challenge of limited space in a dense urban setting. The design preserves the original track and field while introducing new activity zones that serve both the university and surrounding neighborhoods. The project emphasizes resilience and community integration, offering a multifunctional sports space that enhances student life and urban interaction. It reflects a thoughtful approach to urban renewal, blending educational infrastructure with public utility in a compact footprint. Academia Atlas By Sordo Madaleno, Zapopan, Mexico Jury, Gyms and Recreation Centers, 13th Architizer A+Awards Academia Atlas is a modern training and development center for Atlas FC, one of Mexico’s oldest football clubs. Designed by Sordo Madaleno, the facility spans seven hectares and includes six professional fields, clubhouses, and sport science labs. It supports youth development, especially for underprivileged players, and uses local materials and traditional techniques. The modular design allows for future expansion, while open-air corridors and shaded courtyards foster a campus-like atmosphere. The architecture encourages interaction and movement, creating a vibrant environment where sport, education, and community converge. More than a training ground, Academia Atlas is a social engine, nurturing talent, fostering inclusion and celebrating the cultural significance of football in Mexico. təməsew̓txʷ Aquatic and Community Centre hcma architecture + design, New Westminster, Canada Jury Winner, Sustainable Sports and Recreation Building, 13th Architizer A+Awards This aquatic and community centre is a civic hub designed to foster wellness, inclusivity and environmental stewardship. Built on the site of the former Glenbrook Ravine headwaters, the project reconnects the landscape through a rain garden and public green space. Its dramatic black roof and stepped elevation blend into the terrain, creating a human-scaled, welcoming environment. Prioritizing community needs over colonial planning grids, the centre offers spaces for all ages and abilities, emphasizing connection, recreation and healing. Allan Border Oval Pavilion By Archer Office, Mosman, Australia Popular Choice Winner, Architecture +Community, 13th Architizer A+Awards The Allan Border Oval Pavilion is a hybrid sports and community facility that merges the functions of a grandstand and clubhouse into a single, cohesive structure. Designed by Archer Office, the pavilion honors the site’s heritage with a pitched roof referencing earlier structures, while meeting modern demands for openness and accessibility. A central column supports the roof like an umbrella, creating a sheltered communal space beneath. Sustainable design choices include the reuse of materials from the previous pavilion, such as recycled concrete and timber. The winners of the 13th Architizer A+Awards have been announced!
