Feireiss-Commerell, whose advocacy with Helga Retzer led to the museum’s creation in 1980, was also active in other pursuits within architecture, including serving as the Commissioner for the Dutch Pavilion at the Venice Architecture Biennale twice. The Aedes Architecture Forum has staged over 500 exhibitions since its founding. \"Their respective institutions only sporadically touched upon the topic of the built environment,\" the museum said in 2020. \"In founding Aedes, both women were merely following their intuition that engaging in a discussion of architecture and urban space as important facets of everyday life with a broader public was a worthwhile endeavour: an open dialogue that would reflect changing societal conditions independent of questions of style and, most importantly, beyond expert discourses.\"",
