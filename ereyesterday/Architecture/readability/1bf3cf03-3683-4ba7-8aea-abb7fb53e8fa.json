  "text": "a workspace focused on Innovation and SustainabilityBaumschlager Eberle Architekten has completed the new Huy Hoang Lock Factory, located in the Quang Minh Industrial Zone in northern Vietnam. The facility, recognized by its rhythmic facade of concrete fins, covers three hectares and sits twenty kilometers from the capital, Hanoi. The factory complex includes three buildings: two used for manufacturing with German technology, and a third dedicated to Italian manufacturing technology. This final building is also connected to a multi-purpose structure at the front.The third factory was envisioned as a symbol of Huy Hoang’s forty years of innovation and steady growth. This vision was realized not only through achieving LEED Gold certification during the design phase but also maintaining Gold LEED standards in its operations. The building’s structure follows a core and shell design, enabling large, open spaces within, fostering flexibility and functionality.Designed for Vietnam’s Tropical ClimateGiven Vietnam’s tropical monsoon climate, which features hot summers, heavy rainfall, and cold winters, the team at Baumschlager Eberle Architekten design the factory’s facade system to address the region’s environmental challenges. The concrete louver system varies in density and angle across the building’s different elevations to optimize solar gain, natural ventilation, and protection from weather. On the southern and southeastern sides, the louvers open up to 90 degrees to capture sunlight and airflow. The northern facade, facing cold winter winds, uses denser louvers with smaller openings. On the western side, where thermal radiation from the sun is most intense, the louvers are angled sharply and applied with the highest density to reduce heat gain.Baumschlager Eberle Architekten completes Huy Hoang Lock Factory in Vietnama welcoming campus by Baumschlager Eberle ArchitektenBaumschlager Eberle Architekten designs the Vietnam factory as an open campus, where public space plays a key role in the overall layout. The central operating building includes exhibition spaces, training areas, and offices. Visitors are welcomed into a spacious main hall, designed as a museum showcasing Huy Hoang’s history and products. Here, they can engage with artifacts and learn about the company’s development.The factory complex also features a restaurant and canteen that serves both staff and visitors, offering a shared space for social interaction. Natural light filters into this area through the carefully designed facade system, enhancing the atmosphere for dining and relaxation.
