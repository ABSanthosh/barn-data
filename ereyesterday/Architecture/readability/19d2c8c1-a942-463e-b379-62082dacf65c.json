  "text": "from imperial spa to multifunctional concert hallPetr Hájek ARCHITEKTI has reimagined the atrium of the Imperial Spa in Karlovy Vary, the Czech Republic, as a multifunctional concert hall. Equipped with adaptable acoustics and cutting-edge scenic technology, the new venue breathes new life into the 19th-century architectural landmark. Inspired by the building’s original mechanism for processing and distributing peat, the hall functions as a ‘musical transformer,’ capable of adjusting its spatial and acoustic properties to suit various events — from concerts and dance performances to conferences and film screenings.The hall’s adaptability is its defining feature. A retractable orchestral shell directs sound towards the audience, while rotating triangular panels above the stage can reflect, absorb, scatter, or direct sound energy. Wooden panels embedded in a steel framework on the orchestra floor serve as resonators, enhancing the harmony between space and performance.all images courtesy of Petr Hájek ARCHITEKTIPetr Hájek ARCHITEKTI integrates ‘musical transformers’The historic Imperial Spa, completed in 1895, was remarkable in its time for both its architecture and spa technologies. The building featured an advanced system for processing and distributing peat, which allowed up to 2,000 guests per day to utilize its 100 baths. At the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, it was used only occasionally for cultural events and gradually fell into disrepair. A meaningful purpose was sought to justify the costly reconstruction, with the situation persisting even during the preparation phase for the building works. Eventually, the investor decided to transform the Imperial Spa into a cultural institution, with a concert and multifunctional hall as its central feature.This hall was located in the structure’s core, within the atrium, which had previously functioned as a utilitarian machine room with the peat conveyor. The historical ‘peat machine’ became the inspiration for Petr Hájek ARCHITEKTI’s design. Since the restoration of spa operations was not planned and only a few cast-iron columns from the original structure had been preserved, there was an opportunity to introduce a new ‘machine’.Petr Hájek ARCHITEKTI reimagines the atrium of the architectural landmarkadaptable acoustics and cutting-edge scenic technologyThe Czech architects also compare the hall to a Swiss army knife, offering a variety of functions, equipped with elements that adjust reverberation time, as well as the direction and intensity of sound energy. The orchestral shell features a retractable screen that reflects sound towards the audience, while rotating triangular panels above the stage can reflect, absorb, scatter, or direct sound. Wooden panels on a steel framework in the orchestra’s floor serve as resonators, harmonizing with the musicians’ instruments.Further, a heavy blackout curtain allows the space to be completely darkened and acoustically dampened. All scenic and acoustic technologies are integrated into the hall’s structure, while ventilation and fire safety systems are housed in a block above the main staircase roof. The construction of the hall was challenging, the architects say, as large structural components could not be transported into the atrium. Thus, all parts had to be assembled from smaller elements transported through an opening in the roof.from imperial spa to multifunctional concert hallinspired by the building’s original mechanism for processing and distributing peat",
