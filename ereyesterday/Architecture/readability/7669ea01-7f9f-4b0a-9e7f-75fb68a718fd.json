  "text": "American architecture studio Gensler has revealed designs for an office-to-residential conversion of the former Pfizer headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, which will hold 1,600 apartments across two towers. Located across 219 and 229 East 42nd Street in East Midtown, the project encompasses expanding and converting a 33-storey tiered tower and an adjoining ten-storey tower into a mixed-use development. Gensler has unveiled a rendering of a large office-to-residential conversion in Midtown ManhattanThe rendering shows the complex's exterior with its stepped 33-storey at the front and the smaller tower tucked behind it. According to Gensler, the converted development will contain around 1,600 apartment units, 25 per cent of which will be affordable, and amenities such as a rooftop pool and fitness centre. \"Conversions offer the promise of helping to transform more areas that were historically centralized business districts into vibrant, 24/7 neighborhoods,\" said Gensler principal Robert Fuller. \"Although there has been a big focus on conversions in recent years, it really is not a new concept.\" \"New York City has a long history of repurposing outdated buildings to create new housing. We envision a future where office conversions in Midtown and the Financial District hold a similarly cherished place in the history of the city.\" Gensler will act as design architect, architect of record and interior architect on the project, while Metro Loft Development LLC and David Werner Real Estate Investments are the project owner and developers, respectively. The two buildings were previously home to Pfzier's New York headquarters before the pharmaceutical brand moved across the city into The Spiral skyscraper designed by BIG, in 2o23. The project is slated 2027 completion. Office building conversions are growing in popularity across the United States as cities grapple with underused and vacant spaces. The city of Chicago recently announced initiatives that incentivise developers to convert downtown office buildings into affordable housing, while New York City announced similar programming in 2023. Elsewhere in the city, an art deco office skyscraper was converted into residential use in the Financial District by Developer Harry Macklowe of Macklowe Properties. Other work recently completed by Gensler includes the tallest tower in Austin and a sprawling campus for the new Walmart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas.
