Following a rigorous jury selection process, this year’s finalists have been selected — and now, it’s up to the global design community to decide which products deserve to take home the coveted Popular Choice Awards. Vote Now Spanning more than 30 unique categories, the A+Product Awards honors outstanding architectural products, materials, furniture, lighting and systems that are transforming the way we design and build. From high-performance façade systems to sculptural light fixtures and breakthrough sustainable materials, this year’s finalists showcase the leading edge of product design. Public voting is open now through May 16, 2025, and everyone is invited to participate — architects, designers, engineers, clients, and anyone passionate about design innovation. You may vote once per category per day, and only a quick login is required to take part. Select A+Product Awards Finalists: Elora by Davis Furniture (left); V2 Swing Door by LaCantina Doors (top right); Arcade by Turf Design (bottom right). Judging Criteria: What to Consider Before you vote, take a moment to reflect on the key factors that the expert jury used to select this year’s finalists. These same criteria can guide your decisions as you help choose the Popular Choice Winners: Aesthetics: Consider the product’s design language, materials and detailing, as well as how well it complements its architectural context. While visual appeal is crucial in decorative categories, it plays a secondary role in more technical categories. Performance: Evaluate how effectively the product achieves its intended function. This may include material innovation, durability, adaptability or technical integration. Each product was designed to meet real-world architectural needs. Impact: Think about the broader implications of the product — does it push the boundaries of current practices? Does it contribute to sustainability, equity or innovation in construction? Impact can be immediate or long-term, technical or societal. You can view the complete judging criteria here. This year’s Finalists are divided into two major groups: Best in Product Type: These categories honor top-tier products within specific verticals — including façade systems, contract furniture, architectural lighting, doors and windows, kitchen and bath fixtures, appliances and more. Best of the Year: These awards recognize cross-category excellence, celebrating products that lead in innovation, sustainable design, health and wellness, positive impact and beyond. Cast My Votes Select A+Product Awards Finalists: Vista TL by Euro-Wall (top left); Novawood Ayous by Novawood (bottom left); Clear Coil Collection by LightArt (right). Why Your Vote Matters By voting in the A+Product Awards, you’re doing more than supporting your favorite products and brands — you’re helping to set the global standard for excellence in architecture and interiors. Winners of the Popular Choice Awards will be featured along side Jury Winners in the A+Products List, Architizer’s annual publication highlighting the most impactful product brands worldwide. This definitive directory is used by thousands of specifying architects and designers to find trusted manufacturers for their most ambitious projects. See last year’s A+Product List here. In addition, winners gain international exposure across Architizer’s global media network, a custom-designed A+Product Awards trophy, and a place in the Official Winners’ Gallery — a permanent digital showcase viewed by a global audience each year. Your vote helps elevate deserving brands and brings visibility to the next generation of product innovators.
