  "text": "How do you protect and honor your grandparents’ home, while also updating it for the way we live now? That was the question that Marina Hernández and Rafael Calero, who are a couple both in life and professionally (as the founders of Che.studio), asked themselves.“When we started this project, we knew we had a responsibility to the place and to its history. Marina’s grandparents built it with their own hands, and it holds cherished memories for the whole family. We treated it with enormous respect. That deep connection transforms every corner of it into a reflection of our history. The challenge of bringing this space to life was not easy, but at the same time, we felt that we were taking on the role of guardians of a family legacy that we wanted to continue,” explain the architects.The family home is located in the countryside of the province of Cáceres, in the heart of Spain’s Extremadura region. The most important goals were to maintain the original essence of the property and ensure that the surrounding landscape remained intact. “The biggest challenge was to design with a respect for what already existed, both the natural elements and manmade ones,” says Hernández. This means the holm oaks, the topography, and the granite, as well as the buildings constructed by my grandparents. “They have a strong sentimental value for us. From the beginning, we knew that we wanted to intervene as little as possible,” she continues.The property has approximately 700 square feet of interior space and a 323-square-foot terrace. In the same spirit of conserving what existed, they decided to build using local raw materials, traditional methods, and custom elements they designed and made themselves—they worked almost exclusively with materials from the area. Hernández explains that the stone comes from the site itself, and the interior walls were whitewashed with natural lime, a traditional technique used in the Extremadura region. The floor is polished cement and the wood—chestnut and pine—comes from a nearby sawmill. The metalwork was painted in a shade of green “inspired by the dry leaves of the holm oak, a color that connects the house directly with the landscape,” Hernández says.“The metal window frames that we designed have a unique opening system while the wooden border that surrounds them adds some warmth,” says Che.studio. They also incorporated recycled elements into the design including window frames: “They are old pieces that have been reused, and that have great meaning to us.” A number of the pieces were given to them by neighbors, and the doors and windows were salvaged from houses in the village. “My grandmother and then my mother kept them with plans to use them in the future. Each one has its own story, and we like to think that these elements have had several lives. They were once parts of other houses and other eras,” explains Hernández.“The windows, with their iron and pine frames, were designed to open onto the landscape, creating a visual connection with the nature that surrounds us. We always say that we wanted to feel immersed in the environment.” The same care was taken with new elements too even down to the plates around sockets and switches and the leather handles created for the living room windows. All were designed and manufactured by the studio. However, when they needed specialized outside help to bring some of their other ideas to life, it wasn’t always easy to find it.“The exterior staircase and iron railings, made from steel rods, were very carefully crafted. We wanted them to be visually light, almost imperceptible, and as delicate as possible,” says Che.studio about the installation that connects the porch to the terrain below it. One of the most complex parts of construction, Hernández notes, was harnessing the traditional building methods. “It’s become difficult to find professionals who have mastered them and use the necessary care,” she says, which makes sense in our increasingly industrialized construction industry. Fortunately, during the process, Studio.che met Luismi (a builder) and Rubén (a carpenter) who helped them complete the project. “There was total understanding from the outset, and it was an enriching process for everyone,” the pair recalls.“This house is not just a physical space, it’s also a refuge where we seek peace and opportunities for creativity. It’s a sanctuary that allows us to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of everyday life and return to the essentials.” Thanks to the work of these artisans and the young couple’s renovation, which is respectful of the home’s history, this small refuge has been given a warm and modern second life. “It’s a peaceful place, designed for gathering,” says the couple, who reflect on the project’s origins: the intention of creating a space for family and friends to come together surrounded by nature. “We wanted both its interior and exterior areas to be used—for there to always be a visual and emotional connection between the house and its surroundings.”“The natural light that pours into the kitchen with its wooden ceiling gives the room a warm glow and a comfortable feel,” the architects say. The comment they hear most often from their visitors, now that the project is completed? That they “feel at home.” Safe to say, their aforementioned intention was fulfilled. “It’s moving for us when we hear it, because that’s exactly what we wanted to create: a welcoming, simple, and authentic place.”This home tour was first published by AD Spain. It was translated by John Newton.“The reused windows and doors were given to us by neighbors who wanted to see them live on in a new space, which for us reflects a commitment to sustainability while also creating an atmosphere that is steeped in history.” The sage green of dry oak leaves is replicated in the painted frame of the large window in the living room. The architects, a couple in their 30s who met while studying for their degrees, have retained the character of the original home.
