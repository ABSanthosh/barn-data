  "text": "Archinect kicked off 2025 by asking a bunch of folks (ranging from the AIA’s Chief Economist and the CEO of the American Society of Landscape Architects, to architects and academics like Martha Lewis or Judith Sheine) to share their predictions and insights for the year ahead. In Donna Sink’s opinion, \"Peggy Deamer's and Bryan Lee's are the best. A couple-few are very dinosaurian\". Plus with the help of Enoch Sears, Niall Patrick Walsh reviewed five common ways architects charge fees for design services and offered up five tips for structuring fees. gwharton added \"Another important aspect of this is the importance of good operational systems and management to make sure you can deliver profitably…You may have plenty of fee and a clear scope, but if your process is so ineffective that you can't move the project forward, complete phases, and deliver value consistently and on time, then you are still going to lose money.\" News Drew Haley Smith, a 2023 B.A. graduate of Auburn University completed her licensure process within a year (summer of 2024) making her the youngest licensed female architect in the United States. For those curious about her path to licensure roberto2 posted a link wherein she talks about completing \"the Architectural Experience Program (AXP…and the Architecture Registration Examination (ARE)\" and how \"If there is a secret, it would probably be creating a day-by-day schedule to keep myself accountable.\" Josh Niland questioned whether the quality of construction drawings is getting worse at a critical time? archanonymous’s answer resonated with a lot of folks, \"I'm not saying it is impossible to produce a cohesive and coordinated set of drawings within the current paradigm of contemporary practice, but nearly everything is working against it\". Similarly reallynotmyname argued \"Software and drawing quality are just symptoms. The underlying problem in the USA is the failure of architectural education and the poor economics of architectural practice.\" Still some folks pointed the finger at Revit which OddArchitect countered \"Even with Revit, redlines, QC, and mentorship is still needed…Revit is just a tool. Just like with a pencil, or CAD, it's about the knowledge of user that creates a good design and set of CD's.\" Will Galloway was impressed with the 6 winning pavilions for the Warming Huts 2025 competition \"Nice to see that it isn't all self-referential architectural objects…The PomPom looks amazing, if they can pull it off.\" Pom Pom by Haoran Deng and Bicen SongFrida Escobedo chatted with Robin Pogrebin about her studio’s current projects including the new Tang Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. agorosz was intrigued by the Met proposal \"Somewhat reminiscent of Edward Larrabee Barnes’ museum work from the 70s. Abraham Zabludovsky’s civic buildings come to mind too. I anticipate some lovely gallery spaces if this gets built as currently planned…I have a feeling this is gonna be pretty controversial, though. The enormous, heavy volumes have a brutal quality despite their careful composition…Far as I can tell, there’s not much metaphor to be found in Escobedo’s design. That could be a good or bad thing.\" A judge finalized the sale of the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Price Tower in Bartlesville, Oklahoma for $1.4 million. gwharton lamented \"Unfortunately, the FLLW Foundation (or whatever they call themselves) has encumbered this building with so many easements and covenants that even $1.4 million is too much…What a tremendous shame. It's my favorite Wright building of them all\" while Gary Garvin shared an original sample floor plan and marveled \"Such active, intimate spaces—this would make good museum space, maybe with several floors devoted to FLW furnishings? And such an engaging design, original, unique in what is really a modest building.\" Unfortunately dianafowler provided a update \"on 2/2 Blanchard's filed bankruptcy, putting the sale on hold. The buyers are not happy\". by Oikonomakis Siampakoulis architects35-sqm Micro-apartment in Athens, Greece by Oikonomakis Siampakoulis architects and \"The Cabanon - the biggest smallest apartment in the world\" in Rotterdam, Netherlands by STAR strategies + architecture and BOARD (Bureau of Architecture, Research and Design) are just two of the latest top images (in no particular order) to be found on the Archinect Pinterest board Color.  by STAR strategies + architecture and BOARD (Bureau of Architecture, Research and Design)R.I.P. Japanese postmodern pioneer Hiroshi Hara and Archigram co-founder Dennis Crompton. Regarding the former Will Galloway recommended \"For those who have not been, the Kyoto station remains an amazing experience. It is a sensational blade-runner (or Cyberpunk) kind of place at first blush. A distinctly human place after sitting in it for a moment. Not an easy thing to do.\" Blogs/Firms/Work Updates The National Organization of Minority Architects (NOMA) welcomed Bryan C. Lee Jr. as its 2025-2026 President.  Studio B announced Sarah Harkins and Kyle Burds as the firm's new partners/leaders who will chart a future alongside Founder Scott Lindenau, FAIA and fellow Board of Directors member Susan Lindenau. Looking for work? Live Nation Entertainment wants a Design Manager with 5-7 years of experience and while the gig is remote there will be \"Significant travel required to project sites throughout the US\". Schools Best Architecture Masters (BAM) released the 2024 edition of their world rankings with a total of 18 degree programs listed. natematt was disappointed but not surprised \"I guess someone needs to fill the void left by DI after all the schools said rankings were a bad idea\" while Non Sequitur had a suggestion \"Now do one with rankings based on average degree cost.\" The votes are in and of the 18 architecture school lecture posters featured in our Fall '24 Get Lectured series, UCLA takes first place. design by Alyssa TohyamaThe Detroit Collaborative Design Center based in the University of Detroit Mercy’s School of Architecture and Community Development is hiring for a Co-Executive Director with applications due Friday, March 28, 2025. Discussion/Threads As a result of some \"site constraints and budget considerations\" shreyavardekar was interested in using brickslip and curious for those \"who have specified brickslip before, what are the most important features to evaluate (e.g., texture, color consistency, durability, or installation flexibility)?\" Since the OP didn’t offer up any specific requirements Will Galloway focused his answer on the aesthetic possibilities \"it's default standard to use these in Japan, except we call them what they are, which is tiles…They can look nice when they don't pretend to be bricks, though I have seen some good examples now and then...The panelized versions that are more common look less natural, especially at corners, and can look strange AF if the manufacturer is the one in charge of detailing (and warranties mean they usually are).\" Stewart Studios restarted someone else's thread on NCARB fees, last updated in 2021. They’ve paid NCARB lots of money over the years, are frustrated by high \"transmittal fees\" and now with a lapsed status, much higher reactivation and membership costs. Both graphemic and gwharton sympathize and believe \"The fact that it's a private org is scandalous. The feds should nationalize it\" and there was shock when taz showed the cheaper costs associated with NCEES (Engineering and Surveying) membership. Finally Thread Central thought ICON’s 3D-printed, Lennar homes in Texas had a nice detail or two and were \"very pretty\" but also wondered \"what the upcharge is to get a plasterer to come in and do the ‘smooth’ wall option.\"? Further investigations led taz to tease out Tattooine vs cybertruck aesthetic differences and to uncover satellite imagery which allows for counting \"the number of print rigs they've got running and see the conventional timber roof truss framing.\"  After a tangent regarding manufactured and motorized \"small residences\" Wood Guy reminded folks \"Posts on a specific topic relevant to architecture/design should be in their own thread. Thread Central is like the break room where we talk smack about our colleagues and families, comment on the weather, bitch about the ball game, etc..\" Later vado retro popped by and we all reminisced about the days of John Devlin, Per and Quondam. Additionally Issue 21 of Logic(s), features an interview with Professor Zandria Robinson about Black Southern Placemaking Technologies, in which she explains \"I think that the Southern city, all Southern cities are places spatially, where you can see the collision of time…It’s everything, everywhere, all at once. This is all of the time. This is the industrial; this is the rural; this is what came before all of this, the Indigenous histories, the mounds.\"",
