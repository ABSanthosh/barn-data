  "text": "FG Studio converts a Riverside Farmhouse into a Design GalleryStanding beneath Shanghai‘s Minpu Bridge and adjacent to Pujiang Countryside Park, Wild Garden 野空间 (Wild Gallery Space) breathes new life into a once-forgotten riverside site. Designed by FG Studio, a modest farmhouse is reimagined as a utopian design gallery where architecture and nature converge. FG Studio established Wild Garden as its creative base, overseeing every phase—from planning and construction to interior curation and ongoing operations. The newly planted landscape hints at the vibrant energy of the approaching spring.Previously an irrigation facility for Pujiang Countryside Park, the site had fallen into disuse. The architectural team redefined its boundaries with clean white walls, offering separation while inviting glimpses of the interior. The design respects the original structure, fostering harmony between architecture and nature. The front area features an open landscape with layered platforms and a minimalist water feature, creating a serene sense of ceremony. The rear includes versatile spaces such as a riverside bar and a wooden platform nestled by a grove, ideal for gatherings. Tall trees frame the site, while a preserved farmland corner revives a sense of organic living.all images by Right AngleWild Garden fuses Architecture, Nature, and Creative ExpressionSituated within Pujiang Countryside Park, the design prioritizes integration with its natural and architectural context. Rather than rebuilding, Shanghai-based office FG Studio refined existing structures, using the ‘box’ as a recurring motif to foster a dialogue between architecture and its environment. Geometric black-framed glass boxes were added to the two-story farmhouse, offering sharp modern contrasts to the rustic surroundings. A vertical white concrete box with floor-to-ceiling windows punctuates the single-story buildings, doubling as an exhibition hall and breaking spatial monotony. Skylights flood the interiors with soft natural light, creating a timeless interplay between old and new.Wild Garden embodies FG Studio’s holistic design approach, blending raw structural elements with curated materials. Exposed beams and original textures are retained as focal points, echoing the craftsmanship of displayed artworks. The interiors showcase custom-designed furniture and surfaces, including a ‘design showroom’ with patchwork flooring made from excess project materials. Glass-brick partitions and partial glass flooring enhance the sense of openness, while experimental furniture prototypes add a personal, innovative touch. A newly added northern platform offers panoramic views—Minpu Bridge’s soaring lines to the north and tranquil, reflective courtyards to the south. As a dynamic, ever-evolving space, Wild Garden now hosts art and design exhibitions that blend with their natural surroundings. These exhibitions evolve with the changing seasons, bringing life and rhythm to a setting where nature and creativity thrive together.Wild Garden by FG Studio revitalizes a forgotten riverside site beneath Shanghai’s Minpu Bridgea modest farmhouse is transformed into a design gallery where architecture and nature convergeonce an irrigation facility, the site now features clean white walls that blend separation with opennesslayered platforms and a minimalist water feature create a serene atmosphere in the front landscapethe rear of Wild Garden offers a riverside bar and a wooden platform nestled by a tranquil grovegeometric black-framed glass boxes add sharp contrasts to the rustic farmhouse, blending old and newtall trees frame the site, while preserved farmland corners revive a connection to organic livingpanoramic views include Minpu Bridge’s sightlines to the north and serene courtyards to the southWild Garden evolves with the seasons, hosting exhibitions where nature and creativity thrive in harmony",
