  "text": "09A Studio’s Jisan-dong 989-6 Reinterprets Local TypologyJisan-dong 989-6 project in South Korea, designed by 09A Studio, is inspired by Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of ‘defamiliarization,’ aiming to shift perceptions of the familiar built environment. Rather than creating novelty, the design works with existing neighborhood elements—form, roof structure, horizontal elevation, and volume density—to reinterpret and refresh everyday residential appearances.The building’s massing is shaped by local daylight regulations, which allow unrestricted daylight access up to a height of nine meters. Most surrounding structures use a three-floor layout to maximize space under this limit. In contrast, Jisan-dong 989-6 applies these regulations in a distinct way, opting for a two-story volume with a pronounced roof, creating a more open ground floor and altering typical proportions within the neighborhood.all images by 50BELLJisan-dong 989-6 alters typical proportions of the neighborhoodThe gabled roof draws inspiration from neighboring rooflines accumulated over time but features a minimalist approach with its flatness and three subtle bends. In this way, 09A Studio emphasizes simplicity while subtly shifting expected proportions, creating a harmonious yet defamiliarized aesthetic that responds to its context.Echoing the balcony and terrace extensions common in the neighborhood, the design integrates these elements as functional and proportional dividers, emphasizing the relationship between the building’s lower and upper floors. This use of horizontal divisions not only unifies the structure with nearby residential buildings but also serves as a decorative element.Jisan-dong 989-6 by 09A Studio reinterprets familiar neighborhood forms with the concept of ‘defamiliarization’nuanced adaptations by 09A reimagine familiar structuresSurrounding buildings often employ an unusual thickness on their enveloping form with windows placed outwards to increase interior space, visually minimizing the thickness of materials.
