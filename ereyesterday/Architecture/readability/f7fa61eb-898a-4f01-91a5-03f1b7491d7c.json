Community centers play an important role in cities, offering spaces for individuals to learn, connect and share experiences. More than just physical structures, they shape how people interact with their surroundings and one another. Thoughtfully designed community centers not only meet practical needs but also foster sustainability and social well-being. Typically, these spaces serve as public hubs where community members gather for group activities, social support, public information and various other purposes. While some cater to the broader community, others focus on specific subgroups. Community centers can be community-owned, religiously affiliated, government-operated, sponsored, or commercially managed. Good architecture transforms these spaces from purely functional buildings into welcoming environments. Thoughtful use of materials, light, and spatial design enhances how people experience and engage with these places, encouraging interaction and a sense of belonging. Here, we explore seven community centers that go beyond being simple gathering spaces. These projects adopt innovative design, inclusive planning, and sustainable principles to create meaningful public spaces that bring people together in new ways. Nunawading Community Hub By fjcstudio, Nunawading, Australia Jury Winner, Community Centers, 12th Annual A+Awards The community hub is built on the traditional lands of the Wurundjeri Woiwurrung People of the Kulin Nation. The place is designed as a space for sharing knowledge, gathering, and celebrating the collective memories of the people who spent their childhood there. The building is interlinked with the football oval and Tunstall Park within Nunawading Primary School. The design strategy focuses on creating a space that is open and inviting to the public, providing equitable access for all. The architecture connects with the landscape and surroundings through its simple form. Kula Vocational Training \u0026 Community Center By BE_Design, Rwanda Popular Choice Winner, Architecture +For Good, 12th Annual A+Awards Kula Vocational Training \u0026 Community Center in northern Rwanda supports female entrepreneurs and farmers. Built from local volcanic stone on a steep hill in the Virunga range, the center’s design retains the slope, avoiding costly retaining walls. A covered area made from eucalyptus hosts community events, while a kitchen provides meals. Inside, there are tailoring classes and farming seminars for women. Natural light enters through a skylight and large windows, showcasing views of the volcanoes. The design is inspired by traditional Rwandan “Imigongo” art, featuring a tapering glass facade that offers space for administration and a counseling room for young women’s health needs program. Habitat on Juers By REFRESH*DESIGN, Brisbane, Australia The community centers is at the heart of Habitat on Juers, creating a shared space where residents can come together while still maintaining options for privacy. Juers is one of 20 social housing demonstration projects being delivered by the Queensland Government. Through its “learning-by-doing” approach, it offers a chance to consider what lessons might be transferable to effect systemic change by contributing to the new design guidelines for future social housing. This central area includes communal amenities that encourage social interaction and foster a sense of belonging. Each home faces the garden, providing both a connection to nature and a feeling of safety. The design encourages residents to build strong community ties, supporting a way of life where people can work, socialize, and grow older in a comfortable and welcoming environment. Arverne East RISE Community Hub and Nature Preserve House By WXY architecture + urban design, Queens, New York Built in 2023, the design of the Arverne East RISE Community Hub and Nature Preserve House includes gender-neutral public restrooms that are accessible for the Nature Preserve and Community Farm, as well as for visitors to Rockaway Beach and the community during operating hours. Additionally, it features new administrative offices for the staff of the Nature Preserve and Community Garden, along with the Department of Parks and Recreation Rangers, and offers a versatile meeting space for local community gatherings. Arboretum Community Center By ISTUDIO Architects, Washington, DC The community center merges heritage and innovation with principles of community enrichment, a sustainable ethos, and the preservation of historical heritage. Its master plan integrates architecture and landscape to provide spaces that are multi-faceted and functional. Most importantly, the design team led a series of community meetings to discuss the recreation center. These meetings yielded a rich tapestry of requests, ranging from amenities such as a senior room to the inclusion of boxing facilities and a half-court gym—attesting to the vibrant diversity within the neighborhood. Additionally, these efforts involve collaboration with the Historic Preservation Office and the Commission of Fine Arts to oversee renovations and improve historic structures; this process helps to reimagine structures and meet users’ expectations. Veterans Home at Chelsea, Community Living Center By PAYETTE, Chelsea, Massechusetts The community center is a long-term care facility for the Commonwealth’s veterans. This transformative new facility features 154 private rooms organized around shared community spaces and surrounded by generous courtyards. The design and interior planning decisions were based on research, including workshops. This includes centralized dining and living rooms within the houses, bright lighting with circadian tuning, a home-like environment with positive sensory and safety enhancements, and features that allow for personalization by residents. Erlebnis-Hus St. Peter-Ording By Holzer Kobler Architekturen Berlin, Sankt Peter-Ording, Germany Erlebnis-Hus St. Peter-Ording, built in 2023, aims to serve visitors of all ages and backgrounds as an inclusive meeting point. The construction features five oversized solid wood cubes that are positioned at various heights. Each of these five cubes serves a distinct purpose: they house an analog game venue, an information center and shop, a restaurant, a staff office, and sanitary facilities. A large number of terraces and stairs make the building accessible and functional on multiple outdoor levels, while a reinforced concrete core with an elevator and utility rooms stabilizes the iconic wooden structure.
