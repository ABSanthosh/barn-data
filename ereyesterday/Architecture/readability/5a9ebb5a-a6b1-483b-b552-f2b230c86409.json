However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.The story of how architect Jeffrey Dungan came to design a cottage on a remote Canadian beach for antiques dealer Kim Faison is one that both love to tell. It began a few years ago, when Faison left a comment on one of Dungan’s Instagram posts, complimenting his work. To her surprise, he responded. Over DMs, she told him she’d bought a piece of land in Nova Scotia and needed help figuring out what to do with it. “She wrote, ‘But I don’t know if I can afford you.’ And then I replied, ‘Well, you probably can’t, but I love Nova Scotia,” recalls the AD PRO Directory member in his charming Southern drawl and candid style.Some time went by, and Faison’s wish to have Dungan design her second home never wavered. “One day I had a big sale and afterwards I just mailed him a check for $5,000. He called me up and said, ‘Is this your way of hiring me?’” says Faison, who owns the long-established Kim Faison Antiques in Richmond, Virginia. “It was the funniest thing.” Dungan found the whole thing endearing and agreed to fly out to the northeastern reaches of Canada. Once there, on Faison’s windswept land—seven forested acres perched 100 feet above a craggy Atlantic coastline—he could hardly say no. The two agreed on a price and he drew the plans right then and there.Homeowner Kim Faison’s only request to the architect was a blue roof. Although he was not an immediate fan of the idea, Dungan went along with it. “We got it to be the same color as the water in that area, which is a beautiful dark blue, and in the end it turned out really neat,” he says of the painted aluminum surface. “I did a classic cottage with the simplest roof line and a very livable floor plan that creates these views out to the ocean and over to what’s called Hirtle’s Beach, where the light comes in every morning,” he says. “It’s just this little jewel box.” Faison loved everything Dungan proposed. She only had one request: a blue roof. Although he was not an immediate fan of the idea, Dungan went along with it. “We got it to be the same color as the water in that area, which is a beautiful dark blue, and in the end it turned out really neat,” he says.The 2,500-square-foot structure has a straightforward layout with a main level consisting of a spacious living area and an open kitchen, a primary suite on the top level, and a second bedroom on the lower level, built on a downslope and only visible from the back of the house. Dungan went off-script with one feature, a cozy dining alcove by the kitchen that juts out from the main structure of the house and has French windows on three sides, like a lookout. “The breakfast nook is probably my favorite space in the whole house,” says the Alabama-based architect. “It has seven-foot ceilings and you feel like you’re on a boat; all you can see is water.”“It’s just this little jewel box,” says Dungan of the 2,500-square-foot second home, where even the staircase has views. Behind the contemporary sofa, we see an early-19th-century Norwegian clock and two 18th-century paintings that belonged to the homeowner’s mother, Caroline Faison, who was a well-known antiques expert. Next to the Norwegian clock, a rare piece, is a mid-18th-century Swedish chair, and an early 19th-century Italian console table. To decorate the home, Dungan brought along his former head of interior design, Michelle Cone. At first, they feared that their client, as an antiques dealer, would not be open to someone else’s ideas about decor. But Cone and Faison got along famously well (a little too well, if you ask Dungan. During the Nova Scotia project, Cone left Dungan’s studio to follow in Faison’s footsteps and become an antiquarian. “Even though she quit on me, we’re still friends,” he jokes.)A view of the living room from the open kitchen. The big iron lantern was purchased recently at an antiques show in Nashville, Tennessee. “It took a while to find the right piece,” says interior designer Michelle Cone. With Cone’s help, Faison narrowed down the collection of furniture displayed in the home. They also repurposed a few pieces, such as the coffee table in the living room, made from an 18th-century Italian dining table with shortened legs, and a set of 17th-century candlesticks that were turned into lamps. To freshen up the space—and to reflect the humble seaside vernacular—they added a few simple contemporary items, including a sofa with ivory-hued slipcovers. Many of the antiques came from Faison’s own warehouse in Virginia, but the two women also shopped at a few shows and fairs, including one in Nashville, where they found the big iron lantern that now hangs at the center of the living room. “I would say the house is still a work in progress,” Cone says.“We want to find the right things,” Faison echoes. “My house in Richmond is full of stuff, but this house is clean and peaceful, and with the windows and the light—it’s a darling, darling place.”Architect Jeffrey Dungan designed this compact cottage in Nova Scotia for Kim Faison, an antiques dealer based in Virginia. With large windows oriented toward the craggy coast and a beach to the south, the home makes the most of its dramatic natural surroundings. On the left side of the console is a Swedish corner chair from the 18th century with wheeled legs. The chair on the right is also Swedish. The window frames were painted in Benjamin Moore’s China White, diluted in water to create a washed wood effect. This built-in banquette fits a cozy breakfast nook that juts out from the main structure of the home and has open views on three sides. The gateleg table is a Danish piece from the early 18th century. A set of arched openings in the primary bedroom. Walls were painted in Benjamin Moore’s Seapearl, creating a warm, serene atmosphere. In the primary bedroom on the second floor, we see a jute rug, a spool chair from Charlotte and Ivy, and a 19th-century Swedish buffet. In the guest bedroom on the lower level is a painted writing table from Sweden, from the early 19th century. The chair is from the same time period, as is the hanging corner cabinet, both Swedish as well. This stonewalled porch sits at the back of the house, just outside the bedroom on the lower level.",
