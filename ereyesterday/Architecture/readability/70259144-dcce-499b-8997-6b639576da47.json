Bold logos, engaging graphics, and easily adaptable strategies make digital output the place where most companies spend the majority of their budgets. However, physical spaces also offer a powerful and lasting way to establish identity. The challenge for architects and brand strategists lies in creating designs that make a strong first impression while also standing the test of time. Unlike a print ad or social media campaign, a building is a long-term investment in brand identity. It needs to capture attention quickly but also remain relevant and impactful for years to come. This often involves incorporating elements that can be easily updated or refreshed, allowing the brand to evolve its image without major structural changes. Yet, branding in architecture is often relegated to superficial applications like simple applied graphics and a splash of corporate colors rather than being integrated into the design itself. Approaches such as this are missed opportunities to make a deeper impact. Buildings are long-term brand statements that should embody the brand’s ethos. KDO Kinetic System, the latest launch from Kriskadecor, is a groundbreaking system that does exactly this — rethinking façade aesthetics by harnessing natural forces, offering a façade solution that is visually engaging, incredibly functional and highly adaptable. Kinetic Façades, Timeless Craft Oritia \u0026 Boreas Aerodynamics Laboratory by Water Scales Arquitectos, Escúzar, Granada, Spain | Photo by Ángel Segura Using the brand’s signature lightweight aluminum chains, optimized for outdoors, the KDO Kinetic System moves instinctively with the surrounding airflow, transforming static structures into ever-changing, visually striking surfaces. Unlike LED screens or mechanical elements, this system operates without electricity, programming or maintenance, meaning it doesn’t require constant updates or observation. Since its foundation in 1926, Kriskadecor has been guided by the values of innovation, customization and craftsmanship. Led by its third generation, the company continues to embody the spirit of its founder, Josep Maria Sans Amill. Specializing in manufacturing aluminum chains for architectural and interior design projects, the Montblanc (Spain) and Miami (USA) based company offers versatile, lightweight solutions for both interior and exterior applications. With in-house technology and an extensive palette of colors, Kriskadecor can reproduce text, images and patterns with remarkable precision, ensuring complete personalization in color, shape and dimensions. Additionally, every component, from the chain links to bespoke fastening systems, is produced on-site, with a dedicated technical team guiding clients through the process. Harnessing Airflow for Dynamic Design When it came to designing the façade of the Aerodynamics Laboratory of Oritia \u0026 Boreas in Granada, Spain, Kriskadecor’s KDO Kinetic System was the perfect choice. As a leader in wind engineering, the institution needed a façade that wouldn’t just symbolize airflow but would also physically demonstrate it, and KDO Kinetic System fit the brief masterfully. The installation spans 92 feet (28 meters) in width and 72 feet (2.2 meters) in height and is positioned in front of a west-facing window. The aluminum chains, customized in satin silver and signal blue (RAL 5005), feature the institution’s branding while interacting dynamically with the area’s thermal winds. The transparency of the chain links enhances the building’s ambiance, maintaining exterior privacy and interior visibility. While the ever-shifting façade detail visually represents the airflow patterns studied in the lab within, the architecture is an extension of the company’s purpose; it also complements the rest of the polycarbonate-clad façade beautifully. Beyond it’s eye-grabbing appearance, the kinetic façade also addresses practical concerns, with sustainability being one of its core advantages. Made from 100% recyclable aluminum, the system lowers material waste and improves energy efficiency by providing solar shading, minimizing glare and reducing heat gain. The chain-formed mesh also supports natural ventilation. Unlike standard mechanical louvers or static shading elements, KDO adapts in real time without requiring energy consumption or maintenance, offering a passive and efficient approach to climate control. Sustainable Strength, Minimal Maintenance Oritia \u0026 Boreas Aerodynamics Laboratory by Water Scales Arquitectos, Escúzar, Granada, Spain | Photo by Ángel Segura Of course, durability and sustainability are essential in kinetic architecture. Kriskadecor’s aluminum chains are tested for 10,000 hours of solar exposure under UNE-EN ISO 11341:2005 standards, ensuring they withstand environmental conditions without fading or corroding. The system operates without motors or mechanical components; upkeep is therefore minimal. Because it is lightweight and easy to install on both new and existing buildings, architects and designers can comfortably specify the KDO Kinetic System as a scalable solution that is adaptable to various urban contexts. Meanwhile, the ability to form curved or linear forms makes the system incredibly versatile and a suitable option for almost any architectural project. Finally, Kriskadecor has spent time and invested resources to ensure the user experience is seamless. Packaging has been optimized for efficiency. Tailored to product dimensions for compact, lightweight shipments, when delivered, the system produces minimal waste, and the logistical impact is small. These design provisions ensure easier handling during installation, allowing a single person to transport and assemble the system with ease. Designing Identity Through Built Space Oritia \u0026 Boreas Aerodynamics Laboratory by Water Scales Arquitectos, Escúzar, Granada, Spain | Photo by Ángel Segura Human brains are wired to make split-second assessments. Research in social psychology suggests that within milliseconds, people form opinions based on visual cues; architecture can play a critical role in that instinctive process. When considered holistically, a well-designed building can become a tangible, immersive experience that reinforces a brand’s values and presence. Every material, color and structural element contributes to an impression before a visitor ever steps inside. A building’s façade, when thoughtfully designed, is the initial handshake, acting as a psychological tool to shape the perception of the business within. In understanding this, brands are now investing heavily in innovative architectural designs that capture attention swiftly and effectively communicate their essence. Many brands have spent decades refining their visual identities across digital platforms, yet these mediums often lack permanence and physical impact. Digital spaces are transient and subject to algorithmic shifts, fleeting user engagement and trends. Physical architecture, on the other hand, offers an enduring, place-based expression of brand identity. As seen in the case of Oritia \u0026 Boreas and their use of Kriskadecor’s KDO Kinetic System, a thoughtfully designed façade is not only a way to express visual identity; it can also build a deeper emotional connection with its clients through communicating values. Creating an experience that is both memorable and immersive, harnessing architecture not just for aesthetics but for engagement, differentiation and identity reinforcement.
