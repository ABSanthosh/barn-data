With this in mind, we’re here to point you to the very best mattresses made just for side sleepers.

It’s a medium-firm mattress.How comfortable is it? 8.5/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? I liked how I felt as if I was sinking into the mattress at just the perfect amount. As a result, my body felt as if it naturally, snugly fit into the bed.What do you love about this mattress? I loved the soft cover on top of the mattress, and how nice it felt to the touch. What’s more, I tend to sleep with a harder Tempur-Pedic pillow. This is ideal for most side sleepers, as it allows the alignment of our head to be in a natural position throughout the night (and not subject to the whims of an older pillow). It’s worth mentioning that this pick comes with a lifetime warranty and a 365-night trial.If you could change anything, what would it be? For this price point, I wouldn’t change much about this mattress. But, if pressed, it would be nice if the smell of the mattress wasn’t as mattress-y for the first week or so after unboxing. Perhaps they could lace the fabric with lavender or some other scent that would accompany the mattress for the first few weeks.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? I consider this mattress to be among the next generation in that it arrives in a box, inflates very easily, and is extremely comfortable to sleep on. What’s more, the quality of the mattress is very good. What I mean by that is, upon laying on it, the product feels secure to the bed frame, and doesn’t move if my body does.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? Yes, absolutely.How did delivery and setup go? Very easy delivery and setup. It was sent in the mail in a box. I had to unpack the plastic around the mattress, allow the mattress to air out for 48 hours, and then it was good to go. Incredibly seamless process.Saatva Classic MattressTemperature regulation, firm and supportive feelMattress type: InnerspringHeight: 11.5 inchesShipping: Free in-room delivery, setup, and old mattress removalSleep trial: 365 nightsWarranty: Lifetime warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split king, split California kingReviewer: Erin Kaplan, vice president of communicationsHow firm is the mattress? 8/10How comfortable is it? 10/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? The mattress offers support–and give–where needed, conforms to the body, and doesn’t allow you to sink into the bed too deeply.What do you love about this mattress? It’s firm (which I prefer), regulates temperature well, and is extremely durable. I alternate between sleeping on my side and sleeping on my stomach, and this mattress is great for both positions.If you could change anything, what would it be? I don’t think I would change anything. It’s a terrific mattress—no complaints!How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? The Saatva mattress offers more support and is firmer than mattresses I’ve had in the past. It also keeps me much cooler throughout the night—a huge plus for anyone who gets hot while sleeping. Overall, I get a better night’s sleep on a more consistent basis since I switched mattresses.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? Absolutely, it’s a very high-quality mattress and a terrific option, not just for side sleepers.How did delivery and setup go? The delivery process was extremely easy. They were punctual, even early but with advance notice. I received a text letting me know the mattress would be delivered the next day. I then got a call that morning saying the movers would be arriving in 30 minutes. No additional setup was required.Nectar Memory Foam MattressDurable build, breathable to the touch, great price pointNot made of organic materialsMattress type: Memory foamHeight: 12 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 365 nightsWarranty: Lifetime warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split kingReviewer: Nick Mafi, senior features editorHow firm is the mattress? Medium firm.How comfortable is it? 8.8/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? As a side sleeper, I liked how my body conformed to the Nectar mattress. It felt like my body weight sunk into the mattress at just the right level of comfort.What do you love about this mattress? I love how sleeping and sitting up in bed to read are both comfortable experiences in this mattress. It has great support in all areas, meaning that sitting up near the head of the bed to read before sleeping was also very comfortable. What’s more, I love the cover on the top of the mattress. It not only feels breathable to the touch, but with its quilted poly-blend technology, it also cools me down at night when I sleep.If you could change anything, what would it be? At this competitive price point, I wouldn’t change much of anything.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? It is certainly one of the best mattresses I’ve ever slept on. I think an overlooked element of any mattress is its sturdiness: Too many people tend to focus on the initial feeling of laying in bed, but over time, the sturdiness of the mattress is almost as important. And this one certainly has that element.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? Yes, absolutely. It is among the most comfortable mattresses I’ve slept on, and probably half the price of other similar sleep quality experiences.How did delivery and setup go? Very easy delivery and setup. It was sent in the mail in a box. I had to unpack the plastic around the mattress, allow the mattress to air out for 48 hours, and then it was good to go. Incredibly seamless process.Layla Hybrid MattressFlippable with a soft and firm side, strong motion controlMattress type: Innerspring and foamHeight: 13 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 120 nightsWarranty: 10-year warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingReviewer: Cheryl Dearborne, contributorHow firm is the mattress? This mattress is two-sided, and I sleep on the firm side. It is firm enough for my perfect alignment but still feels soft enough to be cozy.How comfortable is it? 10/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? The flippable option. Softer mattresses can shape better to a side sleeper, but firm mattresses are more aligned if constructed well. I figured between both sides I would find the most comfortable and supportive side. So far, it is the firm side.What do you love about this mattress? The comfort and coziness. I sleep well and sleep through the night. I wake up on the side I fell asleep on. I have not tossed and turned since receiving this mattress. It takes no more than a little adjustment to get in a comfortable enough position to go to sleep, and I find that I fall asleep within minutes of laying down.If you could change anything, what would it be? I genuinely do not have any critiques about the mattress itself.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? It is the best mattress I’ve ever slept on. I have a long history of terrible sleep and back problems from uncomfortable mattresses or comfortable mattresses that weren’t supportive enough. This mattress fills both shoes of comfort and alignment perfectly.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? I would recommend this mattress to a side sleeper over any others.How did delivery and setup go? The delivery was much faster than I expected. It is heavy if you have to carry it up stairs. Once out of the compressed bag, it inflates immediately. There was no chemical smell from the plastic, and I was able to sleep on it the same night.Puffy Lux Hybrid MattressPlush feel, cooling qualitiesRounded edges at the end of the bed mean not the best edge supportMattress type: Innerspring and foamHeight: 12 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 101 nightsWarranty: Lifetime warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split kingReviewer: Sam Cochran, global features editorHow firm is the mattress? The mattress is incredibly soft—some might say like a cloud, based on the logo, but I’ll go with whipped peaks of meringue. I know it’s a hybrid model, with a coil base topped by traditional memory foam. But the overwhelming sensation is one of gently sinking into the surface. I was too comfortable to really consider where one layer ended and the next began.How comfortable is it? 8/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? I’m a side sleeper—and a very still side sleeper at that. I often wake up in the same position (right side down, hands beneath the head, legs slightly fetal) as the one in which I fall asleep. So I like the idea of being cradled in place by a foam bed, all the more so since my skinny 6’4” frame—especially my long neck and spine—enjoy extra support.What do you love about this mattress? I love the feeling of sinking into it at night, the way the foam gives beneath your body. It really feels like the end of the day, an easy transition into relaxation mode and a nice wind down to REM cycle. I also share the bed with a restless snoozer, so I also love not being able to sense his every toss and turn.If you could change anything, what would it be? I suspect there is a reason for this, but one end of the mattress is slightly rounded. Visually, I would have preferred crisp angles in all four corners. The mattress also has a slight synthetic odor upon unpacking it, so best to air out for a night.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? Relative to my previous mattress, the memory foam is much softer and much more supportive. I feel I could get away with one pillow rather than my usual two, since the body seems to assume an ergonomic position in the foam.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? An enthusiastic yes! As someone who has never had a memory foam, I was pleasantly surprised by how cool and comfortable it was—and how quickly my body adjusted to it after years in a traditional coil mattress.How did delivery and setup go? The delivery of this particular mattress was a breached birth, but only on account of my living situation. My downstairs neighbors happened to sign for the delivery, so the mattress was left in our first-floor entry. There it sat for several days until I could find a friend with the requisite upper-body strength to help me lug the heavy, somewhat unwieldy box up three steep flights. Once I got the mattress bedside, it was easy to unbox and unpack, with plastic wrap that rolled off and a vacuum-pack membrane that I quickly sliced open with scissors. Some careful maneuvering was required to get the plastic out from under it and flip it over. Once in position, however, the compressed mattress puffed up in no time.Naturepedic EOS Classic Organic MattressMade of organic materials, left and right sides of the bed have customizable firmnessesLacks edge support, multiple parts of the customized mattress ship in separate boxesMattress type: Innerspring and latexHeight: 12 inchesShipping: Free (ships in boxes)Sleep trial: 100 nightsWarranty: 25 yearsSizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingReviewer: Rachel Fletcher, commerce directorHow firm is the mattress? Cushion firm (which is their medium firm option)How comfortable is it? 9/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? I am one of those misinformed people who assumed that a firm mattress was better for anyone who cared about their posture. Once I started researching the kind of mattress a side sleeper actually needs, I found out I was very wrong—especially as someone who is also a stomach sleeper. Knowing that each side of the EOS Classic is customizable was really appealing, but the 100% organic GOTS certified cred is really what pulled me in.What do you love about this mattress? I love that this mattress feels like it is supportive and cradles your body but isn’t bouncy or too plush. I’m not sinking into it while I sleep but I feel completely at ease. It’s a really lovely sleeping experience and I feel like I now understand what a luxury mattress feels like.If you could change anything, what would it be? Aside from the assembly, which was a bit challenging (more on that below) I genuinely believe this is a great side sleeper mattress. I have one small complaint, which is that there isn’t a huge amount of edge support, but that hasn’t been a big issue for me personally.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? Compared to my last mattress, which didn’t last very long, the EOS feels like a much more solid piece of furniture. My previous mattress was so pillowy I felt like I might float away. In stark contrast, when I lie on the EOS, I feel firmly planted—almost hugged—by the softest quilt layer, which is made of organic cotton and wool. Underneath that, I am supported by the latex and coils for added buoyancy. My hips and my neck don’t feel any sort of scrunch or discomfort, which is a huge plus.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? I definitely would. Aside from all of the benefits I mentioned above, the nice thing about the EOS is that, if the person you sleep next to isn’t a side sleeper or prefers a different level of firmness, the mattress is totally customizable on the left or right sides. Similarly, if your sleep preferences ever change or you want to change your sleep setup, you don’t have to repurchase an entirely new mattress and send the old one to a landfill—you can buy one piece at a time, unzip it from the base layer and encasement, and add the new segment in. I described the assembly of this mattress as almost like making a tiramisu. You have to lay the foundation, sandwich in the left and right pieces side by side, and then zip the entire mattress together with the pillowy top.How did delivery and setup go? Because the mattress is super customizable, each portion comes in a separate box, which is a bit of a nightmare as a single person lugging each box up four flights of stairs by herself. So it’s not as much a mattress-in-a-box as it is a mattress in four boxes. And because the mattress is incredibly well made, each box is fairly dense and heavy. I will say, it is 100% worth the slightly sweaty unboxing and assembly process, but you might want to enlist a friend or partner to spare you the strain.The WinkBedHelpful to soothe those battling chronic hip, shoulder, and back pain, strong edge support and motion isolationLuxury firm option leans a bit on the softer sideMattress type: Innerspring and foamHeight: 13.5 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 120 nightsWarranty: Lifetime warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingReviewer: Mark Burka, contributorHow firm is the mattress? Medium firm.How comfortable is it? Very comfortable—it's like sleeping on a hotel bed.As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? I wanted a mattress that would provide multiple benefits for me and my partner, as we both have different sleeping preferences. I run hot and prefer to sleep on my side and turn to my stomach. He runs cold and prefers to sleep on his back. This mattress was particularly beneficial as it did end up alleviating hip pain and lower back pain. We began sleeping on this mattress in 2019.What do you love about this mattress? It is a hybrid mattress with both supportive coils and a Euro-pillow top with gel-infused foam. Overall, the mattress is great for sleeping on the side, but also for when switching from stomach and/or to back.I love that the mattress has extra-edge anti-sag support, which makes the bed sturdy for everyone: back sleepers, stomach sleepers, combination sleepers, etc. It also has motion isolation technology, which reduces motion transfer across the bed, preventing you from feeling your partner turning around in bed. Although the mattress is designated as firm, the pillow top has a light fluffy feel due to the gel-infused pillow top that is unlike any other mattress I’ve experienced.If you could change anything, what would it be? This mattress has different firmness options, and the aptly named “firmer” is a step up from the luxury firm. I would have chosen that because the pillow top gives the bed a fluffy feel. When I ordered it, I was worried that the firmest option would be too firm for me and my partner. However, I think I should have gone for it. Winkbed’s firmer option is specifically designed for “heavier” people over 200–250 pounds. They even have a firmness option called “plus” for people who weigh more than 250 pounds. The different firmness levels ensure that the mattress will never sag, regardless of the sleeper’s body type.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? Honestly, this mattress is a dream, with the price point being under $2,000 for a California King. Every time I go out of town and stay in an Airbnb or hotel, I am always excited to go back to our bed at home, as it truly fits the needs and desires we have for a mattress.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? I would recommend this mattress to another side sleeper, especially for those looking to alleviate hip pain, shoulder pain, and back pain.Helix Midnight LuxeBreathable, soothing pressure relief around the hips and shouldersChemical off-gassing smellMattress type: Innerspring and foamHeight: 13.5 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 100 nightsWarranty: Lifetime warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingReviewer: Gabriela Ulloa, contributorHow firm is the mattress? Medium firm.How comfortable is it? 9/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? Not only did the company claim the mattress would be cooling—sign me up—but it also noted that it featured a luxury memory foam for pressure relief on hips and shoulders. As a side sleeper who constantly wakes up with a crooked neck and often back pain, this was a huge plus.What do you love about this mattress? It’s the perfect combination of firm yet cozy and is actually, wait for it, breathable. No mattress topper necessary. I sleep bundled between blankets, pillows, and a plush duvet and wake up feeling refreshed and never sore. Plus, if someone is sleeping next to you, you actually do not feel them whatsoever.If you could change anything, what would it be? Honestly nothing. I sleep like an angel on this thing.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? It feels so much more supportive than any other mattress I’ve owned and doesn’t cause any sort of soreness or back pain, even if I’ve been traveling and haven’t slept on it for a while.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? Absolutely. The Helix Midnight Luxe really holds you comfortably with adding constant support, so you never feel that “sinking in” feeling that messes with your hips.How did delivery and setup go? The mattress weighs a lot. Getting it up the stairs was a true mission, but once I was able to unbox it, it was smooth(ish) sailing. From there, I just had to unwrap it and let it breathe to get out that chemically smell most mattresses arrive with. It’s definitely a two-person job but, hey, if that’s the price we pay for good sleep, I’ll take it.Happsy Organic MattressMade with organic materials, perfect balance between comfort and supportNot as thick as other mattresses, so might be more ideal for a lower-to-the-ground, minimalist bedroomMattress type: Innerspring and latexHeight: 10 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 120 nightsWarranty: 20 yearsSizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingReviewer: Terri Williams, contributorHow firm is the mattress? The mattress is firm, but not too firm. It’s firm enough that it doesn’t feel like I’m bouncing on a trampoline or sinking in sand when moving around. However, it’s not so firm that it feels hard and uncomfortable.How comfortable is it? 9/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? As a side sleeper, I’m all over the bed. I may start by lying on my right side, facing my lamp and nightstand, and fall asleep while I’m reading. But later, I may migrate toward the opposite side of the bed, sleeping on my left side to be closer to my air purifier. I also lie on my left side when watching TV in bed. I’m impressed that the mattress doesn’t sag, and my body feels supported in either side position.What do you love about this mattress? As someone with allergies, I love that this mattress is organic. It doesn’t contain glue, adhesives, or flame-retardant chemicals, or flame barriers (but don’t worry: The mattress has passed all flammability safety requirements). Instead, the Happsy mattress has a 100% certification by the Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS). It’s made of organic cotton and wool, along with certified latex to relieve pressure points, and pocketed springs. I actually have two sets of bed pillows on the bed: the top pair is soft, and the pair behind it is firmer, so I sleep like a baby on this mattress.If you could change anything, what would it be? I can’t think of anything I’d change about this mattress.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? It’s one of the best mattresses I’ve ever slept on, and is only the second organic mattress I’ve tried. It’s comparable to the Naturepedic Chorus Organic Mattress, which is also organic and has a similar design.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? Yes, I would definitely recommend this mattress to another side sleeper because it’s built well, and it’s comfortable without being unsupportive.How did delivery and setup go? Delivery was surprisingly quick. It’s a bed-in-a-box mattress and arrived in a tall box that I maneuvered into my garage. Later that day, one of my friends carried it upstairs, opened the box, unrolled the mattress, and placed it on my bed. It was ready to sleep on in less than an hour. However, I always sleep on the sofa the first night to ensure the mattress has completely expanded.Molecule Hybrid MattressSpinal support, comfortable and offers firm supportDoesn’t have a removable coverMattress type: Innerspring and foamHeight: 13 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 100 nightsWarranty: 15 yearsSizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingReviewer: Terri Williams, contributorHow firm is the mattress? The Molecule Hybrid Mattress provides the perfect level of comfort. It’s like sleeping on a cloud, but a firm cloud.How comfortable is it? I would give this mattress an 11. It’s just ridiculously comfortable yet firm.As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? I sleep on my left side, my right side, sometimes in a fetal position. I like firm mattresses, but not too firm. I really like hybrid mattresses because they can provide the best of both worlds. This mattress proves that it can provide spine support without the hard-as-a-brick feeling.What do you love about this mattress? I love the various scientific-sounding layers in the Molecule Hybrid Mattress, which include: ContourFlo for firm support, which helps to keep my spine aligned. The MoleculeEdge is an individually wrapped coil system that provides pressure point relief. RecoveryFlo provides targeted self-adjusting support (and I guess that’s why ballers like Tom Brady and Russell Wilson rep it; I’m a Cowboys fan, so I must really love the mattress to be so excited about it despite endorsements from my team’s sworn enemies!).The AirTec level has five times the airflow in regular memory foam, which explains why I don’t wake up hot anymore. Also, the top layer includes a microban antimicrobial cover. I also love that the mattress is free from PBDE flame retardants, formaldehyde, phthalates, mercury, and lead, and it has a CertiPUR-US certification.If you could change anything, what would it be? Nothing. The mattress arrived with two free Molecule pillows—which I added to the two pillows I already have (I’m a pillow person!). I also have a set of Molecule sateen bed sheets in cloud gray. It’s like sleeping on a silky cloud of comfort, which is not something that I want to end. And honestly, if I didn’t have the best job in the world, it would be really hard to get out of the bed each morning.How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? I’ve tested several mattresses, and the only one that is comparable to this one in terms of comfort is the Layla Hybrid Flippable Mattress. Both of these mattresses are now neck-and-neck on my list of the best mattresses in general, and the best hybrid mattresses in particular.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? Yes, I would definitely recommend this mattress to side sleepers because it supports spine alignment and provides maximum comfort.How did delivery and setup go? The mattress arrived in about a week. It’s a mattress in a box and was easy for me to move into the garage. Later that evening, one of my friends brought it up the steps, removed it from the box, opened and unfolded it, and I helped to place it on my bed. I waited 24 hours before putting bed sheets on the mattress and sleeping on it, although the company says the mattress is ready in a few minutes.Nolah Evolution MattressSeven layers of supportive coals and soft foam, cushy pillow top coverOn the thicker side, so the mattress might be most ideal for bedrooms with a grand, maximalist designMattress type: Innerspring and foamHeight: 15 inchesShipping: Free (in a box)Sleep trial: 120 nightsWarranty: Lifetime warrantySizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split kingReviewer: Audrey Lee, commerce editorHow firm is the mattress? A very solid 8/10How comfortable is it? 11/10As a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress? With numerous sleep awards under its belt, Nolah makes pressure-relieving mattresses designed with side sleepers (like you and me!) in mind. Their construction focuses on core side sleeping needs like supportive alignment, pressure relief, and just the right amount of body conforming—all of which I was interested to put to the test.What do you love about this mattress? I’m not kidding when I say there’s so much to love about this mattress. The first time I flopped onto the bed, I immediately felt like every element in the mattress was working together to provide the perfect balance of comfort and support. This is mainly thanks to the substantial seven layer construction which includes a layer of individually-wrapped coils, breathable Airfoam, and a plush pillow top cover that cradles your body in a particularly soothing way.If you could change anything, what would it be? Not a thing!How does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on? Before trying the Nolah mattress, my preferences definitely leaned more toward soft than firm, but Nolah’s “luxury firm” Evolution mattress made me second-guess myself. Consider me Team Firm Mattress for the long haul.Would you recommend it to other side sleepers? I’d absolutely recommend Nolah’s mattress to other side sleepers—for me, this is my perfect mattress.How did delivery and setup go? Nolah is a bed-in-a-box brand, which makes delivery a breeze. My mattress arrived compressed in a tall box that was waiting on my doorstep once I arrived home from running errands one day. Unless you’re very strong, I would suggest having help to bring the box into your home, especially if stairs are involved, as the box still weighs about 80 to 90 pounds.How We Tested the Best Mattresses for Side SleepersFrom mattresses-in-a-box to affordable mattresses, we thoroughly test and recommend beds only after bringing them in our homes and sleeping on them for weeks, months, and even years at a time. In other words, we get a real feel for the mattress just like our readers would to ensure our recommendations are comfortable and worth the investment—after all, a good mattress should last you for a long time. When it comes to the best mattresses for side sleepers, we kept several important factors in mind to ensure the beds we reviewed are comfortable and pressure-relieving for this sleep position:Firmness: The best mattresses for side sleepers offer a slightly firm feel to offer support and target pressure-relief, especially areas like the back. While it may come as a surprise, foam mattresses in addition to innerspring and hybrid beds can offer this if they have a medium-firm feel.Comfort: Our testers sung the praises of mattresses in this list that had comfortable qualities like pillow top covers for a plush feel, as well as breathable, cooling covers to let air circulate.Edge Support: Keep an eye out for mattresses with strong borders in our guide, as this will help prevent you from feeling like you’re slipping off the bed as you sleep.Motion Control: Our testers noted if the beds were really bouncy, as this is usually a sign of limited motion isolation. This is less ideal when sharing a bed with a partner and can cause you to wake up easily if they are getting in and out of bed.Customization: Whether opting for a flippable mattress with different firmness levels or personalizing the mattress with a plush feel on the left or right side of the bed, we included options in this list that can cater to your specific sleep needs, like Naturepedic’s customizable bed.How We Chose the Best Mattresses for Side SleepersAside from the mattress qualities outlined in our section on how we tested these beds, we selected options that allow for ease of delivery and several other factors to bring them in your own home. Here are key considerations:Shipping: Many leading mattress brands offer free shipping, which is a big perk since beds can already be a big-ticket purchase. Additionally, stores like Saatva include free white glove delivery to set up the mattress in your home and remove an old mattress in one fell swoop.Sleep trial: To ensure you can assess if a mattress is truly right for you, we included mattresses that offer sleep trials. The average is around 100 nights, but some brands even reach up to 365-night sleep trials so you can thoroughly test your mattress through every season.Warranty: If you want to get your money’s worth, keep an eye out for mattresses with extensive warranties. We included options ranging from 20 years to a lifetime so you won’t have to make return after return if the mattress doesn’t meet your needs.Size: While most mattresses offer twin through California king sizes, the thickness is another important factor. If you want a bed that sits lower to the ground, opt for a 10-inch mattress, like the Happsy Organic Mattress. If you want an elevated, maximalist bedroom aesthetic, consider a mattress with a 15-inch thickness such as the Nolah Evolution Mattress.What Side Sleepers Should Look for in a MattressThe first thing to think about when choosing the best mattress for side sleepers is your overall size. Size will dictate the level of firmness you need in a mattress, explains Michael J. Breus, PhD, a sleep expert who serves on the American Board of Sleep Medicine and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.“Most side sleepers will do best on a medium-firm mattress, as a general guideline, but that will vary based on their height and weight,” Dr. Breus explains. “If you’re a 250- to 300-pound person, you’re going to look for a different mattress than a 120- to 130-pound person. As a side sleeper, you have to balance between the idea of sinking in versus support.” As an example, he continues “If you’re a 125-pound person, getting a medium-soft mattress might make sense, but a 300-pound person would get no support from that same mattress. The larger person would need a medium-firm mattress.” Nicely, many of the mattresses we cover offer firmness scales (or different firmness options) on their sites so you can customize your new bed to your liking.Mattress material: In addition to thinking about firmness, side sleepers should consider the material of any new mattress. Dr. Breus recommends avoiding mattresses with memory foam at the top layers. “Side sleepers should avoid memory foam close to the surface unless the foam has a lot of buoyancy. It’s all based on height and weight, so someone who is bigger, you would want innerspring coils,” he recommends.Shopping for two sleepers: What about if you have two sleepers of varying sizes? In cases where one partner is larger, Dr. Breus recommends choosing a mattress that is suited to the heavier person, and then adding a mattress topper to accommodate the lighter person, if they prefer more cushioning.Additional features: Some other features to look for are a 100-plus night trial period as noted above, which most newer mattress brands offer. This allows you to sleep on it like you own it for a few months and notice how you feel without any pressure. Speaking of pressure, you should pay attention to lumbar or hip pain, restfulness, if you’re too warm or cold, and whether you find yourself waking up to readjust often throughout the night. Lastly, if you live alone, paying a few extra dollars for white-glove delivery might be worth it considering setting up even mattresses-in-a-box can be a bit of a heavy ordeal.Types of Mattresses for Side SleepersWhen it comes to different kinds of mattresses, you can lump them into four main categories: Innerspring mattresses, all-foam mattresses, latex mattresses, and hybrid mattresses.Innerspring mattresses have a layer of wrapped steel coils at their core, and they offer responsive support for people with back pain and muscle soreness.Memory foam mattresses kicked off the mattress-in-a-box craze. They rely on layers of memory foam, each of a different density, texture, and thickness. For hot sleepers, many foam mattresses have a top layer of gel-infused memory foam (you’ll find these on some hybrid mattresses too).Hybrid mattresses are the best of both worlds, as they combine innersprings with memory foam (or latex). So if you like a softer, pillow top bed but still need that deep core support, a hybrid mattress is one to look for.Latex mattresses are often hailed as the more “natural” or “eco-conscious” option. While we can’t exactly speak to their sustainability chops, the latex mimics foam so you still get a springy, supportive mattress—without the synthetic fibers.",

But, if pressed, it would be nice if the smell of the mattress wasn’t as mattress-y for the first week or so after unboxing.

I often wake up in the same position (right side down, hands beneath the head, legs slightly fetal) as the one in which I fall asleep. So I like the idea of being cradled in place by a foam bed, all the more so since my skinny 6’4” frame—especially my long neck and spine—enjoy extra support.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e I love the feeling of sinking into it at night, the way the foam gives beneath your body. It really feels like the end of the day, an easy transition into relaxation mode and a nice wind down to REM cycle. I also share the bed with a restless snoozer, so I also love not being able to sense his every toss and turn.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you could change anything, what would it be?\u003c/strong\u003e I suspect there is a reason for this, but one end of the mattress is slightly rounded.

My downstairs neighbors happened to sign for the delivery, so the mattress was left in our first-floor entry. There it sat for several days until I could find a friend with the requisite upper-body strength to help me lug the heavy, somewhat unwieldy box up three steep flights. Once I got the mattress bedside, it was easy to unbox and unpack, with plastic wrap that rolled off and a vacuum-pack membrane that I quickly sliced open with scissors. Some careful maneuvering was required to get the plastic out from under it and flip it over. Once in position, however, the compressed mattress puffed up in no time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv type=\"embed\"

mattress was better for anyone who cared about their posture. Once I started researching the kind of mattress a side sleeper actually needs, I found out I was very wrong—especially as someone who is also a stomach sleeper. Knowing that each side of the EOS Classic is customizable was really appealing, but the 100% organic GOTS certified cred is really what pulled me in.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e I love that this mattress feels like it is supportive and cradles your body but isn’t bouncy or too plush. I’m not \u003cem\u003esinking\u003c/em\u003e into it while I sleep but I feel completely at ease. It’s a really lovely sleeping experience and I feel like I now understand what a luxury mattress feels like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you could change anything, what would it be?\u003c/strong\u003e Aside from the assembly, which was a bit challenging (more on that below) I genuinely believe this is a great side sleeper mattress. I have one small complaint, which is that there isn’t a huge amount of edge support, but that hasn’t been a big issue for me personally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on?\u003c/strong\u003e Compared to my last mattress, which didn’t last very long, the EOS feels like a much more solid piece of furniture. My previous mattress was so pillowy I felt like I might float away. In stark contrast, when I lie on the EOS, I feel firmly planted—almost hugged—by the softest quilt layer, which is made of organic cotton and wool. Underneath that, I am supported by the latex and coils for added buoyancy. My hips and my neck don’t feel any sort of scrunch or discomfort, which is a huge plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you recommend it to other side sleepers?\u003c/strong\u003e I definitely would. Aside from all of the benefits I mentioned above, the nice thing about the EOS is that, if the person you sleep next to isn’t a side sleeper or prefers a different level of firmness, the mattress is totally customizable on the left or right sides. Similarly, if your sleep preferences ever change or you want to change your sleep setup, you don’t have to repurchase an entirely new mattress and send the old one to a landfill—you can buy one piece at a time, unzip it from the base layer and encasement, and add the new segment in. I described the assembly of this mattress as almost like making a tiramisu. You have to lay the foundation, sandwich in the left and right pieces side by side, and then zip the entire mattress together with the pillowy top.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow did delivery and setup go?\u003c/strong\u003e Because the mattress is super customizable, each portion comes in a separate box, which is a bit of a nightmare as a single person lugging each box up four flights of stairs by herself. So it’s not as much a \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattress-in-a-box\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emattress-in-a-box\u003c/a\u003e as it is a mattress in four boxes. And because the mattress is incredibly well made, each box is fairly dense and heavy. I will say, it is 100% worth the slightly sweaty unboxing and assembly process, but you might want to enlist a friend or partner to spare you the strain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv type=\"embed\" data-item=\"{\u0026#34;ctaHref\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/p/LfXDK5GmEGKZDm24edGFzfr7r7nv46u2QzsXewtkqG4cDQ61adJDWL78RDLhww3Fz5AiUUWkYkiV6B2XZAwg8TqJi7YXfCb9YruzWEErztPg824gUdw5WxaCSFAD2okAkNcngdEgnDVgfHjXztvP5aDqgoYX4TL9eXEsWFm8mCp6GcV5vFjXTwPXdYPtm2BruKvakztKoWe3Zckjq54biFsfC\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dangerousDek\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productBrand\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;The WinkBed\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;embedSize\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;isFirstProduct\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;isSponsored\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;offerRetailer\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;WinkBeds\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;offerUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.winkbeds.com/\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;667f2b8852b73a7c62a35e55\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;showOfferUrl\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;showPriceOnButton\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;dangerousCredit\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;showLocalisedOffers\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;isUpcEnabled\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showClampedProductDescription\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;productDescriptionLineLength\u0026#34;:5,\u0026#34;hasReadMoreFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:6,\u0026#34;hasAffiliateLinkDisabled\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;isMobileView\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;hasMultipleImageSupport\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showImageCreditText\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showMultipleImageCount\u0026#34;:4,\u0026#34;hasProsConsFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;hasRatingFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;pros\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;cons\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;rating\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isPrimeExclusive\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;667f2b8852b73a7c62a35e55\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;offers\u0026#34;:[{\u0026#34;offerUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.winkbeds.com/\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$1,799\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;currency\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;USD\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;purchaseUri\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/p/LfXDK5GmEGKZDm24edGFzfr7r7nv46u2QzsXewtkqG4cDQ61adJDWL78RDLhww3Fz5AiUUWkYkiV6B2XZAwg8TqJi7YXfCb9YruzWEErztPg824gUdw5WxaCSFAD2okAkNcngdEgnDVgfHjXztvP5aDqgoYX4TL9eXEsWFm8mCp6GcV5vFjXTwPXdYPtm2BruKvakztKoWe3Zckjq54biFsfC\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;reducedPrice\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$1,499\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sellerName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;WinkBeds\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;countryCode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;US\u0026#34;}],\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;unified_product_card\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;hasMultipleImage\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showProsConsData\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;showBadge\u0026#34;:false}\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"upc_667f2b8852b73a7c62a35e55\" type=\"embed\"\u003eThe WinkBed\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv name=\"accordion\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eHelpful to soothe those battling chronic hip, shoulder, and back pain, strong edge support and motion isolation\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eLuxury firm option leans a bit on the softer side\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMattress type:\u003c/strong\u003e Innerspring and foam\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHeight:\u003c/strong\u003e 13.5 inches\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShipping:\u003c/strong\u003e Free (in a box)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSleep trial:\u003c/strong\u003e 120 nights\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWarranty:\u003c/strong\u003e Lifetime warranty\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSizes available:\u003c/strong\u003e Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReviewer:\u003c/strong\u003e Mark Burka, contributor\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow firm is the mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e Medium firm.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow comfortable is it?\u003c/strong\u003e Very comfortable—it\u0026#39;s like sleeping on a hotel bed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs a side sleeper, what attracted you to this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e I wanted a mattress that would provide multiple benefits for me and my partner, as we both have different sleeping preferences. I run hot and prefer to sleep on my side and turn to my stomach. He runs cold and prefers to sleep on his back. This mattress was particularly beneficial as it did end up alleviating hip pain and lower back pain.

Overall, the mattress is great for sleeping on the side, but also for when switching from stomach and/or to back.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI love that the mattress has extra-edge anti-sag support, which makes the bed sturdy for everyone: back sleepers, stomach sleepers, combination sleepers, etc. It also has motion isolation technology, which reduces motion transfer across the bed, preventing you from feeling your partner turning around in bed. Although the mattress is designated as firm, the pillow top has a light fluffy feel due to the gel-infused pillow top that is unlike any other mattress I’ve experienced.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you could change anything, what would it be?\u003c/strong\u003e This mattress has different firmness options, and the aptly named “firmer” is a step up from the luxury firm. I would have chosen that because the pillow top gives the bed a fluffy feel. When I ordered it, I was worried that the firmest option would be too firm for me and my partner. However, I think I should have gone for it. Winkbed’s firmer option is specifically designed for “heavier” people over 200–250 pounds. They even have a firmness option called “plus” for people who weigh more than 250 pounds. The different firmness levels ensure that the mattress will never sag, regardless of the sleeper’s body type.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on?\u003c/strong\u003e Honestly, this mattress is a dream, with the price point being under $2,000 for a California King.

pressure-relieving mattresses designed with side sleepers (like you and me!) in mind. Their construction focuses on core side sleeping needs like supportive alignment, pressure relief, and just the right amount of body conforming—all of which I was interested to put to the test.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e I’m not kidding when I say there’s so much to love about this mattress. The first time I flopped onto the bed, I immediately felt like every element in the mattress was working together to provide the perfect balance of comfort and support. This is mainly thanks to the substantial seven layer construction which includes a layer of individually-wrapped coils, breathable Airfoam, and a plush pillow top cover that cradles your body in a particularly soothing way.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you could change anything, what would it be?\u003c/strong\u003e Not a thing!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this mattress compare to others you’ve slept on?\u003c/strong\u003e Before trying the Nolah mattress, my preferences definitely leaned more toward soft than firm, but Nolah’s “luxury firm” Evolution mattress made me second-guess myself.

Unless you’re very strong, I would suggest having help to bring the box into your home, especially if stairs are involved, as the box still weighs about 80 to 90 pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"how-we-tested-the-best-mattresses-for-side-sleepers\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow We Tested the Best Mattresses for Side Sleepers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattress-in-a-box\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emattresses-in-a-box\u003c/a\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-best-affordable-mattresses-for-all-types-of-sleepers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaffordable mattresses\u003c/a\u003e, we thoroughly test and recommend beds \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e after bringing them in our homes and sleeping on them for weeks, months, and even years at a time.

As a side sleeper, you have to balance between the idea of sinking in versus support.” As an example, he continues “If you’re a 125-pound person, getting a medium-soft mattress might make sense, but a 300-pound person would get no support from that same mattress. The larger person would need a medium-firm mattress.” Nicely, many of the mattresses we cover offer firmness scales (or different firmness options) on their sites so you can customize your new bed to your liking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMattress material:\u003c/strong\u003e In addition to thinking about firmness, side sleepers should consider the material of any new mattress. Dr. Breus recommends avoiding mattresses with memory foam at the top layers. “Side sleepers should avoid memory foam close to the surface unless the foam has a lot of buoyancy. It’s all based on height and weight, so someone who is bigger, you would want innerspring coils,” he recommends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShopping for two sleepers:\u003c/strong\u003e What about if you have two sleepers of varying sizes? In cases where one partner is larger, Dr. Breus recommends choosing a mattress that is suited to the heavier person, and then adding a \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/mattress-toppers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emattress topper\u003c/a\u003e to accommodate the lighter person, if they prefer more cushioning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdditional features:\u003c/strong\u003e Some other features to look for are a 100-plus night trial period as noted above, which most newer mattress brands offer. This allows you to sleep on it like you own it for a few months and notice how you feel without any pressure. Speaking of pressure, you should pay attention to lumbar or hip pain, restfulness, if you’re too warm or cold, and whether you find yourself waking up to readjust often throughout the night. Lastly, if you live alone, paying a few extra dollars for white-glove delivery might be worth it considering setting up even mattresses-in-a-box can be a bit of a heavy ordeal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"types-of-mattresses-for-side-sleepers\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eTypes of Mattresses for Side Sleepers\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to different kinds of mattresses, you can lump them into four main categories: Innerspring mattresses, all-foam mattresses, latex mattresses, and hybrid mattresses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInnerspring mattresses\u003c/strong\u003e have a layer of wrapped steel coils at their core, and they offer responsive support for people with back pain and muscle soreness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMemory foam mattresses\u003c/strong\u003e kicked off the mattress-in-a-box craze.
