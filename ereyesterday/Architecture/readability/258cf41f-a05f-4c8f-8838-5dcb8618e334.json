In this biweekly roundup, AD PRO has everything you need to know.In the NewsA pivotal legal win for Jean Royère’s estateA sofa from the Ours Polaire (Polar Bear) collection, which is now are now officially trademarks of Jean Royère SAS. Photo: Delphine ChanetIn 2022, the Estate of Jean Royère and Jean Royère SAS, which honors and faithfully reproduces the 20th-century French talent’s furniture designs, filed a lawsuit against designer Denis de la Mésière and his atelier, Edition Modern, alleging that the studio had been manufacturing and selling unauthorized replicas of more than 50 original Royère designs. Recently the court ruled in favor of the Estate and Jean Royère SAS, validating claims of trademark and copyright infringement and unfair competition. The defendants have paid an undisclosed sum as compensation, ceased using the Royère name, and permanently terminated all sales of the illegitimate products. The victory protects the Royère oeuvre for generations to come—and underscores the importance of provenance and authenticity in the industry.AD PRO Hears……that Dunes Point Capital has acquired a majority interest in trade furniture and textiles company Kravet Inc. for an undisclosed amount. The Kravet family, which is now in its fifth generation of leadership since the textile house’s founding in 1918, announced they will continue to lead the corporate operations and maintain a significant ownership position.Design HappeningsDollhouses go designer at the third annual La Petite Maison GalaOn December 4, Houston design aficionados flocked to Hotel ZaZa in the city’s Museum District for the après-ski-themed La Petite Maison Gala. Founded by local designer Alexandra Killion, the buzzy benefit tasks Texas-based architects, designers, and builders to construct fantastical dollhouses, which are then auctioned off to support a local nonprofit. This year, the miniature marvels by Jennifer Barron Interiors, Courtney Barton, Elizabeth Garrett Interiors, Amy Kummer Interiors, Kristen Leigh Studio, Jean Liu Design, Wills Design Associates, and AD PRO Directory’s Avery Cox Design garnered $213,000 for Family Houston, which provides counseling and employment coaching. Structurally crafted by Reagan \u0026 André Architecture Studio and Alair Homes Houston, the miniature forms spanned aesthetics: Barron’s Southern Georgian–style abode flashed a teeny delft tile fireplace, while Cox’s Art Deco meets Greco Roman villa was coated in jewel tones.AD PRO Hears……Salon Art + Design is saying howdy to Dallas! Come March 26, the luxury collectible art and design fair is headed South for its inaugural four-day Texas show.…that limewash’s reign shows no signs of slowing. This season, Color Atelier has teamed up with interior designer Sarah Sherman Samuel to launch a seven-shade collection of custom limewash paints, including breathable hues like Summer Sky and Buttercup Yellow.OpeningsNewly unveiled Gem Home announces inaugural holiday makers marketPictured back-left are the Gabier-constructed Gem Home soap dispensers. The store is located at 181 Mott Street in downtown Manhattan. Photo: Sean DavidsonGem Home, chef Flynn McGarry’s artisanal cafe and home goods shop that opened earlier this season on New York’s Lower East Side, has homestyle roots. In the entry, refreshingly plain cubist wood shelves display farm-fresh produce alongside rustic vintage finds and a refined contemporary design selection—think David Mellor tea sets and exclusive Tetris blocklike soap dispensers made with ceramicist Shane Gabier. (They’re filled with Ffern quince-scented soap special to Gem too.) But this merry season—on December 21 and 22, to be exact—Gem Home is upping the frill with its inaugural holiday makers market. Holiday shoppers can peruse LA ceramic artist Ana Corrigan’s ruffled cocktail-culture-inspired lamps while nibbling on oven-fresh cookies and sipping mulled apple cider. Save room for Milanese designer Chris Fusaro’s playful pasta sculptures rendered in bronze too.From left to right: Samantha Sano, Joslyn Taylor, and Christine Visneau of Shop Swoon. Courtesy of Shawn ThompsonA new resource for artisan objects worth swooning overMultidisciplinary practice Studio Swoon has ventured into e-commerce with Shop Swoon, a collection of furniture and decor that reflect founder Samantha Sano and partner Joslyn Taylor’s fervor for scouring vintage shops and collaborating with artists for one-of-a-kind pieces. With the help of chief curation officer Christine Visneau, Sano and Taylor have packed the Second Floor, their Dallas showroom (open the first Thursday of every month), with the likes of dusty pink mother-of-pearl caviar spoons, bubble-adorned amber lamps, and side tables made of stacked Mexican stone orbs.A concept shop reaches from the Nile to the DanubeThe couple’s acclaimed From the Nile to the Danube show at the Egyptian Embassy in Vienna in 2022 was their impetus to open a storefront. Photography Courtesy of Sobek \u0026 Schnurl ShopWhen Sobek \u0026 Schnurl opened earlier this year in Vienna, it was clear this concept shop was like no other. Where else could you find a decoratively painted canoe sofa? A tambourine lamp? Papyrus and lotus motifs and architectural fretwork vibing Egyptian, whitewashed finishes, or Scandi blue? Architect and interior designer Victor Sobki and his partner in life and work, Caroline Carnbring, mix their Egyptian and Swedish heritages in a modern, artisanal aesthetic. Carnbring designs hand-knotted chevron kilims, while Sobki reimagines the pharaoh to the folk (see the Tut chair and stool and stenciled checkerboard bar, respectively). Natural materials—ceramic, glass, metal, alabaster, stones, wood and cotton—reflect Arts and Crafts traditions spanning several hundred years. Modern art, including pop and digital, rounds out the curated collection, all handmade by artisans in Egypt. —Elaine MarkoutsasExhibitionsApparatus captures inner light with mixed-media Subjects showJivan, Athena, and Victor Calderone for Apparatus. Photo: Matthew PlacekIn 2014, design studio Apparatus unveiled Cylinder, a lighting series that has now evolved into the modular Cylinder: System. Infusing the product launch with a warm, human dimension is Subjects: Biographies in Light, on view through January 17 at Apparatus’s New York gallery. Within it, artist Matthew Placek and photographer Dina Litovsky have dreamed up 7 films and 19 moody portraits of 24 creatives, including studio artistic director Gabriel Hendifar, Directory designer Andre Mellone, and tastemaker Athena Calderone and kin, all basking in the glow of those bespoke Cylinder luminaires.Tile-studded tables and writerly goods debut at Bennett Schlesinger’s New York showGalerie Timonier is located at 246 W Broadway in Tribeca. Photo: Marco GallowayBennet Schlesinger’s ethereal pendants, table, and floor lamps are simultaneously grounding and experimental. These disparate sensibilities are on full display at Galerie Timonier, marking the Ojai and Costa Mesa, California–based designer’s New York debut. On view (by appointment only) through January 25, I Too Am, a title derived from a poem by Pier Paolo Pasolini, comprises the artist’s new bamboo-and-paper lighting and paintings. Also on display, for the first time, is furniture: An upholstered daybed, coffee table, portable bookcase, bookshelf, writer’s desk, chair, and stools pay homage to Roycroft furniture from the Arts and Crafts movement. The pieces weave woods like afromosia, poplar, and padauk with tile inlays reminiscent of sea glass or found geodes.AD PRO Hears……that despite celebrating its 150th anniversary this year, Louis Poulsen is as relevant as ever. In this month’s Important Design Sale at Sotheby’s, the legacy lighting studio presented 12 rare lamps designed by the late Poul Henningsen—and far exceeded estimates. Notably, the 1943-designed PH Spiral ceiling light sold for $216,000—more than four times its estimate.Project SpotlightRafael de Cárdenas offers a New York lens to SkimsSkims New York is located on Fifth Avenue between 51st and 52nd Streets. Photo: William AbranowiczSkims, the inclusive shapewear and clothing label founded by Kim Kardashian and Emma and Jens Grede, tapped interior designer Rafael de Cárdenas to transform its new three-story New York flagship. The 6,750-square-foot store is housed in a Fifth Avenue Beaux Arts mansion, formerly the home of George W. Vanderbilt. For the interiors, de Cárdenas responded with fittingly elegant interiors. Take the 15-foot-tall Vanessa Beecroft sculpture that greets customers on the ground floor, the garments laid out on regal Corian displays, or the graceful curves and arches swathed in nude Ultrasuede. A bevy of mannequins lends a touch of whimsy, and the flattering fitting rooms, which feature illuminated ceilings and wraparound mirrors, nod to the Skims’ comfort-driven mission.",
