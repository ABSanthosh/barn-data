  "text": "curved geometries shape Wonderland Elementary School by JFAKJohn Friedman Alice Kimm Architects (JFAK) takes over the design of the Wonderland Elementary School in Los Angeles. The new kindergarten addition consists of two new classrooms, support spaces, and outdoor learning areas, designed for an existing hillside public school. The project incorporates a sculptural building form intended to facilitate early childhood learning through spatial variety and environmental engagement.The structure presents a restrained profile to the adjacent residential context. Around its exterior, a series of colored louvers provides shading and visual articulation. Facing the interior of the school campus, the building form transitions into curved geometries that introduce spatial dynamism. A large roof overhang extends outward to offer protection from sun and rain, establishing a semi-sheltered outdoor zone that supports informal gathering and extended learning activities.all images by Benny Chan/Fotoworkslarge skylights bring natural light to the school’s interiorStudio’s John Friedman Alice Kimm Architects (JFAK) design follows principles of environmental sustainability and meets Collaborative for High Performance Schools (CHPS) Verification standards. The classrooms are oriented to optimize natural daylight and include controlled views toward the campus, surrounding neighborhoods, and nearby wooded areas. Ceiling sections remain partially open, allowing visibility into the mechanical and structural systems to support educational curiosity.Top-lighting strategies include the use of large skylights and solar tubes to minimize reliance on artificial lighting and enhance interior daylight quality. Additional features include custom-designed storage units, integrated reading areas, and low-height seating beneath the extended roof edge, scaled appropriately for early learners. A central roof aperture equipped with colored polycarbonate fins introduces filtered light that shifts with the sun’s position, producing varied color effects throughout the day.
