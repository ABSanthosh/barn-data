  "text": "Tucked high on a hill in the El Dorado Club, Los Cabos, Mexico, the El Dorado Residence offers a soulful retreat for a Seattle-based family of eight. Designed by Susan Marinello Interiors, this vacation home is as much about cultural connection as it is about coastal relaxation. With views across Baja’s arid landscape and curated interiors that celebrate the richness of Mexican art and craftsmanship, it’s a true barefoot-luxury escape built for deep breaths, shared meals, and sunlit memories. The living room is a study in contrast, its neutral, modern shell becomes a gallery for rich textiles, collected art, and sculptural lighting. Anchored by a bold Frank Arnold painting sourced locally in San Jose del Cabo, the space welcomes conversation and lounging in equal measure. Natural textures like seagrass and rope weave through ottomans and rugs, grounding the room in regional craft traditions. Soft, neutral-toned upholstery allows the vivid accents to take center stage, making the living space feel layered yet light. The dining space centers around a striking Parota wood slab table, custom-made from a native Mexican tree species and paired with woven materials that echo the coastal desert palette. Overhead, handmade light fixtures from artisans in Oaxaca and Mexico City cast a warm, intimate glow. The kitchen celebrates the same ethos of tactile warmth, with indigenous woven baskets adding subtle texture and functionality. It’s a space designed for slow breakfasts, fresh fruit, and the hum of gathering. Perched on the third and fourth floors of a Hilltop Villa, the home’s rooftop outdoor space is pure Baja magic. With its elevated position, the views stretch wide and endless, offering a daily invitation to bask, breathe, and soak in the sun. The wood pergola casts patterned shadows that change with the day, while a pair of circular loungers in soft desert rose invite you to sink in and stay awhile, their colorful pillows echoing the tones of clay, sand, and sunset. A surfboard-turned-art piece adds a playful, coastal energy to the concrete wall, and lush potted plants soften the space with their broad green leaves. A bar-height dining table and outdoor kitchen creates a casual gathering spot for afternoon snacks or late-night drinks. This outdoor space continues, where a wall with horizontal slats plays with light and shadow, letting in glimpses of the landscape beyond while still creating privacy. A long wooden dining table anchors the space, while the white and wood chairs keep the look fresh and breezy, perfect for lingering over a sunset meal. A cushioned sofa with bold, patterned pillows ties back in with the theme of the home. Each bedroom balances modern restraint with personal storytelling. Custom soft goods and casegoods echo the natural material palette, while curated artwork and textiles lend depth and personality. The bunk room, a highlight for younger guests or visiting friends, bursts with playful energy, decorated with a collection of animal masks that nod to Mexico’s rich folk traditions. The bathrooms are sanctuaries of quiet luxury. Natural woods, stone textures, and minimal lines make them feel spa-like. These aren’t just utilitarian spaces; they’re designed for unwinding and recharging between ocean dips and dinner under the stars. The El Dorado Residence isn’t just a holiday home, it’s a fully lived-in expression of culture, family, and place.

The lounge chair, angled just so, is the perfect spot to stretch out with a book or sip something cold. Embroidered pillows bring a dash of color and personality, tying in beautifully with the deep blue artwork on the wall. That textile piece adds just enough contrast to make the room feel considered and collected. \" srcset=\"https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-060625-1234-02.jpg 1920w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-060625-1234-02-940x816.jpg 940w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-060625-1234-02-800x694.jpg 800w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-060625-1234-02-768x666.jpg 768w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-060625-1234-02-1536x1333.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1920\" height=\"2359\" src=\"https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03.jpg\" alt=\"This bunk room strikes the perfect balance between playful and polished. The built-in beds, painted in a warm sandy beige, feel sturdy and thoughtfully designed, each with its own cozy nook and a drawer underneath for tucking things away. Crisp white bedding is brought to life with colorful embroidered pillows that hint at desert sunsets and handmade charm. A few bold ikat accents in burnt orange and deep navy add just the right amount of energy without overwhelming the calm. The soft ombré rug grounds the room and invites bare feet, while the scattered floor cushions suggest that this space was made for lounging, chatting, and a bit of mischief. \" srcset=\"https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03.jpg 1920w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03-940x1155.jpg 940w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03-800x983.jpg 800w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03-768x944.jpg 768w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03-1250x1536.jpg 1250w, https://www.contemporist.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/modern-bedroom-design-bunk-beds-060625-1234-03-1667x2048.jpg 1667w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe bathrooms are sanctuaries of quiet luxury.
