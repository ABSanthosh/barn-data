  "text": "a research hub beneath a sculptural roofA curving, solar-clad mass timber structure is set to rise from the historic grounds of New York City‘s Governors Island. The Skidmore, Owings \u0026 Merrill (SOM)-designed structure, set to complete in 2028, will house the upcoming Center for Climate Solutions. While earlier plans for the net-zero campus were unveiled in April 2023, the design has since been updated to reveal a simplified building, its sloping rooftop punctuated with ribbon-like skylights. A research hub masquerading as architectural sculpture, the project toes the line between radical environmental ambition and deft urban insertion, reshaping one of the city’s most iconic islands in the process.visualizations courtesy The New York Climate Exchange and SOMnew york city’s ambitious climate statementThe Center for Climate Solutions on Governors Island will stand as a monumental statement about where the city’s priorities lie in a warming world. Originally born out of a 2020 rezoning proposal, the project has evolved into a consortium-driven initiative led by The New York Climate Exchange, anchored by Stony Brook University. The team at SOM first joined the effort in 2023, bringing its signature clarity and global-scale design expertise to the table.The center will function as a year-round campus and incubator, expected to serve thousands annually — including 600 postsecondary students, 6,000 workforce trainees, and up to thirty startups focused on climate solutions. More than a think tank in isolation, the campus will support K–12 education programs and house new initiatives like the Trust’s Living Lab and the expansion of the Urban Assembly New York Harbor School, reinforcing the island’s longstanding ties to public service and education.the Center for Climate Solutions is designed by SOM with a curving, solar-clad mass timber structurean open, mass timber structureSOM’s updated renderings show a campus raised eight feet above the current grade to combat rising sea levels — a subtle but vital architectural gesture. Mass timber and expansive glazing define the material palette, while large-format windows frame natural views and open the interiors out toward the waterfront. A newly revealed convening hall sets the tone for public engagement, with green spaces and outdoor labs threaded throughout, offering flexibility and functionality in every season.The design of the Center for Climate Solutions on Governors Island continues to evolve toward fluidity, quite literally. The building’s sinuous form echoes the island’s coastal setting, while its solar roof now ripples like a wave, creating a dynamic gesture visible from the harbor. This motion-driven form is more than just visual flourish—it represents a tectonic shift in architectural language toward biomimicry and adaptability.a wave-like solar roof adds a sculptural element visible from Yankee PierThe project aims for True Zero Waste certification and full alignment with the Living Building Challenge, a high bar that no current building in New York has reached. With these goals, the Center for Climate Solutions on Governors Island is expected to become one of the most environmentally ambitious projects in the country, deploying energy-positive strategies and zero-waste operations from the ground up.While Governors Island has been long-known as a summertime escape, it is preparing for a new identity. It will become a climate-forward, year-round space for research, education, and public dialogue. The Center for Climate Solutions will host talks, exhibitions, and events to engage New Yorkers and visitors alike — positioning the island as both a Saturday getaway for New Yorkers, and as a proving ground for the sustainable city of the future.SOM’s design elevates the site by eight feet to prepare for future sea level risethe campus will serve students, researchers, and businesses focused on climate scienceproject info:project title: Center for Climate Solutionsarchitecture: Skidmore, Owings \u0026 Merrill (SOM) | @skidmoreowingsmerrilllocation: Governor’s Island, New York, NYcollaborator: Stony Brook University | @stonybrookucompletion: expected 2028visualizations: courtesy The New York Climate Exchange and SOM",
