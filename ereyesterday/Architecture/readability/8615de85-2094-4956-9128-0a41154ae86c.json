  "text": "Building Beyond Pastorie Revives Communal Vicarage GardenAs part of the Building Beyond Borders postgraduate program at Hasselt University, the Building Beyond Pastorie project introduces a pavilion and an outdoor earth oven as communal gathering spaces. The structures are located in the garden of an abandoned vicarage in Helchteren, Belgium. The design process incorporated participatory methods and prioritized bio-based, geo-based, and reclaimed materials. The intervention serves as a model for architecture that integrates environmental considerations with social engagement. The design team collaborated with BC Materials, a workers’ cooperative that transforms excavated earth into building materials, experimenting with sustainable material use. The site, an abandoned vicarage (Pastorie), is part of a broader municipal initiative to transform the space into a community center. Due to the impact of a major road that divided the village and disrupted its social fabric, the area lacked a central gathering space. The initiative aligns with the ‘Noord-Zuid Limburg’ redevelopment project, which seeks to restore community connectivity.The design consists of two key elements, a wooden pavilion positioned within the garden’s tree canopy to create a quiet retreat, and an earth oven placed near the vicarage to function as a visible landmark. Building Beyond Pastorie project was developed through extensive research and engagement with local residents. Construction was carried out by students with direct involvement from the community, who contributed tools, materials, and labor through workshops and a building festival. Local businesses and organizations also provided support, including material donations and logistical assistance.all images courtesy of Hasselt Universitypavilion and oven use Circular Construction and Local MaterialsSustainability guided the selection of construction materials, with a focus on sourcing locally and reclaiming elements from structures scheduled for demolition due to the Noord-Zuid road redevelopment. The team designed the reversible pavilion to be deconstructed, removed, and reused, thereby reducing waste and impact on the site. Instead of traditional concrete foundations, screw piles were installed on one side of the structure, while the opposite side rests on a foundation composed of reclaimed sand, gravel, and paving stones. These materials were topped with precast concrete elements that can be easily dismantled.The pavilion’s wooden framework was built from repurposed timber donated by a local construction company, extending the lifespan of existing materials. The roof was clad with wooden shakes, handcrafted from logs sourced through sustainable forest management in the Meerdaal forest near Leuven. Inside, a bench constructed from compressed earth bricks (CEBs), provided by BC Materials, contributes to both structural stability and seating. The bench’s weight helps anchor the structure against wind forces, complementing the foundation system. The earth oven follows a similar construction approach. Its foundation and plinth were built using reclaimed materials, while the oven itself consists of molded earth bricks (MEBs) finished with lime plaster for durability. This approach ensures material efficiency and long-term resilience. By integrating circular construction principles and community participation, Building Beyond Pastorie project demonstrates how architecture can respond to both environmental and social needs.the Building Beyond Pastorie project introduces a pavilion and an outdoor earth oven for communal uselocated in the garden of an abandoned vicarage, the project serves as a gathering spacethe wooden framework was built using repurposed timberhandcrafted wooden shakes, sourced from sustainably managed forests, clad the pavilion roofa bench made from compressed earth bricks contributes to both seating and structural stability",
