  "text": "No matter what theory of well-being one subscribes to, shelter is a basic human need. However, many of the world’s 120 million–plus refugees don’t know where they might find theirs next. Whether suddenly displaced by famine, natural disaster, or war, those urgently in need of a safe place to stay must often rely on refuge provided by humanitarian organizations. Such shelters can range from tented camps to architect-designed housing, all built easily and quickly.Since its inception in 2010, Swedish nonprofit Better Shelter has partnered with the IKEA Foundation to offer such protection in the form of flat-packed structures, fabricated of steel frames and insulated polypropylene panels, that can be assembled in a mere four hours to create nearly-200-square-foot gable-roofed living spaces. “Although our houses are meant to be temporary until a new permanent home is found, many people live in them for several years,” reveals Better Shelter founder Johan Karlsson. “It is clear to us, from the people we meet in our work, that the possibility of being able to settle in is important for the feeling of some kind of normality.” Thus, the organization engaged three photographers—Ci Demis, Ali Haj Suleimans, and AD contributor Björn Wallander—to visit refugee settlements in Brazil, Chad, India, Turkey, and Syria and turn their lenses on the shelters of their temporary residents.Outside of the Boa Vista Transit Camp in Brazil. “In all the different places I went to, they all had recreated some kind of feeling of the home that they had to leave behind,” explains Wallander, who has shot the houses of figures like Alex Rodriguez, Michael S. Smith, and Adam Lippes for AD. In Boa Vista, Brazil, a Venezuelan climber named Leo used his knowledge of advanced rope knots to hang a rocking horse from the ceiling for his daughter, the photographer observed. In Cachar, India, where refugees had been evacuated after a flood, “I saw the most colorfully decorated shelters,” he adds. “People had covered walls and roofs in beautiful pieces of fabrics to make the shelter softer and more personal.” In a shelter here that Mongal shares with his older sister, “saris were hung on bamboo rods, making it a beautiful interior fixture as much as a functional wardrobe,” Wallander recalls.19-year old Mohammad pulls out a generator from his shelter and drags it through the sand across the courtyard. He briefly disappears, then returns with an extension cord which lets him move the generator even further away, so the engine's sound won’t drown out the TV. After checking the diesel level, he gives the generator’s pull cord a forceful tug, and its distinctive rumbling starts. Within seconds, children start appearing through an opening in the grass fence surrounding the courtyard—they all know that the sound of the generator means that a movie is about to start. Images of these and many other families Wallander encountered during the project’s duration were hung alongside stories of their daily lives at “What Makes A Home,” a traveling exhibition that debuted at New York’s Ideal Glass Studios from September 25 to 27. The show offers glimpses of the routines, hardships, and creature comforts that define life in these temporary shelters, as well as the ways residents have used furnishings, decorations, or other personalized styling to make spaces their own, in the face of whatever tumultuous circumstances initially displaced them.“I have traveled a lot of places and know that around the world humans and their needs are pretty similar. We want to feel good and safe; we want to be able to leave our home in the morning knowing it will be there when we return; we want [our house] to look nice for the people we care about; we want to create a space where we can do our rituals, have our traditions, and sleep at night without worrying about air strikes,” says the photographer.In Farchana, Chad, Hassan (right) sits with his two-year-old son, who is playing with a pigtailed, pale-skinned doll. Hassan and his wife fled Darfur on foot last summer, nine months ago now. “But our circumstances are vastly different because some of us were lucky to be born in countries where there is peace and stability, while others were not.” Although residents in the shelters he shot may be making the best of their situations, the pictures are honest in depicting their struggles, including limited resources, a lack of food and water, and fear for their safety.“While people were relieved to have survived,” says Wallander, “a shelter in a refugee camp is not a home. It’s temporary.”",
