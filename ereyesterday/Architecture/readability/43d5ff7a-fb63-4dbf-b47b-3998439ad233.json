The project stand humbly among the high-rise offices and luxury developments of the Sudirman Central Business District (SCBD) in Jakarta. Rather than mimicking the corporate expression of its neighbors, the café has taken shape as a modern take on the ‘traditional tropical house’ — the locally-based design team notes that the building’s gabled roof evokes the architectural heritage of Indonesia. Beyond its visual connection to its context, the tropical design addresses functional needs and climatic challenges, establishing the café as a community space and a sustainable urban intervention.images © Kung Photographsplatform architects curates tropical titik temu caféOne of the defining features of the Titik Temu Café is its tiered rooftop, which the team at Platform Architects designs to both enhance the café’s seating capacity and create a unique environment for visitors. Positioned to frame views of Jakarta’s towering skyscrapers, this rooftop invites guests to enjoy treetop outdoor dining while being immersed in the urban context. The design incorporates glass panels between each tier, ensuring natural light penetrates the interiors during the day, while reducing direct heat exposure. Meanwhile, the gabled roof serves a practical purpose by managing water runoff during the rainy season, demonstrating a thoughtful response to the local climate by the locally-based architects.The café’s design fosters social interaction through its tribune seating arrangement, which functions as a multi-purpose urban plaza. This seating area encourages visitors to gather, socialize, and engage with one another, transforming the café into a lively community hub. By creating a space that invites both leisure and conversation, the design furthers the project’s role as a social destination and contributes to the broader cultural and urban fabric of Jakarta’s Sudirman Central Business District.Titik Temu Café is located in Jakarta’s SCBD park, blending nature and urban lifethe design features a tropical house-like structure with a gabled roofPlatform Architects created a two-story café that integrates with the city’s landscapethe tiered rooftop increases seating capacity and offers views of skyscrapers",
