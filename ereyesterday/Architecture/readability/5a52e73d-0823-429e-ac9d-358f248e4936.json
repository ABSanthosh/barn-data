  "text": "Whether you have carpets or hardwood floors that could use a deep clean, the best robot vacuums are here to help—no hands-on work required. While these home appliances are some of the sleekest you’ll find in the world of cleaning gadgets, they’re not one-hit wonders—robovacs have been around for decades and are only getting smarter and more convenient to use for busy households. In an effort to streamline your routine with picks that are actually worth the investment, our editors and contributors continually try out robot vacuums in our own homes, from old-faithful brands like iRobot and Eufy as well as the latest innovations from big-names like Dyson.What’s more, our top picks are designed to do everything from collect loose pet hair to tackle stains and spills with mopping technology. And most of our favorites are available on Amazon and constantly on sale, so you can snag a luxury cleaner to meet your needs at a range of costs. You’ll want something that’s ultra-intuitive, easy to use, and chic enough to blend in with any modern home. Ahead, find our list of the best robot vacuums for you.Our Top Picks for the Best Robot Vacuums:Best Overall Robot Vacuum: Eufy X10 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum, $900 $700Most Stylish Cleaner: Dyson 360 Vis Nav Robot Vacuum, $1,199 $1,000The Budget-Friendly Pick: Shark DetectPro Self-Empty Robot Vacuum, $600 $450Best Wet-Dry Combo: ILIFE V5s Pro 2, 2-in-1 Robot Vacuum and Mop Combo, $200 $100For Hardwood Floors: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni Robot Vacuum, $1,500 $800Best Luxury Robot Vacuum: Eufy Omni S1 Pro Robot Vacuum, $1,500The Pet-Parent Approved Pick: iRobot Roomba i7+, $730 $650Best Robot Vacuums, OverallEufy X10 Pro Omni Robot VacuumUpsidesSelf-cleaningGently scrubs hard floorsDownsidesPriceySuction power: 8,000 PaDustbin capacity: 2.5 litersSelf-empty doc: YesMultifloor mapping: YesWorks with: AlexaThe setup process was easy. After plugging in the Omni station and recharging the robot vacuum, I filled the water tank. Next I downloaded the app and set up no-go zones and no-mop zones. (Note: Make sure to position the Omni station in a place that has a strong Wi-Fi signal.) There’s also an option to schedule a cleaning mode and select a suction power level on my phone. However, it can also be controlled with Alexa or Google Assistant.Tester: Terri Williams, contributorFloor type: Hardwood floors and carpet with stairsMy experience: The Eufy X10 Pro Omni provides a thorough clean. The robot vacuum has 8,000Pa suction and a multidirectional floating roller brush with rubber and bristles, which does an excellent job of removing dust and debris from carpets. When mopping, the MopMaster 2.0 has dual mopping pads and 180 rotations per minute to gently scrub hard floors.Using the same obstacle-avoidance algorithm as the self-driving car industry, the Eufy X10 Pro Omni also detects and avoids my house shoes and other items on the floor. Since it does such a good job of working in the background, I usually don’t notice it. Therefore, the voice reminders like “low battery, heading home,” and “start scheduled cleaning,” are helpful in keeping me abreast of the machine’s activities. If the battery gets low, it will recharge and then pick up cleaning in the same spot where it left off.In addition to controlling the robot vacuum via my phone, I can also use Alexa or Google Assistant for voice control. Eufy’s Omni Station self-empties the dust and debris into the dust bag, which can hold two months worth of dust. The clean water tank holds a generous amount, so I don’t have to refill it after each cleaning cycle. When the water tank in the robot vacuum runs out of water, it refills itself at the station. The station also uses the water in the tank to wash the mop pads and then it dries them, so I don’t have to worry about soggy pads developing mold or mildew.The bottom line: I love a robot vacuum with mapping capabilities that performs excellently and only requires minimal effort on my part. This one fits the bill and makes it easy to keep my home clean.Dyson 360 Vis Nav Robot VacuumUpsidesIntuitive controls on the dock and the MyDyson smartphone appDesign-friendly buildDownsidesSome customers note problems with navigationDustbin capacity: 0.13 gallonsSelf-empty doc: NoMultifloor mapping: NoWorks with: Amazon EchoI’m pretty sure Dyson has a place on every best vacuum article we’ve produced. For example, both the V15 Detect Submarine and the Gen 5 Outsize are on my list of the best vacuums for hardwood floors, and the brand is also on the list of the best cordless stick vacuums. I consider Dyson to be one of the very brands in this cleaning category. And the Dyson 360 Vis Nav is the company’s first robot vacuum. I was eager to see if it would perform as well as Dyson’s other vacuum products.Dyson is known for colorful vacuum cleaners and the 350 Vis Nav is no exception. There’s no mistaking this bluish-purple vacuum with red LCD touchscreen on the top for another product. The first step to setting it up was to download the MyDyson app, set up the dock, and then place the robot on the dock so it could charge.Tester: Terri Williams, contributorFloor type: As mentioned, for my home’s combination of hardwood floors, low-pile carpet, and throw rugs, suction power is an important feature. And the primary reason I’m using a robot vacuum is so it can reach places I can’t. So I like vacuums that can clean right up to the edge of my baseboards and pick up dust hiding in corners.My experience: Since Dyson is usually on the cutting edge of technology, honestly, I was surprised that the 360 Vis Nav didn’t have a self-emptying, self-cleaning dock. It also doesn’t have a mopping function. Admittedly, the advantage of a “regular” robot vacuum is that it doesn’t take up much space, which is a problem I have with the bigger, bulkier robot vacuums that have all of the bells and whistles.Once I got past the lack of these features, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the robot vacuum includes all of the other functions you’d expect on a high-end offering. For example, I can control the robot from either the LCD touchscreen on the dock or from the MyDyson app on my phone. Smart voice control is another option.The robot creates a map of my home with the app, and from my phone I can create cleaning zones, and also see where the robot has already cleaned. For more than one level, maps can be created for each story of the home. I can also create specific zones to clean (or to avoid cleaning). In addition, I can determine which areas the robot vacuum should clean with the brush bar off to avoid damage.The vacuum returns to the dock when the battery is low, and after charging, continues cleaning. The run time can get up to 65 minutes, but keep in mind that in boost mode, the battery runs out sooner. There are four modes: auto (the one I typically use), quick, quiet, and boost.Powerful suction is apparently one of Dyson’s core values, and I was impressed (but not surprised) that this little robot vacuum didn’t leave anything on the floor. The brush bars provide edge cleaning, and that’s another feature that allows it to pick up dirt and debris along the baseboards.Disposing the debris is a simple process of pressing the removal latch, lifting the bin out, and then carrying it to the trash can. Fortunately, the release button is on the top and the trash comes out from the bottom, so my hand never touches anything. To be on the safe side, I empty the debris into a large zip lock bag inside of the trash can and then seal it.The bottom line: I love Dyson’s 360 Vis Nav—but I didn’t have to purchase it. For the price, there are more economical choices that can also clean well. At this price point, mopping capabilities, as well as self-cleaning, and self-emptying features should be included. However, if you’re not looking for a budget robot vacuum cleaner or a mopping robot, and you want the Dyson experience, you’ll enjoy this robot vac.Shark RV2820AE Detect Pro Self-Empty Robot VacuumUpsidesOdor neutralizing technologyAutomatically boosts suction power in dirty areasDownsidesSome customers note issues with mapping accuracyDustbin capacity: 5.3 litersSelf-empty doc: YesMultifloor mapping: NoWorks with: Amazon EchoShark is a well-known vacuum brand, and we include a variety of their cordless stick and upright models on our extensive list of the best vacuums for hardwood floors. The company makes cordless vacuums, corded stick vacuums, upright vacuums, and carpet cleaners. In addition, Shark has several well-made, mid-range robot vacuums.Setup was easy. After installing the self-empty base and putting the side brush on the bottom of the robot vacuum, I let it charge. Then I downloaded the SharkClean app, which controls the robot remotely, lets me schedule cleanings, and also issues cleaning reports. The Shark DetectPro Self-Empty can also be used with Alexa or Google Assistant.Tester: Terri Williams, contributorFloor type: Hardwood floors and carpet with stairsMy experience: The DetectPro Self-Empty has a slimmer base than some vacuums, so it doesn’t take up as much space, which is important in smaller homes. It uses 360-degree LiDAR vision to map my home, and it can detect and avoid obstacles on the floor. It also uses edge cleaning to blast air into corners and remove dust. It has strong suction and a brush roll that traps hair.Using dirt-detection technology, it will automatically boost suction when it detects a dirtier section. That is always comforting to me, since I know it means the dirt tracked in by visitors is being erased (the dust bin does indeed confirm the presence of significant debris). One of my favorite features of the Shark DetectPro is the odor-neutralizer technology that guards against odors. Also, the true HEPA self-empty base traps up to 99.97% of dust and allergens. (Note: This model only vacuums, it is not a robot vacuum and mop.)The bottom line: A self-emptying base and the ability to trap odors and allergens are just some of the features that make this a good choice if you want a robot vacuum without the mopping function. Strong suction, dirt-detection, and LiDAR vision are other reasons to consider it.ILIFE V5s Pro 2 Robot Vacuum and Mop ComboUpsidesCircles backs to pick up any areas it might have missedAffordableDownsidesGets stuck in smaller spacesDustbin capacity: 300 millilitersSelf-empty doc: NoMultifloor mapping: NoWorks with: Alexa and Google assistantI had never heard of ILife before, but while doing a deeper dive, I was impressed by the wide range of prices for their eight different models. The ILife V5 Pro has a two-in-one feature that allows the robot to be used as a vacuum and a mop, which makes it the ideal time-saving solution for the different materials in my bedroom. I was also surprised to learn that the vacuum automatically senses the area that needs to be cleaned rather than requiring programming to navigate the space.The setup process was fairly straightforward and took a little less than 30 minutes. The instructions were clear and concise, but missed a few minor components such as when to use the remote control and how long to charge the vacuum before use. When getting started, I had the issue of the vacuum “circling around a small area,” but was able to quickly solve this by reviewing the troubleshooting guide. Once solved, the vacuum was up and running in no time. I also appreciated the manual’s use of imagery to help showcase all of the parts of the vacuum and the step-by-step guide to cleaning the device.I was most excited to set up the scheduling feature that tells the robot when to begin cleaning each day. It was pretty easy to set up and took less than a minute—you simply have to set the local time on the remote and pick a time that works best for your schedule. I scheduled the robot to begin cleaning in the morning when I leave for the day and have been pleasantly surprised at how clean my apartment is when I get home.Tester: Jordan Goldberg, contributorFloor Type: After indulging in one too many cleaning videos on TikTok, I’ve turned into an everyday deep cleaner. As part of my weekday cleaning routine, I spend about 10 to 15 minutes sweeping, mopping, and vacuuming my entire apartment. This may seem like overkill, but it’s necessary to clean the wood-paneled floors in our living room area that trap food crumbs and the white tiles in the kitchen that spotlight even the smallest bit of dirt. In my bedroom, I have the same wood-paneled floors as well as a viscose rug that traps in hair and fuzz, so I use both a vacuum and a mop to tackle the two different materials.My experience: After charging the robot overnight, it was ready to go, and I was impressed with how well the vac cleaned my living and kitchen areas when it was on path mode (this setting was most efficient because the robot works on its own to find and attend to areas that need cleaning). The vacuum is dedicated to getting even the tiniest specks of dirt, circling back two or three times until the area is spotless. I did notice that the robot had some trouble transitioning from the wood floor to the carpet. But after a few attempts, it was able to overcome the obstacle by backing up and coming from a different angle. Another perk is that it’s also surprisingly quiet and did not disturb me when I slept in one morning.The process of transitioning the robot from vacuum to mop took five minutes, and I was happy to see the velcro strip on the back of the mop pad for easy cleaning when not in use. While mopping, the robot performed best on wood flooring, while I noticed it had a bit of trouble navigating the uneven tile. Nonetheless, it was equally persistent when tackling the dirtier areas and didn’t leave the floor too wet to walk around after it was complete. In terms of looks, the robot is not too bulky, and I love the white and gold coloring that matches my furniture. However, the charging station is black, so it does stand out a bit more than I would have liked.The bottom line: The ILife V5 Robot Vacuum has cut my daily cleaning routine in half! It’s both very thorough and strong enough to pick up large dust balls or any hair around the apartment. The mop feature is also fantastic for wood floors and very useful for spills while cooking. That said, the robot does get stuck in smaller spaces, so I’d recommend it to anyone who works from home who can keep an eye on it throughout the day.Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni Robot VacuumUpsidesLong battery lifeExtra-long cleaning brushesDownsidesLarge home base that takes up a good amount of floor spaceDustbin capacity: 4 litersSelf-empty doc: YesMultifloor mapping: YesWorks with: Smartphones, Amazon Echo, Google HomeThe Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni Robot Vacuum is on our list of the best vacuums for hardwood floors. Ecovacs makes well over a dozen different Deebot models with varying features and functions. Some only vacuum, while others vacuum and mop, and some include docks. Some of the robot vacuums are budget-priced, starting at only $100, while others are over $1,000. The Deebot X2 Omni is currently the most expensive of the Ecovac Deebots, but it’s also the most feature-packed, high-end model.The setup process is easy. After scanning the QR code on the robot, I downloaded and installed the Ecovacs Home app. I then opened the app and added the robot by scanning the QR code. Then I opened the doors to the rooms I wanted to map and removed any obstacles on the floor. I turned on all of the lights to ensure adequate lighting, as recommended by Ecovacs. The app will provide notifications when the water is running low in the clean water tank and when the dirty water tank is full.Tester: Terri Williams, contributorFloor type: Hardwood floors and carpet with stairsMy experience: The Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni Robot Vacuum has several features that I particularly like. Unlike the vast majority of vacuums that have a round body, the Deebot X2 has a square shape—quite helpful for thoroughly cleaning in corners.Although it’s one of Deebot’s slimmest and narrowest models, this one also has one of the widest brushes and one of the highest auto-mop lifting heights. With 8000Pa suction and an extra-long rubber brush, the X2 Omni has plenty of cleaning power. In addition, the vacuum robot uses a rotating mop system and mopping pads that have a three-layer design to remove dirt and spills from hard floors, making this one of the best robot mops.Using a dual-laser LiDAR navigation system, the vacuum can avoid obstacles and won’t tumble down my stairs. The camera on it can also be used as a security camera to remotely see what’s happening (helpful if you have pets). The 210-minute run time is one of the longest for robot vacuums, making it a good choice for large homes, and the mop lifting feature does a good job of keeping the mop off of carpet.The bottom line: The Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni provides a thorough cleaning through the use of strong suction, intense mopping, and a square design that fits into corners. The long battery life and bonus security camera are other functions that make this feature-rich robot vacuum a great (albeit, expensive) choice.Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni S1 ProUpsidesSleek designThorough wet-dry cleaning technologyDownsidesPriceyDustbin capacity: 2.5 litersSelf-empty doc: YesMultifloor mapping: YesWorks with: Smartphones, Amazon Echo, Google HomeEufy makes a variety of cool products spanning various categories—including a few more on this list. From smart scales to security cameras, video doorbells, and smart locks, the company is always on the cutting edge of technology.The Eufy X10 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum is one of my tried and true favorites. However, the futuristic Eufy Robot Vacuum Omni S1 Pro is sleeker and more impressive—although it’s also much more expensive.Honestly, I couldn’t wait to unbox and set up the Eufy X10 Pro Omni Robot Vacuum because it’s loaded with so many features. I installed the brushes, set up the dock, and installed the hard floor cleaner. After downloading the Eufy Clean app, I created a customized cleaning schedule and detailed maps for multiple levels. The robot vacuum is also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. From my phone, I can adjust suction power, water levels, and decide if I want to clean a specific area more than once. While I can also create no-go zones, the Omni S1 Pro is smart enough to maneuver around objects on its own.Tester: Terri Williams, contributorFloor type: I have hard floors, carpet, and rugs. When it’s time to clean my hard floors, I appreciate robot vacuums that can thoroughly clean without any assistance from me.My experience: I was eager to see how this robot vacuum cleaner differed from the Eufy X10 Pro Omni, and it didn’t take long to find out. Both have 8,000 Pa suction, and a mop that stays clean because it refreshes itself while cleaning the floor. Both have a raised mop that lifts itself up when over carpet, and both auto-empty, auto-wash, auto-dry, and auto-detangle.However, the obstacle avoidance technology included in the X10 Pro Omni has a 3D MatrixEye. Using active binocular infrared imaging technology, and a RGB camera, the robot vacuum can create 3D models in real time to identify obstacles—even in the dark.Edge to edge cleaning provided a thorough dust and dirt removal process, and there were no tangles thanks to the detangling brush, which eliminated the need to stop and remove trapped hair. The vacuum cleaner has powerful suction, and the mop cleans without sloshing and smearing water on the floor. Also, dual water tanks ensure the robot vacuum is not recirculating dirty water on my hard floors.The run time was particularly impressive: 3.6 hours, so it could cover almost 2,000 square feet without recharging. Also, the child safety lock is a feature that parents (and pet parents) will enjoy.The lack of hands-on cleaning is one of my favorite features. After auto-emptying, the dust bag can hold up to 68 days’ worth of dust sealed in the dock. The auto washing function uses ozonated water and a hard floor cleaner to thoroughly clean the rolling mop, so my floors aren’t just being cleaned, they’re being sterilized. Keep in mind that Eufy does not recommend using other types of cleaning solutions, since they can damage the machine’s components.When the mop is cleaned on the dock, it also self-dries by heating up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit so it remains fresh and clean.The bottom line: It’s quite expensive, but if you have the budget, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro Robot Vacuum is one of the best robot vacuums you can buy. It has a plethora of features and functions that can make your life and your floor care process much easier.iRobot Roomba i7+ (7550) Robot VacuumUpsidesBudget-friendlyHolds 60 days’ worth of dirt and debrisDownsidesThe machine scratches easilyDustbin capacity: N/ASelf-empty doc: YesMultifloor mapping: YesWorks with: Amazon Echo, Google HomeWe specifically chose the i7 model because it’s supposed to be iRobot’s best vacuum for pet owners. That’s because it has power-lifting suction, a high-efficiency filter, and AllergenLock bags meant to trap pollen, dust mites, and other allergens, so they don’t escape back into the air. And along with Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant connectivity, another cool feature is the iRobot Genius, an app for the robot that helps it detect and suggest clean zones.Setup only took a few minutes and instructions were easy to follow.Tester: Bailey Berg, contributorFloor Type: We recently moved and have hardwood floors, but our last apartment was carpeted. It works just as well on both, but vacuuming on hard floors is pretty loud. We also have two large dogs who shed constantly, so I generally run the vac once a day, while I’m out walking said dogs (they’re terrified of vacuums, big and small, so being able to do that lessens the stress levels for everyone involved).My experience: The Roomba is very easy to use and control, all you have to do is push a button and it goes (it usually does a couple laps and is able to navigate around obstacles well). It even does a good job smart mapping out the space—when we moved it, it realized it immediately and made a new floor plan. The i7 is also “self-sufficient,” meaning when the robot is full, it returns to the docking station to empty. The bag is supposed to hold 60 days of dirt, dust, and hair, but we usually fill the bag once a month (again, we have two extra large dogs, so we’re likely not the average user). My only complaint is the bag isn’t reusable, so you have to order more frequently, which isn’t particularly green, especially considering the opening is made of plastic.It looked very sleek when we first got it, but after a year it’s looking a bit beat up. There is a gap between the floor and the bottom cupboards in our kitchen and bathroom, and the vacuum is taller than the gap, so it keeps getting scratched on the edge of the cupboards. It definitely gets the dirt and hair from under the cupboard, though, so I guess some dings and dents are worth not having to clean those areas myself. And for the most part, it cleans just as well as our standard vacuum. The only time it doesn’t is when we’ve gone too long between vacuuming sessions and there’s too much dog hair. In that scenario, it tends to get jammed, though if we’d been more proactive, it wouldn’t be an issue.The bottom line: It’s crazy how noticeably cleaner the floors are whenever I’ve programmed the Roomba to clean while I’m out walking the dogs. We’ve been using this vacuum for about a year and I’m never going back, 100% would recommend it. Particularly if you’re kind of lazy, have multiple animals, or are trying to save a few minutes wherever you can.Side note: It’s possible to name your Roomba. We’ve yet to think of a good enough pun, so ours has remained unchristened.

We have been testing high-tech cleaners for years to bring our readers the best wet-dry vacs, steam cleaners, and more for their homes. Just like we have with other cleaning products, our editors and contributors have tested the best robot vacuums ranging from weeks up to years to find the ones that deserve the title of “best.” We also kept the points below in mind to find out if they are worth shopping:Cleaning Power: Each vacuum cleaner in our list passed our tests with flying colors to pick up everyday messes, ranging from shedding pet hair to crumbs that fall off the kitchen table. We also looked for multifunctional robovacs like wet-dry that can tackle stuck-on stains without making you pull out a mop.Smart Mapping: Unlike your average vacuum, a robot vacuum’s smart mapping capabilities allow for a true hands-off cleaning experience. Our team noted whether the vacuums were able to navigate around the house without bumping into furniture or getting caught on area rugs. Plus, they gave extra points to robot vacuums that feature multifloor mapping to clean every level of the house.Style: As experts in design, we can’t help but scour sites for the best looking items—and yes, that applies to gadgets, too. Our favorite robot vacs boast streamlined cleaning capabilities as well as designs that go easy on the eye. Dyson’s signature colorways are a standout in our list, as well as Eufy’s S1 design that looks more like a futuristic centerpiece than a clunky appliance. They might not be beautiful enough to display in your home, but we appreciate when a brand goes out of its way to reinvent what we think a product should look like.What to Look for in the Best Robot VacuumsAside from the aforementioned testing qualities, the factors below are just as important to keep in mind when shopping:Self-Emptying Features: Busy households will appreciate this: Self-emptying features rid the robot of debris after its rounds of cleaning are done. When the vacuum returns to the home base, it’ll do its thing automatically. Most of the options with this functionality in our list can hold up to 60 days’ worth of debris. Once the 60 days are up, you just have to empty the bin into a regular old trash can.Warranty: Like any pricey appliance investment in your home (think: smart fridges or washing machines), you’ll want to check if there’s a warranty available. We combed through all of our picks and found that many offer warranties around one year each on these cleaning appliances, including coverage of the battery and home station. Be sure to read the fine print before you add to cart.Smart Device Compatibility: We dive into this a bit more below, but smart device compatibility is a huge bonus when you’re trying to clean on-the-go. This can mean connections to Alexa, Google Assistant, or Amazon Echo that manage your device with voice controls, as well as smartphone compatibility to track your cleaning schedules at your fingertips.How to Care for Robot VacuumsFrom cordless to handheld, every type of vacuum out there needs maintenance to run properly. When it comes to robot vacuums, we recommend light cleaning it after every use. This typically means checking the brush rollers for buildup from pet hair and other debris and wiping off the smart sensors to make sure they can effectively map out your space. While many of the options on our list have smart features that detect when it’s time to empty the dustbin, we recommend dumping it after every deep clean across your floors to run efficiently. Otherwise, keep an eye out for additional care tips from the manufacturer's instructions for your specific robovac.FAQsWhat is the top-rated robot vacuum?The top-rated vacuum depends on who you ask—and product testers can be quite subjective. We all have our personal favorites, which is why we present a range of vacuum cleaners we consider the “best,” including the Roborock S7 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and the Eufy Omni S1 Pro Robot Vacuum, depending on the functionality you’re looking for. However, you should ultimately decide which features are most important for your home. For example, if you only have hard floors, it’s unlikely that you’d care which robot vacuum performs best on carpet. On the other hand, you may only want a robot vacuum for carpet, and, if so, you probably don’t care about mopping features. Your budget can also play a role in determining the best robot vacuum for your needs. Think about the best car in the world, which could be an Aston Martin that costs as much as a house. But you could be equally happy with a second- or third-tier car.All this is why believe just choosing the top-rated vacuum may not be the right choice. Determine what features are most important to you, such as battery life, suction, navigation, intuitiveness, cleaning performance, noise level, self-cleaning features, and so on, decide how much you’re comfortable spending, and then get to work on the search.What are the negatives of robot vacuums?Some people erroneously assume that having a robot vacuum means you’re completely hands-off. But that’s not always the case. If you have a self-emptying and self-cleaning robot vacuum, admittedly, you won’t have to do as much. However, if your robot vacuum doesn’t have these features, you’ll need to empty the bin or bag more frequently. Also, sometimes robot vacuums get stuck under furniture, and you’ll need to crawl underneath to dislodge it. In addition, while it’s more convenient to let the robot do all of the work, it takes longer. It’s often quicker to just pick up one of the best cordless stick vacuums, and clean the floor yourself.While some people are quite happy with robot mopping features, others note that it doesn’t clean their floors as thoroughly as an old-fashioned mop.What is the best robot vacuum for homes with dogs?The best robot vacuum for a home with dogs is one that includes a detangling hair brush so it won’t get clogged with hair, like the Eufy Omni S1 Pro. And since dogs tend to make a mess, strong suction power, and a scrubbing mopping feature (both found on the Roborock S7 Max Ultra) can help to remove pet dander from carpets and paw prints from floors.How do robot vacuum mops work?Robot vacuum mops have replaceable mopping pads underneath, and the robot dispenses water and/or a cleaning solution while the pads gently clean (or on some models, scrub) the floor. On more advanced robot vacuums, the mop is self-cleaning and self-drying. Otherwise, the mops can be removed and tossed into the washing machine. However, keep in mind that it may be difficult to clean heavily soiled floors or large messes with robot vacuum mops alone.How well do hybrid vacuums work?Sometimes, hybrid vacuums (which vacuum and mop) do one function better than the other. In other words, they tend to vacuum carpet better than they mop floors, or they tend to mop floors better than they vacuum carpet. Some models do both well, but just know that there may be a trade-off and pay close attention to the reviews.Why is mop-lifting important?If you’re looking a hybrid vacuum, make sure that it has a mop-lifting feature. This means that when it’s in mop mode, the machine can distinguish between hard floors and carpet, and not only stop the mop function when it’s over carpet, but also lift the mop up instead of dragging it across the carpet. No one wants a soggy carpet.Is suction power important in robot vacuums?In short: yes. Suction power can usually reach up around 8,000 Pa, which is found in most of our top picks. According to our testers, this suction level is ideal for everyday cleaning to pick up crumbs and dust effectively.Do all robot vacuums work with voice control?Hey, Google, start vacuuming! In this day and age, the best robot vacuums are all equipped with smart voice controls for easy functionality. This can allow you to start a cleaning cycle with a simple call out to Alexa, Google Assistant, or Amazon Echo in most of the picks in this list. Otherwise, you can use the dock controls or your smartphone to keep track of your cleaner.",

After plugging in the Omni station and recharging the robot vacuum, I filled the water tank. Next I downloaded the app and set up no-go zones and no-mop zones.

The robot vacuum has 8,000Pa suction and a multidirectional floating roller brush with rubber and bristles, which does an excellent job of removing dust and debris from carpets. When mopping, the MopMaster 2.0 has dual mopping pads and 180 rotations per minute to gently scrub hard floors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing the same obstacle-avoidance algorithm as the self-driving car industry, the Eufy X10 Pro Omni also detects and avoids my house shoes and other items on the floor. Since it does such a good job of working in the background, I usually don’t notice it. Therefore, the voice reminders like “low battery, heading home,” and “start scheduled cleaning,” are helpful in keeping me abreast of the machine’s activities. If the battery gets low, it will recharge and then pick up cleaning in the same spot where it left off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn addition to controlling the robot vacuum via my phone, I can also use Alexa or Google Assistant for voice control. Eufy’s Omni Station self-empties the dust and debris into the dust bag, which can hold two months worth of dust. The clean water tank holds a generous amount, so I don’t have to refill it after each cleaning cycle. When the water tank in the robot vacuum runs out of water, it refills itself at the station. The station also uses the water in the tank to wash the mop pads and then it dries them, so I don’t have to worry about soggy pads developing mold or mildew.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e I love a robot vacuum with mapping capabilities that performs excellently and only requires minimal effort on my part.

on every best vacuum article we’ve produced. For example, both the V15 Detect Submarine and the Gen 5 Outsize are on my list of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/vacuums-for-hardwood-floors\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebest vacuums for hardwood floors\u003c/a\u003e, and the brand is also on the list of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-cordless-vacuums\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebest cordless stick vacuums\u003c/a\u003e. I consider Dyson to be one of the very brands in this cleaning category. And the Dyson 360 Vis Nav is the company’s first robot vacuum. I was eager to see if it would perform as well as Dyson’s other vacuum products.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eDyson is known for colorful vacuum cleaners and the 350 Vis Nav is no exception. There’s no mistaking this bluish-purple vacuum with red LCD touchscreen on the top for another product. The first step to setting it up was to download the MyDyson app, set up the dock, and then place the robot on the dock so it could charge.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTester:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/terri-williams\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTerri Williams\u003c/a\u003e, contributor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFloor type:\u003c/strong\u003e As mentioned, for my home’s combination of hardwood floors, low-pile carpet, and throw rugs, suction power is an important feature. And the primary reason I’m using a robot vacuum is so it can reach places I can’t. So I like vacuums that can clean right up to the edge of my baseboards and pick up dust hiding in corners.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e Since Dyson is usually on the cutting edge of technology, honestly, I was surprised that the 360 Vis Nav didn’t have a self-emptying, self-cleaning dock. It also doesn’t have a mopping function. Admittedly, the advantage of a “regular” robot vacuum is that it doesn’t take up much space, which is a problem I have with the bigger, bulkier robot vacuums that have all of the bells and whistles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOnce I got past the lack of these features, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the robot vacuum includes all of the other functions you’d expect on a high-end offering. For example, I can control the robot from either the LCD touchscreen on the dock or from the MyDyson app on my phone. Smart voice control is another option.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe robot creates a map of my home with the app, and from my phone I can create cleaning zones, and also see where the robot has already cleaned. For more than one level, maps can be created for each story of the home. I can also create specific zones to clean (or to avoid cleaning). In addition, I can determine which areas the robot vacuum should clean with the brush bar off to avoid damage.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe vacuum returns to the dock when the battery is low, and after charging, continues cleaning. The run time can get up to 65 minutes, but keep in mind that in boost mode, the battery runs out sooner. There are four modes: auto (the one I typically use), quick, quiet, and boost.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePowerful suction is apparently one of Dyson’s core values, and I was impressed (but not surprised) that this little robot vacuum didn’t leave anything on the floor. The brush bars provide edge cleaning, and that’s another feature that allows it to pick up dirt and debris along the baseboards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDisposing the debris is a simple process of pressing the removal latch, lifting the bin out, and then carrying it to the trash can. Fortunately, the release button is on the top and the trash comes out from the bottom, so my hand never touches anything.

The ILife V5 Pro has a two-in-one feature that allows the robot to be used as a vacuum and a mop, which makes it the ideal time-saving solution for the different materials in my bedroom. I was also surprised to learn that the vacuum automatically senses the area that needs to be cleaned rather than requiring programming to navigate the space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe setup process was fairly straightforward and took a little less than 30 minutes. The instructions were clear and concise, but missed a few minor components such as when to use the remote control and how long to charge the vacuum before use. When getting started, I had the issue of the vacuum “circling around a small area,” but was able to quickly solve this by reviewing the troubleshooting guide. Once solved, the vacuum was up and running in no time. I also appreciated the manual’s use of imagery to help showcase all of the parts of the vacuum and the step-by-step guide to cleaning the device.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was most excited to set up the scheduling feature that tells the robot when to begin cleaning each day. It was pretty easy to set up and took less than a minute—you simply have to set the local time on the remote and pick a time that works best for your schedule. I scheduled the robot to begin cleaning in the morning when I leave for the day and have been pleasantly surprised at how clean my apartment is when I get home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTester:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/10-bathroom-organizers-the-pros-stand-behind\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJordan Goldberg\u003c/a\u003e, contributor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFloor Type:\u003c/strong\u003e After indulging in one too many cleaning videos on TikTok, I’ve turned into an everyday deep cleaner. As part of my weekday cleaning routine, I spend about 10 to 15 minutes sweeping, mopping, and vacuuming my entire apartment. This may seem like overkill, but it’s necessary to clean the wood-paneled floors in our living room area that trap food crumbs and the white tiles in the kitchen that spotlight even the smallest bit of dirt. In my bedroom, I have the same wood-paneled floors as well as a viscose rug that traps in hair and fuzz, so I use both a vacuum and a mop to tackle the two different materials.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e After charging the robot overnight, it was ready to go, and I was impressed with how well the vac cleaned my living and kitchen areas when it was on path mode (this setting was most efficient because the robot works on its own to find and attend to areas that need cleaning). The vacuum is \u003cem\u003ededicated\u003c/em\u003e to getting even the tiniest specks of dirt, circling back two or three times until the area is spotless. I did notice that the robot had some trouble transitioning from the wood floor to the carpet. But after a few attempts, it was able to overcome the obstacle by backing up and coming from a different angle. Another perk is that it’s also surprisingly quiet and did not disturb me when I slept in one morning.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe process of transitioning the robot from vacuum to mop took five minutes, and I was happy to see the velcro strip on the back of the mop pad for easy cleaning when not in use. While mopping, the robot performed best on wood flooring, while I noticed it had a bit of trouble navigating the uneven tile. Nonetheless, it was equally persistent when tackling the dirtier areas and didn’t leave the floor too wet to walk around after it was complete. In terms of looks, the robot is not too bulky, and I love the white and gold coloring that matches my furniture.

Ecovacs makes well over a dozen different Deebot models with varying features and functions. Some only vacuum, while others vacuum and mop, and some include docks. Some of the robot vacuums are budget-priced, starting at only $100, while others are over $1,000. The Deebot X2 Omni is currently the most expensive of the Ecovac Deebots, but it’s also the most feature-packed, high-end model.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe setup process is easy. After scanning the QR code on the robot, I downloaded and installed the Ecovacs Home app. I then opened the app and added the robot by scanning the QR code. Then I opened the doors to the rooms I wanted to map and removed any obstacles on the floor. I turned on all of the lights to ensure adequate lighting, as recommended by Ecovacs. The app will provide notifications when the water is running low in the clean water tank and when the dirty water tank is full.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTester:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/contributor/terri-williams\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTerri Williams\u003c/a\u003e, contributor\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFloor type:\u003c/strong\u003e Hardwood floors and carpet with stairs\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e The Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni Robot Vacuum has several features that I particularly like.

With 8000Pa suction and an extra-long rubber brush, the X2 Omni has plenty of cleaning power. In addition, the vacuum robot uses a rotating mop system and mopping pads that have a three-layer design to remove dirt and spills from hard floors, making this one of the best robot mops.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing a dual-laser LiDAR navigation system, the vacuum can avoid obstacles and won’t tumble down my stairs. The camera on it can also be used as a security camera to remotely see what’s happening (helpful if you have pets). The 210-minute run time is one of the longest for robot vacuums, making it a good choice for large homes, and the mop lifting feature does a good job of keeping the mop off of carpet.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e The Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni provides a thorough cleaning through the use of strong suction, intense mopping, and a square design that fits into corners.

When it’s time to clean my hard floors, I appreciate robot vacuums that can thoroughly clean without any assistance from me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e I was eager to see how this robot vacuum cleaner differed from the Eufy X10 Pro Omni, and it didn’t take long to find out. Both have 8,000 Pa suction, and a mop that stays clean because it refreshes itself while cleaning the floor. Both have a raised mop that lifts itself up when over carpet, and both auto-empty, auto-wash, auto-dry, and auto-detangle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHowever, the obstacle avoidance technology included in the X10 Pro Omni has a 3D MatrixEye. Using active binocular infrared imaging technology, and a RGB camera, the robot vacuum can create 3D models in real time to identify obstacles—even in the dark.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEdge to edge cleaning provided a thorough dust and dirt removal process, and there were no tangles thanks to the detangling brush, which eliminated the need to stop and remove trapped hair. The vacuum cleaner has powerful suction, and the mop cleans without sloshing and smearing water on the floor. Also, dual water tanks ensure the robot vacuum is not recirculating dirty water on my hard floors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe run time was particularly impressive: 3.6 hours, so it could cover almost 2,000 square feet without recharging. Also, the child safety lock is a feature that parents (and pet parents) will enjoy.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe lack of hands-on cleaning is one of my favorite features. After auto-emptying, the dust bag can hold up to 68 days’ worth of dust sealed in the dock. The auto washing function uses ozonated water and a hard floor cleaner to thoroughly clean the rolling mop, so my floors aren’t just being cleaned, they’re being sterilized. Keep in mind that Eufy does not recommend using other types of cleaning solutions, since they can damage the machine’s components.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen the mop is cleaned on the dock, it also self-dries by heating up to 131 degrees Fahrenheit so it remains fresh and clean.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e It’s quite expensive, but if you have the budget, the Eufy Omni S1 Pro Robot Vacuum is one of the best robot vacuums you can buy. It has a plethora of features and functions that can make your life and your floor care process much easier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv type=\"embed\" data-item=\"{\u0026#34;ctaHref\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/p/P5DkZRf1FvK8J8iBYjqE2E6BzrHCvaejx66imaJUW1sE4PJsN2PUWm6s5xRLMCetWpVQHwkJ4R3B46zBy6Hn8AV2XcrnDkGSiJZy6CZrFAjjGRKsoXE91CapyJrEVy4E8bR7D9FDf26Noyz1qZkGDdrtDbN7sJ9Y1yq31zSJduvkJh5CvkzFJSKtHxQ9wirURWVaHytZYi3Udwpst4pyLzfZrAs551P61tLRZFpyjnPcUTJaFjwvkTRfp8FFFuYbH2h9gxvPpXApApyb58c7J1UwpuhLrGdXAsc2tngtC63oViMe1qG8L57jHFGf5GRRXeZnHkQSjfyLa6k4D6hQFXZWEPDVzdX7MbgZrbg\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dangerousDek\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productBrand\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;iRobot Roomba i7+ (7550) Robot Vacuum\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;embedSize\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;isFirstProduct\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;isSponsored\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;offerRetailer\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Walmart\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;offerUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.walmart.com/ip/iRobot-i755020-Roomba-i7-plus-Wi-Fi-Connected-Robot-Vacuum-with-Automatic-Dirt-Disposal-7550/612743250\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;6345c2cbb42a4a7a25449fd9\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;showOfferUrl\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;showPriceOnButton\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;dangerousCredit\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;showLocalisedOffers\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;isUpcEnabled\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showClampedProductDescription\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;productDescriptionLineLength\u0026#34;:5,\u0026#34;hasReadMoreFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:6,\u0026#34;hasAffiliateLinkDisabled\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;isMobileView\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;hasMultipleImageSupport\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showImageCreditText\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showMultipleImageCount\u0026#34;:4,\u0026#34;hasProsConsFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;hasRatingFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;pros\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;cons\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;rating\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isPrimeExclusive\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;6345c2cbb42a4a7a25449fd9\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;offers\u0026#34;:[{\u0026#34;offerUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.walmart.com/ip/iRobot-i755020-Roomba-i7-plus-Wi-Fi-Connected-Robot-Vacuum-with-Automatic-Dirt-Disposal-7550/612743250\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$730\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;currency\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;USD\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;purchaseUri\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/p/P5DkZRf1FvK8J8iBYjqE2E6BzrHCvaejx66imaJUW1sE4PJsN2PUWm6s5xRLMCetWpVQHwkJ4R3B46zBy6Hn8AV2XcrnDkGSiJZy6CZrFAjjGRKsoXE91CapyJrEVy4E8bR7D9FDf26Noyz1qZkGDdrtDbN7sJ9Y1yq31zSJduvkJh5CvkzFJSKtHxQ9wirURWVaHytZYi3Udwpst4pyLzfZrAs551P61tLRZFpyjnPcUTJaFjwvkTRfp8FFFuYbH2h9gxvPpXApApyb58c7J1UwpuhLrGdXAsc2tngtC63oViMe1qG8L57jHFGf5GRRXeZnHkQSjfyLa6k4D6hQFXZWEPDVzdX7MbgZrbg\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;reducedPrice\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$650\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sellerName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Walmart\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;countryCode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;US\u0026#34;}],\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;unified_product_card\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;hasMultipleImage\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showProsConsData\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;showBadge\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;cneIds\u0026#34;:[]}\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"upc_6345c2cbb42a4a7a25449fd9\" type=\"embed\"\u003eiRobot Roomba i7+ (7550) Robot Vacuum\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv name=\"accordion\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpsides\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBudget-friendly\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHolds 60 days’ worth of dirt and debris\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDownsides\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe machine scratches easily\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDustbin capacity:\u003c/strong\u003e N/A\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSelf-empty doc:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMultifloor mapping:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorks with:\u003c/strong\u003e Amazon Echo, Google Home\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe specifically chose the i7 model because it’s supposed to be iRobot’s best vacuum for pet owners.

It works just as well on both, but vacuuming on hard floors is pretty loud. We also have two large dogs who shed constantly, so I generally run the vac once a day, while I’m out walking said dogs (they’re terrified of vacuums, big and small, so being able to do that lessens the stress levels for everyone involved).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e The Roomba is very easy to use and control, all you have to do is push a button and it goes (it usually does a couple laps and is able to navigate around obstacles well). It even does a good job smart mapping out the space—when we moved it, it realized it immediately and made a new floor plan. The i7 is also “self-sufficient,” meaning when the robot is full, it returns to the docking station to empty. The bag is supposed to hold 60 days of dirt, dust, and hair, but we usually fill the bag once a month (again, we have two extra large dogs, so we’re likely not the average user). My only complaint is the bag isn’t reusable, so you have to order more frequently, which isn’t particularly green, especially considering the opening is made of plastic.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt looked very sleek when we first got it, but after a year it’s looking a bit beat up. There is a gap between the floor and the bottom cupboards in our kitchen and bathroom, and the vacuum is taller than the gap, so it keeps getting scratched on the edge of the cupboards. It definitely gets the dirt and hair from under the cupboard, though, so I guess some dings and dents are worth not having to clean those areas myself. And for the most part, it cleans just as well as our standard vacuum. The only time it doesn’t is when we’ve gone too long between vacuuming sessions and there’s too much dog hair. In that scenario, it tends to get jammed, though if we’d been more proactive, it wouldn’t be an issue.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e It’s crazy how noticeably cleaner the floors are whenever I’ve programmed the Roomba to clean while I’m out walking the dogs. We’ve been using this vacuum for about a year and I’m never going back, 100% would recommend it. Particularly if you’re kind of lazy, have multiple animals, or are trying to save a few minutes wherever you can.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSide note: It’s possible to name your Roomba.

When it comes to robot vacuums, we recommend light cleaning it after every use. This typically means checking the brush rollers for buildup from pet hair and other debris and wiping off the smart sensors to make sure they can effectively map out your space. While many of the options on our list have smart features that detect when it’s time to empty the dustbin, we recommend dumping it after every deep clean across your floors to run efficiently. Otherwise, keep an eye out for additional care tips from the manufacturer\u0026#39;s instructions for your specific robovac.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"faqs\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFAQs\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv name=\"accordion\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"accordion-item-container\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the top-rated robot vacuum?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe top-rated vacuum depends on who you ask—and product testers can be quite subjective. We all have our personal favorites, which is why we present a range of vacuum cleaners we consider the “best,” including the Roborock S7 Max Ultra Robot Vacuum and the Eufy Omni S1 Pro Robot Vacuum, depending on the functionality you’re looking for. However, you should ultimately decide which features are most important for your home. For example, if you only have hard floors, it’s unlikely that you’d care which robot vacuum performs best on carpet. On the other hand, you may only want a robot vacuum for carpet, and, if so, you probably don’t care about mopping features. Your budget can also play a role in determining the best robot vacuum for your needs. Think about the best car in the world, which could be an Aston Martin that costs as much as a house. But you could be equally happy with a second- or third-tier car.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll this is why believe just choosing the top-rated vacuum may not be the right choice. Determine what features are most important to you, such as battery life, suction, navigation, intuitiveness, cleaning performance, noise level, self-cleaning features, and so on, decide how much you’re comfortable spending, and then get to work on the search.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"accordion-item-container\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the negatives of robot vacuums?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSome people erroneously assume that having a robot vacuum means you’re completely hands-off. But that’s not always the case. If you have a self-emptying and self-cleaning robot vacuum, admittedly, you won’t have to do as much. However, if your robot vacuum doesn’t have these features, you’ll need to empty the bin or bag more frequently. Also, sometimes robot vacuums get stuck under furniture, and you’ll need to crawl underneath to dislodge it. In addition, while it’s more convenient to let the robot do all of the work, it takes longer.

On more advanced robot vacuums, the mop is self-cleaning and self-drying. Otherwise, the mops can be removed and tossed into the washing machine. However, keep in mind that it may be difficult to clean heavily soiled floors or large messes with robot vacuum mops alone.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"accordion-item-container\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow well do hybrid vacuums work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes, hybrid vacuums (which vacuum and mop) do one function better than the other.
