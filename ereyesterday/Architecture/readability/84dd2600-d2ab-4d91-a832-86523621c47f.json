  "text": "unknown surface studio’s café in bangkok draws from flowersUnknown Surface Studio presents Curvy Dining, a sculptural all-white café that takes root within Bangkok’s industrial landscape. Set on an open, boundary-free site, the 250-square-meter space invites nature to shape its form. Inspired by wildflowers growing on-site, the design translates organic radial symmetry into a flowing architectural language. The café expands outward from a central point, with sunburst lines and soft curves evoking petals in motion.A squared outer boundary introduces a sense of structure, grounding the design within its surroundings. Movement through the space follows a subtractive approach, with carved-out pathways offering a gradual, unfolding experience. Green pockets emerge throughout, allowing the café to feel as if it is growing from the landscape itself.all images by Rungkit Charoenwatthe organic language continuES inside the buildingCurvy Dining, designed by the Thai team of Unknown Surface Studio, is a sculptural celebration of organic growth, inspired by the delicate unfolding of blooming flowers. Its design features radial symmetry and fluid, undulating edges that evoke the soft curves of petals in bloom. The architecture feels structured and open at the same time, with curved walls and cylindrical forms defining the spaces. Smooth white surfaces that reflect light enhance the sculptural quality of the building. Green spaces within and around the structure invite nature to coexist with architecture, making the experience immersive and inviting.Inside, the organic language continues, with vertical ribs extending from the walls to the ceiling, creating a flowing, undulating canopy with a skylight at the center that fills the space with natural light.The material palette is soft and warm, with off-white surfaces that float above green upholstered seating and natural wood furniture. Spherical pendant lamps, echoing the building’s curves, cast a soft glow that complements the natural light. Meanwhile, a linear counter provides a subtle counterpoint to the flowing space, anchoring the room while preserving its organic rhythm.Unknown Surface Studio presents Curvy Dining, a sculptural all-white caféthe 250-square-meter space invites nature to shape its forminspired by wildflowers growing on-sitea skylight at the center that fills the space with natural light",
