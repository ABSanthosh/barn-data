Start your entry to receive global recognition for your work! From a design perspective, one could say that the past decade was all about the bars — with the rise of the speakeasy came a heightened interest in bar interiors. Now, one can argue that we’ve entered the golden age of the coffee shop. From the smell of freshly ground beans to the slow pour of black coffee and the amazing latte art found in every cup, coffee shops have become a new place of gathering. Apart from social spaces, cafes act as workstations for remote workers or digital nomads, cozy “lounge rooms” for reading books and listening to podcasts and even event spaces that host pouring workshops or book club assemblies. Coffee shops straddle the intersection of public and private space, challenging architects to compose flexible designs and explore the qualities that make a successful cafe. Slabtitude By Vaslab Architecture, Bangkok, Thailand Popular Choice Winner, Restaurants (S \u003c 1000 sq ft), 12th Annual A+Awards The ‘slabtitude’ concept is translated into a place for gathering made of exposed concrete surfaces and accompanied by a long wooden table as the key centerpiece. The offices’ storage space was transformed into a café for casual meetings, work sessions and social connections. A series of custom made furniture complement the design, providing different moments of interaction as well as privacy throughout the space. FSW Coffee By Phoebe Says Wow Architects Ltd. / PSW建築設計研究室, Taipei City, Taiwan The project is located in a former office space at the corner ground floor of a mixed-use building close to nearby trails from the CBD area of Taipei. Contrary to most coffee shops, this proposal turned the space into a high quality espresso bar with an on-site roasters and space event, carefully concealing the interior from the bustling cityscape. The shop is divided into a semi-open street pocket space, inviting customers to enjoy a quick sip, and a sideways sit-and-drink area for a more casual experience. Polycarbonate panels act as dividers that offer an incredible illuminating effect throughout the day. NANA Coffee Roasters Bangna By TROP : terrains + open space, Bangkok, Thailand Nana Coffee Roasters Bangna investigates how eco-conscious design can inform a new café proposal along the Bangna-Trad motorway. Through the use of man-made structures and natural resources, the project blurs the boundaries between interior design, landscaping, and architecture and uses the three existing “structures” on site (the house; the road; and the parking) as a starting point for the design. The café layout is comprised of a Slow Bar, a service zone as well as a Speed Bar and indoor seating zone. Finally, lush plant species act as sound buffers and construct peaceful green pockets around the structure. The Caffè by Mr Espresso By jones | haydu, Oakland, California The Caffè reflects the second generation of Bay Area icon Mr. Espresso, serving as an example of how a diverse cultural landscape operates within a dense urban fabric. Heavily inspired by Italian culture and the ritual of a “pausa” or a pause, the design features elements of minimalism and contrast. The central bar sits as an island within the space, accentuated by an overhead wooden sculpture made of 272 slats of birch plywood. Blue Bottle Los Gatos By Lincoln Lighthill Architect, California The design for this cafe focused on the idea of how people move through confined spaces and the architectural language that can be derived from these conditions. Using the concept of super quadrics – math equations that yield rounded forms – the café was designed free of sharp corners, ensuring a smooth flow throughout the space. Respectively, the material palette echoes this smoothness, where key furniture pieces such the bar are made of a single solid piece of acrylic polymer (Corian) to reinforce its seamless, continuous form. % Arabica West Jianguo Road By B.L.U.E. Architecture Studio, Shanghai, China Popular Winner, Restaurants, 8th Annual A+Awards The coffee shop’s design focused on both its façade and interior renovation, creating an interplay between interior and exterior space. The shop becomes completely open through a small courtyard that expands around a U-shaped glass box. The transparent design allows part of the commercial space to blend with the wider urban context, while incorporating, in turn, the surrounding scenery into the store through the integration of parasol trees around the façade. Option Coffee Bar By TOUCH Architect, Udon Thani, Thailand Popular Choice Winner, Bars \u0026 Nightclubs, 8th Annual A+Awards Option Coffee Bar hosts three primary functions within the space: a café, a restaurant and a bar and occasionally an event space. The design objective was to create interchangeable zones, where these contrasting functions can occur both separately and simultaneously. Careful attention is given to the façade, which is comprised of a double layer of clear polycarbonate, which creates variation of light throughout the day as well as acts as a sign for the café.

Using the concept of super quadrics – math equations that yield rounded forms – the café was designed free of sharp corners, ensuring a smooth flow throughout the space. Respectively, the material palette echoes this smoothness, where key furniture pieces such the bar are made of a single solid piece of acrylic polymer (Corian) to reinforce its seamless, continuous form.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/arabica-coffee-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e% Arabica West Jianguo Road\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/firms/blue-architecture-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eB.L.U.E.

The shop becomes completely open through a small courtyard that expands around a U-shaped glass box. The transparent design allows part of the commercial space to blend with the wider urban context, while incorporating, in turn, the surrounding scenery into the store through the integration of parasol trees around the façade.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/option-coffee-bar/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eOption Coffee Bar\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/firms/touch-architect/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eTOUCH Architect\u003c/a\u003e, Udon Thani, Thailand\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003ePopular Choice Winner, Bars \u0026amp; Nightclubs, 8th Annual A+Awards\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01.jpg\" alt=\"Option Coffee Bar_01\" width=\"7952\" height=\"5304\" srcset=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01.jpg 7952w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_01-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 7952px) 100vw, 7952px\"/\u003e \u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/Option-Coffee-Bar_02.jpg\" alt=\"Option Coffee Bar_02\" width=\"12206\" height=\"5289\"/\u003eOption Coffee Bar hosts three primary functions within the space: a café, a restaurant and a bar and occasionally an event space.
