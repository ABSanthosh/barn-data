  "text": "william mulvihill opens ‘context, form, and light’ in shanghaiThrough the lens of William Mulvihill, the ‘Context, Form, and Light’ exhibition at Tongji University in Shanghai examines the fundamental principles that shape architecture. Timed with the Spanish Biennale BEAU XVI’s visit to the city, the exhibition showcases how buildings engage with their surroundings, transform functional needs into powerful forms, and harness light to shape spaces and evoke emotion.The photographer curates a collection of global projects that illustrate this interplay, from modernist icons to recent institutional developments. The imposing presence of Álvaro Siza and Carlos Castanheira’s concrete structures in Korea are captured as they peer through their wooded sites, while light gently pierces through Theaster Gates’ 2022 Serpentine Pavilion — a black enclosure inviting meditative moments of rest in London. David Chipperfield’s geometric facade and concrete arches too reactivate a former administrative building into an open space for the public in Paris.all images courtesy of William Mulvihillthe exhibition spotlights fundamental principles of architectureHosted at Tongji University’s Sino-Spanish Campus, ‘Context, Form, and Light’ avoids definitive narratives, instead allowing viewers to determine how each photograph resonates with their understanding of these principles. Whether focusing on the dynamic role of light, the relationship to context, or the discipline of form, the exhibition encourages a deeper appreciation of architecture’s complexities as a multisensory discipline. Spotlighting the creations of Le Corbusier, Sanaa, estudio Herreros, Herzog \u0026 de Meuron, and more, the exhibition draws attention to architecture’s relationship with context. Viewers are challenged to see buildings not as mere isolated objects but as part of a broader urban or natural environment.William Mulvihill’s photographs highlight forms that engage in continuous dialogue with their built and natural environments while speaking to their cultural contexts — including those that soften or land with sculptural presences. At the same time, they work underscores the precision and intentionality of form itself. From geometric clarity to expressive structures, the images celebrate the rigor of architectural design and its capacity to merge utility with beauty. Light is central to this photographic exploration, with the photographer revealing how it animates spaces and transforms surfaces throughout the day. By framing light as both a functional and poetic material, the photographer captures its role in shaping atmosphere, depth, and emotional resonance across spaces, from icons of modernisms to recent commercial developments.Okurayama Apartments by Kazuyo Sejima \u0026 AssociatesGrace Farms by SANAATeshima Art Museum by Ryun Nishizawa",
