  "text": "Step into the Oxford Avenue residence by Workshop No.5, and you’ll immediately be drawn to the blue-tiled shower. Tucked beneath an angled ceiling and surrounded by frameless glass, this expansive shower reads more like a serene spa retreat than a standard bathroom. Walls and ceiling are clad in elongated blue tiles, interrupted only by a dramatic skylight that floods the room with soft, natural light. A built-in bench runs underneath a horizontal window, which frames a leafy view and brings in daylight at eye level, offering a connection to the outdoors even in this most private of spaces. A recessed niche is neatly integrated into the tiled wall, providing a subtle storage solution for soaps and essentials without interrupting the room’s visual rhythm. The light from both the window and skylight plays across every surface, shifting the blue tile from smoky slate to sky blue as the day changes. But this thoughtful attention to space, light, and detail extends far beyond the bathroom. The front facade of the Oxford Avenue home blends clean geometry with inviting material contrast. A vertical volume clad in rich natural wood softens the modern silhouette and brings warmth to the overall composition. In contrast, smooth light-toned stucco defines the main body of the home, offering a crisp backdrop that accentuates the deep overhangs and angular roofline. Matte black window frames and railings introduce a sharp, modern edge, while the wood-lined soffits under the eaves and carport continue the warm material palette across horizontal planes. A concrete and gravel driveway reinforces the minimalist tone, guiding visitors toward the recessed entryway. Altogether, the exterior strikes a balance between bold presence and livable charm. The entryway sets the tone with a bold blue accent wall detailed in diagonal paneling. Sleek brass sconces bring a soft glow, while a glass console table keeps the space feeling open and light. Sculptural objects and fresh florals add a thoughtful touch, creating an inviting first impression in a compact footprint. The living room feels open and light, with a vaulted ceiling and expansive windows that invite the outdoors in. A minimalist palette of crisp white walls, black-framed windows, and soft neutral furnishings is warmed by subtle accents throughout. A clean-lined fireplace grounds the space, while matching glass console tables and abstract artwork bring a sense of balance. Just off the living room, a spacious deck extends the living area outdoors. Clad in smooth wood planks and framed by a minimalist pergola, the space feels warm yet modern. An outdoor kitchen adds function, making it ideal for hosting or quiet evening meals under the open sky. The dining room pairs modern simplicity with warmth and texture. A built-in diagonal wood wine wall creates a striking focal point and adds rich texture. A round dark table is surrounded by soft gray chairs, while overhead, a sculptural pendant light brings a contemporary finish to the space, designed with gathering and everyday elegance in mind. The kitchen combines clean lines with inviting textures. Flat-panel dark cabinetry brings warmth to the space, while a sleek stone island provides contrast and utility. Integrated appliances and minimalist hardware keep the look streamlined, and under-cabinet lighting adds subtle depth. Positioned at the heart of the home, the kitchen opens directly to the living and dining areas, reinforcing the home’s open, connected layout. A sophisticated powder room with a moody navy backdrop has subtle geometric lines for added depth. A round brass mirror and matching fixtures bring a touch of glam, while the warm wood vanity adds natural texture. The modern light fixture and minimalist styling create a refined, spa-like vibe in a small space. The striking modern staircase design features floating wood treads with black steel supports for a clean, architectural look. Large windows fill the stairwell with natural light, creating a bright and open feel. The minimalist handrail and sculptural pendant light add a sleek finishing touch. A minimalist ensuite bathroom has warm wood cabinetry, sleek black fixtures, and oversized charcoal floor tiles that create a clean, modern look. A vessel sink and round mirror add sculptural elegance, while the walk-in shower features natural wood-look tile. The open doorway leads seamlessly into a cozy, light-filled bedroom, creating a connected and calming primary suite. From the striking blue-tiled shower to the seamless connection between indoor and outdoor spaces, the Oxford Avenue residence reflects a deep attention to detail. Every element, from materials to layout, has been considered not just for style, but for how it feels to live there. It’s a home that invites light, warmth, and ease into daily life.
