Enveloped in a pure green facade that blends with the surrounding lake, the cabin offers a space for solitude and reflection. Its structure is crafted from laminated wood and assembled through precise digital fabrication, preserving the natural texture of the forest while integrating harmoniously into the landscape. Accessed only by a small boat, the cabin features a personal dock that acts as the entry point to the interior. Designed with artist residency in mind, the cabin functions as a green exhibit of natural living, where inhabitants can walk barefoot, enjoy the sounds of birds and wind, and embrace a slowed pace of life. Wiki World emphasizes sustainable practices in the construction, with each prefabricated wooden cabin crafted to adapt to the original path and topography of the forest, minimizing environmental impact.all images by Pan Yanjun, courtesy of Wiki World, unless stated otherwiseOasis cabin is part of an intimate island cabin initiativeThe project is part of the Island Living Plan, an initiative to create intimate island cabins that reconnect occupants with nature. Hubei-based firm Wiki World designs the Oasis Cabin sanctuary for a single occupant. The structure, which occupies nearly the entire islet, consists of two bedrooms and a living room connected by narrow corridors that give each room an individual sense of privacy. Floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights ensure that even within this intimate space, views of the lake and sky remain visible. A private inner courtyard, concealed spaces, and an expansive terrace complete the design, where guests can enjoy fishing, gather around a bonfire, and observe the stars. In alignment with Wiki World’s design principles, Oasis Cabin commits to natural construction techniques, using carbonized wood boards and reassembly-friendly components that respect the landscape. Elevated slightly above the ground, the design respects the organic relationship between architecture and the wild environment.Wiki World presents a serene residence on a tiny islet | image by Cai Muanenveloped in a pure green facade that blends with the surrounding lakeIts structure is crafted from laminated wood and assembled through digital fabrication | image by Arch EXISTaccessed only by boat, the cabin features a dock that acts as the entry point | image by Arch EXIST",
