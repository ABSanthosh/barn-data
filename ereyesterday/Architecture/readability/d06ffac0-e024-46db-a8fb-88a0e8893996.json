  "text": "5th International Architecture Biennial of BASQUE COUNTRY, Mugak/The ONSITE Ephemeral Architecture Design Competition announces the three visionary projects selected to transform public spaces during the 5th Mugak/ Biennial in 2025. The competition brought together global talents to envision impactful solutions for contemporary spatial challenges, celebrating architectural ingenuity and forward-thinking design. Organized by the prestigious Mugak/ International Architecture Biennial, the 2024 edition, themed ‘Castles in the Air, or How to Build Utopia Today,’ encouraged the creation of temporary structures that explore utopias of our time through renewable energy, green technologies and community collaboration. As part of the 5th Mugak/ Biennial, ONSITE Mugak/ praises the three winners, offering each of the ephemeral designs a space for their construction in iconic public spaces of the Basque capitals. ‘Etxenoi,’ a project by Bilbao-based architects Jaime Gutiérrez Armendariz and Itziar Molinero Miranda | all images courtesy of Mugak/ BiennialONSITE Reveals winning design visions in Mugak/Organized by the Basque Country International Architecture Biennial, Mugak/, and promoted by the Basque Government’s Department of Housing and Urban Agenda, the ONSITE competition attracted entries from around the world, including participants from Spain, Portugal, Italy, Brazil, India, and South Africa. Highlighting diverse approaches to the competition’s utopian theme, the winning projects blend innovation, sustainability, and social commentary while harmonizing with their iconic urban environments. The three highlighted projects reimagine public spaces and reflect on the relationship between the built environment and its communities.Mugak, which translates to ‘boundary’ in Basque, provides a symbolic context for exploring architecture’s potential to transcend borders—both literal and conceptual. Between October-November, 2025, Mugak/ Biennial unveils the three winners, each uniquely interpreting the competition’s call to imagine a better future. ‘Levedad y denuncia. El bordado como utopía en femenino,’ a proposal by Madrid-based Izaskun Chinchilla ArchitectsLocated in Women’s Square, near Bilbao’s historic Abando Station, ‘Etxenoi,’ a project by Bilbao-based architects Jaime Gutiérrez Armendariz and Itziar Molinero Miranda, reimagines architecture as a collective responsibility. Using scaffolding, reused materials, and discarded furniture, this installation critiques the superficiality of “fast” renovations, positioning citizens as active agents in sustainable urban change.The project’s intimate design evokes domestic spaces, inviting public reflection on themes of sustainability and urban regeneration. As described by the jury, ‘Etxenoi’s ability to translate fundamental concepts of reuse and urban sustainability into a functional and engaging structure makes it a powerful architectural statement.’‘Etxenoi,’ a project by Bilbao-based architects Jaime Gutiérrez Armendariz and Itziar Molinero MirandaThe Alderdi Eder esplanade, in front of Donostia’s City Hall, will be hosting ‘Levedad y denuncia. El bordado como utopía en femenino,’ a proposal by Madrid-based Izaskun Chinchilla Architects. This poetic structure uses embroidery—a traditionally feminine craft—as a metaphor for care, community, and justice. Combining lightweight textiles and 3D-printed elements, the project advocates for equality and reclaims women’s historical contributions to utopian thought.Praised by the jury for ‘intertwining aesthetics, materiality, and cultural impact,’ the installation embodies the transformative power of feminist perspectives in architecture. Its design creates a symbolic, ephemeral space that fosters community interaction and dialogue.‘Levedad y denuncia. El bordado como utopía en femenino,’ a proposal by Madrid-based Izaskun Chinchilla ArchitectsFor the first time, the Biennial will bring an installation to Vitoria-Gasteiz’s Virgen Blanca Square. ‘Utopia: Prohibido el paso,’ by architect and artist Sebastián Bayo, erects a four-meter-tall wooden wall that divides the square, prompting reflection on societal and territorial boundaries. The installation invites citizen participation, encouraging visitors to modify and reinterpret the wall as an evolving canvas for collective expression.The jury commended the project’s ‘symbolic strength and ability to transform a public space into a platform for dialogue about the impact of real and fictional borders on communities.’",
