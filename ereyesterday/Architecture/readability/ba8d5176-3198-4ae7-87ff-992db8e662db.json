  "text": "SKRA Park Stadium turns into Sustainable and Multiuse urban HubAtelier ENTROPIC, studio4SPACE, and ARUP Polska present a comprehensive redesign for the SKRA Park Stadium in Warsaw, Poland, blending sustainable technologies with a multi-functional approach to urban recreation. The proposal focuses on transforming the athletics stadium into a year-round hub for sport, community, and cultural activities while preserving the site’s natural and urban connections.The stadium’s design is inspired by its park setting, with a roof structure supported by irregularly arranged columns that mimic the appearance of tree trunks. The two inner rows of columns support the main truss structure, while the outermost columns act as tension members, ensuring roof stability. The middle columns are designed for technical functions, such as housing cabling for the roof’s solar panels and managing rainwater drainage. Rainwater captured by the roof is stored in underground tanks and directed toward rain gardens to manage excess water, contributing to the sustainable design. Ground-source heat pumps and kinetic energy-harvesting pavements further reduce the stadium’s carbon footprint. The materials used in construction include recycled elements and low-emission concrete, supporting environmental goals.tall images courtesy of Atelier ENTROPIC, studio4SPACE, and ARUP Polskastadium’s built structure integrates with natural surroundingsThe collaborative team between Atelier ENTROPIC, studio4SPACE’s designers, and ARUP Polska associates conceives a concept that emphasizes integrating the built environment with its surroundings, particularly through elevated walkways that connect the stadium to the adjacent Zieleniec Wielkopolski Park. These paths allow visitors to experience the area’s green spaces while transitioning into the stadium’s urban environment. The stadium’s roof opens toward the park, allowing natural light and views into the spectator areas, enhancing the connection between the park and the building’s interior spaces.The stadium’s multifunctional design includes spaces for a wide range of activities beyond sports, such as commercial and cultural areas. The eastern part is a closed zone for administration, media, and VIPs, connected to a dedicated stand via an underground garage. The ground floor includes athlete changing rooms with access to a spacious underground warm-up/training zone linking the stadium and multifunctional hall. The western zone features shops, cafés, and restaurants, while the upper levels offer co-working spaces and areas for e-sports. Two ramps and staircases provide access to the main pitch, leading from the starting line (south) and the finish line area (north). The proposal also preserves the original elevation of the stadium, with new functions integrated beneath the stands, including administration offices and athlete facilities. The surrounding area is developed into a recreation and gaming zone, with open sports pitches and terrain stairs forming spectator stands. Parking for administration and media, along with an underground car park with over 400 spaces, supports the stadium’s operations.the stadium’s roof opens toward the park, inviting natural light and enhancing views for spectatorselevated walkways connect the Stadium to Zieleniec Wielkopolski Park, blending natural and built environmentsthe original stadium elevation is preserved, with new functions integrated beneath the standsthe western zone includes shops, cafés, and restaurants, while upper levels offer co-working spaces",
