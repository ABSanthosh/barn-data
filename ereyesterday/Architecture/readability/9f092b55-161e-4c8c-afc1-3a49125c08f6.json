  "text": "In AD PRO’s monthly “Having a Moment” column, AD senior design editor Hannah Martin is a weathervane for fads big and small, documenting the patterns and home decor trends she’s clocked in the pages of AD and beyond. Here, enjoy a look back at the looks that defined interiors in 2024.Allover WoodIf your grandmother had a 1970s-era paneled living room, it might be difficult for you to hear this, but wood-clad interiors are having a major resurgence. Lately, as we scout homes in consideration for the magazine, it almost feels like a new must-have. Cedar-panel dining rooms. Soaring living spaces with mahogany-veneer walls. Offices and libraries with ornate, Arts and Crafts–style millwork. And of course, tons of top-to-bottom timber kitchens. Wood is back, and being used in abundance.Beet RedAre we finally finished with oatmeal? After a yearslong reign of bland, risk-averse rooms—50 shades of beige, we sometimes call it—interiors have finally taken a turn toward something more flavor-forward. Today’s prevailing look takes guts: dark, wood-clad walls, bold, patterned fabrics, moody hues that envelope a room. One color has emerged as an unexpected new neutral: A shapeshifting purple-red with brown undertones that feels fresh from the soil. Earthier than aubergine; a drop more purple than oxblood—we’re calling this super-saturated hue beet.A Carlo Bugatti throne chair in a Greenwich Village home designed by Studio Shamshiri. Photo: Stephen Kent Johnson / Styling: Michael ReynoldsCarlo Bugatti FurnitureFor most, the word Bugatti conjures images of sleek, sculptural, speedy automobiles—or maybe some song lyrics referencing them. But for a growing number of design aficionados, that’s no longer the case. What comes to mind, rather, are tassels, carved wood, inlaid pewter, and vellum-sheathed forms—all hallmarks of the fantastical turn-of-the-20th-century furnishings of Italian designer Carlo Bugatti. More than 50 lots of his work went up for auction this year at Bonhams from the Merle and Peter Mullin collection, and fetched a pretty penny. (A rare 1907 sterling silver dragonfly bowl sold for a whopping $191,000.) The sale’s success sheds light on a growing interest in Bugatti’s works, which have been cropping up in interiors and at design fairs in recent years as a younger set of collectors looks to Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts eras with fresh intrigue.A silver pitcher and candlesticks in Adam Lippes’s Berkshires kitchen.

Robert Wilson/RW Work Ltd.Grandma’s SilverSilver—a material whose antibacterial properties lend it to culinary use—has been a tabletop status symbol since ancient times. Through the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, as silversmithing entered its heyday across Europe, elaborate table services were an indication of social standing and wealth—after all, the material corresponded directly to currency in many nations. Even in the 20th century, silver still dazzled on the tables of those who could afford it, and a woman might inherit her mother or grandmother’s service and then pass it on to her own daughter in due time. But in recent decades, a younger generation has been ditching the heavy metal tableware, gravitating towards a more casual, contemporary aesthetic. But hold on to that silver, people: The pendulum is mid-swing back in its direction.APPLY NOWGrow your business with the AD PRO DirectoryArrowThe tented dining room created by AD100 designer Josh Greene for a young family on New York’s Upper East Side. Photo: Tim Lenz / Styling: Mieke ten HaveRuched RoomsIn the opening scene of Feud: Capote vs. the Swans, a distraught Babe Paley, played by Naomi Watts, pulls her friend and confidant Truman Capote (Tom Hollander) into her sitting room to unload about the latest transgressions of her husband, Bill Paley. As she laid bare the gory details, all I could look at was the room—a recreation of the one Billy Baldwin conceived for the real-life Babe’s St. Regis apartment, with walls curtained in a pleated tobacco-brown Indian calico cotton, block-printed with pale pink flowers. Fabric-sheathed spaces like this one—often dubbed tented rooms—have a rich history in 20th-century decorating. But recently, more contemporary spaces have been embracing the timeless trick. For a young family’s home on Park Avenue, for instance, AD100 interior designer Josh Greene recently used 290 yards of fabric to create a delightfully ruched dining room. “It was cut, sewn, stapled, and pulled to the brink, then gathered on the ceiling to a central point which the chandelier canopy covers,” Greene explains of the precise, rather mathematical process.Marc Phillips abaca rugs on the patio of an LA home by AD100 designer Jamie Bush and architect William Hefner.

And for a millennium, the practice has continued across the globe. In the Middle Ages, woven rush–sometimes called medieval matting—covered dirt grounds, preventing them from turning to mud when it rained. In the Tudor court paintings, similar rugs can be spotted underfoot. And for centuries in Japan, tightly woven rush tatami mats laid the ground in the homes of the upper class and aristocracy. Today, interior designers are turning to this typology yet again as a chameleon, all-natural basic that can work in virtually any project.The home of Oliver M.

When we talk about lacquer today, we’re often referring to a surface that is slick, shiny, and catches the light. There are a range of products on the market that give off that signature sheen. But the real deal—or “true lacquer,” as it is sometimes called—originated in Asia, with some of the earliest examples found in Japan, circa 7,000 BC. In the past few years, the slick, shiny finish has emerged on our radar once again. The lustrous finish has been the star of some of our favorite, refreshingly sophisticated interiors and furniture by emerging firms like Hugo Toro, Akademos, Uchronia, and EJR Barnes.",

In the Tudor court paintings, similar rugs can be spotted underfoot. And for centuries in Japan, tightly woven rush tatami mats laid the ground in the homes of the upper class and aristocracy. Today, interior designers are turning to this typology yet again as a chameleon, all-natural basic that can work in virtually any project.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/inside-a-classic-california-canyon-home-filled-with-sensational-design\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe home of Oliver M.

When we talk about lacquer today, we’re often referring to a surface that is slick, shiny, and catches the light. There are a range of products on the market that give off that signature sheen. But the real deal—or “true lacquer,” as it is sometimes called—originated in Asia, with some of the earliest examples found in Japan, circa 7,000 BC. In the past few years, the slick, shiny finish has emerged on our radar once again. The lustrous finish has been the star of some of our favorite, refreshingly sophisticated interiors and furniture by emerging firms like Hugo Toro, Akademos, Uchronia, and EJR Barnes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
