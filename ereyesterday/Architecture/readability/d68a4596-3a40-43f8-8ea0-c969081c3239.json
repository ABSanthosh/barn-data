  "text": "10. Larry Booth Shares the Places + Spaces That Captivate Him + More Larry Booth’s natural flair for design and architectural convictions have garnered him some 50+ years of professional practice where he has significantly contributed to Chicago’s cultural landscape in addition to the broader academic arena. As the founder and principal/director of Booth Hansen, he has led by example proving that robust design solutions come from an open and organized collaborative studio. 9. Alda Ly Revels in Reeded Glass, Icelandic Baths + More Architect Alda Ly continues to assemble a portfolio of meaningful work designing for entrepreneurs and startups with her practice ALA Studio. She has a storied history of socially conscious contributions to the field and employs ethnographic research to inform her concepts. Though Ly’s practice tackles a wide range of projects, each space is imbued with a sense of play and reflective of her deep consideration for the client’s human experience. 8. Hadiya Williams on Connections, a Love of Old Objects+ More The tendrils of graphic thinking extend into almost every other facet of design, as evidenced by the work of Hadiya Williams and her design studio Black Pepper Paperie Co. She draws from two decades of experience in the graphic arts to inform fresh objects in the realm of ceramics and surface design. What’s more, her work builds on a storied tradition of West African art and textiles while referencing the Black Arts Movement and the early 20th century Harlem Renaissance. 7. Susan Maddux Shares Her Vintage Textiles, Art Collection + More Los Angeles-based artist Susan Maddux makes works that are an incredible three-dimensional experience drawing. Her origami-inspired technique transforms paintings into oversized wall sculptures through experimentation with proportion and patterning. The work also connects Maddux – a 4th generation Hapa-Japanese woman – to generations of artisans who came before her. 6. Kate Rohrer on Jumpsuits, Earthy Scents + More Creative practice is inextricably linked to life experience. And for interior designer Kate Rohrer, her time waiting tables and pouring cocktails in the food service industry still informs the way she approaches hospitality projects. Her firm ROHE Creative is responsible for some exhilarating spaces thanks to Rohrer’s unabashed use of color and penchant for rich textures seamlessly blending disparate styles into unique personal narratives. 5. Sarah Jefferys Prizes Sustainable Design, Lots of Natural Light + More Passive house design, net zero goals, and sustainability. These things might sound like headaches for some, but for Sarah Jefferys – who leads her namesake firm, Sarah Jefferys Architecture + Interiors – they are the impetus to arrive at the most robust design solution for people and the planet. An expert in her field with over 20 years of experience, Jefferys is on a mission to reach net zero on all her studio’s projects within the next decade. 4. George Smart on His Favorite Modernist Residential Architecture Having defected from a career in consulting, George Smart set on a new path to pay it forward. While researching design precedents for a new family home, he noticed the lack of reputable online sources for the everyman. He decided to build his own repository, which marked the founding of NCModernist, and later USModernist – the world’s largest nonprofit educational archive dedicated to the documentation, preservation, and promotion of Modernist residential design. 3. Brigette Romanek Loves Alaia Dresses, Soulful Books + More Gwyneth Paltrow, Demi Moore, Joe Jonas, Christian Bale, Beyoncé, and Jay-Z. While celebrity may be one throughline connecting these stars, interior designer Brigette Romanek is another. The award-winning creative started styling interiors roughly a decade ago and has already grown her creative practice into a highly sought after design studio now stepping into the realm of product design. 2. Kickie Chudikova Loves the Art of Scent, Issey Miyake + More Industrial designer Kickie Chudikova’s curiosity for artful objects is exercised in the design of every product, home furnishing, and artifact she manufactures – with the hopes that it will provide their owners with enrichment or fulfillment for a lifetime. Chudikova has never limited herself in material palette or by color, always looking for a solution that invites interaction, with future aspirations to tackle food. And the most popular Friday Five post of 2024 is… 1. Dale Chihuly Shares His Favorite Architect + Beloved Collections Glass is enchanting, and for master of his craft Dale Chihuly, the medium’s properties are incomparable. His work includes more than 200 museum collections worldwide and his résumé is equally as decorated. It boasts many accolades including two fellowships, 13 honorary doctorates, and title as co-founder of the Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. Chihuly is one of few leading the development of this industry into the future. Check out the rest of Design Milk’s end of the year coverage here! With professional degrees in architecture and journalism, New York-based writer Joseph has a desire to make living beautifully accessible. His work seeks to enrich the lives of others with visual communication and storytelling through design. When not writing, he teaches visual communication, theory, and design.",
