Start your entry today, and take advantage of the Early Entry prices! In many parts of the world, libraries are being reimagined as more than quiet spaces for reading. Lately, they are becoming active parts of the community and everyday life. Modern library design now focuses on creating community spaces that connect people not only with knowledge but also with nature and one another. Instead of being closed off, many of these libraries now include features that let the outside in. Architects use large windows, open courtyards, rooftop gardens and outdoor patios to bring in natural light, fresh air and views of the surrounding landscape. The buildings are often shaped by local conditions, like nearby mountains, forests, or even the patterns of wind and sunlight. These choices help create calm and beautiful spaces that feel part of the land around them. At the same time, these libraries are designed to support community life. They include flexible areas that can be used for different activities, such as group meetings, children’s programs, workshops, or just a quiet place to relax. Some even have cafes, open reading gardens or public squares. So, instead of only focusing on storing books, these spaces support learning in all its forms. From Chengdu to Arizona, these libraries show how architecture shapes our connections with each other and the world. They unite learning, landscape, and community, creating inspiring and useful spaces. Chengdu Museum of Contemporary Art, Tianfu Library of Humanity and Art By CSWADI, Chengdu, China Jury Winner, Libraries, 12th Annual A+Awards Tianfu Art Park, located on North Third Ring Road in Chengdu, houses the Chengdu Museum of Contemporary Art and the Tianfu Library of Humanity and Art. These two museums aim to create a platform for urban public culture, intertwining art and nature. The pavilion features two curved roofs mimicking the nearby mountains, shaping a soothing skyline aligned with Chengdu’s climate. The museum spans 355,210 square feet (33,000 square meters), serving as a contemporary art exhibition and research center, showcasing installation and multimedia art. The Tianfu Library focuses on art literacy and aesthetics, its name translating to “Book Mountain.” Shenzhen Reef Library By Wildurban Architects, Shenzhen, China The initial design of the Shenzhen Reef Library aimed to develop a varied and complex public space on a compact site. The project seeks to create a peaceful environment to promote the interaction between human and non-human elements. The area is organized using a grid consisting of nine squares, with the building’s four corners drawn inward, which reduces its overall volume while allowing sufficient space around neighboring structures. The internal spatial relationships and scale evolve through a sequence of retreating actions. The project is inspired by the red reefs formed from ancient volcanic activity on the Dapeng Peninsula, and this unique material features prominently in both the façade and interiors, fostering a connection between people and nature. Square volumes paired with curved openings create a dynamic form. The robust red walls provide a stable framework, contrasting sharply with the transparent white book tower. The ground floor includes a red cave-like area, designed with curved bookshelves reminiscent of a reef. Asante Public Library By Richärd Kennedy Architects, Surprise, Arizona The library sits on a 12-acre park in Arizona, overlooking White Tank Mountains. Its folded perforated metal baffles in white powder coat create a canopy that filters sunlight, emulating a tree’s diffused light for occupants. The continuity of vertical and horizontal planes, in both exterior and interior design, forms a dynamic façade of light and shadow, reminiscent of the park’s tree canopy. This architecture abstracts the experience of reading under a tree, creating a sheltered and dynamic space in the desert. The park currently serves as a regional retention basin that drains along the local green belt. In order to reduce overall site disturbance, four-foot retaining walls serve as an elevated plinth. Inside, the library offers a large, open reading room where full-height glazing affords sweeping views of the nearby mountain range. Tainan Public Library By Mecanoo, Tainan City, Taiwan Popular Choice Winner, Libraries, 12th Annual A+Awards Tainan Public Library represents the intersection of cultures, generations, and histories. It is mainly inspired by local culture and designed with consideration for Tainan’s climate. The building houses the city’s heritage, art, music and films, and has more than a million books from different periods of history. The library features a stepped shape and slender columns that are rhythmically placed. This stepped structure offers shelter to visitors both inside and outside and creates a smooth transition between the exterior and interior. Beneath the cantilevers are four sunken patios for outdoor activities, with the largest accessible from the square; lectures, concerts, and exhibitions can be organized here. There are also four outdoor areas arranged as roof gardens, as well as three multifunctional spaces for classrooms, workshops, and a café. Flint Public Library By OPN Architects, Flint, Michigan In 2022, the Flint Public Library has transformed into an equitable, confident and aspirational community space. Retaining the building’s original footprint, its 94,000 square feet (8,732 square meters) have been redesigned with new openings between the first and second floors. Windows were added or replaced, and architectural fins reflect the surrounding mid-century architecture of the cultural campus. The new floor plan enhances efficiency by reclaiming 16,000 square feet (1,486 square meters) of underutilized space and relocating staff offices from exterior walls to the lower level with historic archives. This layout creates quiet reading areas and various meeting rooms that allow natural light for formal meetings, community groups and informal discussions. A modern service model replaces the traditional circulation desk, improving staff and visitor interactions in first-floor collection areas. Children’s services and tech spaces have doubled in size, and interactive kiosks on the second floor highlight the library’s African American Sports Hall of Fame archives. Atherton Library By WRNS Studio, Atherton, California The multifaceted project encompasses the renovation of the historic town hall, the construction of a modern library, and the development of a California Mission-style town center that will house city administration, public works, community meeting spaces and the police station. Atherton Library connects to the historic city hall building (where the library is currently located) through a spacious outdoor patio, envisioned as a front porch for the community. The library reflects current research on how facilities can best serve our communities now and in the future, featuring a flexible design that can adapt to community needs as technology and work evolve. Tianmu Lake · LI City Library By Greater Dog Architects, Liyang, Changzhou, China The LI City Study is situated in the Tianmu Lake Resort in Liyang City, built in 2023. This government-sponsored public welfare initiative facilitates access to shared urban cultural spaces and offers a free reading area for citizens and tourists, open 24 hours a day. Originally, the building served as an office. The government has introduced new social functions to meet public needs and demonstrate a commitment to the community’s well-being.
