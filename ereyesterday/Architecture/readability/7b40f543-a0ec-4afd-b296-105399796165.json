  "text": "Project Monokuro adaptively reuses dilapidated canteen blockThe Monokuro project, an adaptive reuse initiative by Compartment S4, transforms a dilapidated canteen block in Ahmedabad into a contemporary office space, honoring its modernist architectural legacy while addressing present-day needs. In a city steeped in the industrial legacy, Ahmedabad’s architectural narrative unfolds with echoes of modernist visionaries like Louis Kahn and Le Corbusier. Their influence, manifested in iconic structures commissioned by local mill owners, has left an ingrained mark on the cityscape.Against this backdrop, Compartment S4 reimagined a 1970s canteen block within an industrial complex manufacturing agricultural water pumps. The project pays homage to the city’s modernist heritage, retaining the building’s original geometric form, defined by its inverted beam roof and abundant use of concrete, while seamlessly integrating contemporary design elements. A key feature of the redesign was the incorporation of Mild Steel (MS) as a primary material, chosen for its reusability and dismantlable nature. The architectural approach focused on blending spatial reuse with innovation, respecting the structure’s heritage while adapting it to modern requirements.all images by Atik Bhedawing-like metal hip roof tops Compartment S4’s office spaceRetaining the original outer walls, the redesign prioritized Vastu-compliant circulation, shifting the entrance from its former southern orientation to face east, with the obsolete kitchen block transformed into a courtyard. This courtyard, a lush green oasis amidst the industrial surroundings, forms the heart of the project, fostering a sense of community and connection. It serves as a tribute to the memories associated with the original structure, redefining its role as a place of gathering and interaction. Adjacent spaces include an admin area and waiting room, while director cabins flank a common meeting room that offers views of the courtyard. The new inverted hip roof, a wing-like metal structure inspired by the original roof system, cantilevers over the courtyard, creating a striking focal point while enhancing natural light through ribbon windows on all four sides. For the building’s exteriors, the designers at Compartment S4 employ stone-chip plaster, both as an aesthetic complement to the ribbon windows and a practical measure against water seepage.Inside, departing from conventional industrial aesthetics, custom-made furniture tailored to the office’s functional needs was crafted onsite. A simple palette of black, white, and gray is accented with warm wooden details, such as door handles. Flooring choices, including black granite and white checkered marble, add subtle quirks, while gray MS structures recede into the background. Insulated PUF ceiling panels ensure thermal comfort, and transparent walls visually extend the courtyard into the interiors, fostering openness and connectivity. Project Monokuro exemplifies sustainable design by prioritizing the repurposing of existing spaces. Beyond functionality and aesthetics, it enriches the workplace experience, creating a meaningful connection between individuals and their built environments.Monokuro transforms a 1970s canteen block in Ahmedabad into a modern office spaceMonokuro honors the city’s industrial legacy influenced by modernist visionaries like Louis Kahn and Le Corbusierthe adaptive reuse project retains the building’s original geometric form, including its inverted beam roofMild Steel, chosen for its reusability, plays a central role in the redesign, emphasizing adaptabilitythe central courtyard fosters community interaction, offering a lush green oasis amid the industrial surroundingstransparent walls extend the courtyard’s greenery into the interior spaces, creating a sense of openness",
