  "text": "The Main Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, December 6. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today. The home of the future — it’s a place we’ve all seen in films, on TV, and even at exhibitions. If you were lucky, it might have been your rich friend’s parents’ house growing up. It’s usually an awe-inspiring, glazed hilltop palace where the fridge orders matcha before you run out, where lighting switches from meditation to movie night with a single word, and the dog has its own passcode for the alarm system. Whether it was Star Trek’s replicators printing out meals, Marvel’s disembodied assistant JARVIS, or the Jetsons’ robotic pet cross-household appliance Lectronimo, not so long ago, it all felt like a fantasy. Yet today, in the midst of the biggest technological revolution ever, not only are these devices a reality — they are even better than we imagined. While Alexa is part of everyday life, and many of us couldn’t live without our Roombas rolling around, it’s not only the big names that are driving our homes into the future. Thousands of amazing products hit the market each year, determined to make our lives easier and our homes more intuitive. At Architizer, we’re determined to celebrate these incredible feats of design. So, here are 14 futuristic products that won our coveted Architizer A+Product Awards prizes and will make any home fit for the future. Enter the A+Product Awards CUPACLAD By Cupa Pizarras Popular Choice Winner, Building Envelopes, Cladding \u0026 Roofing, 2024 A+Product Awards If the future of cladding means elegance, endurance and zero maintenance, CUPACLAD is on it. Crafted from 100% natural slate, CUPACLAD delivers a façade system that’s not only non-combustible and waterproof but actually gets better with age. This cladding is the real deal for sustainable design, requiring no upkeep or repainting while reducing water, energy and carbon impact during the construction phase. It’s easy to install, and in addition, CUPA PIZARRAS has its own internal design teams, ensuring the vision of every client is not only realized but elevated with unique design flair. Airiva Wind Energy System By Airiva Jury Winner, Smart Design \u0026 Technology, 2024 A+Product Awards The Airiva Wind Energy System is reshaping renewable energy in urban design. With its sleek, modular array of vertical turbines, Airiva is ideal for housing developments and urban landscapes, turning partition walls into on-site power generators. Scalable to meet the energy needs of anything from a single building to a sprawling development, it’s an adaptable solution for architects and developers.

Made from bio-based, sustainable polymers, RE/8 reduces the carbon footprint by up to 80% and can be used indoors as a striking interior feature or outdoors for shading and ventilation.

ISCC PLUS-certified and 100% recyclable, RE/8 is a forward-thinking choice that merges aesthetics with impressive environmental performance. PureBond® By Columbia Forest Products Popular Choice Winner, Cabinetry \u0026 Millwork, 2024 A+Product Awards. PureBond® is an eco-friendly answer to high-quality cabinetry and built furniture. The North American-made hardwood plywood uses a soy-based, formaldehyde-free adhesive inspired by the way mussels naturally grip. It is an excellent material choice in the home for anyone wanting beautiful, durable interiors without risking air quality. Designed to be cost-competitive with traditional materials yet boasting superior water resistance, PureBond® panels support LEED and FSC certifications and ensure no off-gassing, adding peace of mind alongside stylish surfaces. Bio-Acoustic Claypot Wall Panel By CSI Creative Popular Choice Winner, Acoustics, 2024 A+Product Awards The Bio-Acoustic Claypot Wall Panel is nature, culture, and acoustic control all together in one striking design. Inspired by traditional handmade clay pots, the panels combine fire-safe replica greenery with high-performance acoustic PET felt backers for a tranquil, biophilic feature that also has great sound-absorbing qualities. It’s ideal for softening spaces both visually and acoustically. The Claypot Panel offers customizable foliage and colors, letting designers tailor each installation for maximum impact.

LHOV By Elica Jury Winner, Appliances, 2024 A+Product Awards LHOV is a very impressive kitchen appliance that combines hob, hood, and oven into one streamlined unit, designed for the burgeoning adaptable home market. LHOV is great for maximizing space and bringing an immediate dose of style. The 3-in-1 system saves space and looks great. It has no protruding corners and no interruptions. The extraction system is cleverly hidden within the appliance, while the extra-wide oven, found under the hob, is at an ergonomic height while also leaving free space below for further storage. In the modern home, every inch counts, and LHOV is acutely aware of that, providing great design and clever functionality.

With the option for custom pictogram embossing, these tiles offer a truly sustainable and creative choice, perfect for the eco-conscious homeowner looking to make an impact without compromising on style.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://winners.architizer.com/2024/Products/kitchen-bath-5/fixtures-fittings-kitchen-2/purist-suspend-mount-kitchen-faucet/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003e\u003cb\u003ePurist Suspend Mount Kitchen Faucet\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eBy \u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/brands/kohler-co\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eKohler Co.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch5\u003eJury Winner, Fixtures \u0026amp; Fittings – Kitchen, 2024 A+Product Awards.\u003ci\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003c/h5\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1707\" srcset=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-300x200.jpg 300w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-768x512.jpg 768w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-2048x1365.jpg 2048w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/2_Purist-Suspend_KOHLER-400x267.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\"/\u003eKohler’s Purist Suspend redefines the kitchen faucet with a ceiling-mounted design that’s unique and exciting.
