  "text": "Tree Tents, known for their innovative suspended treehouses, has developed a new outdoor accommodation called the Birdhouse Modular. This structure combines modular design with sustainable building practices, aiming to offer flexible and environmentally responsible options for outdoor living. The Birdhouse Modular is handcrafted in Sussex, England, by experienced craftsmen and is based on regenerative design principles. Its modular system, designed by Tree Tents founder Jason Thawley, allows for a wide variety of room configurations. This flexibility enables the structure to be adapted to many types of terrain, including forests, coastal areas, and private gardens. Modules can be combined in different layouts to create spaces that include bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchens, lounges, workspaces, art studios, saunas, and more. Optional features such as mezzanines, atriums, and covered outdoor areas provide additional spatial options. This modular accommodation is suitable for eco-tourism sites, commercial ventures, and private residences. It is designed to provide low-impact living spaces that accommodate various uses, from compact retreats to multi-room lodges. The Birdhouse Modular is built with sustainable materials such as responsibly sourced cedar, marine-grade plywood, aluminium, and glass. The structure is weather-resistant and designed to last with minimal maintenance. Its lightweight frame can be installed on flat decking or raised platforms to reduce impact on the ground. The Birdhouse Modular was developed in collaboration with WildComfort, an eco-tourism operator based in Devon, UK. WildComfort has previously used other Tree Tents structures and reported high occupancy rates. Their feedback highlights features such as large windows that offer views and well-insulated builds that enhance comfort. The first Birdhouse Modular installation is located on a cliffside site on England’s South Coast and is currently available for guest use. Designed for flat-pack delivery, the Birdhouse Modular can be assembled quickly by a small team, often within a single day. This approach helps to reduce construction time and costs while minimizing disturbance to the installation site. The modular plumbing system supports simple water and waste management, and the design supports both on-grid and off-grid power solutions, including solar energy. Energy-efficient lighting and charging ports are integrated into the structure to accommodate modern needs. The Birdhouse Modular reflects Tree Tents’ focus on regenerative design. Materials are sourced responsibly to reduce environmental impact. The modular nature of the design allows for adaptation and relocation as requirements change over time. Passive design elements and high-performance insulation contribute to energy efficiency, supporting a range of climates. The accommodation is suitable for those interested in eco-tourism or green living, offering options that minimize ecological footprints while maintaining comfort and functionality.",
