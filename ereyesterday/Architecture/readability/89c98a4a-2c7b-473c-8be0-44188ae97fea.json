  "text": "Redefining Urban Living with Biophilic DesignUNStudio has revealed its latest design for the Hannamdong-4 Residences in Seoul, a residential project developed in partnership with Samsung C\u0026T Corporation. This innovative proposal sets a new standard for urban living by combining biophilic design principles with cutting-edge sustainability features. With its sculptural, occupiable facade, the project aims to bridge the gap between the city and nature, bringing a unique residential lifestyle to the heart of the South Korean capital.UNStudio’s vision for Hannamdong-4 Residences introduces a new approach to urban living, where architecture, community, and environment unite. The design responds to the growing disconnect between Seoul’s Namsan Mountain and the Han River, resulting from rapid urbanization. By creating a cohesive architectural design that blends the vitality of city life with the serenity of natural surroundings, the project offers a future-ready living experience. The development features a series of towers strategically placed to emphasize the connection between nature and the urban environment.images © FlyingArchitectureunstudio brings spiraling towers to seoulSamsung C\u0026T’s Hannamdong-4 concept consists of a group of O-shaped towers along Seoul’s Han River, featuring a patented spiral design by UNStudio. Complementing these are X-shaped and L-shaped towers positioned along Bogwang-ro, leading towards Namsan Mountain. With the tower designs, the architects are heavily influenced by local natural elements, with a focus on reconnecting residents to their environment.UNStudio’s ‘Biophilic Nexus’ concept underpins the entire design, prioritizing both individual well-being and community connectivity. This approach draws inspiration from the unique characteristics of the surrounding landscape, creating a harmonious blend of architecture and nature.image © FlyingArchitecturenature-inspired Towers for Samsung C\u0026TUNStudio’s design for Samsung C\u0026T also takes cues from Seoul and South Korea’s rich history and natural symbols. The facade design is inspired by two key elements: the white pine, once thought to have disappeared but now re-emerging in Seoul, and waterlilies, which are emblematic of the Han River. These natural motifs are reflected in the building exteriors, creating a sculptural and environmentally integrated aesthetic.The X-shaped towers feature facades that mimic the texture and form of white pine trees, with vertical elements reminiscent of tree trunks and branches. The O-shaped towers incorporate waterlily-inspired rotating modules around the cylindrical structure, giving the buildings a sense of fluidity and natural movement. The L-shaped towers provide a backdrop to the O-shaped towers, combining both pine tree and waterlily-inspired elements to complement the overall design.image © UNStudioA key feature of the Hannamdong-4 Residences is the flexible layout of residential spaces. These adaptable interiors are designed to accommodate changing family configurations and diverse lifestyles. Residents can modify their living spaces to suit their specific needs, providing greater efficiency and personal customization. This flexibility not only enhances spatial use but also reflects a forward-thinking approach to urban living, ensuring that the development remains relevant to future generations.Community engagement is central to the design of Hannamdong-4 Residences. The development includes expansive shared spaces and lush landscaping aimed at fostering a sense of belonging in an otherwise densely populated urban setting. Among the standout features is the ‘Highline 365,’ a 365-meter-long eco-friendly elevated walkway that will provide year-round gardens and jogging tracks for both residents and locals.In addition, Samsung C\u0026T Corporation plans to establish five parks throughout the development, covering a total area of 33,000 square meters. These parks will offer green spaces more than five times the size of the Seoul City Hall lawn, creating ample opportunities for relaxation and recreation.image © UNStudioUNStudio’s commitment to sustainability is evident throughout the design of Hannamdong-4 Residences. The project incorporates numerous environmentally friendly features, including green terraces that improve air quality and promote biodiversity. Advanced water management systems, such as rainwater harvesting and permeable paving, help reduce the development’s environmental impact.Energy-efficient technologies, including solar panels and renewable energy solutions, further contribute to reducing the carbon footprint of the development. These sustainable design measures ensure that the project not only enhances the well-being of its residents but also preserves the natural landscape and ecosystem of the area.image © UNStudio",
