  "text": "New York architecture studio Young Projects has created a wooden pavilion on the grounds of Art Omi in the Hudson Valley with pine wood slats that \"clatter and sway\" in the wind. The Match House was commissioned by arts centre Art Omi to be installed in its Sculpture and Architecture Park, which sees a rotation of architecture pavilions and art installations. Young Projects has created a pavilion with a \"fraying\" top. The photo is by Bryan ZimmermanThe pine wood structure consists of a base made of a series of right-angle corners, topped with several sections of wooden slats that form fanning sections. These \"fraying surfaces\" move with the wind. It is made with pine wood timber and lined with plywood\"The crisp sculptural vessels of the upper portion are defined by a combination of static, precise surfaces clad over timber framing and loosely held fraying surfaces,\" said Young Projects. \"An aggregation of individual slats held by a unique cradle attachment allows the structure to clatter and sway in the wind while visually merging the backdrop of sky, tree, and land with the prominent, tactile graining of the pine cladding.\" The structure's shape was formed using a \"manipulated\" four-square grid, according to the team, with each section based around a square foundation. Visitors enter the pavilion through a wide opening on one side. Inside, the upper portion's structure has four chimney-like elements extending from the base. Its form is made from a \"manipulated\" four-square grid. The photo is by Bryan ZimmermanTwo of the upper chambers are open to the sky, creating skylight, while plywood lines the interior. A light grey \"marbled\" stain was used for a finish. \"The structure rises from the ground to its crest through the geometric constraints of a manipulated four-square grid,\" said the studio.  \"The discontinuities between the upper and lower portions of the structure allow for unexpected undulations of form and figure moving from disjointed to resolved as one circles around the piece.\" Young Projects is based in New York City and was founded by Bryan Young in 2010. The studio's work spans buildings to furniture and material research. Other recent architectural pavilions include several timber structures constructed on the historic grounds of the Woodstock festival and pavilions made of timber and robotically woven flax in Germany. The photography is by Caleb Ehly courtesy of Young Projects unless otherwise noted Match House is on view at Art Omi in the Hudson Valley until Summer 2026.
