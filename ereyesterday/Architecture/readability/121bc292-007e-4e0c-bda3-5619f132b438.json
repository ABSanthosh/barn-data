It sits on a lot with a distinctive topography, conceived by OSPA Arquitetura \u0026 Urbanismo as a pure elemental volume that cantilevers at the top of a sloping terrain. From this elevated positioning, residents can also enjoy unobstructed views of the surrounding natural landscape, while remaining concealed from the front road. Enhancing this visual dialogue, the Brazilian studio intentionally defines the house’s material palette as raw, featuring exposed concrete, glass enclosures, wood, and natural stone floors.all images courtesy of OSPA Arquitetura \u0026 Urbanismothe cantilevering home embraces an elemental materialityAltos House’s structure aligns with the southern boundary of the plot, creating a spacious outdoor leisure area facing north, shaded by native Araucaria trees.
