  "text": "Robert Redford is offloading his Bay Area cottage-style pad, per the Wall Street Journal. The renowned actor and filmmaker reportedly put his quaint Tiburon Peninsula home, which is located north of San Francisco, on the market for $4.15 million. Redford initially purchased the four-bedroom dwelling in 2020 for $3.1 million after selling his longtime Napa Valley estate in 2019 for $7 million.Originally built in 1968, the Academy Award winner’s Tiburon split-level spans roughly 2,824 square feet on a 0.2-acre lot dotted with towering redwood trees. The property overlooks the San Francisco Bay and offers sweeping waterfront views of Keil Cove, Angel Island, and the Golden Gate Bridge.Redford and his wife, artist Sibylle Szaggars Redford, remodeled the interiors to give the home a bright and coastal feel. The pair added terraces and Mediterranean gardens rife with plants including lavender, jasmine, and succulents. The house’s great room boasts a soaring ceiling, a fireplace, and skylights, while the kitchen is lined with new appliances, a breakfast nook, and a walk-in pantry. Compass agent Steven Mavromihalis, who holds the listing, described the residence an “oasis of privacy,” perched on a quiet cul-de-sac with minimal traffic—perfect for a big-name actor.Join NowHoliday Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowThe listing comes several years after The Way We Were star announced his retirement from acting in 2018. While Redford and his wife expressed a “long history with and great affection for [the Tiburon area],” per Realtor, the duo decided to offload the property as they didn’t spend much time there. The Redfords primarily live in New Mexico, where Sibylle runs a fine art gallery in Santa Fe. The two also plan to devote more time to their local nonprofit, The Way of the Rain, which “produces educational and artistic performances to protect the environment and promote global conservation efforts,” according to Realtor.",
