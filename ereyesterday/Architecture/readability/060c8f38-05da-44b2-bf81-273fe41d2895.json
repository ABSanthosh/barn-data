  "text": "The first settlers to the colonial town of Ipswich, Massachusetts, experienced a fearsome nor’easter that made them question their journey soon after their arrival. On a stormy evening in 2020, Katie Martinez found herself in a similarly perpending mood. Pummeled by wind and rain, she and her husband had taken a car ferry from Martha’s Vineyard, where they were visiting her parents, to attend an open-house and were stranded when the return boat was canceled due to the weather.Bicoastal designer Katie Martinez renovated a historic 1807 home in her native New England, keeping true to its roots while imbuing it with a loose yet soulful aesthetic. Here, she’s pictured with the climbing hydrangea that is lovingly pruned and manicured along the house’s walls. Built in 1807, the Martin Keith House was hailed as one of the finest examples of Federal-era architecture before it fell into disrepair. A descendant of the original architect and builder rescued it from demolition in 1990, disassembling and storing it in a Cape Cod barn until 1995, when he found a buyer who could honor its history. The carefully reconstructed home preserved many original features, including the front stairway and shuttered fanlight doorway in the entry hall. Martinez hewed to its history, outfitting it with a vintage apothecary cabinet, an antique khotan from Eliko rugs, and a bronze sconce from Collier Webb topped with a Helene Blanche pleated lampshade. “It was pouring, and there was no electricity so it was really dark; we didn’t even see the backyard,” laughs the bicoastal interior designer, who then lived in San Francisco but grew up on the East Coast and was considering a move closer to family. “It was shocking how little we saw or knew about the house.” But she liked what she did see of the Federal-era property: an original leaded-glass fanlight doorway in the entry; a back hall painted with wall murals teasing hidden historic references; a bathroom wrapped in a beloved William Morris print; and, perhaps most notably, central air, “which is wild for these old houses,” the designer says. So Martinez and her husband hunkered down for six hours in the ferry parking lot, waiting for the storm to pass while hashing out a plan to sell their 1920s home in California, move across the country with their two daughters, and modernize the 1807 house before the next school year—no small feat.",
