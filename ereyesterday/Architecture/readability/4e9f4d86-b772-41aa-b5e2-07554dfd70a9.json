  "text": "CPLUS’ KALHA Hotel·Unico project revitalizes Fangjialiang VillageKALHA Hotel·Unico project, led by CPLUS Architects, represents a village revitalization effort, structured as a co-development model aimed at introducing urban living possibilities into a rural setting. The project is located in Fangjialiang Village, Chicheng County, Zhangjiakou City, Hebei Province, about 35 kilometers from Chongli High-Speed Rail Station. Phase one of this development incorporates over 60 previously unused courtyards, each ranging from 200 to 400 sqm. Of these, 45 will serve as residential spaces, and 10 as hotel accommodations, supplemented by facilities including a village hall, Dragon King Temple (designated for reception), workshops, dining areas, gyms, and public restrooms, along with offices and staff quarters for the Unico project.The majority of residences within Unico are intended for long-term residents; however, KALHA Hotel has been designed to facilitate short-term stays, providing an opportunity for urban dwellers to experience village life. The name ‘KALHA’ combines ‘KALGAN,’ the historical term for Zhangjiakou in Mongolian, and ‘HA,’ meaning ‘wall,’ symbolizing both protection and a connection to the local heritage. This naming reflects a commitment to the land and aspirations for the future of the KALHA.all images by ©Liu Jing unless stated otherwiseirregular layout of scattered houses follows natural terrainIn contrast to the independent houses scattered throughout the village, KALHA Hotel presents a cohesive spatial system defined by its enclosing walls. The hotel follows the natural slope of the terrain, extending horizontally to the north, providing panoramic views of both the village and surrounding mountains. For the design, the architectural team at CPLUS deliberately avoids using a definitive central axis; instead, arranges an irregular layout that resonates with the spontaneous development characteristic of the village.The hotel features 10 guest rooms situated at varying elevations to adapt to the topography, allowing for unique forms without disrupting established residential boundaries. This results in a structure that lacks a prominent facade, exhibiting an organic and varied arrangement akin to a small settlement. A series of zigzagging courtyard walls encloses KALHA Hotel enabling it to seamlessly merge with the existing village landscape. These walls not only facilitate efficient management and service but also contribute to the hotel’s visual identity. Both the courtyard walls and the guest room facades, painted in earthy tones, echo the surrounding soil, appearing as geometric sculptures emerging naturally from the landscape.CPLUS introduces the KALHA Hotel within the Unico project to revitalize Fangjialiang VillageCPLUS’ KALHA Hotel enhances residents’ interactions with natureInternally, the spatial layout reflects former village pathways, now transformed into public streets inside the hotel, with pure walls and open spatial scales, that accommodate various community events such as exhibitions, lectures, and performances. This area is anticipated to become a dynamic hub within the hotel.Each guest room is relatively independent, designed with an inward-facing courtyard, ensuring privacy while providing views of lush vegetation and distant mountains. To enhance interactions with nature, the architects have incorporated self-opening apertures in the courtyard walls. Additionally, a staircase leads to a rooftop terrace, allowing guests to enjoy expansive views of the Unico landscape.located near Zhangjiakou City, KALHA Hotel offers a modern twist on rural living in Hebei Provinceover 60 courtyards, once unused, have been transformed for residential and hotel use in the Unico projecteach courtyard spans 200-400 sqm, with 45 designated for long-term residents and 10 for guestsKALHA Hotel combines modern hospitality with traditional village settings, fostering new community spaces",
