  "text": "a vibrant new roof for helsinki’s underground museumYinka Ilori: Transparent Happiness opens at Helsinki’s Amos Rex museum as a vibrant public art commission that invites the Finnish capital to reimagine its urban spaces. Unveiled on June 20th, 2025, the large-scale work engages the museum’s signature mounds, transforming them into a space that is interactive and accessible. Through the project, Ilori reinterprets a popular urban site, bringing a sense of joy and communal spirit to Lasipalatsi Square, one of Helsinki’s most well-frequented spaces.Transparent Happiness is the first in an annual series of public commissions hosted by Amos Rex, an institution known for activating its unique urban setting through art. Ilori’s work stands in contrast to the sleek, minimalist lines of the museum’s Modernist architecture, offering an environment designed for both reflection and play. The installation features a variety of functional spaces, including a playground, a pedestrian and skateboarding trail, a basketball court, and a ping pong table, all encouraging public interaction. Through this transformation, Ilori breathes new life into the urban square, making it a destination for people of all ages.images © Mika Huisman / Amos Rexyinka ilori’s playful reinterpretation of amos rexInspired by the vibrant colors and cultural narratives of his Nigerian heritage, Yinka Ilori’s installation at Amos Rex brings to life his childhood memories of playgrounds in London. Transparent Happiness is a space not just for physical play but for collective storytelling. Visitors are invited to interact with the space, engaging in playful activities that spark memories and anecdotes, creating an atmosphere that feels both nostalgic and refreshing. The installation reflects the artist‘s belief that public art should be accessible, joyous, and capable of creating connections between individuals from diverse backgrounds.The museum’s mission to activate Lasipalatsi Square with dynamic art and events aligns with Ilori’s vision of public space as a place for inclusion and community. As the artist’s first public realm project in northern Europe, the work raises questions about the identity and accessibility of public spaces.Yinka Ilori: Transparent Happiness transforms the iconic mounds at Amos Rex in Helsinkiinstallation art for the communityYinka Ilori’s installation at Amos Rex is a celebration of art’s power to foster social connections. Visitors will find themselves immersed in an environment that encourages interaction, play, and the sharing of personal stories. As the installation remains on view through fall 2025, it brings an opportunity for the people of Helsinki to experience public art and contribute to the space through their presence and engagement.‘Which identities are welcome in the efficient, well-maintained Nordic public realm?‘ asks Museum Director Kieran Long, echoing the underlying themes of Ilori’s work.
