  "text": "Pop legend Britney Spears has moved to Mexico—at least, that’s what she claimed in an Instagram video on Monday, citing paparazzi as the reason for her departure. Though several outlets have reported the news at face value, it’s certainly possible Spears was kidding. (She posted another video that day, which marked her 43rd birthday, in which she said, “I’m turning five years old, and I have to go to kindergarten tomorrow.”) A source told People that the star is merely on a birthday trip across the border, so it seems Spears was either being facetious or she made an exceptionally bold decision while on vacation. No matter the case, the multihyphenate is just the latest to make headlines for joining what seems like a growing conga line of American celebrities cha-cha-ing its way out of these United States. Below, we recap the stars who have recently made international moves.Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de RossiEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi grabbed perhaps the most headlines for their departure, which was reportedly Trump-related. TMZ quoted a source who said the power couple were “very disillusioned” by the election’s outcome and promptly decided “to get the hell out.” Conveniently, the pair had just bought a home in the Cotswolds in October. According to the Standard, their new six-bedroom English farmhouse sits on a 43-acre plot complete with a guest cottage, so they have plenty of room if any of their famous US-based friends want to scope out the expat lifestyle. Reportedly, the longtime California residents do not plan to return Stateside. “Looking forward to our first snowy Christmas,” DeGeneres wrote in an Instagram post celebrating the pair’s anniversary—oh, and the former talk show host got rid of her signature blonde hair, so she’s really out there reinventing herself.Shop Open DoorYour favorite celebrity homes come to life. Bring the look to your own space with these editor-approved picks inspired by the tours.ArrowEva LongoriaLast month, it was reported that Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria also left the country due to Trump’s win, though the actor later clarified that her work had already taken her abroad years prior to the election. Nowadays, the Texas native splits her time between Spain and Mexico with her husband, Mexican producer José Bastón, and their six-year-old son, Santiago. “I’m privileged,” Longoria said in Marie Claire’s November cover story.“I get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren’t so lucky. They’re going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them.” The Flamin’ Hot director told the outlet that the pandemic cemented the fact that “the vibe was different” in the US of A and that it was time for her to leave. “Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to shit on California—it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now,” she said.America FerreraAmerica Ferrera is reportedly also leaving in favor of the UK. “She is devastated that Kamala lost. She thought the country she lived in was better than that,” a source told the Daily Mail. “She is going to continue to have a presence in the US for work purposes and to fight for Latinas and women, but she will be overseas for family and to benefit her kids’ education.” The Barbie actor was seen scoping out a private school in London last month.Richard GereBack in April, Richard Gere revealed that he was moving to his wife’s native Spain. “For me, going to Madrid is going to be a great adventure because I’ve never lived full-time outside the United States,” the actor told Vanity Fair. He officially severed ties with his home country last month, selling his Connecticut home for $10.75 million. “[My wife] was very generous in giving me six years living in my world, so I think it’s only fair that I give her at least another six living in hers,” he told the outlet. “[Spain] is a beautiful place, the food is extraordinary and the people exude sensitivity and generosity, as well as a strong will to laugh and enjoy. So I’m looking forward to going there.” Although his reasons for moving were familial, Gere did also mention Trump, who he referred to as “very crazy” in the interview.Whatever their personal reasoning, the recent slew of American celebs heading for foreign hills shows no signs of stopping.
