  "text": "In an episode of Özlem Discovery, a YouTube channel known for unique home tours, viewers are introduced to a secluded vineyard house tucked away on a one-acre plot in the tranquil hills of Sapanca, Turkey. Designed with strong influences from Japanese architecture, the home offers a bold and refreshing take on vacation living, unlike anything typically seen in the region. This single, stand-alone residence, named Rolling House, sits quietly behind a wooden gate, where visitors can park just outside and step into a garden surrounded by trees and expansive views of Sapanca. The landscape features palm trees, a central plane tree, gentle elevation changes with thoughtfully designed landscaping, a wooden swing, and a shaded barbecue and dining area. Every detail is aimed at creating a serene, almost meditative outdoor experience. At first glance, the architecture is striking. Clad in natural materials and shaped by minimalist principles, the house blends harmoniously into its vineyard setting. A heated pool and a sense of openness to nature adds to the retreat-like ambiance. Step inside, and the interior reveals a balance of sculptural forms and calming simplicity. At the center is a sunken jacuzzi with a circular skylight, a cozy space designed for relaxation. The compact bar-style kitchen includes everything needed for a comfortable stay: a two-burner electric stove, an electric kettle, a mini oven, and storage drawers with cookware and utensils. Its open-plan design avoids upper cabinets, keeping the space airy and connected to the outdoors. A four-person dining table leads into the heart of the home, where a stone-finished bathroom enhances the rustic feel. The house is equipped with underfloor heating, air conditioning in all rooms, and a central fireplace, ensuring comfort in all seasons. On the lower level, one of the two bedrooms features forest-facing windows on both sides, a floor mattress for two, an open wardrobe, and a cozy corner by the window. Upstairs, the second bedroom mirrors the first in layout and décor, with one exception: a more panoramic view of Sapanca’s natural beauty. The house features an eight-person sauna, perfect for unwinding after a swim or jacuzzi soak, while the bathroom has a rustic, stone-inspired design with a walk-in shower. Watch the video below to see it in more detail. This vineyard house isn’t just a vacation rental, it’s a design statement. With its Japanese influence, natural integration, and calming spatial flow, it invites guests to slow down and enjoy a different pace of life.",
