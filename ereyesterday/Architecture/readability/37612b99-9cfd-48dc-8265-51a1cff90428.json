  "text": "This week on Dezeen, automotive brand General Motors and developer Bedrock released their proposal to tear down two skyscrapers surrounding Detroit's tallest building. The plan calls for the removal of two of the five skyscrapers designed by American architect John Portman and the redevelopment of the remaining three, which include the tallest skyscraper in Detroit and all of Michigan. Called the Detroit Marriott, the 222-metre-tall tower will be kept and renovated. The 10 biggest building announcements of the year included the world's tallest residential tower in BrazilAs the year draws to an end, we began our review of 2024. Roundups published this week included the 10 biggest building announcements of the year, the top 10 home interiors and the top houses of 2024. The Dezeen team also picked their favourite design projects of the year, which included grow-at-home furniture and a device to prevent cancer patients from losing their hair. Jaguar's electric concept car divided opinion after being unveiled this weekCar brand Jaguar unveiled its electric concept car, Type 00, this week. The car divided opinion online, with descriptions ranging from a \"design triumph\" to an \"ugly, clunky behemoth\". Dezeen's co-CEO Wai Shin Li got to see the Type 00 in real life at its launch during Miami art week and captured the car in a set of exclusive photos. Will Burges' Six Columns was named RIBA's house of the yearThe Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) named Six Columns – the self-designed home of architect Will Burges and his studio 31/44 Architects in London – its RIBA House of the Year for 2024. The house, which is located on a tight wedge-shaped site in Crystal Palace, was lauded for its adaptable design intended to accommodate the changing needs of Burges and his family over time. Mocha Mousse was named Pantone's colour of the year 2025Colour specialist Pantone revealed its colour of the year, the \"unpretentious\" chocolatey-brown hue Mocha Mousse. According to Pantone, the colour symbolises a \"reframing of anything that could possibly be a trigger into something more positive, and this whole idea of little treat culture.\" The restored interior of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris was showcased this weekThe restored interiors of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris were revealed on Monday, days before the renovated cathedral reopened. The event marked a major milestone in the restoration of the gothic cathedral, which was severely damaged in a huge fire in 2019.
