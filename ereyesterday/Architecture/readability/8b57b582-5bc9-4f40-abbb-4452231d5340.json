  "text": "Mexican architect Fernando Romero has announced plans to restore the La Cuadra estate in Mexico City, designed by famed architect Luis Barragán, while adding pavilions by renowned architects such as Japan-based Kengo Kuma. After he purchased the property in 2024, Romero made plans to restore and conserve the 1960s property and convert it into a campus for the arts in Mexico City. The architect's foundation, Fundación Fernando Romero, plans to execute a multi-year project to create infrastructure for public tourism at the site, including a permanent gallery showcasing Barragán's work, as well as a library, gift shop and event venue. Architect Fernando Romero will restore and expand an estate designed by Luis Barragán\"It is a great honor to begin this work by envisioning La Cuadra as a dynamic cultural hub that encourages new possibilities at the intersection of art and architecture,\" said Romero. \"Through a range of programming, we aim to catalyze the power of architecture for the visiting public and celebrate the enduring cultural influence of Luis Barragán.\" Barragán, revered internationally for his colourful take on modern architecture, designed the property in the 1960s as a residence, with stables, outbuildings, pools for horses and people and a grand courtyard. According to the foundation that promotes the architect's legacy, the estate was an early example of Barragán's attempts to give urban residences a country-like feel. Romero and his team will use the expansive, 6.7-acre walled property to install pavilions and installations, including an all-timber pavilion to be designed by Kuma. No details have been released about the size or nature of the pavilion. The permanent Barragán exhibition will be designed by Mexican architect Jorge Covarrubias, known for his restoration of other Barragán properties, such as Casa Prieto López and Fuente del Bebedero. It will include a permanent gallery as well as pavilionsThe cultural centre will open up in October 2025, with a preview featuring interventions and lectures by artist Marina Abramović on during Mexico City's art week in early February. Romero is the founder of the architecture studio FR-EE. He has worked on significant architectural projects in Mexico City, such as the sculptural Museo Soumaya. Romero also won a commission in 2017 to design a Hyperloop for Mexico City, which has not been realized. The photography is courtesy of Fundación Fernando Romero.
