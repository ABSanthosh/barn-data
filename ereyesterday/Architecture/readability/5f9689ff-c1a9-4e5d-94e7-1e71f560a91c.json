  "text": "He famously hails from Philadelphia, but where does Kevin Hart live today? The comedy heavyweight's homes tend to lean towards a Spanish or Mediterranean style, with modern updates and interiors. “I love the feel of modern [design],” Hart, who traded the City of Brotherly Love for La-La Land long ago, told AD during a 2023 tour of his Hollywood office space. “I want open spaces. I want a lot of glass.” That affinity is reflected in the actor’s real estate portfolio, which is a showcase of open-plan, glass-lined spaces.Another recurring theme that the Fatherhood star seems to gravitate towards when house-shopping is a sprawling property with extensive outdoor amenities; swimming pools and patios are just the beginning for the father of four. Below, we’ve rounded up some of the lavish pads Hart has called home.Tarzana homeHart had a busy year in 2012; he was in three movies—Think Like a Man, Exit Strategy, and The Five Year Engagement—and bought a new house, where he would reside for the next seven years. The actor spent $1.99 million on a two-story mansion in Tarzana, California, in the upscale, private Mulholland Park neighborhood. The contemporary 2000-built residence spans 6,549 square feet and sports a Spanish-Colonial-Revival-style exterior with curved red clay roof tiles, arches, balconies, and stately columns bordering a tall wrought iron front door.Inside, a double-height foyer features a white marble floor, a colossal chandelier, and two winding staircases lined with a wrought iron railing that meet on the second floor. Beyond the foyer, a living room has backyard access, oversized windows, and a metallic floor-to-ceiling fireplace. The home boasts seven bedrooms and bathrooms. An entire wing is devoted to the primary suite, which boasts a fireplace, a spacious bathroom with a freestanding soaking tub, walk-in closets, and a private balcony.The home’s outdoor spaces are equally impressive; a pool with a waterfall feature, a covered dining patio, and an outdoor barbecue kitchen are all found out back.Hart sold the mansion for $2.75 million in 2019.Spanish-style mansionThe Central Intelligence star moved into his present-day primary residence in Calabasas, California, in 2018. Resting on a 26-acre plot, the abode—custom-built for the Fight Night actor, his wife, Eniko, and their four children—reportedly cost a total of about $5 million. The Spanish villa-style dwelling spans an impressive 9,500 square feet.Since the house was never listed, all we know about its interior is what we can glean from Hart’s photos shared on social media. One post reveals a living room with a particularly comfy-looking brown sectional and a TV mounted on a marble statement wall above an electric fireplace, flanked by a built-in bookshelf and a window seat. Another angle of the room shows an open floor plan, with a casual dining area and a kitchen equipped with an eat-in island, wood cabinets, and open shelving.A playground, swimming pool, volleyball court, and an indoor-outdoor gym dubbed Hustle Hart are also on the premises. Hart also offered a glimpse of the back of the house, which offers a sizable covered patio accessible by a sliding glass wall. An outdoor kitchen lined with patterned tiles can be spotted nearby. A video shared by the Borderlands actor showcases the pool area, revealing that it is centered by a spa with a waterfall and bordered by shaded lounge areas. A nearby spiral staircase with glass sides accesses a second-floor patio on the back side of the residence.The comedian seems to maintain this dwelling as his primary residence.Calabasas house next doorIn 2021, Hart expanded his Calabasas estate with the purchase of a $7 million mansion next door to his primary home. The 16-acre plot added a second full-size home—spanning 9,349 square feet, with six bedrooms and bathrooms—to his already sizable California compound.Built in 2004, the Mediterranean-style home has stucco and stone exteriors topped with curved roof tiles. A sunlight-flooded living room with a fireplace, a huge white kitchen centered around a marble-topped island, and numerous sets of French doors leading to the backyard are found in the common areas, while the primary suite features a gigantic spa-like bathroom, a private balcony, and a labyrinth of a walk-in closet.An infinity-edged pool, tennis court, putting green, koi pond with a waterfall, and a well-equipped outdoor kitchen make up some of the impressive outdoor amenities on site. A separate wine cellar, a guesthouse, and a poolside casita with an additional bathroom round out the property, which Hart still owns.",
