  "text": "system 02: Flexible Design for Larger GroupsThe Backcountry Hut System 02, developed with Leckie Studio Architecture + Design, exemplifies a modern approach to prefabricated cabin design. Known for its adaptability and efficiency, the two-story System 02 is inspired by traditional alpine dwelling while offering contemporary flexibility and durability.The System 02 cabin kit is designed for larger groups or families with its spacious, two-story organization. Each module measures 18.5 feet by 10 feet, with a total of 185 square feet per module, and multiple modules can be combined to create custom floor plans. Configurations are customizable and may include features like master bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms, highlighting the adaptability of the system. See designboom’s coverage of The Backcountry Hut Company’s one-story cabin variation here.image © Julian Parkinsonengineered for Extreme ConditionsThe Backcountry Hut Company and the architects at Leckie Studio engineer the System 02 cabin for harsh environments, as the dwellings are constructed to withstand extreme weather while requiring minimal maintenance. The prefabricated nature of the structure ensures a durable and long-lasting solution for remote or rugged locations, making it a durable choice for backcountry enthusiasts and homeowners alike.The modular design of the System 02 allows for an efficient assembly process. Depending on site requirements, the structure can often be built with little to no mechanical assistance. In ideal conditions, a skilled team can assemble the cabin’s shell in as little as four to six weeks. This streamlined process demonstrates the practical advantages of modern prefabrication.System 02 is a modular two-story cabin designed with Leckie Studio | image © Russell DalbyPrefabricated backcountry hut by leckie studioModularity is at the core of The Backcountry Hut System 02. Its standardized structural components can be adapted to various needs, from individual retreats to larger family cabins. The design also allows for extensive customization, with separate platforms for the shell and interior fit-out, accommodating different uses such as outdoor recreation or urban living. The cabin incorporates sustainably sourced materials, including FSC-certified lumber and engineered wood products. Its prefabricated insulated panels and zero-waste philosophy further enhance its environmental credentials. Built on a pile foundation system, the cabin minimizes its impact on the surrounding site.The Backcountry Hut Company has recently announced that its System 02 cabin, created in collaboration with Leckie Studio, has won Construction Product Design of the Year at the renowned BLT Built Design Awards 2024. With more than twenty-five installations across Canada and the US, ranging from 691 square feet to 1,826 square feet, the System 02 showcases the potential of modular building systems.flexible floor plans can accommodate larger groups or families | image © Adrien Williamsengineered for extreme weather conditions and minimal maintenance | image © Russell Dalbymodular components allow for quick assembly in as little as four to six weeks | image © Russell Dalby",
