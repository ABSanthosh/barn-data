  "text": "Woods Bagot Unveils Sydney Central Station RenovationWoods Bagot has completed its Sydney Central Station renovation, part of the Sydney Metro project, Australia’s largest infrastructure development. The project has transformed Sydney’s transport landscape, adding 31 metro stations and more than 66 kilometers of new rail. Central Station, the core of the city’s rail network, plays a vital role in accommodating 40,000 metro passengers per hour, a 60 percent increase in capacity.The renovation, a collaborative effort between Woods Bagot and John McAslan Partners, with construction by Laing O’Rourke, is described as a ‘once-in-a-century’ development as it has enhanced the station’s capacity and functionality. Woods Bagot Principal and Transport Lead John Prentice emphasizes that the design approach centers on customer experience, incorporating open spaces like the new Northern Concourse roof and Central Walk to improve flow and navigation within the station.images © Trevor Meinsydney central station’s Century-Defining UpgradeThe station’s new additions by architecture and design studio Woods Bagot, including metro platforms and concourses, are designed to be both functional and sculptural, blending with the station’s historic architecture. Prentice notes that material selection is key to grounding the design in its local context, providing a civic quality that complements the station’s heritage.The highlight of the renovation is the construction of two new metro platforms beneath the existing Intercity platforms 13 and 14. These new platforms create a major interchange, connecting metro services with suburban, intercity, and regional rail lines. What’s more, the 19-meter-wide Central Walk concourse eases congestion and improves pedestrian flow. This concourse connects Chalmers Street and Sydney Light Rail to the new metro platforms, offering better access to suburban platforms 16-23 and incorporating escalators and lifts.Woods Bagot has announced the completion of the Sydney Central Station renovationIntegration with Sydney’s History and DesignWoods Bagot Global Design Director Domenic Alvaro explains that the material choices for the project are inspired by Sydney’s history, with a focus on a fluid, efficient commuter experience. The station’s design aims to rival iconic train stations around the world, delivering a functional and aesthetically pleasing transport hub for Sydney. The renovation also includes the creation of a new North-South Concourse and the refurbishment of the Northern Concourse. This upgrade replaces dark pedestrian tunnels with a bright, open public space inspired by the great train halls of the world. Improved orientation and new connections between surrounding precincts will enhance accessibility and ease of use.The reimagined Northern Concourse honors the station’s Edwardian architecture. The new roof design, featuring kite-shaped skylights, contrasts with the heritage sandstone buildings, creating a modern yet respectful addition to the historic station. The project has earned a 6-Star Green Star Design and As Built rating, with sustainability at the core of the design.the project is part of the larger Sydney Metro, Australia’s biggest infrastructure developmentthe renovation increases station capacity by 60 percent, accommodating 40,000 passengers per hourtwo new metro platforms are built under existing intercity platforms to create a major interchange",
