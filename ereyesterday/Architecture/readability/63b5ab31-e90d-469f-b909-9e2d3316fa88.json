  "text": "construction completes at toyota woven city in japanAt CES 2025, Toyota announced the completion of Phase 1 construction for its Toyota Woven City, a futuristic prototype urban development designed as a test course for future mobility. The project was first revealed at CES 2020, introduced to take shape as a fully connected ecosystem powered by hydrogen cells, designed by Bjarke Ingels Group. Located at the former Higashi-Fuji Plant site at the base of Mount Fuji in Japan, this human-centered urban experiment is envisioned as a living laboratory. It will become home to inventors, startups, and researchers as a place to co-create solutions for societal challenges while reimagining the future of urban life.The scheme is being developed in collaboration with Woven by Toyota, with the masterplan underscored by environmentally conscious principles with advanced technologies aimed at enhancing mobility, connectivity, and well-being from land, sea, and air to space. The first phase has also earned Japan’s first LEED for Communities Platinum certification, reflecting Toyota’s sustainability values. While the official launch is anticipated to take place in fall this year, doors will open to the general public starting in 2026.all images courtesy of Toyotaa prototype city designed as a test course for future mobilityThe concept of Woven City was first introduced at CES 2018 and 2020 as a vision of Toyota’s transformation from an automobile manufacturer into a mobility company. Its first phase, encompassing a collection of tools and spaces focused on co-creation and innovation, will house approximately 360 residents, including Toyota employees and their families, who will take part in co-creation activities alongside external inventors, known as ‘Weavers.’ As the city grows, the population is expected to expand to 2,000, supported by future construction phases. Insights gathered from Phase 1 will refine the city’s design and functionality for subsequent stages.Woven City embodies Toyota’s ambition to expand the concept of mobility to include the movement of goods, information, and energy. The company is leveraging tools like the Arene OS software platform and advanced driver-assistance technologies (AD/ADAS) to redefine connectivity and safety. Woven by Toyota also recently announced an investment in Interstellar Technologies Inc. and will leverage Toyota’s expertise to support the mass production of rockets. The city’s innovation ecosystem also includes partnerships with external startups, entrepreneurs, and corporations, such as ENEOS, NTT, and Rinnai. Toyota also plans to launch an accelerator program in summer 2025 to invite entrepreneurs and universities and research institutions to participate in the city’s collaborative initiatives. Alongside this, additional key developments include transforming parts of the former Higashi-Fuji Plant into a manufacturing hub and preparing for Phase 2 construction.Phase 1 construction for Toyota Woven City completesthe city is designed by Bjarke Ingels Grouplocated at the former Higashi-Fuji Plant site at the base of Mount Fuji in Japana prototype city designed as a test course for future mobilityunderscored by environmentally conscious principles with advanced technologies",
