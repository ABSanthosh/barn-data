However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Park City, Utah, isn’t just a ski town—it’s a full-blown mountain playground that delivers year-round adventure, world-class dining, and a healthy dose of Hollywood glam every January. But whether you’re carving Deer Valley’s legendary slopes, catching a Sundance screening, fly-fishing in alpine streams, or just here for the mountain air and Main Street’s buzzy après scene, where you stay matters.The best Park City Airbnbs and hotels aren’t just places to sleep; they’re an extension of the experience—ski-in, ski-out resorts with five-star amenities, historic boutique stays with a story to tell, and impeccably designed vacation rentals that can house your whole crew.Luckily, boutique hotels and vacation rentals are easy to find (even ski-in/ski-out options), and firepits, saunas, and private hot tubs are readily available for those prioritizing a bit of relaxation. Keep in mind that rental prices and room rates will fluctuate greatly during the winter and festival season, spiking in January. To save you some work, we pulled together our favorite Park City Airbnbs and luxe hotels to make the most of the snowfall Miracle March has ushered in.This two-bedroom, two-bath rental located right at the top of Main Street is packed with a range of amenities: a professional-grade kitchen, a steam shower, custom furniture, and an air-jet tub. But the most impressive element is just how thoughtful the original—or should we say, original-ish—details are. The owners found wallpaper reproduced from an 1880s-era mining town, the shower is outfitted with tile salvaged from the Utah Governor’s Mansion, and even the trims were custom-milled to match the home’s original state. Beyond the cozy confines of your new temporary home, you’re a quick walk or trolley ride to restaurants, bars, galleries, and more. From $624/night.If you want to get out of town a bit—hey, sometimes the solitude of a ski run just isn’t enough—this three-bedroom rental is a 25-minute drive from Park City right near Mount Timpanogos. The vibe is minimal inside; think Shaker-inspired furniture and white walls, a wood-burning stove, and wide-plank wooden floors. The bedrooms have queen beds topped with Casper mattresses and there are three decks to take in the views from. From $331/night.Far from your traditional vision of a ski chalet, this four-bedroom home has a lot of things going for it. Our favorite of the bunch? The kitchen’s teal marble island. A floating staircase anchors the open floorplan and a private hot tub will draw you outside, even in the coldest of temperatures. The home is unmissable from the street—the exterior is a bright chartreuse. From $767/night.Getting to this one-bedroom treehouse is a bit of an adventure in itself. Accessible only by 4x4 or a car with dependable 4WD (chains required in the wintertime), it’s surrounded by 200-year-old trees at an elevation of 8,000 feet. Inside, there’s a bedroom nestled underneath a skylight, a living room with 270-degree windows, and a big deck. Waking up with the sun is a highlight that can only be matched with a stargazing session on the patio. From $196/night.Courtesy of AirbnbDesigned for those who want to escape into nature without sacrificing style (or fun—did you see that hammock floor?), this two-bedroom cabin is secluded on two acres just outside Park City. Exposed wood beams, tons of natural lighting, and cozy nooks make it effortlessly inviting. Guests can also enjoy a fireplace, a full kitchen, and a living room equipped with an entertainment system. The cabin is somewhat secluded, offering privacy and an off-grid vibe while still being within a reasonable driving distance of Park City and all its adventures. From $199/night.Courtesy of AirbnbDesigned to host up to 18 guests, this home features sleek contemporary interiors with high ceilings, expansive windows, and an open-concept layout that maximizes the breathtaking lake and mountain views. The decor leans minimalist, with a soothing neutral palette, plush furnishings, and warm wood accents, while the amenities—including a chef’s kitchen, multiple lounge areas, and a sauna—are more lavish. Outside, a massive deck with a fire pit and hot tub sets the stage for golden-hour hangs and late-night stargazing. From $2,754/night.This Park City stunner is what happens when sleek modernism meets après-ski luxury. Think walls of glass framing snow-dusted pines, a decorative fireplace, and a trio of tile-rich bathrooms. The open-concept living space is a study in clean lines and warm, organic textures—soft neutrals, creamy leather details, and just the right amount of blonde wood to remind you that, yes, you are in the forest. Arguably, the two best features for powderhounds are the gear storage area, complete with a boot dryer and a waxing and tuning station, and the hot tub because no mountain retreat is complete without a post-slope soak. From $510/night.Best Hotels in Park CityGoldener Hirsch is where old-world Austrian charm meets Deer Valley’s modern luxury. The original 18-suite lodge, built in 1992, is a nod to Bavaria, with arched doorways, roaring fireplaces, and hand-carved and ornately painted woodwork imported from Austria. In 2020, an expansion added 50 complimentary but far more contemporary rooms (think clean lines, rich textures, and custom-built furnishings that feel more like a high-design penthouse than a ski lodge. The addition also introduced a rooftop patio with a hot tub. However, the Goldener Hirsch Restaurant remains a destination in itself, serving up decadent cheese fondue and hearty alpine fare in a setting that feels straight out of the Austrian Alps. From $372/night.Opened in late 2024, ​​Grand Hyatt Deer Valley is the new kid on the (very luxe) block, and it’s already redefining what a high-end ski retreat looks like in Park City. This sleek, ski-in/ski-out stunner swaps out the usual rustic lodge vibes for a polished mix of warm woods, natural stone, and floor-to-ceiling windows. The rooms and residences are decked out with fireplaces, deep soaking tubs, and balconies made for après-ski wine sipping, while the resort itself delivers on the full five-star experience—think a sprawling spa, a heated outdoor pool, and restaurants that lean into locally sourced, seasonal flavors. From $373/night.If any Park City hotel is a love letter to nature, it’s The Lodge at Blue Sky. Set on 3,500 private acres, this alpine sanctuary feels both impossibly refined and deeply connected to the great outdoors. The architecture is modern yet organic, with floor-to-ceiling windows that frame sweeping alpine vistas, reclaimed wood and limestone that ground the space in its rugged surroundings, and earthy, minimalist interiors that let the landscape take the spotlight. Some of the suites are even built into the hillside, making them feel like a natural extension of the terrain. But Blue Sky isn’t just about breathtaking design—it’s also about experiences.Here, guests can spend their days horseback riding through wildflower-blanketed meadows, fly fishing in mountain streams, or skiing at one of the nine nearby resorts (all of which Blue Sky offers shuttles to, though we’d recommend Park City Mountain Resort, where the hotel operates a private ski lounge stocked with complimentary hot drinks and home-baked pastries). On property, the Edge Spa (aptly named, considering it hangs over a precipice) offers a swath of luxurious treatments and an outdoor heated plunge pool. And when it’s time to eat, the on-site Yuta restaurant serves up hyper-seasonal dishes sourced straight from Blue Sky’s own farm. From $2,308/night.Nestled in a valley among the Wasatch Mountains, the sprawling 220-room Montage Deer Valley is conveniently located for direct ski-in/ski-out access to the Empire and Lady Morgan ski lifts at Deer Valley Resort. But the property may be even better known for its R\u0026R amenities after a day on the slopes: Hydromassage showers, deep soaking tubs, heated floors, and the largest spa in the state. The interiors take cues from chalet-style lodgings, with wood-beamed ceilings in the main areas, textured rugs underfoot, and contemporary seating for taking in the breathtaking views on all sides. On site, lots of gastropub fare and fresh sushi will keep you well-fed, and in warmer weather, you can even post up at the alpine pool for a dip. From $501/night.The AD Travel EditCraving an escape?
