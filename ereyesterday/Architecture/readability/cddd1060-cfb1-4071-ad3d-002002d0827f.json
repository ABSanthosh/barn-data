  "text": "HAM by Abarstudio Explores Gestalt in ArchitectureHAM by Abarstudio explores architecture through the lens of Gestalt principles, emphasizing simplicity, order, and perceptual clarity to create spaces that are visually engaging and easy to navigate. By employing fundamental shapes and figure-ground contrasts, it invites viewers to experience a harmonious fusion of form and function. Gestalt principles serve as foundational guidelines in perceiving and organizing visual information. In architecture, these principles help shape spaces that are intuitive and aesthetically harmonious, guiding users’ perception and enhancing spatial experiences. This project explores key Gestalt concepts—such as figure/ground perception and the law of Prägnanz (simplicity and order)—to create a cohesive architectural narrative where form, function, and perception interconnect seamlessly.The law of Perception, or figure-ground organization, refers to the mind’s ability to distinguish objects from their backgrounds. This principle is used to create a radial pattern of five circles, surrounding geometric forms and framing the site in an organized, visually compelling way. By focusing on figure-ground organization, the design invites viewers to see the space not just as individual shapes, but as an integrated visual experience where each element contributes to the whole. The law of Prägnanz, or the Law of Simplicity, emphasizes the mind’s preference for clarity, order, and simplicity. The design incorporates geometric forms—circles, triangles, and squares—arranged to foster a sense of coherence and simplicity. The use of this principle reduces complexity, resulting in a space that feels intuitive and easy to navigate, with an underlying balance and order that enhances the user experience.all images courtesy of AbarstudioSimplicity and spatial Clarity guide Abarstudio’s designThe design team at Abarstudio integrates various Gestalt principles, such as symmetry, order, and figure-ground perception, to create a spatial experience that feels cohesive and well-ordered. The balance between distinct shapes and unified compositions ensures that users can move through the space naturally and effectively. Following Prägnanz (Symmetry and Order), the design’s geometric precision offers a sense of stability, aligning with the law of simplicity and creating a predictable, harmonious environment. Informed by the law of Perception (Figure/Ground), contrasting shapes and backgrounds clarify each element of the space, making it easy to interpret and navigate.Gestalt design philosophy suggests that humans perceive visual information as a unified whole. In this project, elements are organized to enhance understanding and retention. The design presents a cohesive arrangement where each component contributes to the overall structure, ensuring that the space feels complete and intuitive. Fundamental shapes such as triangles, circles, and squares help achieve visual clarity, reflecting the principle of simplicity. Le Corbusier’s statements on fundamental shapes inspired the design, ‘Cubes, cones, spheres, cylinders, or pyramids are the great primary forms which light reveals to advantage; the image of these is distinct and tangible within us without ambiguity. It is for this reason that these are beautiful forms, the most beautiful forms.’ The project embraces this philosophy by incorporating primary forms into the design, celebrating their simplicity and their ability to convey clarity and beauty.HAM by Abarstudio integrates Gestalt principles to shape visually engaging, intuitive spacesThe building in this project is treated as a distinct object within its environment. Through the application of Gestalt principles, it emerges as a cohesive and recognizable form, balancing both functional purpose and visual clarity. The building acts as both a functional space and a visual anchor, demonstrating the importance of perceptual harmony in architecture. By conceptualizing the building as an object, the design exemplifies the essence of Gestalt principles, creating a space that is intuitive, visually cohesive, and grounded in perceptual psychology. Through simplicity, order, and clarity, the project offers a memorable architectural experience that reflects the timeless appeal of basic forms and Gestalt principles.the design emphasizes simplicity and order, creating a harmonious fusion of form and functionfundamental shapes and contrasts invite viewers to experience architecture as a cohesive wholethe project balances distinct shapes and unified compositions, guiding users naturally through the space",
