  "text": "Perched along the tranquil Solway Coast in Dumfries and Galloway, Tidal House is a contemporary retreat envisioned by Brown \u0026 Brown Architects for a retired couple transitioning from city life in Edinburgh. The clients longed for a peaceful escape amidst the rugged waterfront beauty of the Scottish landscape.  On its northern side, the smoked clay brick facade offers a sturdy, grounded presence that reflects the charm of the nearby village. In contrast, the southern wood cladding embraces the fluidity of the coastal environment, designed to age gracefully with the passage of time. At the heart of the design lies a captivating three-sided courtyard, anchored by a vibrant acer Fireglow tree, which acts as both a visual and functional divider between the main living spaces and an artist’s studio. This courtyard approach not only enhances privacy but also fosters a sense of intimacy and connection with the outdoors. The careful placement of expansive windows invites the surrounding natural beauty inside, creating a constant interplay between the built environment and its surroundings. “We wanted a warm, welcoming home, and feel this is beautifully delivered. We’re pinching ourselves still as the whole thing is so incredible,” the clients say. The home is a sanctuary where artistic inspiration and relaxation coexist. The artist’s studio, with its strategically positioned glass corner overlooking the River Urr estuary, encapsulates this dual purpose. This intimate nook serves as a place for reflection and creativity, offering an ever-changing view of tidal waters and distant horizons. Thoughtful design choices, such as large windows for natural solar gain and strategically placed openings for cross-ventilation, ensure energy efficiency without compromising comfort. The masonry wall on the north side acts as a thermal store, while the southern glazing benefits from an overhang that provides seasonal shading. These features embody Brown \u0026 Brown’s philosophy of “slow work,” emphasizing meticulous planning, timeless craftsmanship, and environmental responsibility. Inside, wood flooring and tile coexist alongside textured woods and a rich color palette for a warm, inviting atmosphere, even on gloomier days. The public spaces aim to be more light and airy, while the private areas are designed with a darker feeling to encourage relaxation. Both custom furniture, made by the owners, and family heirlooms round out the interior to make it more personal.
