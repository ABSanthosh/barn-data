  "text": "FEDL shapes Wind Reave residence as a hillside retreat in japanFEDL (Far East Design Lab.) unveils Wind Reave, a hybrid living and working space designed to balance daily life with moments of escape in Kanagawa, Japan. Situated on a southwest-facing hillside, the residence takes advantage of the panoramic sea and mountain views. The project redefines the traditional workplace and vacation home by offering a flexible environment where work, leisure, and family life can coexist.Designed to accommodate professional and personal activities, Wind Reave incorporates a dedicated study for focused work, adaptable spaces for family gatherings, and a setting conducive to outdoor hobbies such as cycling, golf, and hiking. The architecture prioritizes a fluid transition between routine and nonroutine, fostering a resort-like ambiance without compromising everyday conveniences. Local Komatsu stone, framed by wood, was used for retaining walls at the base of the slope, tying the structure to the landscape, while plantings soften the boundary between built and natural elements.all images by Koichi Torimura, courtesy of FEDLworking and residential spaces coexist under lifTIng roofThe Japanese design team of FEDL designed the roof to follow the contours of the hillside, lifting like a gentle breeze. Thoughtful control of visual perspectives adds to the living experience—while the second-floor terrace and living-dining area capture expansive views of the surrounding scenery, the study, and bedroom maintain a sense of privacy through carefully framed outlooks. The study, enveloped by plants and garden stones, fosters concentration with its serene atmosphere, offering glimpses of the distant landscape beyond the immediate greenery.Constructed with wooden materials, Wind Reave responds to its mild climate with a structure that embraces sunlight and ventilation. As remote work reshapes contemporary living patterns, the project emerges as a retreat for a client transitioning to a dual-location lifestyle. FEDL unveils a hybrid space designed to balance daily life with moments of escapelocal Komatsu stone was used for retaining walls at the base of the slopethe project revisits the traditional workplace and vacation home",
