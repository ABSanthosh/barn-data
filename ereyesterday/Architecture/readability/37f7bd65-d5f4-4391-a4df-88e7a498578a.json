  "text": "In a city known for its fast-paced tech life and urban sprawl, a tranquil haven has taken shape – offering not just an aesthetic escape but a lesson in intentional living. Designed by Studio Autumn, the Lagom residence in Bangalore, India, is a 2100-square-foot apartment that elegantly intertwines Japanese wabi-sabi philosophy with modern minimalism, creating a personal and globally inspired home. Crafted for a young couple in the tech industry, the residence reflects their time abroad and a desire for thoughtful simplicity. “A minimalist space with worldly influences, infused with natural materials,” says Chintan Punjabi, Principal Designer at Studio Autumn. The design journey began with conversations around values and vision, resulting in a home that feels both rooted and explorative. “Lagom” – a Swedish term meaning “just enough” – perfectly defines the spirit of the residence. Every element, from spatial planning to material choice, is guided by this principle of balance. The result is a space that feels neither too stark nor overly embellished – meticulously balanced to offer serenity in the midst of a bustling city. Upon entering the home, guests are welcomed by an arched entryway featuring an organically-shaped mirror – a clue into what is to come in the rest of the apartment. These gentle curves recur throughout, softening room transitions and elevating the home’s sculptural aesthetic. A minimalist wooden bar and marble-clad kitchen, as well as brass accents and local stone lend a grounded, regional identity to the pooja alcove that’s defined by an archway. Central to the home, and “the couple’s personal favorite space,” the dining space stands out with its built-in concrete bench, rattan detailing on the wooden Wishbone chairs, and a curated niche wall created by transforming an old window. “An existing window was filled with lime plaster to create this composition,” says Punjabi. This clever intervention not only adds depth to the space – it turns a simple wall into a conversation piece. The color primary palette is earthy and neutral, with warm oak wood flooring underfoot and lime-washed walls adding subtle texture. Furniture is entirely bespoke with fluid forms and tactile finishes. A woven jute rug from Carpet Kingdom and custom decor from Minimal Indian anchors the emphasis on natural materials and handcrafted design details. A fluted glass partition leads to the private areas, maintaining the visual flow while offering a subtle layer of separation. One bedroom has been repurposed into a combined study and wardrobe space, allowing the main sleeping areas to remain open and uncluttered. The primary bedroom, drenched in white tones, maximizes the natural light for a peaceful retreat. In contrast, the guest bedroom introduces oak wood accents and a flexible media unit that transitions between work and relaxation – matching the needs of contemporary life. “Each piece of decor was curated with intention,” concludes Punjabi. “We focused on juxtaposing tactile sensibilities with an intuitive interplay of light and materials. To see this home come to life as a reflection of their personalities has been deeply rewarding.” For more information on the Lagom residence and Studio Autumn, visit studioautumn.com.
