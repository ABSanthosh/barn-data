And that’s not ideal—not with early mornings and busy days and a million and one things to do.And while seasoned city dwellers may claim they simply get used to falling asleep to the sounds of screeching sirens, traffic noise, and the chatter of passing revelers, sometimes there’s really no getting used to the ruckus. The good news is that affordable room soundproofing need not be an overly involved process, even if you’re trying to block out the racket of downtown city life. When you take a few simple room soundproofing steps—like adding carpets, specialized wall hangings, window hardware, and more—you won’t have to deal with the noise anymore, you can just enjoy the silence.And according to science, you actually shouldn’t be simply coping with the din. None other than the World Health Organization recommends you sleep in a room where the noise at night does not exceed 30 decibels, which is literally whisper-quiet. So if your bedroom is louder than whisper-quiet at night, you are probably losing sleep because of it. Even if you’ve gotten used to unsettled sleep, you owe it to yourself to improve your sleeping environment by exploring your options for noise reduction.A few DIY-friendly updates to your room (no major home improvement required!) can greatly reduce the racket, allowing you to enjoy some much-deserved quiet no matter how busy things are outside your window—or outside your door, for that matter, as family members, roommates, or the neighbors across the hall can cause just as much noise as the streets outside or that passing train.Read on for a few clever tips on how to soundproof a room (according to experts) that you can put to use within hours—as well as a few more projects that are a bit heavier of a lift, but that will greatly reduce the noise and enhance your slumber. We see a good night’s sleep in your future.1. Improve your window’s sound insulationBlankets and drapery can help with sound absorption in your home. Photo: Getty ImagesIn a perfect world, you could swap out older windows for newer double-pane windows that offer superb soundproofing. “Double-glazing windows provides an excellent layer of [sound] blocking,” assures Anton Liakhov, founder of Roomtery. Though he concedes that such improvements “do not come inexpensively, but are well worth the investment.” Still, there’s plenty you can do—even without getting soundproof windows—to create a stronger barrier to sounds in your space. You can use sound-blocking inserts like those sold by Indow, which can block out up to 70% of the sound coming through a single-pane window. Or you can seal gaps around the window’s frame using specially formulated acoustical caulk, which will also close an air gap. Or better yet, do both. While you’re looking at your windows, it’s worth inspecting your interior doors as well: You may want to consider replacing hollow-core doors with solid composite versions that will do a better job of keeping sound in.2. Add carpeting and rugs“Soft, thick rugs or carpets are a great way to help reduce sound in a room,” says Liakhov. “They are especially effective when installed on top of hardwood or tile. High-pile carpets are the best and [often fit] tighter budgets.” If it’s in your budget, installing a wall-to-wall pad, then a wall-to-wall carpet is a great start, with area rugs then laid atop the carpet for maximum sound dampening. This move will silence your space while amping up the cozy factor—a win-win, if you ask us.3. Switch out your standard rug pads for soundproof onesLooking beyond rugs and carpets—or rather, under them—it’s helpful to consider some additional layers of soundproofing material you can bring in beneath such sound damping furnishings. The felt and memory foam versions in RugPadUSA’s collection can provide a dense layer of insulation, reducing noise from within your home (think kids stomping about in adjacent rooms) while also keeping neighboring noise out. These pads add insulation that can keep in cool air during the summer and warm air during the winter. And, as you’d expect from a thick rug pad, they create a comfortable and supportive feel under your area rug too. Given all that, these pads are a no-brainer, with three major benefits provided by one easy upgrade. You can even use one if you don’t have a rug or carpeting in your room at all; just get a rug pad that’s sized to fit under your bed. It will be out of sight and out of mind, but it’ll make your life a bit quieter.4. Throw some cotton or wool pillows on the sofaLayer on the cozy textiles. Photo: irina_girich/Getty ImagesIn a European Commission report on green construction, the Science Communication Unit at the University of the West of England, Bristol, states that “researchers have found that natural materials, such as plant fibers or wool, can be used to construct sustainable sound absorbers that help prevent noise pollution.” Jen Baxter of Baxter Hill Interiors sees the real-life resonance of the report’s findings, noting that in her experience, “adding softer materials to the room, [like] throw blankets and pillows [help] sound be absorbed rather than reflected. And thanks to those extra throw pillows, your seating will be more comfortable than ever. Try adding extra throw pillows (plus, your seating will be more comfortable than ever). You can also add a number of natural fiber pillows to your bed. They’ll look lovely during the day, and when you take them off to get into bed at night, you can place them near the windows or in front of your door, catching much of the sound that comes in. As a bonus sound stopper, consider draping cotton or wool blankets over the back of a chair to add a bit more noise-absorbing material to your space. Other textiles to explore for their sound-dampening properties are thick blankets or even wall tapestries, which can be both aesthetically pleasing and functional. The goal is to not have too many hard surfaces around.5. Buy noise-reducing curtains“Heavy curtains can assist in providing a soundproof environment,” says Liakhov. “For windows, I recommend looking for the soundproof curtains which have a heavy lining.” Granted, the same blackout curtains you buy to block out sunlight by day (or city lights by night) will muffle street noise outside your place, but dedicated noise-reducing curtains may be a better choice. Heavy curtains designed to block sound will almost always block light well too, so shop for window dressings optimized primarily for sound reduction. And like with the addition of a sound-blocking rug pad or noise-blocking caulk, these curtains will add better insulation to your home as well, helping with heating and cooling costs and efficacy.5. Invest in a fan or a dedicated sound machineFans and sound machines can help provide white noise to detract from other sounds. Photo: Getty ImagesSometimes your best bet is actually fighting noise with more noise—white noise, that is. A ceiling fan, floor fan, or sound machine can block out the background din and cover up sharper, acute noises (like a car’s horn honking or a dog barking) and allow you to sleep more soundly. Basically, a steady whir can cover up other sounds you don’t want to hear with sounds that won’t bother you. Just make sure your sound maker isn’t turned up too loud, as too much white noise can be a bad thing. Sound machines should generally not be set to volume levels exceeding 50 or 55 decibels in order to guarantee safe and optimal resting conditions. This is especially true for sound makers used for babies or children, according to Baby Sleep Dr.7. Repaint or repaper the wallsWhen it comes to soundproofing walls, coatings from companies like Acoustical Services absorb mid-range sounds—and they’ve been lab-tested to prove it. After applying base and finish coats on your existing walls, you can paint over them with the regular paint color of your choice. You can also try using a sound-reducing wallpaper, which usually comes in peel-and-stick rolls that do not require professional installation. Things will look better than ever (or largely the same, if that’s your aim), but sound transmission of unwanted noise will have been cut.8. Use soundproofing panelsIf you really, seriously, need to cut down on the sound, then you need to use the same sorts of acoustic treatments that musicians and sound engineers use when setting up recording studio spaces. Now, these sound-absorbing materials—arguably the best way to soundproof a room—may not the most aesthetically appealing, depending on your style. But acoustic foam panels will surely get the job done, from a soundproofing perspective. You can also find acoustically rated artistic wall panels that can be applied to create a large mosaic-style piece of artwork that also happens to deaden a lot of noise. Alternatively, opt for smaller acoustic panels that can be applied as needed, such as forming a frame around a window or above a headboard, for example. If you dislike the look of all noise-reducing wall appliqués, you can cut them up, then cover them with a piece of artwork—just don’t cover acoustic panels with any hard surfaces, as that could cause reverberation of sound waves, thereby negating the panels’ efficacy.9. Add spray foam soundproofing insulationIf you own your property and know you aren’t about to seal off any pipes or electrical wiring—or if you have a very accommodating landlord—then spraying foam insulation behind sheetrock panels on the walls and ceiling can do wonders to reduce sound, both for outside noise and from sound within the property. (Note: Hire a professional if you’re not quite handy, or if you’re not 100% sure what’s behind the walls.) “Blow-in consists of small particles of fiber or other materials [that] form an insulation layer that conforms to any space without disturbing what is there,” says Docia Boylen, owner of Handyman Connection of Golden. “This ability to conform makes loose-fill insulation well-suited for spaces where it would be difficult to install other types of insulation.” You’ll need to identify studs behind the drywall and cut some holes to add the spray, so be ready for some prep work and some finishing, but it’s a lighter lift than adding fiberglass insulation.So, there you have it, nine soundproofing methods for creating a more soundproof room—particularly a bedroom—that range from as simple as adding some pillows to as involved a process as replacing windows and adding new insulation.Below, we address some commonly asked questions about room soundproofing.How can I soundproof my room for cheap?Work with what you have! Move a tall bookcase or sofa from a different room into the space you need to soundproof and place it on the wall that most offends with letting sound in. Drape blankets over the backs of chairs. Add a large area rug under your bed and hang decorative fabric on the walls. And invest a few dollars in specialized caulking that can better seal your windows. You’ll save on heating and cooling costs and it will pay for itself over time.How much do acoustic sound panels for a room cost?The best [way to soundproof] would be with acoustic wall panels, which come in fabric-covered foam or timber slats with sound absorbing backing,” says Angelique Kreller, an Interior Designer at Yabby. “Either of these options will help to absorb and block noise, but the better quality of sound absorption here will come with a higher cost, depending on the materials you go for and the layout.” As for that expense, according to our research, the cost per square foot of coverage can range from as little as $1.50 to as much as $5, so the prices can get high for large spaces. But the project usually isn’t a challenging one, says Kreller, explaining: “When it comes to the actual installation, a single wall can usually be done in a day or so.”Can you soundproof an existing room?All the methods previously discussed will do wonders of course, but if you truly need to make a room soundproof (keeping in mind that if you’re asking, “How do I make my room 100% soundproof?” the only answer is to move into a deep cave) then you can do a little renovation. You can apply acoustic panels or foam insulation over the existing walls, then place a new layer of drywall. Yes, you’ll lose about two inches of floor space and you will need to do your fair share of installing and spackling and painting and finishing—and you may want to hire professionals if the project involves any framing—but the result will be a truly quiet space.",

You can apply acoustic panels or foam insulation over the existing walls, then place a new layer of drywall. Yes, you’ll lose about two inches of floor space and you will need to do your fair share of installing and spackling and painting and finishing—and you may want to hire professionals if the project involves any framing—but the result will be a truly quiet space.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
