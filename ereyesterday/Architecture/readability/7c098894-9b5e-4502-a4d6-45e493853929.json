  "text": "Whidbey Puzzle Prefab: Sustainable Design by Wittman EstesWhidbey Puzzle Prefab, designed by architecture studio Wittman Estes, has taken shape to demonstrate the possibilities of sustainable prefabricated housing. Located on Washington State’s Whidbey Island, the residential project combines environmentally-conscious design with flexibility and innovation. The Puzzle Prefab is a prototype created to minimize environmental impact while bringing a healthy, nature-connected living experience for its inhabitants.The home stands as a quarter of the size of a typical 2,000-square-foot American home, offering 600 square feet of indoor living space and an additional 557 square feet of covered outdoor space with cedar decks. Organized into four distinct modules, the design is infinitely reconfigurable. ‘This project shows how innovative prefab construction can be. This could be placed anywhere with little disruption to the natural ecosystem and landscape,’ remarks the 2024 AIA National Small Project Award Jury. The modularity of the Whidbey Puzzle Prefab shows the adaptability of prefabrication, making it suitable for remote, suburban, and urban environments.images © Andrew PogueNet Zero Energy and Rainwater CollectionWith its Whidbey Puzzle Prefab, the architects at Wittman Estes incorporate several high-performance sustainable systems, from the foundation to the energy management controls. Wittman Estes utilized a pin foundation system, eliminating the need for concrete and reducing carbon emissions by 24 tons. The project integrates a 4.1-kilowatt solar array, driving a heat pump with hydronic heating and cooling, and includes an energy recovery ventilation system. According to Matt Wittman, ‘Prefab delivers higher quality construction on a shorter timeline,’ highlighting the environmental and time-saving benefits of prefabrication.Whidbey Puzzle Prefab is designed as a net zero energy building, featuring a photovoltaic array that generates nearly 4,000 kWh annually. A rainwater collection system channels water from the roof into steel columns, storing it in a tank where it is purified for potable use throughout the home. This system supports the household’s water needs, including irrigation for the indoor greenhouse. Wittman notes, ‘Climate change is both the biggest and most accessible issue architects can influence.’ underlining the importance of environmentally responsible design choices.Wittman Estes’ Whidbey Puzzle Prefab is a sustainable prefab home located on Whidbey IslandForest-Friendly ConstructionIn keeping with its mission to respect the local environment, the Whidbey Puzzle Prefab avoids the use of concrete, opting instead for micro pin piles that minimize earthwork disturbance and protect tree roots. ‘The fragile forest ecology was respected by shifting the construction off-site,’ said Wittman. This method reduces environmental disruption and significantly lowers the carbon footprint of the structure by 77% compared to traditional concrete foundations.Despite its small footprint, the Whidbey Puzzle Prefab creates a spacious and flexible living environment. The design integrates indoor and outdoor spaces, with the covered cedar decks acting as an extension of the interior living areas. Wittman remarks, ‘It’s so compact that it feels enormous,’ emphasizing the balance between size and livability. The home’s smart systems allow residents to monitor energy use, manage personal comfort, and store resources efficiently. Thus, the home creates a dialogue between daily life and the natural environment of the Pacific Northwest.the home is 600 square feet of indoor space with 557 square feet of covered outdoor space on cedar deckstt consists of four reconfigurable modules designed for flexibility and adaptability to various environmentsthe project uses pin foundations, eliminating concrete and reducing CO2 emissions by 24 tons",
