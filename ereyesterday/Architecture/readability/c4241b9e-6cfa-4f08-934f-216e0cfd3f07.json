And when it comes to their office spaces, these companies are aiming for workplaces that push boundaries and reflect their forward-thinking values, often collaborating with some of the most renowned architects in the world. From campuses that feel like futuristic parks to skyscrapers with views to match their innovation, these offices are not just workplaces; they’re masterful designs that prioritize sustainability, creativity and employee well-being. Whether it’s Apple’s glass-ringed sanctuary by Foster + Partners or TikTok’s sky-high NYC playground designed by Gensler, each workspace tells a story about the company’s unique culture, vision and commitment to excellence. Let’s take a closer look at seven groundbreaking tech offices redefining what it means to work in style. Apple Park By Foster + Partners, Cupertino, California Apple Park reimagines the workplace as a connection between architecture and nature. At its center, the Ring Building features expansive curved glass panels that offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding park. Innovative “void slabs” combine structural support with integrated heating and cooling, showcasing clever engineering throughout the design. Natural light floods the interior through eight atria, creating open, collaborative spaces that flow into landscaped courtyards. One standout feature is the restaurant – a campus town square, where massive sliding glass walls open entirely, merging indoor and outdoor spaces. Running on 100% renewable energy, the campus is also North America’s largest LEED Platinum-certified office. Apple Park demonstrates how thoughtful architecture can support both sustainability and a functional, inspiring workplace. Spotify At Mateo Campus Los Angeles By RIOS, Los Angeles, California Popular Choice Winner, 11th Annual A+Awards, Architecture +Workspace This campus brings together recording studios, editing suites, performance stages and social spaces under one roof. Every element supports the creative process, from focused production to casual collaboration. Spaces like the food hall and coffee bar offer relaxed areas to connect, while thoughtfully chosen materials and local artwork reflect the character of the LA Arts District. Recording and listening rooms are designed with precision, ensuring creators have the tools they need in a welcoming environment. The campus goes beyond being a workplace — it’s a creative space where employees, artists and collaborators come together to push boundaries and bring ideas to life. Amazon HQ2 at Metropolitan Park By ZGF Architects, Arlington, Virginia Popular Choice Winner, 12th Annual A+Awards, Sustainable Commercial Building Amazon’s HQ2 campus includes two 22-story towers with green roofs, outdoor meeting areas and operable windows for fresh air. A charcoal terracotta podium nods to the site’s history as a brickyard, while passive thermal lobbies and public art create an engaging environment. The project transformed a two-acre underused green space into a public park with gardens, playgrounds and dog areas. It also added over half a mile of protected bike lanes and pedestrian-friendly pathways. Powered by 100% renewable energy, the campus features water recycling systems, bird-friendly glass and energy-efficient systems that exceed industry standards. With retail spaces, local cafes and a daycare on-site, it connects work, sustainability and community in one thoughtful design. Google Borregas By MGA | MICHAEL GREEN ARCHITECTURE, Sunnyvale, California Jury Winner and Popular Choice Winner, 12th Annual A+Awards, Architecture +Workspace Jury Winner, 12th Annual A+Awards, Architecture +Wood Google’s first mass timber office building sets a high bar for sustainable and adaptable workplace design. The five-story structure prioritizes health and carbon reduction, using exposed cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam beams to create a warm, natural environment. A four-story atrium with a timber-glass skylight floods the interior with natural light and connects open spaces across levels. Unique features like a façade with climate-responsive wooden blinds and high-performance glass optimize energy use and reduce glare while offering views of the surrounding landscape. Cantilevered floor plates, made with a wood-concrete composite system, create covered outdoor seating and bring light deep into the interior. With flexibility built into its design, the building supports future reconfigurations to meet evolving needs. Google Borregas demonstrates how mass timber and thoughtful engineering can create a workspace that prioritizes well-being and environmental responsibility. TikTok By Gensler, New York City, New York TikTok’s New York City headquarters occupy the top five floors of the H\u0026M Tower at 42nd and Broadway, encompassing 150,000 square feet designed to reflect the city’s vibrant energy. The 57th floor serves as the main arrival and social area, featuring a signature pink glass and metal staircase that interconnects the floors. Large-format LED screens in the lobby display imagery inspired by New York icons such as pizza, yellow cabs and the Statue of Liberty, bringing the dynamic atmosphere of Times Square into the workspace. The 58th-floor penthouse includes exterior terraces offering 360-degree views of Manhattan. A notable feature is the blackened European oak bleacher seating, positioned to provide dramatic vistas directly into Times Square. Above, a ceiling installation mimics the primary-colored lines of the NYC transit map, paying homage to the city’s subway system. Throughout the office, design elements such as LED tubes abstracting the subway map and climbing ropes referencing urban adventures contribute to a workspace that embodies TikTok’s creative spirit while celebrating its New York City location. Pinterest HQ2 By IwamotoScott Architecture, San Francisco, California Jury Winner, 5th Annual A+Awards, Architecture +Stairs Jury Winner, 5th Annual A+Awards, Office Interiors (\u003e 25,000 sq ft.) Pinterest’s new six-story headquarters in San Francisco’s SOMA district creates a connected urban campus with their earlier workspaces nearby. The design reflects Pinterest’s ethos: clean, simple and intuitive with the aim of fuelling creativity. The ground-level lobby doubles as a Privately Owned Public Outdoor Space (POPOS), with glass walls and an operable corner opening to a landscaped alley. Inside, a custom wood ceiling and built-in furniture create a warm threshold between the company and the city. A striking central staircase cascades through the building, linking all floors and encouraging spontaneous interactions. Its porous white steel enclosure allows filtered views across the workspace. Meeting spaces line the stairwell, creating a functional connection between the core, stair and workstations. Daylight streams through large windows on three sides, brightening perimeter workstations and lounges. The thoughtful layout prioritizes collaboration, creativity and a strong relationship between the building and its urban setting. NVIDIA HQ: Voyager Building By Gensler, Santa Clara, California NVIDIA’s Voyager building in Santa Clara, California, is a 750,000-square-foot workspace designed to connect employees with nature. Its undulating roof, featuring numerous triangular skylights, floods the interior with natural light, creating an open and airy environment. Inside, a central “mountain” structure serves as a focal point, with communal areas at its base and adaptable spaces ascending upward. This design encourages exploration and collaboration among employees. The building incorporates sustainable features, including a trellis lined with solar panels producing approximately 50,000 watts of power and efficient water use strategies that contribute to a 66% savings in outdoor potable water demand. By integrating biophilic design elements and flexible workspaces, Voyager fosters a healthy and inspiring environment for innovation.
