  "text": "From Soviet Cinema to Tselinny Culture centerBritish architect Asif Khan is leading the conversion of a Soviet-era cinema into the Tselinny Center of Contemporary Culture, located in Almaty, Kazakhstan. With its undulating facade, the project aims to establish the country’s first independent cultural institution. It will serve as a dynamic venue for art exhibitions, performances, and film screenings, with a particular focus on supporting creatives from Kazakhstan and Central Asia.The transformation of the cinema, the largest of its kind in Central Asia, began in 2018. Set to open in April, the Tselinny Center of Contemporary Culture will reflect both its Soviet modernist roots and a forward-thinking design that accommodates the needs of contemporary cultural activities. The name ‘Tselinny’ draws on the word ‘tselina,’ meaning undeveloped but fertile land, a reference to both the original cinema and the potential of this new cultural space.Asif Khan is converting a soviet-era cinema in Kazakhstan | image © Asif Khanasif khan to Preserve Soviet Modernism of kazakhstanThe original 1964-built cinema, now the Tselinny Center of Contemporary Culture, is a hallmark of Soviet modernist architecture in Kazakhstan, known for its simple, austere style. Architect Asif Khan’s approach emphasizes preserving much of the building’s existing structure, including its concrete frame and massing. The renovation maintains the integrity of this architectural legacy while adapting the space for its new purpose as a cultural institution.While the auditorium has been structurally reinforced, the cinema’s foyer and wings have been rebuilt to meet modern seismic standards. This rebuilding process allows for improved access between the building’s interior and the surrounding landscape. The restored auditorium, an 18-meter-tall space, will feature a ground-floor ribbon of windows that provide ample natural light and views, connecting the historical core of the building with its surroundings.the center in Almaty will focus on supporting Kazakh and Central Asian creatives | image © Asif Khanthe Fiber-Reinforced Concrete FacadeFrom the exterior, Kazakhstan’s Tselinny Center of Contemporary Culture will feature a facade of fiber-reinforced concrete panels designed by Asif Khan to complement the existing glass entrance. The design will incorporate undulating vertical fins and petroglyph-like motifs, creating a visual contrast to the modernist architecture. These abstract motifs draw inspiration from an original sgraffito by artist Evgeny Sidorkin, which depicts traditional Kazakh life.The reconstructed wings of the building will house a gallery, workshop spaces, a library, office space, and a bookshop, providing the infrastructure needed for the Tselinny Center to host a wide range of cultural activities. A rooftop terrace and restaurant, paying homage to Almaty’s historical ‘Broadway’ district, will complete the project, offering visitors a modern space for social engagement and reflection.the project will preserve much of the cinema’s original soviet modernist architecture | image © MIRa fiber-reinforced concrete facade will include undulating fins and abstract motifs | image © Asif Khanthe building’s auditorium has been reinforced while the wings are rebuilt for seismic safety | image © MIR",
