Set within At-Turaif, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the historic heart of Diriyah, the museum takes it name from Arabic word meaning ‘inheritance passed down through generations’, and in its program, centers on preserving and celebrating the Kingdom’s rich cultural heritage.Drawing inspiration from the surrounding Najdi architecture, a vernacular tradition that has shaped the region’s mud-brick buildings for over six centuries, the museum marks Zaha Hadid Architects’ first use of adobe construction. It is formed from locally produced clay mud-bricks whose high thermal mass and insulating qualities are well-suited to the desert climate. all renders by Specto-Digitalmarking Zaha hadid architecture’s first adobe constructionDiriyah is widely regarded as the birthplace of the Saudi Arabian state, making the new museum a symbolic addition to one of the Kingdom’s most significant heritage sites. The Asaan museum also forms part of the Diriyah Gate development masterplan that envisions a fully walkable city prioritizing water conservation, energy efficiency, wellness, and climate resilience.
