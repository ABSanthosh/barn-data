  "text": "anchor Image: Woodlet/Flickr (CC BY-NC-ND 2.0) A new UNESCO-backed project geared toward human rights and ending antisemitism has named Daniel Libeskind as the architect who will transform the former private home of Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss into a learning center.  The project is called Auschwitz Research Center on Hate, Extremism, and Radicalization (or ARCHER) at House 88. As the name suggests, it will remake the home (which was depicted in Jonathan Glazer's 2023 film The Zone of Interest) into a space that honors the memory of the camp's victims while serving \"unique opportunity to remember the victims of extremism while, at the same time, taking action to prevent the radicalization of future generations.\" Related on Archinect: Daniel Libeskind designs new exhibition at Auschwitz-BirkenauLibeskind, who is designing a memorial to the eleven victims of the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, said: \"I am deeply privileged to be part of a project of such historical importance and magnitude. By transforming this house—once a symbol of unimaginable evil—into ARCHER at House 88 and a centre of learning, action, and remembrance, we can ensure that future generations never forget what took place here. It is my hope that this project can be designed to serve as a legacy, turning horror into hope, and reminding all of us that from the depths of darkness, we can create a beacon of light for the world.\"The nonprofit Counter Extremism Project (CEP) is guiding the effort, which also includes a renovation of the former Block 17 prisoner barracks of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum to install a new permanent exhibition. Libeskind is himself the son of two Polish Holocaust survivors.",
