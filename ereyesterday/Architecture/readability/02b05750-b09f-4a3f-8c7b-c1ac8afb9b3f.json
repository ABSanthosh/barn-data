  "text": "Angelina Jolie is the latest A-lister to make headlines for welcoming friends evacuating areas affected by the Los Angeles wildfires into her home. “Angie is heartbroken for those who have lost their homes, or are impacted by the fires,” a source told People. “She’s doing everything she can to help, even opening her home to friends who were forced to evacuate.” In a video obtained by the Daily Mail on Friday, Jolie said, “I will [make donations, but] right now I’m taking care of people close to me and having them at my house.”The actor’s residence is a $24.5 million Los Feliz compound once owned by Cecil B. DeMille, a filmmaking legend of Hollywood’s Golden Age. The Maria star bought the 11,000-square-foot Beaux-Arts estate in 2017, shortly after her split from actor Brad Pitt. Their divorce was finalized last month.The home, which is still commonly referred to as the Cecil B. DeMille Estate, has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms, a library, and landscaped grounds with gardens, fountains, and a pool. “I love most that there is no entertainment room, but lots of pathways and places to walk and think,” Jolie said in a 2021 interview with British Vogue. A tea house, a studio, and a pool house are also found on the two-acre plot.Join NowNew Year's Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowThe news comes a few days after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle made headlines for inviting evacuated friends into their Montecito estate. Other celebrities who have publicly come to the aid of those impacted by the fires include Beyoncé, who has pledged to donate $2.5 million toward relief efforts; Jamie Lee Curtis, who donated $1 million; and Halle Berry, who shared on Instagram that she was donating her “entire closet.”At least 24 people have died and more than 92,000 people are under current evacuation orders due to the disaster, CNN reports.",
