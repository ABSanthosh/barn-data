Deck the halls with plans and surveys, fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la! Yes, it’s that time of year again when we hunker down, find any and every excuse for a hot chocolate (extra marshmallows, please!), and thoughts of wrapping up projects before the holiday break overtake all thoughts of wrapping up presents. But fear not, dedicated designers — Architizer is here to simplify your shopping. Whether you’re hunting for the perfect present for a fellow architect who spends more time in Revit than in reality, or you’re buying yourself a well-deserved treat (because, let’s face it, if you don’t, who will), we’ve compiled a list that’s sure to rouse your inner Santa. From gadgets to games, our 2024 Gift Guide is stacked with ten perfect presents that will ensure that you’re crowned champion of Christmas once more this year. Happy holidays and merry shopping! For architects worldwide: Architizer: The World’s Best Architecture If there’s one thing that should be on the top of every architect’s Santa list in 2024, it’s this. Architizer: The World’s Best Architecture book is a stunning visual catalogue that showcases the most forward-looking designs of our moment. Each of Architizers’ 12th Annual A+Awards Jury and Popular Choice winners is included in the beautiful hardback edition, and taken as a whole, the collection reads as a forecast for the future of architecture. An inspiring mix of jaw-dropping architectural photography and astonishing projects, while it probably won’t fit in their stocking, any architect or architecture enthusiast who is gifted this book this year will, without doubt, be delighted and enthused by the remarkable work contained in its pages. See more info and buy \u003e  For architects who spend too much time in the studio: Desktop Glass Plant Terrarium with Grow Light Bipohillia, biophilia, biophilia. Say it three times and it might just turn up. Or, why not just gift a touch of nature with a Desktop Glass Plant Terrarium? With greenery being so vital to our mental and emotional well-being and measuring a compact 9.8 inches in height and 5.9 inches in diameter, the terrarium is ideal for miniature gardening landscapes, bonsai, water and land plants, mosses, succulents and more. The adjustable humidity and built-in grow light ensure that the tiny ecosystem within thrives even in the darkest of studios (we’re looking at you, basement office). Your gift receiver could even use the terrarium to house a betta fish if an office pet is on their wishlist. See more info and buy \u003e  For architects who are sketch-obsessed: SCRIB3D Advanced 3D Printing Pen Flat sketches are so last year. Help your favorite architect bring ideas to life in three dimensions with the SCRIB3D Advanced 3D Printing Pen. This innovative gadget allows for the creation of 3D models on the fly. With two starter colors and a PLA refill pack boasting 20 assorted hues, the only limit is imagination (and perhaps steadiness of hand after that third cup of coffee). Whether prototyping a new façade or doodling up a desk tidy, this pen is the perfect tool to take creativity to a new dimension. Just remember: with great power comes great responsibility — being the owner of such a cool present could mean being delegated to drawing up all next years gifts. See more info and buy \u003e  For the nostalgic architect: Freewrite Smart Typewriter In a world of constant pings, dings, and buzzes, the Freewrite Smart Typewriter is the answer to finally managing an uninterrupted thought. This digital typewriter features an E Ink display for distraction-free writing and can sync directly to the cloud when ready. It’s Wi-Fi-enabled but blissfully free of all social media temptations. Perfect for an easily distracted architect who always takes an age to type up project plans, who needs a helping hand to finally start writing that long-overdue book, or who simply needs a break from the relentless glow of digital screens. Getting back to basics but with all the perks of modern technology never looked or sounded better. See more info and buy \u003e  For the architect who is a kid at heart: LEGO Micro Cities: Build Your Own Mini Metropolis! by Jeff Friesen Thought your LEGO days were over? Think again. LEGO Micro Cities by Jeff Friesen encourages readers to build intricate, miniature urban landscapes using everyone’s favorite plastic bricks. This hardcover book gives the reader everything they need to create a micro metropolis, complete with soaring skyscrapers, bustling boulevards, and even petit parks. Filled with striking photos, step-by-step instructions, and countless ideas for customization, LEGO Micro Cities shows you how building small can open up new possibilities and spark creativity. The book is a fascinating way to learn everything you need to know in creating a micro-city, from building the foundation to adding convincing architectural details that will really bring a city to life. See more info and buy \u003e  For the architect who doesn’t get out enough: Under Desk Treadmill Walking Pad Let’s face it, architects spend a lot of time sitting, whether glued to computer screens or sitting through many a meeting, sitting is a significant part of the job description and unsurprisingly, it’s not always great for our health. Enter the Under Desk Treadmill Walking Pad. Walking pads have become a bit of a trend lately, with everyone and their granny looking for a sleek, portable treadmill that fits snugly under their standing desk. With a 2.5 HP motor, remote control, and LED display, this device is easy to use and can help any desk dweller incorporate more movement into the day without stepping foot outside. However, be warned — designing while strolling may cause increased creativity and improved focus.

In architecture, stress has long been an industry-wide issue. However, Mophée is here to help. With the Morphée Zen Pebble, it couldn’t be simpler to find a moment of calm in an overwhelming day. Offering 72 guided meditation and visualization sessions in four languages, the Zen Pebble is a portable gadget designed to help users achieve instant relaxation and ultimately reduce stress.

An icon since its debut in 1985, this kettle has become a piece of design history. Created by the renowned architect Michael Graves, the stainless steel kettle combines practicality with a playful aesthetic. The charming bird-shaped whistle brings a touch of whimsy to daily routines so even boiling water can bring a moment of joy. A delightful addition to any architect’s home, bridging postmodern design with everyday functionality. The Alessi 9093 Kettle serves as a conversation starter, a centerpiece, and a daily reminder of the beauty of thoughtful design—a principle that almost every architect holds dear. See more info and buy \u003e  For sustainability-sensitive architects: Eco-Friendly Bee House Hotel Architects know sustainability isn’t just a buzzword. It’s vital to protect our ecosystem and, in turn, our planet. This gift is for the eco-conscious architect who knows that building hotels for people is great and all, but without protecting the bees, those hotels wouldn’t be that much to look at. The Eco-Friendly Bee House Hotel is an insect nest box designed to attract and house solitary bees and other insects, giving them a safe haven to rest and recuperate in gardens and yards. Made from natural materials like bamboo, The Bee Hotel is a lovely addition to any outdoor space while also providing a home for weary wings and much-needed protection for pollinators.

This year, we’ve got a cracker for you. Blueprints of Mad King Ludwig, is a strategy-style board game that fuses architectural planning with creative puzzle solving. Players sketch and design floor plans to build the most extravagant castles imaginable, all while adapting to the eccentric demands of King Ludwig. Earn new abilities by completing rooms’ entrances and connecting them to other rooms, allowing you to add or remove entrances, earn bonus cards, and even take extra turns, adding layers of depth to the game. Compete against opponents to fulfill the King’s favors and achieve public goals while also creating courtyards and moats around your castle to score massive points and secure victory. It’s a captivating mix of tactical thinking and creative concepts, perfect for architects, designers, or anyone who enjoys a mental challenge.
