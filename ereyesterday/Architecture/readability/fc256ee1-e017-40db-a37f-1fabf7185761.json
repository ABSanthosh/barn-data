The development introduces a distinct approach to airport landscape design, moving beyond conventional transit environments. Serving over 4.8 million visitors annually, with future expansion doubling this capacity, the airport’s new terminal, designed by Singapore-based CPG, incorporates one of the first comprehensive landscape designs commissioned for an airport setting.The 10-hectare site integrates various spatial scales, ensuring a cohesive visual experience for passengers arriving by plane, car, or on foot. The landscape design reflects the natural characteristics of Khanh Hoa Province, with organic forms and carefully arranged elements shaping the visitor’s first impression of the region.all images by Brice Godardorganic shapes form the airport’s open waiting and social zonesLandscape architects at LJ-Group organize the pedestrian-friendly public space at the terminal entrance as the key feature of the project. This area is designed to accommodate multiple circulation flows while maintaining open zones for waiting and social interaction. Large curved seating and shading structures, constructed from bamboo and metal, are positioned in an irregular arrangement. The placement of shading elements is intentionally offset, creating alternating areas of sun and shade. This dynamic layout encourages users to engage with the space by adjusting their seating choices throughout the day.The landscape design extends towards the motorbike parking area, incorporating a selection of coastal plant species that reinforce the local identity. By integrating functional circulation with flexible gathering areas, Cam Ranh International Airport development moves away from traditional airport design conventions, prioritizing a more engaging and human-centered environment while meeting infrastructure and transport requirements.LJ-Group designs the outdoor spaces of Cam Ranh International Airporta 10-hectare site integrates multiple spatial scales for arriving passengersorganic forms shape the visitor’s first impression of the region",
