A scorching morning in August 2020 found India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi carefully setting a foundation stone for the new Ram Mandir in Ayodhya. Designed by Chandrakant Sompura, whose family has spent generations shaping Hindu temples across India, the project chose its launch date based on a Vedic astrologer’s reading of planetary positions. Vedic astrology is a traditional system of astrology that originated in ancient India. It’s based on the Vedas, the oldest sacred text of Hinduism. In Abu Dhabi, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir broke ground one year prior to Ayodhya’s ceremony, forever changing the skyline of the city that is famous for its avant-garde architecture with a project whose earliest moments were guided by star charts. Rather than relying exclusively on modern scheduling software, something that can be done on a cellphone in minutes, planners consulted traditional Vedic astrologers to identify a specific day and hour that, if the star gazers were to be believed, promised favorable cosmic support. In the Pampa plains, in the east of the province of Cordoba, Saint Bernard’s Chapel tracks the movements of the sun each day as a vertical pole and a horizontal pole, that stand outside, cast their shadows on the curved interior. The shadows make their way along their separate paths and meet each other to recreate the symbol of the cross every day of the year without fail. Even the Shanghai World Financial Center includes “cosmic arcs.” Two sweeping arcs that represent the heavens, as the tower ascends into the sky. Creating a square sky portal at the top of the tower that lends balance to the structure and links the two opposing elements, the heavens and the earth. Using astrology to guide architecture may sound like a custom that is better preserved solely for religious sanctuaries, but its modern examples can illustrate something surprisingly current: from the Middle East to South America and from secular high-rises to experimental cultural centers, architects and clients continue to look skyward for inspiration. Beneath all of it is the belief that incorporating astrology — whether through zodiac-based geometry, auspicious timeframes for groundbreakings or design elements inspired by planetary cycles — brings deeper resonance to the built environment. In practical terms, this may mean that a structural engineer finalizes columns or bracing with traditional CAD software, while an astrologer or cosmic consultant highlights a narrow window in which the next critical pour of concrete should occur. It often means windows or openings are orientated to capture the positioning of sun or moonlight at cosmically important calendar events. It can equally be as simple as a surface pattern or decoration that illustrates the stars and planets above. Some might regard these inclusions as purely ceremonial and perhaps unnecessary, yet developers and local officials note that in certain cultures, the inclusion of cosmic traditions can help to encourage support from communities who prize heritage and cultural continuity over all else. Architects in cities as far removed as Mumbai and Milan acknowledge that accepting and incorporating cosmic beliefs, however intangible, into the construction process can strengthen relationships with both civic authorities and end users. While India unsurprisingly provides a vast backdrop for astrology-based building practices, design professionals in other regions observe similar practices. In East Asia, geomantic readings (similar to astrology in their cosmic references) informed “Geomantic pagodas,” structures that were believed to have the capacity to ward off evil influences if situated correctly. Similarly, in the Middle East, Islamic architecture has often turned to celestial references not only for their visual symbolism but also for their theological significance. The Qur’an frequently mentions the heavens and celestial bodies as signs of divine order, inspiring architects to align mosques, courtyards, and madrassas with specific star paths or planetary movements to imbue cosmic harmony. For instance, the layout of some mosques, such as The Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, features a lighting system that projects celestial patterns onto the exterior walls. The patterns change with the moon’s phases, creating the illusion of a moonlit sky. Reinforcing the connection between earthly worship and the heavens above. For these architects, the greatest allure of astrology lies in the storytelling that comes with it. Rather than limiting a building to function and shape, they see cosmic alignment as part of a broader story that, in the end, enriches occupant experience. A boutique retreat center might place each of its villas along a path that corresponds to the known lunar phases. In this way, guests can sense a connection between their living space and the natural rhythms of the planet. Or, as is the case in the Dubai Mall Chinatown, zodiac imagery is included as a nod to the collective and ancient heritage of stargazing that has been a guide for humanity’s curiosity over the millennia. These features do not demand literal belief in planetary influence; they can serve as symbolic gestures, a way to anchor design choices in something larger than the everyday. Enthusiasts argue that, as things become increasingly secular and mechanized, the idea that cosmic energies can bless a structure can stir the imagination and help to cultivate a feeling of belonging. There are, of course, those who remain skeptical, questioning whether astrological frameworks carry any validity. Yet even among critics, there is recognition that such symbolism can unify communities and celebrate traditions in a tangible way. Observers point out that even ancient civilizations combined celestial alignments with the most advanced engineering they had at their disposal. The structures they left behind still inspire awe and fascination today. Current technology allows us to create forms that echo cosmic cycles with unprecedented precision, bridging once-separate passions of mysticism and digital calculation. Whether the result is a literal cosmic conviction or a desire for culturally rooted design, the outcome can be architecture that truly resonates with its audience. Viewed through this lens, astrology in architecture can be seen as a design tool that goes beyond geography or ideology. The practical demands of engineering, scheduling, and budgeting will always remain paramount, yet when they coexist with a desire to link a building to cosmic drama, something special can happen. One project might place structural columns in positions that echo certain celestial trajectories, while another will time a roof’s completion to match a favorable star cluster. What unites each of the separate approaches is the belief that the built environment can have dual meanings depending on a viewer’s unique and personal beliefs, whether interpreted as divine order, universal harmony, or cultural tradition. By shaping architecture that aligns with the heavens, architects, clients and communities create not just incredible structures but also enduring reminders of humanity’s lifelong fascination with the skies beyond our atmosphere that will inform future generations.
