  "text": "Architecture studio Entorno y Contexto has led the redevelopment of a stretch of the Papaloapan River on Tuxtepec, Oaxaca, installing lightweight steel structures on stilts and landscaping to facilitate recreation. The massive development stretches four kilometres along the riverfront. It includes four stilted steel structures and 11.8 hectares of landscaped public space with paths, recreation and conservation areas. The development was created to rehabilitate public space between the urban environment of Tuxtepec and the Papalopan River at the behest of Mexico's Secretaria of Agrarian, Territorial and Urban Development (SEDATU). Entorno y Contexto has created a river park in Oaxaca\"Building on and extending the historical lineage of the park, we focused on the concept of spatial articulation to create a coherent structure that ensures the legibility and accessibility of the public environment,\" said Entorno y Contexto director Alejandro Polo Lamadrid. \"Our aim was to facilitate the introduction of recreational, cultural and sports facilities within the complex while promoting the restoration of areas of environmental and landscape value.\" Many of the structures installed for the project are open-air to facilitate easy access from the park and are covered with simple metal roofing. The simple materials, which include steel and exposed concrete, were used to emphasise the area's industrial heritage, according to Lamadrid. The park includes multiple stilted structures and amenitiesThey were prefabricated and installed on-site and provide space for amenities such as restrooms, while also serving as waiting areas for local transit or as community gathering spaces. All the buildings have large portions suspended above ground by steel stilts due to the intermittent flooding of the river. Though the buildings are mostly open-air, they include elements to shelter users such as walls of perforated brick. Industrial materials were utilised\"Local materials such as stone and natural red clay partitions were also used through simple and timeless applications,\" Lamadrid told Dezeen. \"On the other hand, the use of clay and red chromatics as a material reference to the state of Oaxaca is reinterpreted in a simple and contemporary way.\" Multiple covered courts shelter daytime sports activitiesFive sports courts were included in the program – two covered and three uncovered – as well as grass-covered sports pitches and a track. A variety of open spaces with built-in seating and exercise equipment were woven into the plan, connected by the walking and cycling paths that run through the entirety of the park. Concrete workout equipment is connected by walking and cycling pathsRehabilitating the landscape was of utmost importance for ensuring the durability of the park, and the architecture studio worked with landscape studio Virens A+P to remove non-endemic vegetation, replanting the area with native trees to try and reduce erosion. A boulevard along the park was also restored as part of the project. New signage, paving, and seating were added to complement the landscape of the park. \"The revitalized park is once again attracting users of all ages, who are extending their visits thanks to the lighting provided in the sports and relaxation areas,\" said Lamadrid. \"It is estimated that the park will be able to accommodate up to 10,000 users at any one time, with around 5,000 visitors per day, in line with the planned program.\" Red was used to reference local architectureThis is the latest out of hundreds of architectural projects commissioned by SEDATU to improve the public spaces throughout Mexico. Others include a museum installed inside an old port building by Colective C733 and a concrete community centre by CCA.
