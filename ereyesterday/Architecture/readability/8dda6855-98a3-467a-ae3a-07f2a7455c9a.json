Known for her warm, visually arresting interiors, her work represented an effortless synergy between art and design.“A true visionary and inspiration, Amy dedicated her life to creating warm and inviting spaces, touching countless lives with her passion and unique style,” shared her design firm, Amy Lau Design, on Instagram. “We will forever cherish her legacy and the impact she made on the design world.”Growing up in desert town of Paradise Valley, Lau’s appreciation for the beauty and possibilities of nature began in childhood, riding horses, spending time outside in the arroyo landscape, and gathering shells and rocks with her grandmother, an artist and mineralogist. So too did Lau’s eye for art—her parents being collectors of works by the Taos Society of Artists, jewelry, and regional material culture. After studying art history at the University of Arizona, Lau traveled through Mexico with decorative arts dealer Dino Alfaro buying artisan-made works for his Tucson, Arizona, gallery, then headed to New York City to complete a master’s degree in fine and decorative arts at the Sotheby’s Institute of Art. Stints as a director at both Thomas O'Brien’s design shop Aero and the former midcentury furniture-focused Lin-Weinberg Gallery sharpened her expertise on collectible design across history. In 2001, she founded her own interiors studio, then known as Forms of Design, now Amy Lau Design.In her commercial and residential interiors, the latter of which formed the bulk of her career projects, Lau’s signatures were her embrace of bold color, encouraged by the saturated hues of the American Southwest—“I still think of its dusty olives, siennas, and rusty browns as ‘my colors,’” she wrote in her debut monograph Expressive Modern (Monacelli Press, 2011)—and her disregard for others’ superfluous distinctions between fine art and groundbreaking design. Many of her clients were, naturally, collectors, including Clarissa and Edgar Bronfman Jr., Craig Robins, and the artist Barbara Gross, whose homes she transformed into sophisticated gesamtkunstwerks, total works of art where “every piece in an environment has a supporting role to play within that space,” as she told AD in 2022, having debuted on the annual AD100 list four years prior. In these residences, custom, antique, and 20th-century furnishings form expressive vignettes alongside artworks, in conversation with each other through color, texture, or material.“To consider a detail and its larger context at one and the same time is fundamental to a designer’s work and is critical to working with architects on a daily basis,” Lau explained of her design approach in Expressive Modern, published just a year after she was awarded an honorary doctorate degree in fine arts from the New York School of Interior Design. Founding each project around a client’s personal treasures, interests, or lifestyle needs while also considering the surrounding natural environment, she created specifically tailored spaces that feel both reminiscent of great rooms of history and wholly rooted in the present.With Robins, Lau collaborated particularly closely, cofounding the first edition of Design Miami in 2005 alongside the now London-based consultant Ambra Medda. The fair began with Lau’s co-curation of 15 galleries, and a design prize to the late architect Zaha Hadid. Lau later would become the first designer invited to exhibit at New York’s annual Salon Art + Design fair, where she showed a richly decorated living room of objects, from ceramics to showpiece minerals, in homage to the 120-year influence of Art Nouveau, in 2017.With this background in mind, Lau’s design mantra of “curating rather than merely decorating spaces” was a natural conclusion. In September 2024, the designer debuted a truly curated space of her own—an inaugural eponymous gallery on the eighth floor of the New York Design Center. It showcases her expert selection of contemporary and vintage ceramic, glass, and metal works alongside textiles and furniture. Lau previously designed commercial projects with bravado for institutions like Baccarat, Elie Tahari, and the Museum of Arts and Design, and product collections for Doris Leslie Blau, Heath Ceramics, Kohler, Kyle Bunting, Maya Romanoff, and S.Harris.Despite Lau’s formal training and sophisticated experience in the decorative arts, her projects have no hint of arrogance. Instead, there is a perpetual joyfulness in their designs, one that can only come from someone whose creativity is firmly rooted in the earth and inspired by its spectacular spectrum. As Lau herself once wrote: “I see nature as a friend and teacher, a mentor who shaped my imagination early on and continues to inform my interior design work.”",
