  "text": "UH INFONAVIT Iztacalco Rethinks Communal Spaces in MexicoThe UH INFONAVIT Iztacalco project by AMASA Estudio focuses on the revitalization of communal space within a historic housing complex in Mexico. The intervention centers on a semi-spherical steel structure, originally incomplete and deteriorated, now adapted with a new roofing system that provides shelter and enhances usability. The project introduces a 260 sqm covered forum, integrated landscape elements, and designated areas for parkour and calisthenics, improving the functionality of the space while maintaining efficient material use.Since the mid-20th century, Mexico City has expanded its collective housing developments, with approximately half of the population residing in multifamily housing complexes. Among these, INFONAVIT (Instituto del Fondo Nacional de la Vivienda para los Trabajadores) has constructed a significant portion, though many have experienced infrastructure deterioration due to aging and lack of maintenance. The UH INFONAVIT Iztacalco complex, built in 1972, was the first of its kind developed by the institute. Initially featuring an artificial lake, the site underwent modifications after the 1979 earthquake, leading to the lake’s drainage and subsequent transformation into a park with a structural framework intended for public use. The project, developed by Andrea López and Agustín Pereyra, lead architects of AMASA Estudio, focused on a comprehensive improvement strategy implemented within the communal areas of four of INFONAVIT’s most representative housing complexes in Mexico City: Iztacalco, Santa Fe, Culhuacán El Rosario, and Ignacio Chávez.all images by Zaickz MozAMASA focuses on Structural Adaptation and Material EfficiencyThe competition-winning proposal by AMASA  architectural studio addressed the need to enclose the existing steel structure, providing protection from sun and rain while maintaining openness and adaptability. The intervention reinforces the structural system through additional supports at column bases and steel joints, optimizing the stability of the framework. A suspended, inclined roof composed of a steel grid and lightweight corrugated metal sheets was introduced, secured by tensile steel cables to maximize coverage while minimizing material use. The project also incorporates chromatic and textural modifications, enhancing the spatial experience through material contrasts. Pigmented concrete in warm tones defines the platform and primary structural elements, while turquoise-green steel frameworks support the new roof. The color selection responds to the surrounding built environment, introducing a visual contrast to the original gray concrete.The project required coordination between AMASA Estudio, the construction team, and government agencies, ensuring compliance with urban and structural regulations. The intervention was completed in four months with an investment of approximately eight million pesos, demonstrating efficient resource allocation. All temporary construction elements were removed post-completion, leaving only essential structural reinforcements as part of the final design.the UH INFONAVIT Iztacalco project revitalizes a historic communal space within a Mexico City housing complexAdaptive Design for Community Interaction and RecreationThe adapted space functions as a public forum while integrating recreational and social features. The covered area supports community gatherings, while adjacent sections provide informal seating and interactive zones. The inclusion of parkour and calisthenics areas introduces dynamic movement spaces within the housing complex, enhancing physical activity opportunities for residents. The reconfiguration of the existing structure aligns with contemporary needs, ensuring that the space remains adaptable over time.The UH INFONAVIT Iztacalco project by AMASA Estudio illustrates an approach to housing complex revitalization through efficient design strategies. By integrating structural reinforcement, material optimization, and programmatic flexibility, the intervention demonstrates how underutilized communal spaces can be adapted for contemporary use. The project establishes a model for similar interventions in Mexico City, emphasizing strategic planning and resource efficiency as fundamental principles in the enhancement of collective urban environments.the intervention introduces a 260 sqm covered forum, promoting community interaction and activitythe intervention incorporates chromatic and textural modifications to enhance the spatial experiencea semi-spherical steel structure, once incomplete, now features a new roofing system for enhanced usability",
