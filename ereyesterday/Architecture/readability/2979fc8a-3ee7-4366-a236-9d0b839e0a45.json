In this roundup, AD PRO has everything you need to know.Notable ListingsA Wallace Neff–designed home in Pasadena asks $5.9 millionThe property is located at 790 Huntington Circle. Photo: Carothers PhotoThe list of Wallace Neff fans is long and varied. The beloved California architect’s projects have been published in AD since the magazine’s infancy, including 29 stories in the 1920s alone. More recent homes designed by Neff and featured in AD include Troian Bellisario and Patrick J. Adams’s abode and Diane Keaton’s Beverly Hills pad. This newly listed 1926 Neff property in Pasadena shares many of the hallmarks you’ll note from those designs, including wood-beamed ceilings and a mezzanine balcony.The Tudor Revival has five bedrooms and six bathrooms, plus a spacious double-height living area and extended eat in kitchen. Upstairs, the primary bedroom is especially large, with its own fireplace, a bay window seating area, and a walk-in closet. The lower level could serve as an in-law suite, with its own private entrance and a second kitchen. The home is located on the Langham Hotel grounds, in a 13-home neighborhood known as Huntington Circle. Residents enjoy private access to the Langham Hotel's amenities, including gardens and fine dining.The listing is held by Matthew Berkley of Engel \u0026 Völkers.A home engineered by One World Trade Center’s Jeff Smilow asks almost $6 millionThe house is located at 145 Neck Path, East Hampton, New York. Photo: Gavin ZeiglerIf you mention the Glass House to an architecture buff, Philip Johnson’s seminal work would probably be the first thing that comes to mind. The Glass House of East Hampton, built in 2016, might be more contemporary looking, but in broad strokes it’s not far off. Like Johnson’s Glass House, the East Hampton structure is surrounded by nature, making it possible to glimpse through one side of the home and out to the trees on the opposite side.The roughly 10,000 square foot home’s wraparound floor-to-ceiling glass windows and total lack of columns or dividing walls in the open lower level is what makes this uninterrupted view possible. But it’s no easy feat—the home was engineered by Jeff Smilow, who worked on One World Trade Center and 55 Hudson Yards, among many other notable structures. Two staircases slightly separate the downstairs space, leading to two separate bedroom wings. There are six bedrooms and seven full bathrooms, plus a lower level that has a four-car garage and space for a rec room.The listing is held by Jenny Landey and Zack Dayton of Sotheby’s International Realty East Hampton Brokerage.Creedence Clearwater Revival bassist Stu Cook lists Florida home for $9.975 millionThe property is located at 3638 San Remo Terrace in Sarasota. Photo: CMSMiami might get all the love in conversations about Florida real estate, but Sarasota remains a destination for midcentury architecture lovers thanks to the city’s modern movement. Creedence Clearwater Revival bassist Stu Cook has recently listed his waterfront Sarasota home designed by Carl Abbott, reportedly the last living member of the Sarasota School of Architecture.The four-bedroom, four-and-a-half bathroom home is bright white, and a travertine walkway curls out from the front door to the sidewalk. On the backside, travertine reappears in a patio that leads out to the heated pool. Upstairs, long, flat eaves hang over the terrace providing shade, and a rooftop patio extends off the top of the house to recall a diving board. A backyard spa, covered lounge area, and private boat dock with a lift add further ways to enjoy the outdoorsInside, the primary suite is accessible from a private hydraulic elevator. Pocket sliders dissolve the boundary between the bedroom and the adjoining terrace.Joel Schemmel of Premier Sotheby’s International Realty holds the listing.A newly redesigned Beverly Hills property asks $4.495 millionThis house was covered in AD Middle East. Photo: Christopher Amitrano/CS8 PhotographyEarth tones are trending in 2025, according to AD PRO’s interior design trend predictions, and this Beverly Hills property is dripping with them. Newly redesigned by Amr Samaha of Samaha Studio, copper panels, white oak accents, and green limewash walls all add warmth to the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home.“Shadybrook was an exercise in layering materials and design narratives to transform a once-forgotten space into a contemporary ranchette,” Samaha says of the 2,700 square foot property. “The design blends modern execution with vernacular principles, drawing inspiration from Egyptian architecture—seen in details like the mashrabiya-inspired front door and natural limewashed surfaces. It’s a home that celebrates warmth, tactility, and the dialogue between old and new.”The listing is held by Marco Salari and Brent Watson of the Beverly Hills Estates.New DevelopmentAmerica’s biggest office-to-residential conversion launches leasingThe office-to-residence complex is near the buzzy WSA building. Photo: StreetsenseThe race to convert empty office space into much needed residential units is on, and the country’s largest completed conversion has officially launched leasing. Named SoMA, the building is located one block east of Battery Park at 25 Water Street. Led by development firms GFP Real Estate and Metro Loft, the architecture and interior design firm CetraRuddy reimagined the building once home to JPMorgan Chase, the National Enquirer, and the Daily News.Now outfitted with 1,320 apartment units, potential tenants have options ranging from studios to three-bedrooms, many of which have home office spaces. There’s also approximately 100,000 square feet of amenity space, including a bowling alley, arcade, sports simulators, karaoke room, and coworking area.“As architects who have planned and designed residential conversions across New York City for nearly four decades, it’s no exaggeration to say that SoMa is a unique and completely unprecedented project in both scale and vision,” said John Cetra, FAIA, Founding Principal of CetraRuddy. “We’re thrilled to be a part of the team responsible for this building’s transformation.”Model apartments have been staged by Ash. Compass Development Marketing Group is the property’s exclusive leasing and marketing partner.NewsRFR Holding has officially been evicted from the Chrysler BuildingSix years ago, the Chrysler Building’s leasehold was purchased by two real estate companies, RFR Holdings and Signa. Though the latter dropped out in 2023 following the orders of an Austrian judge, RFR was just evicted from the building. During RFR’s tenure, it has grown increasingly “haggard,” as one developer source described it to Curbed. The land that the building stands on has belonged to Cooper Union since 1902, so now that RFR and Signa are no longer attached, the building is officially under Cooper Union’s leadership. Cooper Union took over operations in November, but the new judge ruling makes RFR’s lease termination official.“RFR could never overcome the basic fact that they were in arrears to the tune of $21 million and had not paid rent in months. Despite their desperate attempts to shift the focus, the problem has always been their continued failure to meet their obligations,”the vice president of finance and administration at Cooper Union, John Ruth, said in a statement shared by Commercial Observer.On Wednesday, January 28, Manhattan Supreme Court Judge Jennifer Schecter ruled that RFR must vacate and surrender the property, marking the official beginning of a new chapter for the Chrysler building. “We appreciate the court validating our position, and we look forward to working with Cushman \u0026 Wakefield, Savills and our team to assume full management of the property so we can implement a long-term plan to improve the tenant experience and maximize the building’s value,” Ruth continued.",
