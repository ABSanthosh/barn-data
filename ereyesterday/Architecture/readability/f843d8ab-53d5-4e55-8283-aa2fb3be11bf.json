The best Copenhagen Airbnbs, from a cottage surrounded by gardens to a glamorous Old World apartment, place you in the heart of the action—close enough to all the smørrebrød you can stomach and all of its most picturesque sights, like the Nyhavn Harbor.Whether you’re in town for the 3daysofdesign fair, fully embracing the Danish concept of hygge (a celebration of the small joys in life), seeking out fine dining à la Noma, or hoping to shop all the buzzy upstart brands that got their start here (sans tariffs), Copenhagen is a place that has it all. Whatever your reasoning, we’ve curated a selection of Copenhagen Airbnbs that will give you the full Danish experience, ones that embody the savvy design the city is known for.Perks: Two terraces, high chairs and children’s toys, outdoor dining spaceDecorated with a carefully curated mix of minimalist furnishings that reflect the city’s aesthetic, this two-story apartment is flooded with light thanks to a multitude of skylights, windows, and glass doors leading out to the two balconies. Exposed beams and bleached wood floors add to the Scandinavian appeal. Meals can be enjoyed in the well-appointed kitchen, or step outside to the terrace to enjoy picturesque views of the city while you wine and dine. The building is nestled next to a park–which houses a playground if you’re traveling with kids—providing a serene setting within the bustling multi-cultural neighborhood of Nørrebro. From $307 per night.Perks: Art collection, luxury mattress, chef’s kitchenIf the sleek interiors, Nordic furnishings, and mélange of artwork here call to mind an art gallery, you wouldn’t be wrong. Thanks to a partnership with the local gallery Nordvaerk, guests can enjoy a rotating collection of pieces by emerging Danish artists. The interiors aren’t the only eye candy though: Consider the gobsmacking sunsets on view from the terrace overlooking the lake. Prep a picnic in the futuristic stainless steel kitchen to tote to one of the neighborhood parks, then spend the day exploring all the nearby galleries, boutiques, and restaurants. No matter what you choose to do, you can look forward to a wonderful night’s sleep on the luxurious Hästens mattress after a long day. From $259 per night.Perks: Garden, woodburning stove, outdoor firepitThe Frederiksberg neighborhood in the center of Copenhagen is known as the city within the city. This charming light-filled cottage, located within a garden association, epitomizes the area’s reputation for being a green oasis. The Danish modern furnishings allow the surrounding gardens—from which you are welcome to pick your own fruit, vegetables, and herbs—to take center stage. Embrace Denmark’s concept of hygge by relaxing with family and friends on the outside terrace or curling up in front of the woodburning stove. Feeling creative? Explore these impulses in the art studio or the woodworking shop, the latter being the perfect space to realize any inspiration you’ve found in a city recognized as a leader in furniture design. From $370 per night.Perks: High-end appliances, sleeps up to 10 guests, rain showerLocated on one of Copenhagen’s most prestigious streets and surrounded by a multitude of shops and restaurants, this Indre Bay historic apartment is designed for those who want to experience European glamour at its best. Step inside the private entrance to discover high ceilings, picture moldings, a glistening crystal chandelier, and a dining room that can host a 10-person dinner party. Although this feels like a step back in time, don’t worry—the historic design doesn’t extend to the amenities. High-end appliances, spa-like bathrooms, large closets, and luxurious bedding offers the modern comforts all travelers desire. From $1,382 per night.Perks: Fireplaces, washer, crib and pack-and-playLive like a lord or lady, at least temporarily, in this 1757 home that was built for nobility and aristocrats. Connected to the Yellow Palace (yes, you read that right, palace), the apartment, which showcases intricate moldings and arched oversize windows, has served as a home to two kings. Fittingly, walls and furnishings in jewel tones can be found throughout. It’s an easy walk to the city center, but a fireplace, oversize velvet furniture, and king-size beds (no pun intended) dressed in luxury linens will make it difficult to leave your own personal castle. From $918 per night.Perks: Fireplace, balcony, pets allowedWith its picture moldings, built-ins throughout, and fireplace, this Frederiksberg apartment oozes historic charm while its white color palette and sun-bathed interiors ensure that it still feels fresh. Start your day enjoying coffee on the bedroom’s charmingly furnished balcony. If at the end of the day, you’re too tired for dinner at one of the many surrounding restaurants, prepare a meal in the classic white kitchen and enjoy it in the elegant dining room. Then, retire to the spacious living room to sip a digestif on one of the large couches. From $1,336 per night.Perks: Balcony, courtyard, washer and drierEmbrace your inner Rapunzel in this 1847 penthouse with expansive views of the city’s rooftops and iconic towers. Vintage-inspired wallpaper, a mix of antique and modern furnishings, and historic art set a layered, eclectic vibe. Bring home some local produce from the nearby farmer’s market to make a meal in the well-appointed kitchen, which opens to the living room. The only challenge you’ll face during your stay is deciding between the first bedroom with its original atelier windows or the second that hosts a comfy reading nook and access to the private balcony. From $713 per night.Perks: Shared courtyard, washer and dryer,While this large, sun-filled flat was recently renovated, it still maintains the original charm from when it was built in 1700. A stylish, muted palette (all white save for soft-green kitchen cupboards) allows the ceiling moldings, natural floors, and built-in cabinetry and shelves to shine. Within walking distance to many fashionable shops, popular restaurants, and public transportation, as well as Tivoli Gardens, you won’t have to go far to enjoy the city. Want to socialize a bit closer to home? Head to the shared courtyard to meet a mix of local residents and other tourists. From $503 per night.Perks: Quiet location, washer and dryer, shared backyardLooking for a flat that feels somehow minimalist and vibrant at the same time? This one is for you. Contemporary white kitchen cabinetry with butcher-block countertops balance sleek style with warm vibes while the exposed brick in the bedroom adds another hint of coziness. Textiles and artwork infuse the space with pops of color, making for a playful setting that both adults and kids will enjoy. For those who want easy access to the city center but prefer to avoid crowds, the location is a bike ride to the heart of the city, while the home itself is located in a quiet neighborhood for resting up. From $178 per night.",
