When she first visited the bucolic Paris home, it was like discovering a magical overgrown garden. That also made it impossible to get a good photograph of the house in its entirety, as nature hid sections of it from view. Behind all that greenery was a typical early 19th-century home with a classically inspired exterior. The romantic setting near Paris and the house that occupied it belonged to the pointillist painter Jac Martin-Ferrières in the 1930s; he added a studio with a glass roof in the 1950s. (Unfortunately, after years of neglect, the studio was beyond the point of being salvaged when Pargger arrived.) “I wanted the house to continue to maintain its connection with nature while also preserving the large volume and better organizing the space,” the Austrian architect and designer says. In order to save the house, it would have to be completely gutted and its faux brick facade entirely rebuilt.The facade of the home was completely rebuilt. Large French windows in modernist style open onto the garden. On the roofs are planters with trees. The staircase consists of a metal structure covered in plaster. On the wall hangs Kernelless Siamese Cobs by Xolo Cuintle (DS Galerie). Next to a chair by Charles Rennie Mackintosh stands a Teatro armchair by Aldo Rossi (Nans Design). “We kept the very high ceiling and the large French windows overlooking this fabulous garden, in an assertively modernist style, along the lines of Le Corbusier and Robert Mallet-Stevens,” Pargger explains. An indoor swimming pool with a sober and restrained design now stands where the studio once did. With gardens on both sides of the house, Pargger has created a new fluidity: the building has large vertical openings that blur the lines between exterior and interior on warm days. From the living room to the bedrooms, wherever you are, you’re surrounded by trees, and the architect’s goal has been to engage with this natural setting that both reveals and hides itself behind the layers of foliage.In the living room, behind one of the leather sofas (Katja Pargger), a Regen rope and silicone pouf (Wendy Andreu) and a pair of Armloffel armchairs by Joseph Hoffman. The Park rug is from Nordic Knots. Photos: Clément Vayssieres/Réalisation: Aurore Lameyre et Alice Mesguich assistées de Joanne FaberIn terms of colors and textures, the architect, who says she “loves authentic materials,” has restored the original appearance of the elegant classical facades—which were whitewashed with small bits of marble—and curated an interior aesthetic that’s reminiscent of the Viennese Secession, while simultaneously evoking the designs of Josef Hoffmann. “I like stone, lime, wood, glass, metal—as raw as possible without being too finished. I don’t use my design freedom simply to make a bold gesture without considering other factors. I design interiors that are sustainable, so that they don’t have to be redone in 10 or 15 years, having fallen out of fashion,” Pargger says. In the vast living area with its soaring ceiling, for example, the walls are constructed from a mineral plaster, while the herringbone parquet is in natural oak. The staircase leading to the mezzanine, made of a single piece of metal, is clad in plaster and has a presence like an elegant sculpture rising in the space at the heart of the home.The living room is organized around a conversation pit: two large modular sofas designed by Pargger form a circle. In the center, an aluminum Sella Curulis stool by SashaxSasha (GSL Gallery) and, atop glazed ceramic coffee tables by Pargger, a bronze Hera Pira box by Victor Guedy. Toward the rear of the room, a 19th-century Italian Studiolo cabinet (Nans Design) and a Les Artisans de Marolles wrought-iron lamp (Maison Cédric). On the stele, a patinated bronze sculpture, Broac over Paris, by Victor Guedy. Above the fireplace, the diptych (Dé)-camper by Clément Borderie (Galerie Jousse Entreprise). On the right, the textile work A Trillion Threads Still Weaving by Zuzanna Czebatul (Galerie Sans Titre) and a vintage Indian wooden chair. Upstairs, in a smaller lounge, the lightly stained oak and Japanese raffia complement the garden without feeling forcefully coordinated. The forest green carpet—which Pargger denotes as “something very new for me!”—evokes nature and the outdoors in a similarly subtle way.Above a cabinet of wood and parchment and an ivory box (Karin Szanto), an untitled work by Loïc Blairon. In front, a pair of Armloffel armchairs by Joseph Hoffman. On the stele, a vase by Natalia Criado (Galerie Paradis). The Park rug is by Nordic Knots. In an alcove off of the living room, a lacquered wooden bench by Pierre Cardin (Maison Verrsen) with an Iranian sofreh by Afshar hanging on the wall behind it(Galerie Triff). On the small black melamine table (Hélène Lalbaltry), a terracotta vase by Sakata Jinnai (MBA Fine Arts). The pair of Saucer sconces are by Gilles Derain (Nans Design). Constantly questioning her training as an architect, Pargger attempts to create lucky accidents, like placing a door frame in a paneled wall. It’s an effect that recalls a certain Japanese purity. “The more solid and perfect that you build the base, the more you can then innovate, but it’s like a mathematical equation. You have to master everything in sequence before you can go off in other directions.” She embraces experimentation and the blending of materials with an empirical approach that comes from deep within her, the result of her travels around the world to experience art and marvel at beauty that is the result of age and a certain patina. For example, the sofa in the form of a conversation pit, made with leather scraps from Hermès—a design she especially loves—encourages openness and fosters communication. As for the rest of the space, the room is pure and simple. Whitewashed walls diffuse light, while the convex fireplace features a concave sheet-metal hearth. The space is calm, glowing, and Zen-like. The curation of furniture and contemporary works gives the house its personality, with paintings by Clément Borderie, sculptures by artist duo Xolo Cuintle, a tapestry by Zuzanna Czebatul, other paintings by Ciprian Tocu, and furniture by Elias Van Orshaegen.In the dining room, above the fireplace, Origanum Phengaris and, to the right, Seed, Roots, Seed and Inside Out Shell, both by Xolo Cuintle (DS Galerie). On the lacquer table, a Teodora cup by Ettore Sottsass (Galerie Romain Morandi). Vintage chairs. The paint from Clay used for the kitchen cabinets echoes the emerald green of the swimming pool. They also complement the brilliance of the lacquered worktops. Combining leather, wood, lacquer, and thick fabrics, Pargger’s design is more than a collection of materials, it’s also a meeting of the souls of designers and craftsmen. “This whole mix requires a solid base on which to then fill in the gaps and create a whole that can be experienced. It’s my attempt to take something from Umberto Eco’s theory of literature and apply it to architecture,” says Pargger with a smile. “It’s a little bit of something here, a little bit of something else there, and it all adds up to create something unique.” It’s a design that relies on differences of scale, discreet contrasts, and creating a rigorous whole from a variety of elements.In the library, in front of okoumé and velvet armchairs, two glazed ceramic coffee tables (all by Katja Pargger).

The Turkish kilim is from Konya (Galerie Triff). In front of the bed, a stainless steel and leather bench (Katja Pargger).
