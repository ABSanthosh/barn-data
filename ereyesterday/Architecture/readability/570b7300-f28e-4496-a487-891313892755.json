Submit your work ahead of the Main Entry deadline on June 6th! Learn More About Vision Awards It’s time to give some overdue attention to the people who shape architecture in ways a floor plan never could: architectural photographers and videographers. You’ve captured the atmosphere of a space before the concrete set. You’ve told a story that made someone feel a building halfway across the world. You’ve distilled the soul of a space into a single frame (or a few perfectly edited minutes). You’re a photographer, a videographer, but above of all — a storyteller. And now, there’s an award that sees what you do for what it truly is: architectural work. With that in mind, we want to share a few reasons why architectural photographers and videographers deserve the recognition buildings usually get — along with a handful of Vision Awards categories made specifically for the people behind the camera. From stills of interiors and exteriors to categories that focus on mood, detail and narrative, there’s room for every perspective to find its place. 1. Cameras frame how the world sees architecture. Photo by Shoayb Khattab, Special Mention, Photographer of the Year, 2023 Architizer Vision Awards Apart from documenting what a building actually looks like, what distinguishes good architectural photography is the way it gives people a sense of what it feels like to be there. The weight of the materials, the quality of the light, the atmosphere of the space — it can all come through. When it’s done well, you can almost imagine the sound of your footsteps on the floor. Photographers and videographers decide which parts of a project become visible and which ones fade into the background. You choose what gets shown: the angle, the light, the moment. That version often becomes the one people remember, shaping how they understand a project and what stays with them long after. Front of House/Back of House by John Muggenborg Architectural Photography, Studio Winner, Interior Photograph, 2023 Architizer Vision Awards Through framing, pacing and mood, the image offers legibility. It shows how a space works, where it opens up, where it holds back, where it asks for attention. If your work helps architecture stay visible, understandable and alive in the public imagination, the Vision Awards were designed to recognize exactly that. Explore these categories (and more) at this year’s Vision Awards: Exterior Photograph – For capturing how a building meets the world around it; Interior Photograph – For the qualities of light, texture and space that unfold inside; Building Portrait (Video) – For architectural films that bring movement and life to the frame; Color Photograph – For visual narratives shaped by tone, contrast and atmosphere; Black \u0026 White Photograph – For images that focus on structure, light and clarity. 2. Cameras capture what architects can’t put on paper. Architecture takes time. And along the way, there are moments worth seeing — materials arriving on site, something being installed for the first time, the way a space starts to take shape before it’s fully done. These stages often go unrecorded, but they reveal just as much as the final result. They show how a project was built, not just what it became. Even once a building is complete, plans and diagrams can only tell part of the story. They explain how things work, but not how they feel. A drawing can show you where the windows are, but not how the light actually moves through the space. Good photography and video pick up where the technical information stops. They make the atmosphere visible. If your work captures process, mood or the details in between, the Vision Awards offer categories that value the full story — not just the finished product. Categories that might be a good fit for you include: Making Of (Video) – For films that follow the progress of a project from idea to built form; Architecture \u0026 Details – For images that focus on texture, surface and material precision; Architecture \u0026 Atmosphere – For visual work that brings out tone, timing and ambient light; Experimental (Video) – For creative approaches that rethink how architecture is documented. 3. Cameras show what (and who) architecture is really for. Architecture exists to be used. But it’s one thing to plan how a space will function and another to see it in action. Photography and video reveal how people actually move through a building — where they slow down, where they gather, how they occupy space over time. Photo by Philippe Sarfati, Professional Winner, Architectural Photographer of the Year, 2023 Architizer Vision Awards Including people in the frame does more than show activity. It helps us understand proportion. A lone figure in a long corridor. A crowd moving through a narrow threshold. These moments give us a sense of scale that drawings can’t. They show how large or intimate a space feels, how open or compressed, how formal or relaxed. If your work focuses on lived experience and human connection to space, these categories highlight exactly that perspective: Architecture \u0026 People – For capturing how human presence gives meaning to a space; Architecture \u0026 Urban Life – For movement, density and everyday patterns in the built environment; Profile or Interview (Video) – For stories centered on the people behind or within architecture; Interior or Exterior Photograph – For spaces that hold real use and human scale. 4. You turn representation into interpretation. Every building has a concept behind it—a guiding idea that shaped the form, the material choices, the layout. But that idea isn’t always immediately visible. Sometimes it only becomes clear if you know where to look. Through photography and video, you help surface it. You draw attention to what matters, whether it’s contrast or calm, complexity or restraint. Even the most straightforward image involves decisions: where to stand, what to include, when to shoot. These choices are subtle, but they add up to a kind of authorship. Over time, they influence how a project is read, how it’s remembered and what kind of impact it has. Your work doesn’t just communicate what’s there. It tells a version of the story — one that might otherwise go unseen. Photo by NING WANG, Special Mention, Architectural Photographer of the Year, 2023 Architizer Vision Awards If your work is guided by atmosphere, tone or conceptual clarity, the Vision Awards recognize how those choices shape architectural meaning through these categories and more: Architecture \u0026 Atmosphere – For images that evoke feeling through time, light or weather; Architecture \u0026 People – For work that draws out human stories and interactions; Architecture \u0026 Environment – For interpretations that frame architecture in relation to its context; Experimental (Video) – For films that push the format or shift the lens entirely Any Video Category – For projects that use structure, motion or mood to frame architectural intent. 5. You’re building architecture’s visual legacy. Photo by NING WANG, Special Mention, Architectural Photographer of the Year, 2023 Architizer Vision Awards Every building has a moment when it’s new. But that moment passes quickly. Over time, materials weather, programs change and additions are made. What stays, what gets remembered, is often the way it was first captured. Photos and films become the record. They’re what future clients see. What ends up in books, archives or public memory. Your work might be the only version of the project that people engage with once the building has changed, closed or disappeared. That long-term story deserves a platform. And the Vision Awards and all its different categories exist to make sure it has one. Get the Recognition You Deserve — Submit for the Vision Awards Photo by Kevin Scott, Special Mention, Architectural Photographer Of The Year, 2023 Architizer Vision Awards The Vision Awards were created to recognize the people who shape architecture through images and ideas. That includes the concept designers, the renderers, the model-makers and just as importantly, the photographers and videographers whose work becomes the lasting record. Your images are what people remember. They’re what circulate, what get published, what define how a project is understood long after the fact. The program includes dedicated accolades like Photographer of the Year and Videographer of the Year, alongside a full set of categories for still and moving images. Winners are featured across Architizer’s global platforms, published in our annual print book How to Visualize Architecture and celebrated by a jury of industry leaders. It’s visibility, credibility and long-term recognition — at a global scale. If your work tells the story of architecture (how it feels, how it works, how it lives), this is your chance to step into the spotlight.
