  "text": "85 design works Toward a Greener Urban ModelG.ao House by 85 Design stands quietly among the streets of Hòa Hải, Vietnam, carrying ambitions that extend well beyond shelter and workspace. Surrounded by the tropical landscape of central Vietnam, the project reflects a broader shift in the country’s architectural outlook toward sustainability. Designed as a hybrid between residence and office, it demonstrates how smaller-scale projects can respond to the climate crisis through material choices and energy strategies.The architecture takes form through a prefabricated steel frame, selected for its low-waste assembly and future recyclability. This structural approach allows the building to remain flexible over time, supporting the shifting demands of daily life and work. The designers minimized the building footprint to open up surrounding gardens, letting air and light move freely through the spaces. A rooftop solar array feeds over 11,000 kilowatt-hours of renewable energy into the building annually, supported by smart management systems that optimize consumption and storage.images © To Huu Dungga.o house interiors united by Vertical GreeneryThe architects at 85 Design organize G.ao House’s two main floors and attic to weave interior spaces with the exterior landscape. A front garden introduces water features and reclaimed stone elements that recall the site’s construction process. These salvaged materials add texture and character while reducing waste. On the ground floor, a casual dining bar serves the office community, while the upper levels blend private and communal functions through adaptable layouts. Features such as a double-height void, cascading balcony waterfall, and glass fish tank contribute to the building’s layered sensory experience.Ecological intentions are extended vertically with a green wall that stretches from ground to roof. The living surface enhances air quality while moderating the indoor environment throughout the year. Above, the attic opens toward panoramic views and benefits from operable roof elements that adjust to changing weather. Mechanical systems for cooling and water storage are discreetly positioned alongside solar panels on the roof to ensure that technical performance supports the building’s quiet relationship with its context.The home performs as much as it shelters. Through integrated energy and water systems, it reduces fossil fuel dependency by up to 80 percent and prevents the release of more than 8.5 tons of carbon dioxide each year. Over time, its contribution to offsetting emissions rivals the environmental impact of planting thousands of trees. In this way, the project offers more than functional space — it becomes part of a larger environmental narrative.G.ao House by 85 Design merges living and working spaces in Hòa Hải, Vietnamthe project uses a prefabricated steel frame to reduce waste and allow flexibilityrooftop solar panels generate over eleven thousand kilowatt hours annuallyrainwater and irrigation systems are designed for reuse and minimal resource waste",
