  "text": "sofiia hupalovska and nataliya stukonog complete insideSofiia Hupalovska and Nataliya Stukonog have created a chic sex shop in Kyiv that diverges from stereotypes of adult retail spaces. Instead of the usual neon lights and clichéd symbols, the Ukrainian designers introduce a more nuanced approach to such environments. One that feels more natural and approachable. ‘INSIDE is not just a sex shop — it’s an immersive experience where design meets passion,’ they share.A sense of intimacy is spatially fostered by tucking the showroom within a basement space, transforming it into an exploratory environment that encourages curiosity and openness, removing any sense of stigma. Bold architectural choices, sensual lighting, and a playfully sophisticated ambiance characterize the concept, emphasizing a blend of sleek and textured finishes for a tactile finish that feels luxurious yet accessible.all images by Yevhenii Avramenkosleek surfaces, sensual lighting, and an accessible ambianceSituated underground with no access to natural light, INSIDE incorporates a stretch ceiling with backlighting. This setup creates a soft diffused glow that mimics daylight, eliminating harsh shadows and making the space feel more open and airy. The lighting design enhances the showroom’s clean aesthetic, ensuring that every detail — from product displays to architectural elements — is clearly illuminated. In the reception area, intended to feel both private and welcoming, the designers have positioned the desk against a striking metallic backdrop. Soft lighting enhances this central greeting point, while the desk itself establishes a clear check-in or information zone without overwhelming the rest of the store. Ahead, the seating area features a sofa with organic curves as an artistic representation of the human form. The placement of ‘LOVE CARE PLEASURE’ messaging on the walls beside it reinforces the store’s philosophy with boldness.Sofiia Hupalovska and Nataliya Stukonog designed the shelving as rounded built-in wall units that respond to the curvature of the basement walls and provide a clean backdrop for showcasing products. They ensure easy accessibility while browsing, keeping the space uncluttered.
