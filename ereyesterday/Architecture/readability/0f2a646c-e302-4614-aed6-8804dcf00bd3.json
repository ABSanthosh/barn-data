Although this neighborhood is apropos for such a monumental display of design talent, this year’s showcase house itself didn’t begin as the grand manse it is today.Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

Through the 1930s, the building’s tenants included well-heeled bachelors and widows until it was sold to real estate entrepreneur Lyman Potter (who then moved into one of the units with his family and rented the others through the 1960s.)Changing hands several more times over the ensuing decades, it was relatively recently that the home’s design identity completely shifted. By all outward appearances, not a semblance of Tudor styling remains following its 2009 transformation by architect Louis Felthouse and designer Matthew MacCaul Turner. The home’s English façade gave way to a classically-inspired French limestone exterior, but its interiors, now consolidated to form a single-family home, still reflected its Tudor past (though all these elements were now contemporary interpretations). Aside from owners, not much else has changed in the 16 years since the massive renovation, but the sky was the limit when the region’s top designers got the keys to the eight bedroom, seven full- and three half-bath home, with its multi-level rooftop terrace boasting staggering city and Bay views. Sandwiched between sizable single-family homes (including the Dutch Colonial Revival Newhall Mansion) and Edwardian and classic revival-style apartment buildings, the 123-year old structure is ready for its latest reveal.However, it’s not the panoramic vistas or sightline across the water to Marin that are the most captivating parts of the San Francisco Decorator Showcase, which has raised more than $19 million for the San Francisco University High School’s financial aid program since 1977. It’s the newly imagined spaces that hold our attention and help to forecast incoming design trends, as interpreted by arbiters of style from around the Bay Area. In Geoffrey De Sousa’s reimagining of the wood-paneled living room, the designer foreshadows several of the major taste-making themes seen throughout the house. Beneath a large photograph by pioneering filmmaker and installation artist Sir Isaac Julien, a sumptuous curled-arm sofa in the softest blush pink is flanked by a pair of Todo Modo slipper chairs upholstered in green boucle. (The set was designed by French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte in 1993 for the Louvre—its moveable steel arms allow the bolster-back to move from one side to the other so patrons could comfortably view works on opposing walls without changing seats.)Directory member Katie Monkhouse designed the garden apartment at the San Francisco Decorator Showcase 2025. Photo: Stephanie RussoIn fact, nearly all the designers upped their chair game by including statement-making pairs in many of the home’s vignettes. In the utterly chic garden apartment, AD PRO Directory member Katie Monkhouse had two Almond + Co. chairs upholstered in a delightfully contrasting mustard yellow Sandra Jordan bouclé. An undulating sofa upholstered in a printed Dedar fabric from Kneedler Fauchère anchors the main living space, which chicly riffed on the Garden of Eden. For his 1970s-inspired rooftop retreat, John K. Anderson incorporated a set of Campbell barstools—with their tubular steel frames, leather belt detail and hide-upholstered cushions—from Sean Woolsey Studio. In Kathleen Navarra’s library, a cylindrical-shaped fringed bench by Lorenza Bozzoli Couture softens the rectangular room, as does the custom rolled-arm sofa. In fact, curvaceous sofas replaced more linear one-note shapes in virtually every common space of the house. In the opulently tented dining room, for example, AD PRO Directory designer Julie Rootes scouted a Moroccan scallop-backed bench with large bolster pillows as arms and rounded seat cushions for a moment of post-feast relaxation.Shades of pink are also noticeably woven through the veritable fabric of the home’s design. In Sabah Mansoor’s playroom and adjoining bath, the AD PRO Directory designer custom-built a 1980s-inspired bench and vanity base lacquered in a pale mauve hue. Downstairs in Assel Teskey’s laundry room, the Foster City, California-based designer maximizes color in the tight space with crane-and-flamingo-printed Calico wallpaper. She also painted the cabinets a complimentary champagne shade from Sherwin-Williams. A richer, “sunbaked” tone of pink—like something pulled from a New Mexico sunset—clads the walls of Kendra Nash’s guest suite. Anderson’s aforementioned penthouse gathering spot is aptly dubbed “Way Out West: A Technicolor Time-Out,” considering the pops of pink incorporated through the space’s fabrics and artwork, as they are in Rootes’ dining room. For her somewhat cinematic office titled “Beauty Interrupted,” Leslie Lamarre installed Timorous Beasties’ bee-motifed Bloody Empire wall covering, wherein various shades of pink are incorporated into abstract florals and paint splatters.The office, called “Beauty Interrupted,” by Leslie Lamarre of TRG Architecture + Interior Design. Photo: Brad KnipsteinCool blues also had their moment, particularly in Showcase veteran Kelly Hohla’s “Marine Layers” family room and kitchen. Combining ethereal blues and grays that recall the tranquility of water, fog, and a dreamy coastal sky, the AD PRO Directory designer connects the two spaces seamlessly. The palette also served as an opportunity to debut her new capsule furniture collection featuring the Cove banquette, Droplet dining chairs, and Seafoam rug—all of which nod to the Bay Area’s own marine layer. In the kitchen, Hohla entrusted UK-based Bakehouse Kitchens to fabricate the cabinetry, which was painted a soft dove color called “Bridgerton Blue.” Going back to Navarra’s library, the designer debuts Fromental’s new graphic wallpaper, installed on the ceiling so that the various shades of blue radiate from two pendants by Jonathan Browning Studios. At one end of the room, Navarra selected a pair of Gio lounge chairs by Kimberly Denman upholstered in a patterned blue Pierre Frey fabric. In a nearby stairway, designer and artist—and former University High School student—Diane Rosenblum unveiled her “DNA Family Portraits.” The installation of vertical panels—with their horizontal hand-painted strips of cream, grey, black and pale blue—represent individual chromosomes that map her own DNA.Lighting choices were just as illuminating with designers opting for whimsical and biomorphic shapes over more traditional styles. In her child’s bedroom design, sweetly dubbed “Nest,” designer Ansley Majit selected Daniel Shapiro’s Chirp floor lamp No. 1, a reverberating ceramic number inspired by the sound waves of serenading crickets outside the artist’s studio. Meanwhile, in Heather K. Bernstein’s “Imaginarium” kids room, the designer commissioned ceramicist Hannah Simpson to create a floor lamp edition of her scalloped Drip fixture series—an ask that required a specially-built kiln to produce. In the home’s foyer, AD PRO Directory designer Jon de la Cruz opted for Boyd Lightings’s Ovalo Chain Cluster pendant, which cascades multiple floors down the center of the spiral staircase. And back in the tented dining room, Rootes installed an ornate Paul Ferrante circular fixture that looks as much like an Art Deco pendant necklace as it does a chandelier. Trés chic.Thanks to generous sponsorships from Bakehouse, Bluestar, Da Vinci Marble, Pietra Fina, Amber Flooring, Matterport, Sherwin-Williams, Waterworks and Perez Construction, among dozens of others, there was no shortage of creative solutions that help make it possible for the San Francisco Decorator Showcase 2025 to dazzle thousands of visiting design enthusiasts and provide deserving Bay Area students with a college preparatory education (through San Francisco University High School) that they may not otherwise have access to.The “Rock, Paper, Scissors” entry and ground floor stair hall by DLC-ID.
