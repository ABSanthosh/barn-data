  "text": "Heys Café by BREND: A Flexible, Material-Driven Space in OsakaLocated near the river in Nakanoshima, Osaka, Heys Café is a newly constructed coffee shop designed by BREND. The project responds to the brand’s concept of ‘no barriers’ by creating a space where varying materials and functions coexist within a compact footprint of approximately 33 sqm (10 tsubo).To balance seating capacity with a sense of openness, BREND introduced a built-in volume that serves as outdoor bench seating. The café’s street-facing facade incorporates operable steel sashes, allowing for flexible enclosure and ventilation while encouraging interaction between interior and exterior spaces. The overall facade concept intentionally softens the boundary between indoors and outdoors, promoting fluid movement of air and light throughout the space.all images courtesy of BRENDMaterial Continuity and Flexible Spatial Use define BREND’s designConsidering materiality, BREND’s design team utilizes Mino ware tiles for both the bench and table finishes, a material characterized by uneven color variation, adding visual texture and continuity. The surrounding walls feature a plaster finish in a color range closely matched to the tiles, creating a cohesive material palette while highlighting subtle differences between surface treatments.The café’s furniture is designed with flexibility in mind. Stackable elements allow the interior layout to adapt easily for alternative uses outside of regular business hours, supporting a variety of spatial configurations.designed by BREND, the café reflects the brand’s concept of ‘no barriers’outdoor bench seating is integrated into the building’s volume",
