The Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter is selling his midcentury modern home to Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles star Josh Flagg, a source tells AD. The off-market deal is reportedly under contract, per Robb Report.Puth listed the property in November 2023 for $17 million before slashing the price to $14 million in May, according to TMZ. The “We Don’t Talk Anymore” singer later reduced it further to $11 million, which was its last listed price. The sale comes a month after Puth’s wedding, which was held at his family’s residence in the celeb enclave of Montecito, California.The musician first acquired the home in 2017 for $9 million. The seller was photographer Matthew Rolston. Puth settled into the 4,800-square-foot property, located in the affluent Trousdale Estates neighborhood, not long after parting ways with his Mediterranean-inspired villa in the Hollywood Hills for $2 million.The home’s kitchen.

It was originally owned by Freddie de Cordova, a longtime producer of the The Tonight Show during Johnny Carson’s tenure, which earned it the moniker “The de Cordova House.” The manse was also reportedly a social hub for advisers to President Ronald Reagan. Lotery was the mind behind many famous abodes, including Elvis and Priscilla Presley’s home, also located in Trousdale Estates.A dining area in the home.

The exterior of the singer’s soon-to-be-former dwelling is composed of concrete, stone, glass, and redwood. The estate features spacious courtyards and a motorcourt that can accommodate nine vehicles.

As for Flagg, he currently resides in Bel-Air. The purchase of Puth’s home marks yet another multimillion dollar addition to the star broker’s growing bicoastal holdings; he scooped up a 7,100-square-foot Bedford mansion in 2022 for $9.2 million and purchased an abode on Miami Beach’s exclusive North Bay Road the following year. TMZ reports that Flagg and his father are also exploring properties in New York.",
