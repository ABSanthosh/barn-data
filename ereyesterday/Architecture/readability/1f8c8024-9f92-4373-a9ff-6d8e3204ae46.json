  "text": "Wendelstrand Lakehouse camouflages into natureIn the Swedish town of Mölnlycke, outside Gothenburg, Snøhetta‘s Wendelstrand Lakehouse stands as the central gathering space within a visionary development. Wendelstrand is at once a residential development and a community designed for interaction and leisure. The Lakehouse is the heart of this vision, offering spaces for work, dining, fitness, and events. It is both a functional hub and an architectural symbol of the area’s sustainable future.The Lakehouse, which broke ground in early 2022, is an elongated structure designed to camouflage with its natural surroundings. Its form evokes the shape of a spine, extending across the landscape and bridging the gap between the past and the present. This connection between old and new is further emphasized by the building’s materials, which draw directly from the site’s history as a former quarry.images © Kalle SannerSustainable Design for Community NeedsSnøhetta’s design of the Wendelstrand Lakehouse is informed by the surrounding landscape. The lower floors of concrete and stone are embedded in the bedrock, offering a solid and grounded connection to the earth. With these materials to reflect the rugged terrain and the site’s quarrying past, the architects reinforce the relationship between the built environment and the natural landscape.At the core of the Lakehouse is an open atrium that rises through all the building’s levels. This vertical space serves as a gathering point, allowing natural light to flood the interior and enhancing the building’s sense of openness. The atrium is flexible, able to accommodate concerts, performances, or quieter moments of relaxation. It spills out into an open-air amphitheater, which overlooks Lake Landvetter, blurring the line between the built and natural world.Wendelstrand Lakehouse is the heart of a new residential development in Mölnlycke, Swedensnøhetta’s Hub for Community Building in swedenSnøhetta’s commitment to sustainability is clear throughout the Wendelstrand development, and the Lakehouse is no exception. The building incorporates energy-efficient solutions and a careful selection of materials that minimize its environmental footprint. A key aspect of the design is its connection to nature. The functional green roof, resembling a treetop canopy, is covered with native plants such as moss, grass, and wildflowers, which help manage water runoff, mitigate heat, and promote biodiversity. The top floors of the lake house continue the theme of nature-inspired design. Constructed from glulam and laminated timber, these levels reflect the forested surroundings with their warm, organic textures. Large glass panels, adorned with strategically placed patterns, mimic the interplay of light through treetops, while also improving the building’s energy efficiency by reducing solar heat gain.the building’s form reflects the natural landscape, drawing inspiration from the site’s quarry heritageconcrete and stone dominate the lower floors, grounding the building in its natural surroundingsa central open atrium connects all levels and serves as a flexible gathering space",
