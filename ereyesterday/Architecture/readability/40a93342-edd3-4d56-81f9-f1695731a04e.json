  "text": "In the year since Benny Blanco first listed his longtime New York City condo for just under $4 million, he’s gotten engaged and dropped a collaborative album with Selena Gomez. The pair also bought a $35 million Beverly Hills mansion together. While they haven’t tied the knot quite yet, Blanco seems to be quite comfortably beginning his wife guy era—which should be even easier now that he’s officially shed the lingering NYC bachelor pad from his real estate portfolio, according to Robb Report. The outlet shares that the musician’s loft-style three-bedroom, three-bathroom dwelling sold this week for $3.6 million. He dropped $3.45 million on the spot back in 2011.The 2,200-square-foot corner unit is nestled on the sixth floor of the Chelsea Mercantile building, a 19-story luxury condominium that offers amenities like a full gym, garage parking, an expansive roof deck, and 24-hour doorman and concierge services. Blanco’s former spot features an open floor plan, wherein a compact all-white kitchen with a breakfast bar shares the sprawling window-lined space with living and dining areas.On one end of the apartment, a bedroom looks to be set up as a music studio, carpeted with overlapping kilim rugs which calls to mind Blanco’s more-is-more approach: “​​I’m not afraid to be a grandmother and have patterns everywhere,” he told AD last year. “I don’t mind a clash.” The primary suite, which is situated on the opposite side of the great room, is pictured in the listing with floating shelves displaying Blanco’s various awards, a dressing room, and a bathroom lined with jet black tiles.Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.ArrowIn addition to Gomez and Blanco’s new Beverly Hills home, Blanco maintains the colorful Hollywood Hills estate that he referred to in a 2024 AD tour as “a dinner party house.” As for the Emilia Perez star, she’s got an Encino property custom designed by Tom Petty.",
