  "text": "The recently formed architectural duo of Inès Deschodt and Johanne Le Griffon has quickly proved itself to be an impressive pair. Both graduated from prestigious Paris design schools (the former from Penninghen, and the latter from the École Boulle.) Now, they are already presenting one of their first projects to AD. It’s no small feat, given that it involved the renovation of an 18th-century mansion in the south of Paris.For his Versailles apartment, the owner, who is a chef and pastry chef, wanted “a cocoon” that subtly evokes the style of the Palace of Versailles, located nearby. “We didn’t want to fall into the trap of hyper-classicism, and instead wanted to do something completely different,” explain the interior designers. “It was important to create a contemporary space.” The first time they visited the pied-à-terre, the walls were yellow with red tapestries—case in point. “We wanted to give the home a new, stronger identity.” the designer duo explain. But the whole project needed to be carried out in accordance with strict French regulations covering historic buildings, as the one where the apartment is located is protected.The living room is staged with a theatrical flair, with items casually left on the floor and a throw draped over the sofa. Coffee table by Paul Coenen (Scène Ouverte). Pacific sofa (Moroso). Maison Verrsen armchair. Wendy Andreu stool. The painting A Leak in the Storm is by Lucy Ralph. 101 CPH pendant light. Stele by RoWin’ Atelier (Scène Ouverte). Sculpture by Antoine Martinon (Aurélien Gendras). Selection of vases by Studio Collected. Gouged bronze bowl by Mathieu Delacroix. Marcelle tube lamp by Clément Pasquier. Alessi ashtray. Rug from Layered. The period moldings had to be preserved given these restrictions; no matter, they proved to be an asset for the duo. “We chose to highlight them and they became a motif of the apartment; they make a statement. The constraint of having to keep them led to aesthetic choices,” they explain. Working within the parameters set by French authorities, Deschodt and Le Griffon played on the duality between the original classicism of the space and a more contemporary style. The aim was to create a home that would work both for entertaining and also when the owner wanted some time to himself. “He wanted to be able to recharge his batteries by spending a few days alone here each month, but he also wanted to be able to entertain guests whenever necessary.” Among the other features shaping the renovation was a garden, measuring roughly 1,450 square feet, which needed to be redesigned.The majestic entrance sets the tone. Armchair by Ricardo Fasanello (Brazil Modernist), Art Deco screen (House of Barcia), Louis Sognot floor lamp (AT Bauer), and Morgane Pasqualini vase. The kitchen opens onto the rest of the home. Candleholder by Eric Schmitt (Galerie Jais), wall lamp by Koge, armchair (House of Barcia), stool by Gilles Derain for Zanotta (Galerie Parallèle), and glasses by Dior (Studio Collected). “Starting with the entrance, we staged the arrival with a large carpet to create a theatrical atmosphere.” The kitchen was then designed like a framed work of art: its moldings surrounded the furniture selected by the duo. “You can see the moldings running down to the floor. Since we had to design around them, we responded to this constraint by creating a space with very high ceilings, clean lines, and simple materials such as stainless steel and marble.” A contemporary practical touch came in the form of a bar where people can gather and relax, to the delight of the owner.Even with the moldings left in place, the kitchen has a very contemporary feel. Gilles Derain stool for Zanotta (Galerie Parallèle), Mogane Pasqualini vase, Dior Maison glasses (Studio Collected), Josef Hoffman bowl (House of Barcia), and bowl (Galerie Jais). A selection of objects from Studio Collected. Folié wall lamp (Francois Bazin) and 101 CPH pendant lamp. Calacatta Viola marble (MDY). Floral arrangement (Saison Paris). Raw, expressive materials give the space a modern yet welcoming feel. Inès Deschodt and Johanne Le Griffon designed the wine rack. Eugène chair (Clément Pasquier), Garouste and Bonetti bowl (Galerie Jais), and a selection of objects (Studio Collected). In the apartment’s enfilade series of spaces, a more formal dining room adjoins the kitchen. Framed by large, molded doorways, it lends a sense of grandeur to the home. To capitalize on these unique features, Deschodt and Le Griffon once again played with the room’s layout adding a large contemporary black wooden table, a bench, and sculptural chairs. “We wanted the rooms for entertaining to be unusual, while remaining timeless,” they explain.With its dark curved sofa, faux-fur blanket, and stainless-steel table, the living room is the most rock-and-roll room of the house. The home’s decorative objects have all been carefully selected. Vase (Studio Collected), gouged bronze bowl by Mathieu Delacroix (Collection Particulière). “A little more rock, a little more chill,” the designers say about the living room, which extends an invitation to kick back. Note the painted floor and the objects deliberately placed on it to continue the theatrical sensibility of the house. “In the style of model Betty Catroux or Yves Saint Laurent, it’s like a tuxedo—classic and timeless,” the designers say. “We’re in Versailles, we’re working with classic French design, and breaking out of a rigid approach makes you feel more at home.” They also added a few curves with the sofa and coffee table, softening the lines of the moldings.The theatricality continues in the bedroom. Betty pendant lamp (Hauvette \u0026 Madani), pitcher (Maison Verrsen), Convergence of Passages by Lucy Ralph; screen (Clément Pasquier). Selection of objects (Studio Collected). The bedroom sits behind a hidden door. Sapelli wood veneer wall paneling, Michel Boyer stool (House of Barcia). Sculpture by Antoine Maurice. On the wall, an untitled work by Gaspard Girard d’Albissin. Bowl, Maison Verrsen. In contrast to the open living areas of the apartment, the bedroom is hidden behind two large, concealed doors in the bathroom. “Sort of like a contemporary version of the hidden doors you might find in the Palace of Versailles,” the designers say, as they took the owner’s desire for privacy very seriously. Access to the principal bathroom is only possible from the bedroom. “It’s really his own space,” they emphasize. They chose raw, contrasting materials, like the glass block screen from which you can glimpse movement behind. The Japanese-style pendant lights, which contrast with the warm Sapelli wood and stainless steel in the background, add an exotic touch to the room.The bedroom has been designed in the style of a hotel suite, fitting for its owner who travels frequently. Custom headboard (Studio Inès Deschodt \u0026 Johanne Le Griffon). Convergence of Passages by Lucy Ralph. Spotlights (Faustlight) and tray (The Socialite Family). Selection of objects (Studio Collected). Carpet (Stepevi). A sculptural stone desk faces a mirror. Torres floor lamp (CTO). Absentes chair by Eloi Schultz (La Lune Gallery). Vase by Christophe Pillet for Algorithme (Galerie Parallèle). Persona wall sculpture (Gaultier Rimbaud Joffard). Curtains by Pierre Frey. Silver travertine desk shelf (MDY). Alessi tableware. The electric blue carpet adds a bold intensity to the room. “We really wanted to give this space a unique identity to contrast with the moldings in the rest of the house. We created something quite straightforward, with clean lines,” the designers explain. Facing the garden, the bed boasts a large headboard and offers a view of nature. In fact, the room has a welcoming hotel-like style, fitting for the owner who is a frequent traveler. A dressing room behind the bed allows for easy circulation around the room, and a silver travertine desk adds a touch of sculptural elegance.The bathroom is a light-filled space. Silhouette, a sculpture in bronze, is by Laurence Bonnel (Scène Ouverte). Ceramic 1970 (Studio Collected). Custom mirror (Studio Inès Deschodt \u0026 Johanne Le Griffon). Spotlights (Faustlight). Curated objects add to the home’s theatricality. Dynamic Frames, by Gaultier Rimbaud Joffard, Gisèle floor lamp (Clément Pasquier), silver pitcher (Studio Collected), and Alba pendant lamp (Contain). Calacatta Viola marble (MDY). The hallway leading to the bathroom is a passage from shadow to light, with deep blue carpeted flooring. Keops chair (Galerie Jais). Dome wall lamp (Francois Bazin). Behind a set of doors, a hallway with a deliberately mysterious atmosphere leads to the bathroom. “It’s like a wooden box, very private and very dark, and it transports you to a completely different atmosphere.” Indeed, the bathroom with its light colors and polished concrete contrasts dramatically with the hallway that leads to it. Its molded shell is instead reminiscent of the apartment’s rooms designed for entertaining with a “voluptuous, warm” spirit, and the hanging mirrors continue the home’s theatrical flair. Finally, the Calacatta marble provides a warm touch while subtly complementing the painting on the wall. As you explore, the space reveals its secrets gradually, without ever giving everything away and always retaining an air of mystery—just like a gripping theatrical performance.This Versailles apartment was originally published by AD France.
