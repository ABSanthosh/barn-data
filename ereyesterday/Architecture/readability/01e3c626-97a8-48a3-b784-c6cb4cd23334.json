As the boundaries of architectural visualization continue to expand, so too does the Vision Awards jury. This year, Architizer welcomes a powerhouse panel of visual storytellers — founders, directors, artists, and educators — who are redefining how architecture is seen before it’s built. From cinematic renderings to conceptual portraits, their work demonstrates that great visualization is not just about realism, but about resonance: the ability to capture a feeling, provoke a reaction, and communicate a story that transcends the page or screen. Start Vision Award Spanning global studios, major practices, and award-winning independent platforms, this jury brings a rare mix of creative rigor, technical mastery and cultural insight to the table. Their influence is shaping the visual language of the built environment — and now, they’ll help select the next generation of visionary image-makers at the 2025 Architizer Vision Awards.
