  "text": "X+Living brings retro gaming aesthetics into Top Toy’s first storeX+Living takes over the design of the first global flagship store of TOP TOY, located on Shanghai’s Nanjing East Road, introducing a ‘gamified design approach’ to retail. Drawing from pixelated gaming aesthetics, classic consoles, modular building blocks, and bold color schemes of red, blue, and purple, the space features oversized toy-packaging facades to create an interactive and immersive environment. The store’s open visual pathways and game-map layout encourage exploration and engagement. Functional zones, including IP-themed cafés and brick-building areas, mimic gaming quests and reinforce the interactive experience while strengthening the brand’s identity and enhancing offline retail’s role as a social hub.all images courtesy of X+Livingentering TOP TOY store mimics entering large-scale packaged toysFor the design of TOP TOY’s first global flagship store in Shanghai, architectural studio X+Living adopts a dynamic, playful approach. The external facade features a large-scale toy-packaging design with irregular transparent display windows, creating a visually striking entrance. A prominent TOP TOY character, the Great Power Fortune Cat, is displayed at an exaggerated scale, establishing a recognizable landmark and inviting exploration. The interplay of vivid colors and open sightlines act as a loading screen, setting the stage for a ‘gamified’ retail experience.Inside, the spatial design reflects the aesthetics of classic red-and-white gaming consoles. Rather than relying solely on nostalgia, the design deconstructs and reinterprets familiar elements to create a connection across multiple generations. Modern visual elements ensure relevance for younger audiences while maintaining an aesthetic continuity that appeals to all ages.oversized toy-packaging facades create an immersive storefrontX+Living arranges game map layout for TOP TOY flagship storeGaming-inspired modularity informs the TOP TOY flagship store’s layout, with rectangular elements derived from gaming consoles forming display platforms, shelving, and seating arrangements. The design integrates brand identity through elements inspired by TOP TOY’s game ‘China Bricks,’ arranging modular units in varied configurations. Transparent columns and staggered display platforms resemble the plastic texture of retro games, creating an open, layered visual experience. On the ceiling, a grid of perforated trusses is interspersed with mirrors, reflecting and inverting the space. The central staircase serves as a focal point, connecting multiple levels and reinforcing the sense of vertical exploration akin to progressing through game levels.The layout mirrors a game map, with interconnected pathways guiding visitors through different sections. A zigzag circulation pattern on the first floor ensures smooth movement and product accessibility, while a circular route on the second floor avoids rigid layouts. X+Living’s design aims to create a multi-dimensional consumer experience that blends aesthetics, engagement, and brand identity.large-scale toy-packaging facade features irregular transparent display windowsa pixel-inspired aesthetic connects gaming and retaila bold color scheme of red, blue, and purple defines the spaceopen visual pathways guide visitors through a game-like layout",
