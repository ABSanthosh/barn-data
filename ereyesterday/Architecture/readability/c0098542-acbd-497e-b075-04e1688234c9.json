  "text": "Whether your latest carpet stain resulted from a Merlot mishandling or a Chardonnay snafu, your first reaction is often sheer panic—followed by frantic googling for “homemade carpet cleaner.” Not only is a DIY carpet cleaner made from common household ingredients ideal when you’re in a bind, it’s also often more cost effective and just as powerful as a store-bought alternative. What’s more, the premade solutions can be made from harsh chemicals, which can be hard on carpets. To that end, we spoke to carpet cleaning pros to find the best DIY carpet cleaner recipes you can feel good about using on your next stain. The following guide from AD tells you exactly how to mix up, use, and store the best homemade carpet cleaners. Here’s what you need to get started.What do you need to make a homemade carpet cleaner?You can make the best carpet cleaner solution at home using only simple household ingredients you likely already have on hand—things like dish soap, which breaks down grease and grime; vinegar, which neutralizes odors and helps lift stains; and baking soda, which absorbs moisture and deodorizes.Simple household ingredients like baking soda and vinegar can create an effective carpet cleaner.

Which ingredients you’ll need depends on the type of stain you’re trying to remove. From there, the steps to create the DIY carpet cleaner are the same.These recipes work wonders on mild to moderate stains, such as acidic stains (milk, juice, soda, etc.), mud, and dirt. “When you have deep set-in stains like dye, paint, or biohazards, it’s time to call the professionals,” says Sheppard.Ingredients:For a general purpose carpet cleaner2 teaspoons of baking soda2 tablespoons of dish soap2–3 drops of essential oil (optional, for scent only)2 cups of hot water2 tablespoons of white vinegarFor a carpet cleaner that removes grease and oil4 tablespoons of baking soda2 teaspoons of dish soap2–3 drops of essential oil (optional, for scent only)2 cups of hot wat erFor a carpet cleaner that removes organic stains (pet waste, blood, etc.)2 cups of hydrogen peroxide (3%)2 teaspoons of dish soap2 teaspoons of baking sodaHow to make a homemade carpet cleanerStep one: Add all ingredient to a plastic tub or basin.Step two: Using a large spoon or spatula, mix the ingredients until combined.Step three: Pour the solution into your carpet cleaner, following the manufacturer’s instruction. Set some of the solution aside for spot cleaning with a spray bottleHow to clean carpets with a homemade carpet cleanerFill your carpet cleaner with your homemade solution or apply directly to stains with a spray bottle. Photo: Andrey Popov/Getty ImagesWhether you’re deep cleaning an area rug or all the carpet in your home, there are a few simple steps to follow.Step One: Vacuum the areaBefore using a DIY carpet cleaner, vacuum thoroughly. This will clear away dust and prevent debris from being worked further into the carpet. “You may need to do it multiple times. Whatever the case, the carpet needs to be free of dust and other particles,” says Rinea Blanchard, owner of Superior Contract Cleaning.Step Two: Do a spot testYou never know how your specific carpet fibers will react to a carpet cleaner you haven’t used before. Apply your DIY cleaner to a small, hidden area with a spray bottle, and check for colorfastness before applying it to your entire carpet.Step Three: Spot-clean tough stainsStubborn stains, such as pet urine and oils, benefit from concentrated treatment before you use your carpet cleaning machine. Pour your DIY carpet cleaning solution into a spray bottle and apply it to areas with visibly hard stains. Make sure not to overspray or soak the intended work area, and allow the solution several minutes to work. Blot—don’t scrub!—the area with a fresh microfiber cloth until it dries. (A clean rag or paper towels also work.)Tough stains often require spot cleaning.

For most machines, you’ll detach the tank and fill it about three quarters of the way full or until the solution reaches the level indicator. However, it’s best to follow the manufacturer’s instructions.Step Five: Clean the carpetClean your carpet according to the manufacturer’s instructions for your machine. Generally, you’ll pull the trigger to spray water onto the carpet while pushing the cleaner forward and back, focusing on one manageable area at a time. Release the trigger to suction up dirt and water with dry passes over the same area. Alternate wet and dry passes until no more water is pulled up as you work across the carpet. For heavily soiled areas, repeat the process for a deeper clean.Step Six: Air dryWait until the carpet dries completely. Also, tell guests and others who live in the home where carpets have been freshly cleaned so they can stay off of the area or walk extra carefully.How to store homemade carpet cleanerHomemade cleaners typically last about five to seven days when stored properly, according to Sheppard. Use an airtight glass or plastic container and keep it in a cool place. Label the container with the ingredients and the date for easy reference.Some mixtures, especially those containing peroxide, lose their effectiveness after 48 hours. Similarly, vinegar and dish soap solutions gradually weaken over time. To prevent waste, prepare only what you need for the task at hand.What can’t be mixed to make a homemade carpet cleanerNever assume that just because ingredients are available over the counter, they’re safe to mix. Certain combinations can quickly turn your homemade carpet cleaning solution into a chemistry experiment gone wrong. Always avoid the following combinations:Vinegar and hydrogen peroxide: These ingredients react to create peracetic acid, which off-gasses fumes that are considered toxic and can cause burning of the nose, throat, and respiratory tract.Vinegar and bleach: These mix to create chlorine gas, which is dangerous even at low levels. Exposure to this gas can cause respiratory problems and other bodily irritations.Vinegar and baking soda: While exposure is not dangerous, this one is contradictory. The baking soda neutralizes the acidic vinegar, providing the cleaning power of normal water. It’s also possible that the buildup of carbon dioxide could cause its container to explode if stored for a long time.Frequently asked questionsWhat are the toughest stains to remove from a carpet?Experts agree red wine, pet stains, and coffee are the toughest stains to get out of a carpet. “All of them penetrate deep into the fibers and, if left untreated, cause odor and discoloration,” says Vince Cedric Nolasco, a cleaning expert at Hellamaid. Any oil-based stains are also likely to cause trouble, according to Deep Johal, owner of Sunny Side Clean Team. “These stains sink deeper into the fibers, making them even harder to lift,” he said.These tough stains may require their own DIY solutions and cleaning techniques. Consider the following:Red wine: “Blot the spillage immediately and apply a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and dish soap to weaken the pigment,” says Barbara Stern, textile and cleaning expert at Ottoman Textiles.Pet urine: Sheppard’s organic stain recipe is a great DIY option for pet accidents since hydrogen peroxide oxidizes and breaks down organic stains, dish soap lifts remaining residue, and baking soda neutralizes odor. However, if this doesn’t work, an enzyme-based, store-bought cleaner is another option.Ink: “Ink stains should be treated using rubbing alcohol, applying gently using a cloth,” adds Stern.How can you reduce the frequency of deep cleaning a carpet?The best way to cut down on carpet cleaning is vacuuming slow and often, according to experts. It’s easy to rush this mundane task, but the slower you go, the more dirt you lift. Remove your shoes indoors, which drastically reduces oil and grit tracked onto the carpet. Finally, spot-clean stains immediately. “The longer a stain is being given to admire its own beauty, the harder it becomes to remove,” said Johal.Do vinegar and Dawn clean carpet?Yes, vinegar and Dawn dish soap are effective for cleaning simple dirt and mud stains out of carpet. For deeper-penetrating stains, such as wine, blood, or pet accidents, you’ll want additional cleaning agents in your homemade carpet stain remover.",
