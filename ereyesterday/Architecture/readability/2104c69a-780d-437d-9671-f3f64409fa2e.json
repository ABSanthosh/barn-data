  "text": "Acclaimed children’s furniture brand Whitney Brothers® recently introduced the elevatED™ Collection, a new line of furniture that embraces a fresh contemporary style, unique materials and flexible modularity to furnish dynamic learning environments for young learners.  The elevatED™ Collection comprises 46 individual and modular pieces for young learner activities including art, STEM/sensory, literacy development, play, tables, seating, lockers, and classroom storage. The wide range of furniture items can furnish a complete classroom that supports the specialized developmental needs of infant/toddler, preschool and kindergarten aged children. A coordinating workstation and organizer cabinets for the teacher complete a smartly composed look.  The design ethos of the elevatED™ Collection is sophisticated chic and thoroughly modern. Each piece is constructed in textured white oak and white melamine structural elements that form crisp, pleasing lines with refined contrasting color accents. Brushed nickel legs add design counterpoint and rich visual interest. Each piece is flexible, mobile or modular to enable furnishing a dynamic learning environment for young learners completely within the elevated™ Collection.  (Courtesy Whitney Brothers) Technical attributes of the collection include FSC certified wood material and Eco-Certified Composite (ECC) certification, an exemplary commitment to sustainability and environmental stewardship. The finish on each piece includes proven antimicrobial properties, an important attribute that contributes to the health of young children.  K-12 educational facilities today are focused on creating dynamic learning environments that challenge students to develop new skills and interests, promote collaboration, inspire curiosity and develop critical thinking skills to improve education outcomes. Whitney Brothers® is one of many education furniture producers that have embraced this concept by designing products that are flexible, agile, reflect real-world use and adapt to students’ varied learning styles.  “The elevatED™ Collection is a stylish, modern expression of how early education furniture can play a central role in creating a dynamic learning environment for our youngest learners,” said Mike Jablonski, president of Whitney Brothers®. “It’s another great example of the fresh design thinking behind the Whitney Brothers® brand and illustrates our commitment to furnish learning environments that inspire and engage.”  Availability of the elevatED™ Collection is immediate through authorized Whitney Brothers® dealers and distributors worldwide. The collection will be displayed in the company’s exhibit at the November 6 –9 at the NAEYC Annual Conference in Anaheim, California and November 12–14 at the EDspaces Conference in Houston.",
