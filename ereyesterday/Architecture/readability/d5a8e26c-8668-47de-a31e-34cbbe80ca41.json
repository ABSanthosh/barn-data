However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.If you’re prone to coughing and sneezing indoors, your air quality could be to blame—and that’s where the best air purifiers come in. While home appliances like humidifiers are helpful to regulate humidity and decrease certain allergy symptoms, air purifiers will rid your space of airborne dust mites, pesky dander, and other airborne pollutants that can also cause flare-ups. And considering how unpredictable the weather and natural disasters like wildfires can be, having one of these powerful appliances on deck can help ensure the air you breathe is clear of anything harmful. Health aside, an air purifier can rid your home of cooking smells and make the air fresher overall.We put several leading air purifiers to the test to find out which ones truly deserve the title of best. During our testing process, we considered the different types of air purifiers and what to keep in mind when shopping for one, from area coverage to filter replacements. Plus, most of the models in our homes are available on Amazon if you need one shipped quickly. We’ve even selected a few with contemporary designs that, aside being easy on the eyes, can also make great housewarming gifts. Ahead, discover the editor-favorite air purifiers that came out on top, complete with thorough reviews based on our experiences.Our Top Picks for the Best Air Purifiers:Best Overall Air Purifier: Coway Airmega True HEPA Purifier, $225Best Runner-Up Air Purifier: Coway Airmega 250 Smart Air Purifier, $319 $290Most Versatile Air Purifier: Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool Formaldehyde, $806Best Budget Air Purifier: Clorox Smart Medium Room Air Purifier, $120 $100Most Customizable Air Purifier: Rabbit Air A3 Ultra Quiet Air Purifier, $750If you’d like to learn more about a specific type of air purifier or unpack even more benefits about these small appliances in our FAQ section, you can click one of the following jumplinks.Browse by Category:Our Favorites | Air purifiers for small spaces | Air purifiers for larger spaces | Multifunctional air purifiers | FAQsOur FavoritesBest Overall: Coway Airmega True HEPA PurifierCoway Airmega AP-1512HH(W) True HEPA PurifierTester: Nashia Baker, senior commerce editorMy space: Overall, my space has pretty standard air quality—I typically like opening my windows for some circulation, but it’s less ideal during the changing seasons when dust and allergens get inside from the trees in the area. With wildfire smoke recently circulating the New York City air, any added protection with an air purifier is a major plus.Area coverage: This air purifier is designed to clean spaces up to 874 square feet, and I can confidently say that it does its job well. I usually place it right in the middle of my home to circulate through the space, but since some areas of my home are more tucked away, I also like to move it to specific spots that could use some extra love.Filter replacements: Replacement filters cost $70. The manufacturer suggests replacing the HEPA carbon filters every 12 months to remove odors and gases from the air.My experience: I’ve been using this air purifier for the last few months, and its quality is second to none. First off, the setup was simple. Coway’s included printed instructions were easy to follow, and after placing the HEPA filter inside, the hard cover snapped in place seamlessly. The HEPA filter itself has a four-stage filtration design: Pre-filter, Deodorization filter, True HEPA filter, Vital Ion. I’ve appreciated this thorough filtration process since it’s made to capture up to 99.97% of even the smallest of particles, like pollen and allergens that can come in my space during spring blooms.Like the Coway Airmega 250 Smart Air Purifier Mafi tested below, this air purifier turns on quietly. So much so that I can hardly tell it’s on most of the time. While it comes with three speeds to help thoroughly clean the air, I always keep the air purifier on auto mode. This is a favorite feature of mine, as it automatically detects the air quality through three LED light modes: blue (good), purple (moderate), and red (unhealthy). Whenever there’s a change in the air quality, like if I’m cooking, the LED light adjusts to either purple or red and the air purifier picks up its speed to quickly regulate it. Usually in just a matter of minutes, the LED light changes back to blue and the air purifier goes back to a whisper-quiet sound. When the purifier doesn’t detect any air pollution at all for half an hour, it’ll automatically switch into eco mode, which is an amazing tech feature for energy savings.Lastly, the overall design of this air purifier is a big standout for modern spaces. Since this is a slightly bigger home appliance (larger than a standard space heater but much smaller than an HVAC), I didn’t want it to be an eyesore in my space. I have it in the white colorway, but you can shop it in the black too.The bottom line: Coming in at less than $250, I highly recommend this air purifier to anyone who is looking for powerful air cleaning qualities, great smart technology, and a more affordable option to shop. It was bigger than I expected, but thankfully it comes with a hidden carry handle that makes it easy to move around my space. Like most air purifiers, this one has a corded design, so just make sure you have an outlet handy wherever you place it in your home.Runner-Up: Coway Airmega 250 Smart Air PurifierCoway Airmega 250 Smart Air PurifierTester: Nick Mafi, senior features editorMy space: Luckily, the air quality in my home is pretty good and I don’t smoke nor do I live with any animals. I will say that I live in Brooklyn and my windows face a street. So, naturally, some dust from the street does find its way into my apartment.Area coverage: My apartment is 814 square feet and I have the air purifier unit located in the center of the apartment, next to a wall. At this size, the purifier can and does cycle and clean the air that spans the entirety of the space. (It can clean air in large spaces up to 930 square feet.)Filter replacements: New filters cost about $79 and replacing the pre-filter (the first of four filters) is very simple. You simply pull the washable pre-filter out of the device, clean it, allow it to properly dry, then slide it back into place.My experience: My experience with the air purifier to date has been a very good one. When turned on, it is very quiet. This is important because I typically turn the unit on while having friends over for dinner. I do this to create an extra level of protection in my apartment during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the noise level of the product is important, so as not to drone out people speaking at the table. Fortunately, it’s not an issue with this machine. The design of the product is great too. It almost looks like a fancy, sort of futuristic speaker. In fact, it’s turned into a bit of a dinner table conversation, as people often don’t immediately guess that it’s a purifier.In terms of the technology, Coway’s unit has a four filtration system, which in and of itself is kind of incredible. I mean, how often do we get four layers of protection for anything? The first layer is for the larger dust particles or pet hairs. Then, the second layer involves capturing the small particles that made it through. The third layer is carbon activated, which means it can extract carbon dioxide and other harmful chemicals from the air. The fourth and final layer involves the capturing and containment of viruses and bacteria.In terms of smart features, I was impressed with how I could control everything from the tap of a button on my smartphone. The app also allows me to set a timer for the duration that I’d like the purifier to stay on, while also providing a detailed report on the air quality in real-time.The bottom line: I would recommend this air cleaner to anyone who is in the market. At this time, when clean air in your home is so important, this air purifier is a must for those who can afford it. I think the fact that this filter involves four layers of protection, and that the fourth actually contains and extracts 99.999% of viruses and bacteria is phenomenal. All the more so that it can do it in the midst of a global pandemic. And as we are starting to learn how to “live” with the pandemic as part of our daily lives, having a state of the art air purifying system is all the more important. By paying $350, you are providing you and your family the safety and security to invite friends and family to your house, with much needed peace of mind too.Most Versatile: Dyson Purifier Humidify+Cool FormaldehydeDyson Purifier Humidify+Cool FormaldehydeTester: Rachel Fletcher, commerce directorMy space: I have pretty intense dust and fragrance allergies and I work from home a lot these days with a large dog in an old building. It’s not an exceptionally dusty space, but we live on a block with a decent amount of car traffic and I’m pretty much always obsessing about the air quality. If I start sneezing or waking up with a sore throat, I want answers!Area coverage: The Humidify+Cool is meant to work in a single room at a time (it was previously tested by Dyson in an 81 cubic feet chamber), and I placed it in my bedroom, which is the smallest room in my home.Filter replacements: Filter replacements cost $79.99 and it’s recommended that they be replaced once every year. Installing them initially was quite quick–they snapped into place fairly easily.My experience: It’s rare to find a machine that can purify your air, humidify it, and cool down a space all in one–so I was impressed right off the bat. An update to earlier Dyson models, this machine does all that and aside from getting rid of the usual particles, it also removes formaldehyde (which can cause even more irritation to your eyes and throat) from the air.The Humidify+Cool has a HEPA filtration system and a separate carbon filter detects formaldehyde. I guess it could be due in part to my obsession with clean air, but, so far, the Dyson has reported good air quality every time I’ve checked in–the only exceptions being after I’ve lit candles or cooked something on the stovetop. But when the air quality has dipped below ideal levels, it doesn’t seem to take much time for the purifier to do the job once I turn up the fan speed (it should be noted that this model also has an auto purify setting that will kick into high gear if the quality dips, but it is a little loud for my taste so I tend to keep it on a lower setting).While I hate having an app for literally every device in my home, installing the Dyson Link app really did make installation a snap. And I love being able to check in on the air stats (temperature, particle level, humidity level, etc) whenever I want. You can also control the fan speed, oscillation range, and set timers from the app.As for specific features I appreciate, filling the water tank from the top is a huge plus and it’s large enough that it doesn’t have to be refilled every day. I also appreciate the night mode setting, which makes everything a little quieter and less bright.What I would change: This may be a misconception about the purpose of a humidifier, but I am used to really intense humidifiers that emit visible plumes of moist steam all night long. This is not that. The humidity that the Dyson model generates in the house is definitely a healthy and reasonable level (most sources recommend 30–50% humidity, and the Dyson, at its max humidity setting, hovers around 60%), but if you are like me and want more targeted humidity in the super dry winter months, this is not the machine for you and you might want to stick to separate devices for purifying, humidifying, and cooling.The bottom line: Aside from the note above, this is a really expensive device, coming in at more than $800. That said, it might actually save you money in the long run if you don’t want to buy a purifier, a fan, and a humidifier individually and you want a powerful device for each activity. I’d recommend it if you have deep pockets and not a ton of challenging air pollution situations to combat on the regular.Best Budget Pick: Clorox Smart Medium Room Air PurifierClorox Smart Air PurifierTester: Andrea Lewis, assistant to the global editorial directorMy space: I have allergies and live in an old building that generates dust easily, so I am very sensitive to air quality. This makes me particularly focused on reducing allergens and dust in my living space; especially in my bedroom, which is smaller and where the air is noticeably less fresh.Area coverage: The Clorox Smart Medium Room Air Purifier is designed for medium-sized rooms. It works best in spaces up to 1,000 square feet, but it can clean the air up to five times per hour in a room as small as 225 square feet, which is ideal for my needs.Filter replacements: In terms of replacement filters, the Clorox 12030 Medium Room Replacement Filter is what’s recommended and should be replaced every 6 to 12 months. It’s straightforward to swap out, ensuring the air purifier runs at optimal efficiency.My experience: The purifier runs quietly, which is a bonus for using it in a bedroom like I do. It has a three-stage filtration system with a 360° design, including a True HEPA filter that captures 99.97% of allergens and particulates, along with viruses and bacteria. I especially appreciate the smart features, such as Alexa voice integration, which allows me to control the device with my voice or the app. The real-time air quality feedback with a color-coded display is also incredibly useful. Overall, the Clorox air purifier has performed exceptionally well in reducing dust in my space—I’ve even noticed that I don’t need to vacuum as often.The bottom line: I recommend this air purifier, especially to those with allergies or concerns about dust and air quality in their homes. It’s effective, smart, and well worth the price for peace of mind and fresher air.Most Customizable: Rabbit Air A3 Ultra Quiet Air PurifierRabbit Air A3 Ultra Quiet Air PurifierTester: Steven John, contributorThe space: I got our home’s first air purifier back in 2018, hoping it would help scrub the air of some pollen and pet dander (first a Molekule Air Pro, then adding an ALEN Breathesmart to the mix). Then 2020 hit. By the summer of 2020, we had six or seven air purifiers running in the house at all times. Today, most of our air purifiers have been donated, and I’m back to being primarily concerned with pollen, pets, dust, and smoke (a problem that is only going to get worse in the foreseeable future) when it comes to indoor air quality.Area coverage: The A3 Ultra Quiet is rated to fully refresh the air in a space measuring 1,030 square feet, twice per hour. Though do note that, as with all air purifiers, its effective coverage size is considered to be smaller for allergy sufferers.Filter replacements: You can buy filter replacements here for just under $100. While many air purifier filters need to be swapped out every six months, this one can last up to two years.My experience: My first thought on powering on the A3 is that Rabbit Air isn’t kidding then they say this air purifier is quiet. In fact, when set to a “silent” operating speed, it’s literally quieter than a whisper. And at night, thanks to a built-in light sensor, it reduces its lights (which can change color to represent air quality in real time) fading away into a dim, barely-audible device one could easily forget was even there.In terms of actually using the device, it’s an easy setup and familiarization process. You can pretty much start using it right out of the box—all you need to do is discard the packing materials and then pop the front panel off the air purifier, exposing the filters inside that need to have protective film removed. On the control panel, you will find air quality indicators, filter status info, and your Wi-Fi connectivity status.Because this is a fully smart air purifier that you can control remotely in real time via a phone or tablet app, you can also get all the info you’d ever want about your indoor air quality via the Rabbit Air app, available for download at both the Google Play and Apple app stores.The bottom line: When the Rabbit Air A3 is running, the air in your home will be cleaner—you can count on that based on the intense testing and product comparisons the company runs, not to mention the five-year warranty offered. You can also tell the air is cleaner because it will smell that way, and I don’t just mean a reduction in unwanted odors (though that’s a welcome fact here)—I mean you will literally experience the odor of fresher air, much like going outdoors on a clear, breezy day.

Throughout that week and beyond, the small but mighty Airmega 150 (the brand’s entry-level option) has been a lifesaver.Area coverage: This air purifier is designed to clean spaces up to 214 square feet in just over 12 minutes and up to 518 square feet in 30 minutes. I use it in the living room of my ~500 square foot apartment and even when it’s dealing with something noxious like bleach, it will usually only take up to 20 minutes to clear chemicals and foul smells. Cooking smells might linger on, FYI, so this isn’t a cure-all for that sort of thing, but I find it most effective with especially potent odors (like candles, cleaning products, andFilter replacements: Two sets of replacement filters cost $40. The manufacturer recommends replacing the odor filter every six months and the HEPA filter once a year (and the device will remind you when you need to make those changes), though I’ve found that vacuuming the pre-filter helps with stretching that window of time between filter changes even further.My experience: I picked it because of its stylish Dieter Rams-esque design. It looks more like a speaker than a traditional cylindrical air purifier, which I love, and works really well, too, without needing a lot of maintenance.Over the year or so that I’ve owned it, it has helped immensely with keeping my small apartment free of cooking smells, the cigarette smoke that wafts in from the apartment downstairs (don’t ask), and generally helping clean up some of the dust that seems to accumulate there readily. It’s also fairly quiet unless your air levels have set off one of the more intensive settings programmed—a color-coded system (blue, green, yellow, and red) tells you just how bad your current air quality is. It helpfully includes a HEPA air filter, odor filter, and pre-filter, and though it doesn’t come with a remote or app for switching things up from afar, I kinda love not having to think about a whole ‘nother piece of equipment.Bottom line: I would wholeheartedly recommend this air purifier to anyone looking for a budget air purifier that won’t cramp your style. This one has been a pretty invaluable addition to my home.Blueair Blue Pure 411i MaxBLUEAIR Blue 411i Max Air PurifierTester: Lizzie Soufleris, visuals editorMy space: My living situation is absolutely rife with dust: I live in a century-old apartment building right next to an elevated subway track with two wonderful cats, and their not-so-wonderful litter boxes. Our gas stove is hood-less and sits right next to our gas-powered washer-dryer. Beyond all of that, my partner and I have a penchant for buying dusty antiques nearly every time we leave the city.Area coverage: The Blue Pure 411i Max is optimized for “small spaces,” touting a suggested range of 219–526 square feet. I tested it in my 13x13 living/dining room (which clocks in well below the maximum square footage).Filter replacements: Blueair offers 2 options for filter replacements: A single filter for $39.99, or a two-pack with a replacement subscription for $50.98. Each filter lasts 6-9 months, and the Blueair app alerts you when it is time to switch over to a new one.My experience: I hate downloading apps onto my phone. And I especially hate appliances that are rendered useless without their accompanying app. Thankfully, the Blue Pure Max 411i works its magic with or without it (the app is an optional addition for some extra functionality).In the app (I downloaded it for testing purposes), you can create a schedule, set the purifier to automatically switch modes at different times of the day, set a “child lock,” and change the brightness of the LED display (a perfect feature for people with purifiers in the bedroom). Beyond changing settings, the app gives an overview of the level of air pollution in your space and alerts the user when it is time to change filters. While I can’t say I’ve noticed a palpable difference in the quality of the air in my apartment, I’m sure the HEPA filter is removing plenty of imperceptible pollutants. That peace of mind is good enough for me!What I would change: In a perfect world, I would be able to find a purifier that blends in with my collection of midcentury furniture, rather than one that screams “I AM AN AIR PURIFIER”—but alas. When it comes to aesthetics, the Blueair models are totally fine, and better than most–they’re sleek and minimal, and likely blend in more easily with modern decor.For a purifier specifically aimed at small spaces, the Blue Max 411i is not exactly miniature. At 19 inches tall, with a 10-inch diameter, it’s a tad bulky, especially when placed in an optimal location for purifying.The bottom line: Overall, I am very happy to have this purifier in my space! In the age of global pandemics and unpredictable environmental factors, we can all stand to benefit from some cleaner air. Though slightly bulky, the Blue Max 411i is extremely easy to use, relatively affordable, and almost completely inaudible. For me, it’s a fantastic set-it-and-forget-it air quality solution!Coway Airmega 100Coway Airmega 100 Air PurifierTester: Lila Allen, associate director, AD PROMy space: As long as I’ve lived in New York City, I’ve struggled with a general feeling of ick around my home. Dust, pollen (especially during open-window season), and pollution from traffic have all been challenges. And with a cat in the mix, there’s also pet dander, fur, and litter box odors to contend with. Diligent cleaning gets me pretty far, but doesn’t resolve all of these issues.Area coverage: This model covers up to 810 square feet in an hour. I focused it in one area of my home—the bedroom—where pet odors and pollution were the biggest blights.Filter replacements: A replacement filter runs just shy of $40. Filters last for up to a year, and Coway recommends vacuuming them periodically. I didn’t need to replace mine during my testing window, but it’s very easy to swap out whenever it comes time—you just flip the unit upside down, untwist the top, pull out the old filter, and slide in your new one.My experience: The Airmega 100 runs right about the size of a breadbox, at 15 1/2\" tall and a diameter of 8 3/4\". The cylindrical body (which intakes air from all directions) is inoffensive, if slightly conspicuous—it’s solid white, with functions integrated into a touchpad on a black top. An indicator detects particulate matter down to 2.5 microns, telling you about the state of your space in real time and illuminating blue when air quality is good, green when it’s moderate, orange when it’s unhealthy, and pink when it’s very unhealthy (which thankfully I never saw!). Airflow can adjust automatically based on air quality by using the device’s “Smart Mode.” If you’re bothered by glowing lights at night, good news: This model offers an amber-hued “night light” setting, or you can turn off lit features entirely.I tested this model over the course of about six months and definitely noticed a reduction in pet odors and dust during that time. (Bragging rights: I was told that the dust and dander in my room was “not bad at all” for someone with a cat by my movers this summer! I attribute that at least in part to this device.) The Airmega uses a three-stage system, with a vacuumable pre-filter, a HEPA filter, and a deodorization filter combining to clean and de-stinkify your room.The bottom line: This was a great product, and I think the price (around $130 at full retail) is fair for what you get. I’ve used other air purifiers where I’ve had to change filters all the time, so having one where I could “set it and forget it” was a plus. This unit is a solid option for someone living in an apartment and dealing with similar issues—mold, pollution, pet dander, and so on—or looking to neutralize some less-than-pleasant funk in a small to medium-sized space.Air purifiers for larger spacesLevoit Core 400S Smart True HEPA Air PurifierLevoit Core 400S Smart True HEPA Air PurifierTester: Rebecca Grambone, social media managerMy space: No matter how much I dust my bedroom in my apartment, the wooden floors always seem to get dusty the next day. I live with two other roommates and my bedroom is attached to a hallway that we all are constantly walking through to get to the bathroom or the laundry area. I’ve realized recently that having a bedroom near a “high traffic” area of the apartment may be the culprit behind my dust issue, especially if people are walking through after having been outside.Area coverage: The effective range of the air purifier is 403 square feet and can be used in larger areas, however purification will take longer. I used it in my bedroom, which is approximately 12 feet by 13.Filter replacements: The filter replacements for this particular model cost around $50. I haven’t had to replace my filter yet since it lasts about 12 months. However, when you first take the air purifier out of its delivery packaging, you have to remove the filter from a plastic covering and place it back in the purifier. I found this process super simple since all you have to do is twist the bottom portion of the purifier off, remove the filter, put the cleaned filter (or a new one) back in, and then twist the bottom portion back on.My experience: After about a week using the air purifier in my bedroom (along with regular dusting), I noticed that I wasn’t waking up with puffy eyes anymore. This may sound cliché, but the air in my room felt crisper and definitely cleaner. I specifically liked the Auto Mode feature that adjusts the fan settings automatically based on the current air quality in the room. I also appreciated the Sleep Mode feature that keeps the air purifier operating quietly by using an ultra low fan speed, this way I could use it throughout the night without the sound disrupting my sleep. I found it interesting that this air purifier has a 3-Stage Filtration system: the first is a pre-filter that captures larger particles such as dust and pet fur, the second is a H13 True HEPA filter that “captures at least 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 microns in size,” and the third is a custom high-efficiency activated carbon filter that absorbs smoke, odors, and fumes. Each of these filters also serves the purpose of maximizing the filter’s life which I find makes this purifier a good investment.I was also impressed with other high-tech features such as the VeSync app, which allows you to control the air purifier from your smartphone by connecting it through Bluetooth. Having access to the app allows you to easily view the air quality in the room you have the air purifier set up in with words like “good” or “very good.” You can also view the air purifier’s filter life, as well as set up features such as “Auto Clean,” which turns the air purifier on automatically when the air quality is bad and “Auto Stop,” which automatically turns the air purifier off when the air quality is good. I also found it helpful that the app lets you view how long you’ve had the air purifier running as well as how much air has been purified. You can visibly see the job getting done!For someone who really isn’t that tech savvy, I found everything to be easily accessible. Sometimes products add all this extra tech just as a bonus, but I truly felt that each and every tech feature that this air purifier had to offer was functional and beneficial.What I would change: One downside of this air filter is that it’s definitely on the larger and bulkier side and you definitely need to have the space for it, especially since the manual recommends keeping it 15 inches from anything surrounding it.The bottom line: Overall, I found this air purifier very effective! I would recommend this specific product to anyone who is looking for more of a high-tech option that will definitely get the job done. However, you definitely have to have the space for it, as it is not a sleek and sexy option compared to other air purifiers on the market that are on the pricier side.Honeywell True HEPA Air Purifier for Large RoomsHoneywell HPA204 HEPA Air Purifier for Large RoomsTester: Sydney Gore, senior digital design editorThe space: My allergies have always made me a sensitive person in regards to air quality, but it wasn’t until I got sick from the smoke that spilled into New York from the Canada wildfires that I was pushed to invest in an air purifier. My apartment gets dusty despite all my efforts to keep it clean and that’s a much smaller space compared to an entire house in the suburbs—in addition to me and my parents, we have two cats and their fur gets caught on every surface.Area coverage: The dimensions of this model are 17.72 x 10.05 x 18.86 in and it was specifically designed for larger spaces to circulate and filter room air in a 310 square foot space. I set this up in the family room on the first level of my parents’ house since it’s an open floor plan and that zone gets the most foot traffic, especially from our cats.Filter replacements: Replacement filters for the HPA204 series will run you around $25 with the recommendation to replace filters annually (though I haven't gotten around to replacing mine just yet, it seems fairly simple to do so).My experience: My parents have always had Honeywell air purifiers around the house, which I didn’t notice until recently, so that felt like a strong indicator for me to trust the brand—they’re true to this, not new to this. The setup is pretty simple, but I unboxed everything to make sure that my parents would be good to go on their own when I’m not around. Within the first few days of using the HPA204, I felt like the air quality in that section of the house had improved. (We get a lot of dust and other miscellaneous particles downstairs so you can usually hear a lot of sneezing.) After three months, my dad actually likes this version more than his older Honeywell products so he has since moved it upstairs into his bedroom (a very strong endorsement)—I wouldn’t be surprised if he ordered more of them for the rest of the house. Also, the cats don’t seem to mind when it’s on and they’re the toughest critics out of all of us!Honeywell’s True HEPA Air Purifier uses an activated carbon pre-filter to help capture large airborne particles and reduce odors and VOCs. The filtration helps capture up to 99.97% of the following microscopic airborne allergens and particles: Dust, pollen, pet dander, dust mite debris, and smoke. It has three cleaning levels (high/medium/low) with a turbo setting that is supposed to be excellent for people with allergies, so essentially our entire household. I especially appreciate the silent operation and dimmer option, this is critical in the evenings.The bottom line: Honeywell is an OG air purifier and air conditioner brand, I would highly recommend any of their products. Did I forget to mention that they offer a five year warranty? Doesn't get classier than that. Also, this model earned the ENERGY STAR label by meeting strict energy efficient guidelines set by the U.S. EPA so seems pretty legit! The Gore family swears by it, what other approval do you need?Multifunctional air purifiersDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Air Purifier, Heater, and FanDyson Purifier Hot+Cool Air Purifier, Heater, and FanTester: Audrey Lee, commerce editorMy space: I’m always looking for ways to protect myself from anything that could flare up my eczema and dust allergies, but once pollen gets thrown into the mix, all bets are off. While I do a pretty good job of catching the visible aggressors with dusting and vacuuming around my house, it’s difficult to monitor microscopic allergens and airborne contaminants, so I’m usually left sniffling or itching during transitional seasons.Area coverage: Dyson’s Purifier Hot+Cool is great for medium to large rooms and can easily cover an area of up to 315 square ft (2860 cubic feet) if not more, according to tests conducted by Dyson. I kept mine in my bedroom, which is about 170 square feet.Filter replacements: Filter replacements run about $80 from Dyson, though cheaper alternatives do exist from outlets like Amazon (just know these off-brand versions have been reported to work to varying degrees). The filters easily snap into the chamber-like base of the purifier and Dyson recommends replacing your filters when you’re alerted by the app or every 12 months, whichever comes first.My experience: In addition to a small remote control, there’s also the Wifi-enabled Dyson Link app, which you can download to your smart device. I usually detest having to download an app to get the most out of my tech and appliances, though the Link app made setup a breeze; plus, if you own more Dyson home products it’s easy to manage them all in one place.The purifier itself works like a dream, and I noticed within a week of use that I felt noticeably less congested. The intuitive device uses a 360° filtration system that implements a combination of activated carbon to remove potentially harmful gases and odors from the air and a HEPA H13 filter to capture 99.97% of particles. I appreciated that the Hot+Cold has an auto mode, which continuously monitors room temperature and indoor air quality, while also running the fan or heat to the degree of your choosing.When you first turn on the purifier, it immediately starts assessing the surrounding air quality, and you can monitor any fluctuations in general air quality, particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10), volatile organic compounds usually from air sprays or aerosol (VOCs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as well as temperature and humidity. I was particularly fond of this feature and frequently looked at these charts to see how the levels would rise or decrease over long periods of time.Visually, the Dyson purifier definitely grabs attention with its sleek, modern design—a big draw to me when incorporating it into my space. Noise was never something that bothered me, though it emits louder sounds when the fan/heater is on a higher level or if it’s working to clean the air in a more polluted space. Besides its impressive air purification skills, the device doubles and triples as an oscillating smart fan and heater with adjustable airflow which I became hugely hooked on during winter (on account of some drafty windows in my room). With the ability to set your desired temperature, the heater can make a closed space feel noticeably warmer in very little time (my room size is average and I would say it took under 10 minutes).The bottom line: I really love this air purifier because I can feel and see it working (via the app). At $650 a pop, this air purifier is definitely a splurge. Are there other air purifiers out there that work just as well at a lower price point? Probably—but I would say it’s the combination of a high-quality air purifier, fan, and heater that make this one worth its price.Shark 3-in-1 Air Purifier, Heater \u0026 Fan with NanoSeal HEPAShark 3-in-1 Air Purifier, Heater \u0026 Fan with NanoSeal HEPATester: Mel Studach, AD PRO editorMy space: While I love the charming architectural details of my prewar rental in New York, I don’t necessarily love the old gas range and dated ventilation that came with it. My biggest air quality concerns generally come to mind when I’m cooking, so I always keep a nearby window open.Area coverage: Shark’s three-in-one unit is great for medium-to-large rooms, as it promises a purifying capacity of up to 500 square feet. I keep the system in my kitchen, which has an open floor plan that connects to the living room.Filter replacements: The air purification system uses a Nanoseal HEPA filter with Microban, which costs $69.99 on Shark’s website to replace. The company recommends changing the filter every six months for the best results, and doing so is super simple—just open the back of the base, snap the new piece in place, then reset the filter life on the remote by holding down the air icon for a few seconds.My experience: Setting up the system took only a few minutes thanks to the brand’s straightforward directions that are strategically placed on the unit itself. The air purifier comes with a Nanoseal HEPA filter with Microban, which traps 99.98% of large, small, and micro-size particles. Should you be the type of person who gets great pleasure out of cleaning, you might also enjoy the unit’s Clean Sense IQ monitor, which measures particle sizes (of PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) in real time.There are several features I found to be worthwhile with the air purifier. For starters, it’s so quiet you might even forget it’s in your space—a huge benefit for a room that has to serve multiple functions, from at-home office to entertaining hub. I also like that the system comes with a remote control, so I can adjust the settings or swap functions from anywhere in the room.Overall the system’s intuitive design has been a breeze to use, and I’m happy with its performance in my home. I also appreciate that I now have a greater understanding of my space: The air purifier’s visual tracking of the air quality in the room allows me to be more aware of my surroundings, alleviating any concerns of airborne allergens.What I would change: My only critique is a visual one: Because most of the walls in my apartment are white, I wish I would have gotten the white version so it would blend in with my space more. My mistake!The bottom line: At $400, the unit is on the mid- to higher-range pricing, but I found it to be worth it for the added benefits (and convenient consolidation!) of a heater and fan.How to Check Your Air QualityThere are three primary ways to check your air quality. If you want to go the free route, you can use your phone’s built-in weather app to check the AQI (Air Quality Index) of your location. It won't be exact, especially if your windows are closed, but it's an okay estimate. For a more specific air quality reading, you can purchase an air quality monitor (we found a bunch on Amazon starting from $36). Otherwise, if you have an air purifier already, there’s a good chance it has a screen or connected app that will tell you the CADR rating (Clean Air Delivery Rate) of your space.How Does Wildfire Smoke Impact Indoor Air Quality?According to the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency, a wildfire and the smoke and ash it emits can cause health risks, even if you remain indoors. Aside from smoke gases, the biggest health risk stems from the smoke’s fine particles. These can get in the eyes and respiratory system and cause issues like burning eyes, runny nose, and bronchitis. For those with pre-existing conditions, the fine particles might cause chronic heart and lung disease flare-ups.The most common way wildfire smoke can enter a home is through natural ventilation, typically through open windows and doors. Otherwise, it can make its way inside through mechanical ventilation devices (like HVAC systems) and small openings or cracks that might be around closed windows.How to Boost Air Quality in the Event of a Wildfire FireUsing an air purifier is one of the most effective ways to protect your air quality from a wildfire. The EPA notes that it’s important for the air purifier to be sized for the room that you will use it in to ensure it can clean the necessary coverage area. Keep it in a spot where people frequent the most and run it on the highest fan speed as often as possible, the EPA adds. However, even if you are using an air purifier, check your community’s air quality index and warnings to confirm it is safe to stay in your area.An HVAC system with a high-efficiency filter installed is also helpful to remove particles from the air. The EPA team recommends running it on the fastest mode possible by using “On” instead of “Auto” to improve poor air quality. Also, check your HVAC or air purifier filter often and change it when it looks dirty.Here are other helpful reminders to keep in mind, according to the EPA:Avoid opening windows and doors.Refrain from using appliances that could emit more fine particles, like using gas, propane, or wood-burning stoves and furnaces.Avoid rigorous activity if possible to help cut the amount of smoke you breathe in.Air out your home when air quality gets better when air conditions get better. Open windows or the fresh air intake on an HVAC system and run the exhaust fans in your kitchen and bathrooms.Types of Air PurifiersYou might not know that there are actually a handful of different kinds of air purifiers. The primary aim of each is the same: to filter out allergens, mold spores, smoke, VOCs, and other particulate matter. You can find UV purifiers, which use ultraviolet rays to sanitize surfaces. There are also activated carbon, ionization, and HEPA air purifiers—the last of which is most common for personal use.Most of these machines are on the smaller side and only purify one room, while other air purifiers work larger spaces. Some HEPA purifiers come with a carbon filter, and vice versa. In fact, many different types of air purifiers use HEPA technology.Things to Keep in Mind When Shopping for Air PurifiersNow that you know some of our favorite air purifiers, it’s your turn to go shopping. Whether you stick with one of our top picks or branch out, these are the things we recommend keeping in mind when choosing an air purifier.Consider the area coverage. Not all air purifiers are created equally. While some devices like the My Happi are designed to purify small rooms, others (like the Coway’s AirMega series) are designed to cover up to 930 square feet. Before you buy an air purifier, consider where you're going to be using it. That will help you pick the right air purifier for your space.Look for top-tier filtration systems.The most important thing about any air purifier is how well it filters the air. The gold standard is the HEPA filter. So, what is a HEPA filter? According to the U.S. Environmental Protective Agency, HEPA stands for “high efficiency particulate air\" and any filter with this designation can trap 99.97% of particles like dust, mold, and pollen that are 0.3 microns. According to Coway, HEPA air filters were originally created to capture radioactive particles during atomic bomb tests in World War II. Today’s HEPA filters—usually made out of maze-like, interlaced glass fibers—are used to trap air contaminants like dust, mold, and pollen.Factor in the cost and frequency of air filter replacements.Replacing your air filters when it’s time is crucial in ensuring your air purifier is performing at its highest efficiency. We’ve outlined the cost and process of replacing filters for each of these units—from the more cost-effective Blueair to the splurge-y Dyson—but strongly recommend you check out the cost to maintain your air purifier before hitting “add to cart.”Choose an air purifier with several speed options.As you can imagine, more air in your home will be filtered when you keep your air purifier on a higher fan speed, so keep an eye out for options in the market with multiple speeds. However, the EPA notes that boosting the amount of time your air purifier runs will also help increase air filtration.Last but not least, find an air purifier that will blend with its intended surroundings.The main factor in any air purifier is, of course, how well it cleans your home air. But ideally, you can find a low-profile, well designed air purifier that will fit your home aesthetic (it will, after all, be on display).Our Testing and Selection ProcessWe had our editors and writers live with their air purifiers for at least one month in order to gauge the full effects of each device. When selecting products we took into account factors such as size, coverage range, design, and price (including long-term costs of replacing filters). We also inquired within our testing pool about their current environments and how they hoped an air purifier would improve their home life. Several of our reviewers live with pets, have asthma or allergies, or were hoping the devices would keep areas like the kitchen and bedroom fume-free.",

windows for some circulation, but it’s less ideal during the changing seasons when dust and allergens get inside from the trees in the area. With wildfire smoke recently circulating the New York City air, any added protection with an air purifier is a major plus.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArea coverage:\u003c/strong\u003e This air purifier is designed to clean spaces up to 874 square feet, and I can confidently say that it does its job well. I usually place it right in the middle of my home to circulate through the space, but since some areas of my home are more tucked away, I also like to move it to specific spots that could use some extra love.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFilter replacements:\u003c/strong\u003e Replacement filters cost $70. The manufacturer suggests replacing the HEPA carbon filters every 12 months to remove odors and gases from the air.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e I’ve been using this air purifier for the last few months, and its quality is second to none. First off, the setup was simple. Coway’s included printed instructions were easy to follow, and after placing the HEPA filter inside, the hard cover snapped in place seamlessly. The HEPA filter itself has a four-stage filtration design: Pre-filter, Deodorization filter, True HEPA filter, Vital Ion. I’ve appreciated this thorough filtration process since it’s made to capture up to 99.97% of even the smallest of particles, like pollen and allergens that can come in my space during spring blooms.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike the Coway Airmega 250 Smart Air Purifier Mafi tested below, this air purifier turns on quietly. So much so that I can hardly tell it’s on most of the time. While it comes with three speeds to help thoroughly clean the air, I always keep the air purifier on auto mode. This is a favorite feature of mine, as it automatically detects the air quality through three LED light modes: blue (good), purple (moderate), and red (unhealthy). Whenever there’s a change in the air quality, like if I’m cooking, the LED light adjusts to either purple or red and the air purifier picks up its speed to quickly regulate it. Usually in just a matter of minutes, the LED light changes back to blue and the air purifier goes back to a whisper-quiet sound. When the purifier doesn’t detect any air pollution at all for half an hour, it’ll automatically switch into eco mode, which is an amazing tech feature for energy savings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLastly, the overall design of this air purifier is a big standout for modern spaces. Since this is a slightly bigger home appliance (larger than a standard space heater but much smaller than an HVAC), I didn’t want it to be an eyesore in my space. I have it in the white colorway, but you can shop it in the black too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e Coming in at less than $250, I highly recommend this air purifier to anyone who is looking for powerful air cleaning qualities, great smart technology, and a more affordable option to shop. It was bigger than I expected, but thankfully it comes with a hidden carry handle that makes it easy to move around my space. Like most air purifiers, this one has a corded design, so just make sure you have an outlet handy wherever you place it in your home.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"coway\"

space:\u003c/strong\u003e Luckily, the air quality in my home is pretty good and I don’t smoke nor do I live with any animals. I will say that I live in Brooklyn and my windows face a street. So, naturally, some dust from the street does find its way into my apartment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArea coverage:\u003c/strong\u003e My apartment is 814 square feet and I have the air purifier unit located in the center of the apartment, next to a wall. At this size, the purifier can and does cycle and clean the air that spans the entirety of the space. (It can clean air in large spaces up to 930 square feet.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFilter replacements:\u003c/strong\u003e New filters cost about $79 and replacing the pre-filter (the first of four filters) is very simple. You simply pull the washable pre-filter out of the device, clean it, allow it to properly dry, then slide it back into place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e My experience with the air purifier to date has been a very good one. When turned on, it is very quiet. This is important because I typically turn the unit on while having friends over for dinner. I do this to create an extra level of protection in my apartment during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As such, the noise level of the product is important, so as not to drone out people speaking at the table. Fortunately, it’s not an issue with this machine. The design of the product is great too. It almost looks like a fancy, sort of futuristic speaker. In fact, it’s turned into a bit of a dinner table conversation, as people often don’t immediately guess that it’s a purifier.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of the technology, Coway’s unit has a four filtration system, which in and of itself is kind of incredible. I mean, how often do we get four layers of protection for anything? The first layer is for the larger dust particles or pet hairs. Then, the second layer involves capturing the small particles that made it through. The third layer is carbon activated, which means it can extract carbon dioxide and other harmful chemicals from the air. The fourth and final layer involves the capturing and containment of viruses and bacteria.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn terms of smart features, I was impressed with how I could control everything from the tap of a button on my smartphone. The app also allows me to set a timer for the duration that I’d like the purifier to stay on, while also providing a detailed report on the air quality in real-time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e I would recommend this air cleaner to anyone who is in the market. At this time, when clean air in your home is so important, this air purifier is a must for those who can afford it. I think the fact that this filter involves four layers of protection, and that the fourth actually contains and extracts 99.999% of viruses and bacteria is phenomenal. All the more so that it can do it in the midst of a global pandemic. And as we are starting to learn how to “live” with the pandemic as part of our daily lives, having a state of the art air purifying system is all the more important. By paying $350, you are providing you and your family the safety and security to invite friends and family to your house, with much needed peace of mind too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"humidify\"

Installing them initially was quite quick–they snapped into place fairly easily.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e It’s rare to find a machine that can purify your air, humidify it, and cool down a space all in one–so I was impressed right off the bat. An update to earlier Dyson models, this machine does all that and aside from getting rid of the usual particles, it also removes formaldehyde (which can cause even more irritation to your eyes and throat) from the air.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Humidify+Cool has a HEPA filtration system and a separate carbon filter detects formaldehyde. I guess it could be due in part to my obsession with clean air, but, so far, the Dyson has reported good air quality every time I’ve checked in–the only exceptions being after I’ve lit candles or cooked something on the stovetop. But when the air quality has dipped below ideal levels, it doesn’t seem to take much time for the purifier to do the job once I turn up the fan speed (it should be noted that this model also has an auto purify setting that will kick into high gear if the quality dips, but it is a little loud for my taste so I tend to keep it on a lower setting).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I hate having an app for literally every device in my home, installing the Dyson Link app really did make installation a snap. And I love being able to check in on the air stats (temperature, particle level, humidity level, etc) whenever I want. You can also control the fan speed, oscillation range, and set timers from the app.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs for specific features I appreciate, filling the water tank from the top is a huge plus and it’s large enough that it doesn’t have to be refilled every day. I also appreciate the night mode setting, which makes everything a little quieter and less bright.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I would change:\u003c/strong\u003e This may be a misconception about the purpose of a \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/the-best-humidifiers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehumidifier\u003c/a\u003e, but I am used to really intense humidifiers that emit visible plumes of moist steam all night long. This is not that. The humidity that the Dyson model generates in the house is definitely a healthy and reasonable level (most sources recommend 30–50% humidity, and the Dyson, at its max humidity setting, hovers around 60%), but if you are like me and want more targeted humidity in the super dry winter months, this is not the machine for you and you might want to stick to separate devices for purifying, humidifying, and cooling.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e Aside from the note above, this is a really expensive device, coming in at more than $800. That said, it might actually save you money in the long run if you don’t want to buy a purifier, a fan, and a humidifier individually and you want a powerful device for each activity. I’d recommend it if you have deep pockets and not a ton of challenging air pollution situations to combat on the regular.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp id=\"bisell\" tabindex=\"-1\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eBest Budget Pick: \u003ca data-offer-url=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N5C92DN?th=1\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;element\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;ExternalLink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;outgoingURL\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DX7bjAvRTFh3UoynZ14uGtAxpfKiwWvZiVnYzhj24QLxta8CWCPjdBTqq9ddwKcxFByyDaYcSnFoDdLNuDqrcAGG4SioyKSUz79i5Vh5fgV4hwPK4osqw5WVuo45YQGY13X5xdi7KXqvr8\u0026#34;}\" href=\"https://cna.st/affiliate-link/DX7bjAvRTFh3UoynZ14uGtAxpfKiwWvZiVnYzhj24QLxta8CWCPjdBTqq9ddwKcxFByyDaYcSnFoDdLNuDqrcAGG4SioyKSUz79i5Vh5fgV4hwPK4osqw5WVuo45YQGY13X5xdi7KXqvr8\" rel=\"sponsored\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eClorox Smart Medium Room Air Purifier\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv type=\"embed\" data-item=\"{\u0026#34;ctaHref\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/p/Bid7cpAzxp9QtS1uEJXBjkY7uWZpE5jxmqf4oqGuurXZbKDrAzH8NnaKHTKnwJssZErxajnvbKyMEyHJgUD8LFbWQADrw1oAVTQtCCRJii7WnAGvhHei4yTLWe8CxpYgWoWqL489eEpcVRoMxmDzFyqAn3U3ybXSQHWtn4uXUUz5wKCAr2dTNLhDeHxMxeJ4U4CFXFn53oEpYpnyGHY2m6ckbXfpaUNMjaBNYd19Tayqr2r\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dangerousDek\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productBrand\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Clorox Smart Air Purifier\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;embedSize\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;isFirstProduct\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;isSponsored\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;offerRetailer\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Amazon\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;offerUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N5C92DN?th=1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;productId\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;66ec41de503ed88ecaa82c93\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;showOfferUrl\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;showPriceOnButton\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showAffiliateDisclaimerOnFirstProduct\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;dangerousCredit\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;showLocalisedOffers\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;isUpcEnabled\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showClampedProductDescription\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;productDescriptionLineLength\u0026#34;:5,\u0026#34;hasReadMoreFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:3,\u0026#34;hasAffiliateLinkDisabled\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;isMobileView\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;hasMultipleImageSupport\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showImageCreditText\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showMultipleImageCount\u0026#34;:4,\u0026#34;hasProsConsFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;hasRatingFeature\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;pros\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;cons\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;rating\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;isPrimeExclusive\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;shouldUseAmazonPrimeDayLiveAPIData\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;66ec41de503ed88ecaa82c93\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;offers\u0026#34;:[{\u0026#34;offerUrl\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09N5C92DN?th=1\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;price\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$120\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;currency\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;USD\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;purchaseUri\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https://cna.st/p/Bid7cpAzxp9QtS1uEJXBjkY7uWZpE5jxmqf4oqGuurXZbKDrAzH8NnaKHTKnwJssZErxajnvbKyMEyHJgUD8LFbWQADrw1oAVTQtCCRJii7WnAGvhHei4yTLWe8CxpYgWoWqL489eEpcVRoMxmDzFyqAn3U3ybXSQHWtn4uXUUz5wKCAr2dTNLhDeHxMxeJ4U4CFXFn53oEpYpnyGHY2m6ckbXfpaUNMjaBNYd19Tayqr2r\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;reducedPrice\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;$100\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sellerName\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Amazon\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;countryCode\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;US\u0026#34;}],\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;enhanced_product_card\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;total_index\u0026#34;:3,\u0026#34;hasMultipleImage\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;componentType\u0026#34;:true,\u0026#34;showProsConsData\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;showBadge\u0026#34;:false}\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"upc_66ec41de503ed88ecaa82c93\" type=\"embed\"\u003eClorox Smart Air Purifier\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTester:\u003c/strong\u003e Andrea Lewis, assistant to the global editorial director\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy space:\u003c/strong\u003e I have allergies and live in an old building that generates dust easily, so I am very sensitive to air quality.

It’s also fairly quiet unless your air levels have set off one of the more intensive settings programmed—a color-coded system (blue, green, yellow, and red) tells you just how bad your current air quality is. It helpfully includes a HEPA air filter, odor filter, and pre-filter, and though it doesn’t come with a remote or app for switching things up from afar, I kinda love not having to think about a whole ‘nother piece of equipment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e I would wholeheartedly recommend this air purifier to anyone looking for a budget air purifier that won’t cramp your style.

And I \u003cem\u003eespecially\u003c/em\u003e hate appliances that are rendered useless without their accompanying app. Thankfully, the Blue Pure Max 411i works its magic with or without it (the app is an optional addition for some extra functionality).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the app (I downloaded it for testing purposes), you can create a schedule, set the purifier to automatically switch modes at different times of the day, set a “child lock,” and change the brightness of the LED display (a perfect feature for people with purifiers in the bedroom). Beyond changing settings, the app gives an overview of the level of air pollution in your space and alerts the user when it is time to change filters. While I can’t say I’ve noticed a palpable difference in the quality of the air in my apartment, I’m sure the HEPA filter is removing plenty of imperceptible pollutants. That peace of mind is good enough for me!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I would change:\u003c/strong\u003e In a perfect world, I would be able to find a purifier that blends in with my collection of midcentury furniture, rather than one that screams “I AM AN AIR PURIFIER”—but alas. When it comes to aesthetics, the Blueair models are totally fine, and better than most–they’re sleek and minimal, and likely blend in more easily with modern decor.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor a purifier specifically aimed at small spaces, the Blue Max 411i is not exactly miniature.

In the age of global pandemics and unpredictable environmental factors, we can all stand to benefit from some cleaner air. Though slightly bulky, the Blue Max 411i is extremely easy to use, relatively affordable, and almost completely inaudible.

Filters last for up to a year, and Coway recommends vacuuming them periodically. I didn’t need to replace mine during my testing window, but it’s very easy to swap out whenever it comes time—you just flip the unit upside down, untwist the top, pull out the old filter, and slide in your new one.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e The Airmega 100 runs right about the size of a breadbox, at 15 1/2\u0026#34; tall and a diameter of 8 3/4\u0026#34;. The cylindrical body (which intakes air from all directions) is inoffensive, if slightly conspicuous—it’s solid white, with functions integrated into a touchpad on a black top. An indicator detects particulate matter down to 2.5 microns, telling you about the state of your space in real time and illuminating blue when air quality is good, green when it’s moderate, orange when it’s unhealthy, and pink when it’s very unhealthy (which thankfully I never saw!). Airflow can adjust automatically based on air quality by using the device’s “Smart Mode.” If you’re bothered by glowing lights at night, good news: This model offers an amber-hued “night light” setting, or you can turn off lit features entirely.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI tested this model over the course of about six months and definitely noticed a reduction in pet odors and dust during that time. (Bragging rights: I was told that the dust and dander in my room was “not bad at all” for someone with a cat by my movers this summer! I attribute that at least in part to this device.) The Airmega uses a three-stage system, with a vacuumable pre-filter, a HEPA filter, and a deodorization filter combining to clean and de-stinkify your room.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e This was a great product, and I think the price (around $130 at full retail) is fair for what you get. I’ve used other air purifiers where I’ve had to change filters all the time, so having one where I could “set it and forget it” was a plus. This unit is a solid option for someone living in an apartment and dealing with similar issues—mold, pollution, pet dander, and so on—or looking to neutralize some less-than-pleasant funk in a small

I haven’t had to replace my filter yet since it lasts about 12 months. However, when you first take the air purifier out of its delivery packaging, you have to remove the filter from a plastic covering and place it back in the purifier. I found this process super simple since all you have to do is twist the bottom portion of the purifier off, remove the filter, put the cleaned filter (or a new one) back in, and then twist the bottom portion back on.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e After about a week using the air purifier in my bedroom (along with regular dusting), I noticed that I wasn’t waking up with puffy eyes anymore. This may sound cliché, but the air in my room felt crisper and definitely cleaner. I specifically liked the Auto Mode feature that adjusts the fan settings automatically based on the current air quality in the room. I also appreciated the Sleep Mode feature that keeps the air purifier operating quietly by using an ultra low fan speed, this way I could use it throughout the night without the sound disrupting my sleep. I found it interesting that this air purifier has a 3-Stage Filtration system: the first is a pre-filter that captures larger particles such as dust and pet fur, the second is a H13 True HEPA filter that “captures at least 99.97% of airborne particles 0.3 microns in size,” and the third is a custom high-efficiency activated carbon filter that absorbs smoke, odors, and fumes. Each of these filters also serves the purpose of maximizing the filter’s life which I find makes this purifier a good investment.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI was also impressed with other high-tech features such as the VeSync app, which allows you to control the air purifier from your smartphone by connecting it through Bluetooth. Having access to the app allows you to easily view the air quality in the room you have the air purifier set up in with words like “good” or “very good.” You can also view the air purifier’s filter life, as well as set up features such as “Auto Clean,” which turns the air purifier on automatically when the air quality is bad and “Auto Stop,” which automatically turns the air purifier off when the air quality is good.

The setup is pretty simple, but I unboxed everything to make sure that my parents would be good to go on their own when I’m not around. Within the first few days of using the HPA204, I felt like the air quality in that section of the house had improved. (We get a lot of dust and other miscellaneous particles downstairs so you can usually hear a lot of sneezing.) After three months, my dad actually likes this version more than his older Honeywell products so he has since moved it upstairs into his bedroom (a very strong endorsement)—I wouldn’t be surprised if he ordered more of them for the rest of the house. Also, the cats don’t seem to mind when it’s on and they’re the toughest critics out of all of us!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eHoneywell’s True HEPA Air Purifier uses an activated carbon pre-filter to help capture large airborne particles and reduce odors and VOCs. The filtration helps capture up to 99.97% of the following microscopic airborne allergens and particles: Dust, pollen, pet dander, dust mite debris, and smoke. It has three cleaning levels (high/medium/low) with a turbo setting that is supposed to be excellent for people with allergies, so essentially our entire household. I especially appreciate the silent operation and dimmer option, this is critical in the evenings.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e Honeywell is an OG air purifier and air conditioner brand, I would highly recommend any of their products. Did I forget to mention that they offer a five year warranty? Doesn\u0026#39;t get classier than that.

The filters easily snap into the chamber-like base of the purifier and Dyson recommends replacing your filters when you’re alerted by the app or every 12 months, whichever comes first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy experience:\u003c/strong\u003e In addition to a small remote control, there’s also the Wifi-enabled Dyson Link app, which you can download to your smart device. I usually detest having to download an app to get the most out of my tech and appliances, though the Link app made setup a breeze; plus, if you own more Dyson home products it’s easy to manage them all in one place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe purifier itself works like a dream, and I noticed within a week of use that I felt noticeably less congested. The intuitive device uses a 360° filtration system that implements a combination of activated carbon to remove potentially harmful gases and odors from the air and a HEPA H13 filter to capture 99.97% of particles. I appreciated that the Hot+Cold has an auto mode, which continuously monitors room temperature and indoor air quality, while also running the fan or heat to the degree of your choosing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen you first turn on the purifier, it immediately starts assessing the surrounding air quality, and you can monitor any fluctuations in general air quality, particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10), volatile organic compounds usually from air sprays or aerosol (VOCs), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), as well as temperature and humidity. I was particularly fond of this feature and frequently looked at these charts to see how the levels would rise or decrease over long periods of time.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eVisually, the Dyson purifier definitely grabs attention with its sleek, modern design—a big draw to me when incorporating it into my space. Noise was never something that bothered me, though it emits louder sounds when the fan/heater is on a higher level or if it’s working to clean the air in a more polluted space. Besides its impressive air purification skills, the device doubles and triples as an oscillating smart fan and heater with adjustable airflow which I became hugely hooked on during winter (on account of some drafty windows in my room). With the ability to set your desired temperature, the heater can make a closed space feel noticeably warmer in very little time (my room size is average and I would say it took under 10 minutes).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe bottom line:\u003c/strong\u003e I really love this air purifier because I can feel and see it working (via the app). At $650 a pop, this air purifier is definitely a splurge. Are there other air purifiers out there that work just as well at a lower price point?

Aside from smoke gases, the biggest health risk stems from the smoke’s fine particles. These can get in the eyes and respiratory system and cause issues like burning eyes, runny nose, and bronchitis. For those with pre-existing conditions, the fine particles might cause chronic heart and lung disease flare-ups.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe most common way wildfire smoke can enter a home is through natural ventilation, typically through open windows and doors. Otherwise, it can make its way inside through mechanical ventilation devices (like HVAC systems) and small openings or cracks that might be around closed windows.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to Boost Air Quality in the Event of a Wildfire Fire\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing an air purifier is one of the most effective ways to protect your air quality from a wildfire. The EPA notes that it’s important for the air purifier to be sized for the room that you will use it in to ensure it can clean the necessary coverage area. Keep it in a spot where people frequent the most and run it on the highest fan speed as often as possible, the EPA adds. However, even if you are using an air purifier, check your community’s air quality index and warnings to confirm it is safe to stay in your area.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn HVAC system with a high-efficiency filter installed is also helpful to remove particles from the air. The EPA team recommends running it on the fastest mode possible by using “On” instead of “Auto” to improve poor air quality. Also, check your HVAC or air purifier filter often and change it when it looks dirty.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere are other helpful reminders to keep in mind, according to the EPA:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAvoid opening windows and doors.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRefrain from using appliances that could emit more fine particles, like using gas, propane, or wood-burning stoves and furnaces.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAvoid rigorous activity if possible to help cut the amount of smoke you breathe in.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAir out your home when air quality gets better when air conditions get better.
