The project is located in Kiryu City, Gunma Prefecture, a historic regional hub known for its textile industry. Completed in collaboration with urban development companies, the renovation redefines the use of a small, single-story house of less than 60 sqm situated in a densely built area of wooden houses. The existing structure, originally designed as a closed-off and compact residence with aging interiors, was converted into a traditional Japanese townhouse-style greengrocer.all images by Hayakawa Records – Shinsuke HayakawaSakugetsu project Integrates Community and CommerceNegishi Kenchiku Studio’s design team opened up the street-facing side of the building to create an accessible entrance and display area for the store’s products, enhancing its connection to the surrounding neighborhood.
