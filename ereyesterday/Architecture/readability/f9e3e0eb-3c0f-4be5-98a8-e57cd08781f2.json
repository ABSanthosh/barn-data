The person precariously perched to snap the perfect flat lay, their phone raised high like an offering to the gods of Instagram, capturing an overhead shot of a plate that’s stone cold. Glasses clinked repeatedly, not in celebration but for a fifth take, as diners choreograph their meals into moments of content. Whether you love it or hate it, it seems as though restaurant-goers are spending just as much time photographing their surroundings as actually enjoying their meals. The spectacle is now very much part of the experience, and with it, the visual appeal of restaurants has become more valuable than ever. Paired with intelligent social media marketing, a space that films and photographs well can be just as successful (at least in the short term) as one that has a flawless menu. It’ll come as no surprise then that this emphasis on amplified visual appeal has brought about a change in restaurant design. As chefs and owners try to capture the crowds, offering something unique and unexpected in a time where no design is a new design, themed restaurants are back in a big way. No, we’re not talking about Hard Rock Cafe or Bubba Gump Shrimp. Today’s version is more immersive storytelling than plastic props. Spaces that take restaurant design to another level, combining visual narrative with culinary excellence. But as the genre takes hold, the question remains: are themed restaurants a valuable dining experience, or is it all just a carefully staged illusion? A gimmick for likes? Themed restaurants are not a modern invention by any stretch of the imagination. Their roots can be traced back to the 19th century, particularly in Paris, in venues like the Café du Bagne. The restaurant was established in 1885 and featured decor that was inspired by prisons, offering its patrons a uniquely immersive and voyeuristic experience. By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, themed dining experiences flourished globally. In the United States, beefsteak dungeons became popular. Men put on butchers’ aprons and threw aside the illusion of civilization as they sat uncomfortably on boxes in dingy cellars, drinking beer and eating steaks without silverware or napkins. Popular venue Healys in New York was one such place. It had three rooms with varied themes: the Dungeon, the Jungle Room and the Log Cabin Room. The Log Cabin Room, probably the most civilized space of the three, was furnished with long tables and chairs and complete with tablecloths and napkins and while the guests ate, someone read aloud humorous fake telegrams to curate a theatrical dining experience. Yet, if you’ve ever been to a successfully themed restaurant, you’ll know that it begins and ends with its design. Every element — from the lighting to the ceiling heights, even the table setting — has to support the story. Ultraviolet by Paul Pairet in Shanghai is a three-Michelin-starred restaurant that’s a masterclass in themed dining. The backdrop of the ten-person dining room isn’t static — it changes through carefully timed projections that bring each course to life. One dish might transport you to a serene ocean setting, while the next places you in a bustling cityscape. The experience doesn’t stop at visuals; every course is accompanied by sounds, music and scents that provide context to the flavors on the plate. The restaurant’s secret location adds another layer of intrigue, setting the tone for an evening designed to straddle the border of dining and performance art. Not all themed spaces achieve this balance. Many fall into the trap of prioritizing style over substance, resulting in spaces that feel overly choreographed and devoid of interpretation. The danger lies in an over-reliance on control — when every detail feels so meticulously planned that there’s no room for the unexpected moments that make dining memorable. Great-themed restaurants succeed because they allow for a degree of unpredictability and opinion, a chance for the theme to evolve naturally and uniquely to each diner through interaction, conversation, or the environment itself. Without this, themed spaces risk becoming static — a set piece rather than a living, breathing experience. It’s the relationship between structure and spontaneity that separates a memorable restaurant from one that feels like a children’s party. Themes in restaurants are not neutral. They tell stories about identity, culture and aspiration — not just of the space but also of its patrons. Consider the throngs of Art Deco-inspired bars and restaurants, with their tiny cocktails, jewel tones and geometric motifs. Appealing to a contemporary longing for glamour, stability, and craftsmanship. But nostalgia can be a double-edged sword. While it evokes emotion, it can also veer into kitsch, reducing histories to surface-level aesthetics and raising questions about the legitimacy of the design style and its worth. Some might argue that to replicate it is to cheapen it, while others see it as an opportunity to bring a style and a history to a new audience who previously might not have had access to it. A big consideration comes in the form of cultural appropriation; many themed restaurants borrow from global cultures, and so the question of authenticity becomes unavoidable. Some succeed in honoring the traditions they represent. Take Tsukimi, for instance — a restaurant that demonstrates how cultural themes can be celebrated with sophistication and authenticity. Named after the Japanese tradition of moon viewing, the restaurant designed by Studio Tack reflects the poetic essence of this practice with subtle yet deliberate nods to its inspiration: crescent-shaped archways, circular mirrors, and warm lighting reminiscent of moonlight. Cultural storytelling is embedded throughout the menu and interior design — the glazed counter that mimics the reflection of the moon on water is special indeed. Tsukimi creates an immersive experience that feels thoughtful and deeply rooted in its cultural origins rather than simply decorative. But for every Tsukimi, there’s another that treats cultural motifs as props. When not approached sensitively, spaces that take on this challenge can be hollow, soulless, and can wander into insulting very quickly. These designs commodify cultural symbols without understanding or respecting their deeper meanings, creating experiences that lack cultural awareness. Mostly, the downfall of a themed restaurant is a failure to connect their culinary offerings with their design. A restaurant with a coastal theme serving generic fusion cuisine or a saloon bar offering sushi not only creates a visual disconnect but also undermines the believability of the experience. Often, the failure runs deeper than mismatched aesthetics too. The most successful restaurants don’t just match their menus to their decor. A seafood restaurant using scalloped tiles is a bit obvious for today’s design-savvy diner. Building an emotional connection with patrons is more valuable and lasting. This could mean creating a sense of place, respecting local heritage, nostalgia, or fashioning complete escapism. The rise of speakeasies reflects this trend, too. These directions feel more authentic rather than contrived. When a themed restaurant fails to deliver, it feels off, leaving diners with the impression that the interior design is simply a costume, not a fully realized concept. Themed restaurants walk a fine line between storytelling and spectacle. When executed with care, they have the power to transport and educate diners, creating spaces that elevate the act of eating into something extraordinary. But when themes are reduced to superficial aesthetics, they risk becoming little more than gimmicks that undermine both the design and the culinary experience.
