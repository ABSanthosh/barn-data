  "text": "The Footprint No. 2: Housescape Design Lab’s reimagined ShelterHousescape Design Lab’s The Footprint No. 2 offers a vision for redefining shelter, rooting the design within the ecological and cultural history of Southeast Asia. Avoiding typical Anthropocene architectural language, the project refrains from conventional elevation and instead integrates directly into the land, aiming to merge structure with the surrounding landscape. By excavating instead of building upward, the design preserves the topographical narrative of its site in Thailand, an area shaped by over two millennia of ecological and human interaction.Surrounding rice fields and irrigation channels inform the design, as a 160-year-old Rain tree’s organic canopy acts as a natural roof. The approach is inspired by local beliefs, particularly the practice of Liang Phi Fai, a ritual honoring water spirits tied to irrigation systems. Water flows through the space in tribute to these traditions, reflecting a design approach that connects nature and the divine. The Rain tree’s presence further shapes the shelter: instead of creating a conventional roof, Housescape Design Lab uses durable wooden shingles that adapt to the tree’s seasonal cycles, from fallen leaves to shifting shade, celebrating natural processes.all images by Rungkit CharoenwatHousescape Design Lab Blends design, spirituality, and LandscapeThe shelter’s architectural language draws from local agricultural practices, notably the rice fields and irrigation channels characteristic of the area’s history.
