  "text": "exposed concrete, wood, and stone define otaku caféThe principles of wabi-sabi, a Japanese philosophy that finds beauty in the natural and the imperfect, intertwine with the stark poetry of brutalism at shell+core’s OTAKU café in Abu Dhabi. Sited along the waterfront in the city’s Al Qana district, the project crafts a tactile and atmospheric environment envisioned to evolve with time. From the structure to the interior finishes, the UAE-based studio embraces material honesty, leaving concrete, untreated wood, and natural stone exposed to tell their own stories over time. all images by Bianca Studio shell+core’s earthy material palette embraces brutalismGiven the site’s location on an irregular lot and drawing inspiration from its waterfront setting, shell+core has integrated fluid forms throughout that soften the rigidity of the material palette. Reflective surfaces and carefully curated lighting create shifting patterns of shadow and light that soften the presence of imposing materiality, reinforcing the idea that the café is in constant dialogue with its natural surroundings. Among these organic touches, the influence of Tadao Ando’s brutalism is evident in the architects’ stark yet poetic approach to form. Volumes of concrete are juxtaposed with warm organic textures, prevalent in a central column, which, rather than being hidden or structurally masked, is partially clad in richly patterned Californian burl wood and elevated into a sculptural feature.Indirect lighting accentuates its duality, allowing the interplay between smooth and rugged textures to become a focal point at OTAKU. Throughout, the architects have also positioned vintage and restored furniture personally sourced by the client to add further layers of depth and character, while large plants form subtle space delineators to present both intimate and open seating arrangements without disrupting the openness of the program.shell+core completes OTAKU cafésited along the waterfront in Abu Dhabi’s Al Qana district",
