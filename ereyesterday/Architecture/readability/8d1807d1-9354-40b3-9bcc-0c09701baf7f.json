  "text": "A sloping concrete roof and perforated walls shelter the open-air interiors of Anchor House, a dwelling in the jungle in Vietnam by local studio MM++ Architects. Designed for an artist looking for an escape from the city, the 160-square-metre Anchor House sits on a narrow site surrounded by vegetation in the Mekong Delta. MM++ Architects organised its spaces across two floors that are open to a large, sheltered verandah wrapped by perforated concrete walls, creating a close relationship to the site while naturally ventilating the home in warmer weather. MM++ Architects has completed Anchor House in a Vietnamese jungle\"Refined open spaces have been thoughtfully curated with the ground floor platform and wooden divides accentuating the soaring trees, inviting in the breeze, scents of nature and the light shows of dusk and dawn,\" said the studio. \"When local climatic conditions of intense downpours during the wet season and sweltering heat during the dry season may seem undefeatable, this mothership provides protection with its extended coverage and ample cooling airflow,\" it added. \"[It is] monastic minimalism anchored in the tropics, an idyllic spot to retreat to and spectate the surrounding natural environment.\" A sloping concrete roof and perforated walls enclose the homeOutside Anchor House, a small parking area also wrapped by perforated concrete walls sits beside a set of steps that lead onto the veranda. From here, the bedroom, kitchen and bathroom can all be accessed via doors in a wood-panelled section of wall with built-in storage. A wooden stair leads up to the first floor, where a study overlooks the veranda below. Alongside, the second bedroom is illuminated by high-level glass bricks while an additional bathroom is lit by a large skylight. As well as glass bricks and perforated sections, parts of the wall are also fitted with metal panels with angled openings, providing ventilation while keeping out the rain. The first floor overlooks a verandaAt the front of Anchor House, a concrete terrace extends out above the parking area to provide views over the surrounding jungle. An approach of \"decluttering the nonessentials\" guided the interior design of the home, which is defined by exposed concrete, untreated dark wood and light fittings concealed in the concrete roof. Glass bricks illuminate a bedroom\"The straightforward raw finishings of wood and untreated concrete deliver an uncomplicated abode,\" described MM++ Architects. \"Whatever the weather, whatever the mood, Anchor House provides transportation to personal places of poetic imagination, minimal introspection, and peace.\" MM++ Architects is led by Michael Charruault and Mỹ An Pham Thi. Its previous projects include a shophouse with a facade that folds open and a pared-back open-plan villa with red bricks and pivoting glass. The photography is by Oki Hiroyuki.
