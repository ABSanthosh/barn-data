Siwa, known for her once-eccentric YouTube presence and starring on Lifetime’s hit reality show Dance Moms, has officially sold her spot in Tarzana, California, for $4.1 million, per TMZ.The singer and dancer listed the property, which is located about 45 minutes away from Los Angeles and was unaffected by the city’s wildfires, in December 2024 for $3.99 million. The buyer of the home has not yet been revealed. The listing was spearheaded by Selling Sunset’s Stause and the Oppenheim Group’s Omar Abaza. TMZ reports that the home is slated to appear in season nine of Selling Sunset, which will air later this year.A living area in the home.

When I stopped filming in the house every day, it was really weird for me to come into the house, and it felt like work. So I told my family, ‘Let’s change the house to a nice, pretty, calm, serene house.’”",
