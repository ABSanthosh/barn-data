  "text": "Overwater bungalows are now deeply embedded in our collective consciousness, but are still a relatively newer phenomenon in the world of hospitality characterized by sublime seascapes on all sides, water glittering like gemstones beneath your bed, and steps leading directly into the ocean.There was a time when cruise ships, yachts, and other sailing vessels were your primary options for housing right on the sea, when comfort was subject to swells and storms, not to mention space constraints. Now, as planes—both the standard and float version—descend into destinations such as the Maldives and French Polynesia, passengers can spot long, often gracefully arching lineups of bungalows that cut across famously crystalline cerulean waters. This type of villa has become so prolific it’s now found from Saudi Arabia to Indonesia, Belize to Switzerland.It all started in 1967, on the island of Raiatea—which, without a sandy beach, was proving a challenging sell for tourists. A trio of Californians known as the Bali Hai Boys conceived of a new type of accommodation: the overwater bungalow. At the time they assured the government that, like traditional Tahitians’ fishing huts, they would not harm the coral with their pandanus-leaf-thatched-roof structures, and that edict still holds true. Their trio of bungalows at Bali Hai Hotel became a craze that spread to Bora Bora and beyond; after all, the charming stilted cottages offered immersion into the magic of the sea, sans snorkel mask or air tank. Now nearly 60 years old, the iconic honeymoon hideaways, sought-after spots for not just romance but easy access to throngs of Technicolor sea creatures below, are looking better than ever.Over more than a half century, but especially in the last decade, the overwater villa has gone from strikingly simple to, in some cases, over-the-top opulent—though there are still plenty of affordable, modest versions around the world. Its homeland, French Polynesia, lays claim to somewhere around 1,000 properties, from Moorea to Rangiroa and Bora Bora. Of any destination, overwater villas are most abundant in the Maldives, with more than 170 resorts in the same category.Wherever they stand, overwater accommodations often feature similar elements, such as thatched roofs made of natural, indigenous materials. Bungalows are usually attached to a wooden pontoon walkway unless we’re talking about one very special overwater villa in the Maldives that floats, can be moved to different locations, and (thanks to state-of-the-art engineering) doesn’t rock and roll with the ocean’s swell. As interiors go, barefoot island rustic with lots of wood is a popular aesthetic, while some spots, like JOALI MALDIVES and Nujuma, a Ritz-Carlton Reserve, are incredibly glamorous. Panoramic views of the countless shades of blue outside are requisite, while overwater pools, jacuzzis, and suspended hammocks have become popular amenities, too.Because these revolutionary structures make for fun daydream fodder, here we look at some of the most heavenly modern overwater bungalows from around the world.",
