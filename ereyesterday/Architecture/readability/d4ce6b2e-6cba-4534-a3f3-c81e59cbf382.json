Designed by L’Antic Colonial (part of the Porcelanosa Group), this latest series turns walls into immersive experiences. Each mural goes beyond decoration to create a mood, a story, or even a sense of place. Whether it’s the calm of soft water lines, the energy of abstract fragments, or the elegance of cranes in flight, these designs feel intentional and expressive. Here’s a closer look at what’s inside the collection… Cranes This mural pays tribute to the elegance of cranes, captured in a moment of stillness. With delicate detailing and soft metallic tones, it brings a sense of quiet refinement to the space. The composition feels poetic and serene, perfect for interiors that lean into subtle beauty. Fragments Bold, abstract, and full of movement, Fragments is the most playful of the group. Its design seems to shift the longer you look, creating a dynamic effect that makes the wall feel alive. A perfect choice for creative or conversational spaces. Forms This striking abstract wallpaper in a deep navy and creamy white shapes, dances across the wall in a graphic, almost architectural rhythm that feels both artistic and grounded. The rich contrast draws your eye immediately, giving the room a sense of purpose and personality. Lake Soft and serene, Lake channels the stillness of water with its gentle color palette and subtle reflections. It’s calming without being dull, and works beautifully in places meant for rest and relaxation. Labyrinth Labyrinth plays with interlocking shapes and endless pathways. The result is a modern, geometric composition with a hint of mystery. It’s ideal for spaces that embrace clean lines but still want visual depth. Whether you’re drawn to bold abstraction, natural forms, or soft, meditative tones, The Art Collection offers a way to express it on your walls. Each mural brings its own rhythm, emotion, and atmosphere, all with the practical performance that makes Skins Wallpaper easy to live with. It’s art you don’t just look at, you live in.",
