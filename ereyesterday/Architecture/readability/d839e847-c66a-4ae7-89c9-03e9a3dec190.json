  "text": "Studio Gang Rethinks the typical Conference CenterThe David Rubenstein Treehouse, designed by Studio Gang for Harvard University in Boston, redefines the typology of the conference facility. These buildings are often insular, energy-intensive, and disconnected from their surroundings. As Harvard’s first mass timber building, the Treehouse emphasizes low-carbon construction and creates a space that encourages conversation, collaboration, and connection with its surrounding community and environment.Located within the first phase of the Enterprise Research Campus, the Treehouse is envisioned as a destination for Harvard and the wider Boston community. The building offers event spaces for university-wide use and amenities for the neighborhood, including meeting areas and dining facilities. Designed with accessibility in mind, its ground floor features multiple entry points, a transparent facade, and a welcoming atmosphere. A double-height lobby connects to two year-round covered porches, promoting indoor-outdoor interaction.visualizations © Studio Gangharvard’s Immersive Mass Timber ‘treehouse’The architects at Studio Gang design the Harvard building to host meetings and events within its two upper floors, its design inspired by the experience of climbing into a treehouse. A central staircase, illuminated by skylights, highlights the natural beauty of the mass timber structure, which forms the building’s backbone. The Canopy Hall, the main conference space, is supported by branching columns and cross-bracing that frame views of treetops and the surrounding campus. The sustainably harvested timber structure, also expressed on the facade, defines the Treehouse’s identity as an innovative and environmentally conscious building.the Treehouse redefines conference centers with a sustainable and community-focused designSpaces Designed for ConnectionSustainability is central to Studio Gang’s design for its Treehouse at Harvard. Its self-shading facade minimizes energy demands while maximizing natural light, and rooftop solar panels provide clean power for the building’s all-electric systems. A combination of bioswales — landscape features that collect and filter polluted stormwater runoff — and a rooftop rainwater collection system supports irrigation, contributing to the project’s low environmental footprint. These green strategies reduce the building’s carbon impact while at once creating a vibrant, biodiverse environment that attracts wildlife.The Treehouse is designed to encourage interaction. Informal gathering areas include open atrium landings, central stairways, and an expansive upper-level porch that offers the sensation of being among the treetops.
