  "text": "Nestled in a serene, forested enclave of Portland, Oregon, the Mori House merges mid-century modern architecture with contemporary minimalist sensibilities. Originally designed in 1963 by Saul Zaik, a revered figure in Pacific Northwest architecture, this home has been thoughtfully reimagined by SHED Architecture \u0026 Design to meet the aesthetic and functional needs of its new owners: a young family with a passion for design. Set on a sloped, wooded lot, the Mori House makes a striking yet understated statement. The property includes a detached garage and studio, along with a teahouse pavilion, accessible via elevated decks. These elements, framed by towering trees, create a peaceful retreat that prioritizes connection with the natural environment. Zaik’s original blueprint was a celebration of mid-century modern design, marked by clear geometries and the use of organic materials. The current remodel extends this vision, weaving in Japanese-inspired minimalism. SHED’s approach preserves the house’s architectural integrity while enhancing light, space, and the fluidity between indoors and outdoors. Central to the redesign is the transformation of the vertical circulation. The removal of the original spiral staircase and loft unveils a dramatic vaulted ceiling, showcasing a nail-laminated wood roof that draws attention to a new central skylight. This skylight, a focal point of the home, infuses the living spaces with soft, natural light and highlights the structural rhythm of the house. On the main floor, the living, dining, and kitchen areas flow seamlessly along the southern axis, framed by expansive glazing that opens to the forest. A newly positioned fireplace anchors the living room, offering panoramic views that extend to Mount Saint Helens on clear days. The kitchen’s design enhances functionality while celebrating craftsmanship, with custom fir accents and thoughtfully placed windows that connect the space to the landscape. A horizontal window runs along one wall above the cooktop displaying framed views of mature rhododendrons. The primary suite, positioned on the northern side of the house, embodies serene luxury. Featuring a walk-in closet and an elegant bathroom complete with a Japanese soaking tub, it combines comfort with understated elegance. Fir slats above the suite’s entry doors subtly diffuse light, maintaining a connection to the skylight above. The renovation also enhances the lower level, turning it into a versatile space for family life. Three flexible rooms – suitable as bedrooms, offices, or fitness areas – accompany a shared bath and a dedicated wine cellar. A cozy lounge, framed by floor-to-ceiling windows, offers a tranquil space for relaxation, reinforcing the home’s strong bond with its natural surroundings.
