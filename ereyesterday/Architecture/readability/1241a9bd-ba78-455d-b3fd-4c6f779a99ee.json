  "text": "Ellen DeGeneres is shuffling her English real estate portfolio around less than a year after relocating from the US. The former talk show host and her wife, actor Portia de Rossi, have put their UK farmhouse on the market for $30 million.DeGeneres and de Rossi have been spending their time in the Cotswolds, a quiet hub of small towns roughly two hours southwest of London. DeGeneres has largely wiped her portfolio of American real estate, including her last standing property in California: a Montecito bungalow that sold for $5.2 million in March 2025. The Emmy-decorated comedian has since opted for a $20 million estate in Swinbrook, Oxfordshire, dubbed Kitesbridge Farm, which she purchased in the spring of 2024.American A-listers from Ellen DeGeneres to Richard Gere to Eva Longoria are embracing the expat lifeThe estate, which dates back to the 1700s, features six bedrooms with exposed wood beams, stone walls, and rustic furnishings. The 16,600-square-foot dwelling surrounds a central courtyard on a 43-acre site and is connected to a two-bedroom guesthouse. DeGeneres and de Rossi added modern touches to the countryside dwelling during their ownership, stating that the farmhouse had great bones but was “quite tired, with a quite basic finish,” per listing agent Andrew Barnes of UK Sotheby’s International Realty.The power couple hired an army of 70 contractors for renovations that were quoted to take between 12 and 18 months, but would be expedited to conclude in just five months. Kitesbridge Farm is now updated with a separate party barn with a pub, a heated indoor swimming pool, and a fully equipped gym. Additional upgrades include a five-car garage and windows that allow more natural lighting to enter the main house.Per the Wall Street Journal, the couple snatched up a larger, more contemporary estate in the same area, citing the need for more space for de Rossi’s horses. “When we decided to live here full time, we knew that Portia couldn’t live without her horses,” DeGeneres told the outlet in a statement via Sotheby’s. “We needed a home that had a horse facility and pastures for them.”Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.
