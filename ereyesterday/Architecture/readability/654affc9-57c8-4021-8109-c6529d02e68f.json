You might also find back sleeping more comfortable for back pain over side sleeping, or vice versa. Some experts suggest one position over the other, depending who you ask, but whichever position is most comfortable to you will be best for your individual needs.As for the one sleeping position you should consider avoiding with back pain? Stomach sleeping. “Stomach-sleeping hyperextends the neck and strains the lower back,” says Dr. Saifullah.Tips to Reduce Back Pain While SleepingWhile sleeping on a mattress with adequate support and comfort is probably the best way to reduce back pain while sleeping, there are a few lifestyle changes you can make (and ways to reduce pain before going to bed) that can help improve your quality of sleep as well.Maintain Good Sleep PostureYou’ve probably heard by now that poor posture can lead to back pain, and while maintaining good posture during the day matters, so does good posture during sleep. While you may not be able to drop your shoulders or sit upright while sleeping, you can potentially reduce back pain by sleeping on your side or back, which Dr. Saifullah says are the preferred sleeping positions for back pain. “Avoid sleeping on your stomach, which strains your neck and lower back,” he says.Use a Supportive PillowInvesting in a mattress for back pain isn’t the only change you can make to your bed to help avoid achy, sleepless nights. Your pillows are just as important for reducing pain. “Choose a pillow that keeps your head and neck in proper alignment with your spine,” says Dr. Saifullah. Your head shouldn’t be elevated too high or too low. If you sleep on your side, look for a pillow with a higher loft designed with side sleepers in mind.Invest in a Mattress TopperIf purchasing a new mattress outright isn’t feasible or affordable for you, adding a medium or firm mattress topper to your existing bed can provide pressure relief if there is none. A memory foam mattress topper can also cradle your sensitive joints and contour to the unique shape of your body. If springs are poking out of your mattress or there’s noticeable sagging (signs your mattress should be replaced), a mattress topper won’t fix these issues and you’ll likely still feel discomfort while sleeping.Apply Heat or IceTaking a few minutes to apply heat before bed or ice upon waking up can be a great way to lessen any lingering back pain. Dr. Saifullah recommends applying a heating pad before bed to loosen tight muscles and an ice pack to reduce inflammation after waking up with pain.Stretch Before BedGiving your body a good stretch isn’t just for before or after workouts. “Regular stretching before bed can improve flexibility and reduce back pain,” explains Dr. Saifullah. Lying on your back and pulling your legs close to your chest can provide relief for lower back pain, but be cautious about stretching if you have new pain (such as from an injury) since stretching could make it worse. And always follow the guidance of your physical therapist or doctor.Nourish and Rest Your BodyYour bedtime routine and sleep habits aren’t the only ways to reduce back pain while sleeping. The way you spend your daytime hours can also make a big impact. Eating a nutritious, well-balanced diet with complex carbohydrates like whole wheat toast or oatmeal can help you sleep better overall by increasing your body's production of melatonin, the hormone that makes you sleepy. And, of course, it’s important not to push yourself too hard if you have more serious back pain. Be sure to weave plenty of rest into your schedule and not just during nighttime hours.FAQsWhat type of mattress is best for back pain?Memory foam, latex, or hybrid mattresses are the best choices for back pain relief, says Dr. Saifullah. Memory foam contours to your body while latex offers good pressure relief. Hybrid mattresses, meanwhile, combine the support of coils with foam or latex comfort layers for better sleep.Is a soft or firm mattress better for back pain?Most experts and research agree that a medium-firm mattress is the sweet spot for back pain relief or prevention. This firmness level tends to provide the best spine alignment and general comfort. Firmness can be subjective, so it’s important to seek out a mattress that ultimately feels comfortable to you (which may or may not be medium-firm).Are memory foam mattresses good for back pain?Memory foam naturally conforms to the shape of your body, which can be a great way to get targeted pressure relief in areas causing you pain along your spine or shoulders. Keep in mind, though, that memory foam can trap heat, so you may want to look for a cooling variety or try a latex mattress if you tend to run hot while sleeping (latex is supportive yet more breathable).What is the best mattress topper for back pain?Adding a memory foam mattress topper to your bed can amp up pressure relief and support if your current mattress is causing you back pain. It’ll also cost a fraction of the price of buying a new mattress. Just be sure that your mattress topper isn’t too soft, which can cause you to sink into the bed and throw off your natural spine alignment, potentially adding to any existing pain.This article was medically reviewed by Soma Mandal, MD.
