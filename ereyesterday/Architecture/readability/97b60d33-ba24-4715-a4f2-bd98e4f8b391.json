  "text": "Bioclimatic Residence by CTA Addresses Urban HeatNam House, designed by CTA | Creative Architects, is situated in Thu Duc City, Vietnam, where urban temperatures are significantly higher than in rural areas. The residence responds to this challenging climate with bioclimatic design strategies aimed at reducing mental and physical stress caused by heat and enhancing comfort.The house is divided into three functional blocks. The front block prioritizes privacy with dense walls, containing the garage, toilet, entrance, bedroom, and study. The back block houses two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a laundry area, also surrounded by dense walls for privacy. The middle block features an open dining area designed to connect with nature and adjacent structures. This open layout allows ample sunlight and fosters interaction while ensuring privacy and climatic protection.all images by Hiroyuki OkiLayered System Optimizes Thermal Comfort at Nam HouseTo tackle heat transfer, the designers constructed a 250mm thick outer shell composed of three layers; a solid brick outer layer that blocks most sunlight but retains heat for long periods, an air gap that separates the inner wall from the heated outer wall, reducing heat transfer, and an inner wall made of 4-hole bricks that creates an air cushion, further reducing heat transfer. This system effectively blocks solar heat, maintaining cooler interior temperatures during peak heat periods. Solar heat gain is further minimized by using raked mortar joints in the brick walls, creating shaded areas that reduce heat absorption by 14-16%. This subtle design choice significantly enhances thermal performance.Natural ventilation is prioritized with Z-shaped shades integrated into doors and windows, promoting airflow and cooling throughout the house. Each room is designed to have at least two windows, facilitating continuous air circulation even when occupants are away. The design also incorporates a heat delay strategy, ensuring that peak internal temperatures do not coincide with the most active hours of the day. This is achieved by positioning rooms and walls to slow the transfer of solar radiation. CTA | Creative Architects’ thoughtful arrangement of spaces and structural elements helps to maintain a comfortable climate throughout the house.the residence is divided into three blocks, prioritizing privacy and climatic protectionWater Features Shape Cooling Microclimate at Nam HouseWater features, including a strategically placed lake in the northeast, enhance the microclimate by increasing humidity and lowering temperatures through evaporation. This contributes to a cooling effect around the house, reducing the overall temperature by 6 to 8°C. The material palette includes brick, concrete, and natural finishes that support the building’s thermal performance while blending with the surrounding environment. The project reflects a thoughtful approach to tropical modern architecture, creating a comfortable living environment amidst challenging climatic conditions. Nam House exemplifies how architectural design can create a microclimate that improves the quality of life, addressing climate challenges through passive design and material choices.a 250mm thick outer shell minimizes heat transfer through its three-layered designNam House addresses urban heat challenges with bioclimatic design strategiesthe solid brick outer layer blocks sunlight and retains heat, aiding in climate control",
