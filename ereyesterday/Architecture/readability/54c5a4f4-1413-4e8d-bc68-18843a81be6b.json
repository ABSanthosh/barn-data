  "text": "Hiyoshi Ribbon Terrace shades Campus sunken amphitheaterHiyoshi Ribbon Terrace is a temporary shading structure designed to enhance the usability of a sunken amphitheater with terraced seating on Keio University’s Hiyoshi Campus in Yokohama. Located adjacent to a student cafeteria, the amphitheater previously saw limited use due to its exposure to intense sunlight. The project designed by Jorge Almazán and Keio University StudioLab introduces fabric shading to create a comfortable outdoor space for relaxation and interaction.Taking advantage of the amphitheater’s shape, the design features ribbon-like fabric panels suspended from the university building, creating a maypole-like arrangement. These ribbons provide shade for the terraced seats while allowing airflow and natural light to pass through. The bright orange fabric contrasts with the surrounding greenery and adds vibrancy to the concrete courtyard. The structural design enables the ribbons to be easily removed or adjusted. Bolts at the upper fittings allow angle modifications, while lower metal fittings permit quick detachment. This flexibility ensures the structure can be dismantled during long vacations or typhoon seasons.all images courtesy of Jorge Almazán and Keio University StudioLabHiyoshi Ribbon Terrace serves as a Social shaded Outdoor SpaceCompleted in November 2023, the shaded terrace designed by architects at Jorge Almazán and Keio University StudioLab quickly became a popular gathering space for students. Observational studies and cafeteria usage trends from April to July revealed a 1.5 to 2-fold increase in visitors compared to the same period before the project’s implementation. Students utilized the shaded space for dining and leisure, with some spending short breaks while others remained for extended periods.Thermographic measurements taken in July indicated that shaded bench surfaces were approximately 20°C cooler than those exposed to direct sunlight, highlighting the effectiveness of the fabric shading. By introducing a detachable, easily installed shading system capable of covering a large area, the Hiyoshi Ribbon Terrace demonstrates a practical approach to enhancing the usability of outdoor spaces in educational settings.the shading structure enhances a sunken amphitheater at Keio University’s Hiyoshi Campusribbon-like fabric panels create shaded seating areas, making the amphitheater more usable for students",
