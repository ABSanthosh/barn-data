  "text": "In a letter addressed to the FAA, local airport director Jeff Mulder has expressed concern about the height and safety of the proposed Legends Tower supertall skyscraper in Oklahoma City. Designed by architecture studio AO and developed by Matteson Capital, Legends Tower would be the tallest building in the United States at 581 metres (1,907 feet) high if completed, and is part of a mixed-use development set to be built in downtown Oklahoma City. Mulder wrote in the letter that the height of the tower would \"increase travel time\" for passengers, cause \"adverse changes\" to departure schedules and \"create the safety of flight issues\" in the greater metropolitan area. Airport authority raises safety concerns around Legends Tower This would be due in part to an increase in the minimum victory altitude (MVA) in the city – meaning planes would take longer to descend – and the tower's proposed location, which infringes upon the airspace of not only Will Rogers World Airport (OKC) but other airports in the city such as Tinker Air Force Base, Wiley Post Airport and Max Westheimer Airport. According to KOCO News 5 ABC, which published the letter, Mulder stated the letter is a routine process and it is \"not in support or against the project\", although the FAA has yet to respond, which has caused delays. Developer and Matteson Capital founder Scot Matteson also told the outlet that he \"expected some pushback\". \"We expected some pushback from them,\" Matteson said. \"We're waiting for the full report from the FAA, which we are supposed to get by the end of this month,\". It may be \"a little shorter\" He also told News on 6 that the tower will be a \"little shorter\" if needed, though the skyscraper currently has \"unlimited\" height approval from local government, approved earlier this year. While the developer seems hopeful, a number of other large-scale developments proposed in Oklahoma have recently faced delays, according to The Oklahoman, including an oil refinery, an amusement park, a solar panel factory and the Legends Tower development. \"Indeed, reporting by the Oklahoman shows the stalling and delays involve a mix of unrealistic expectations, politics, government red tape and shaky economic confidence due to unrest overseas,\" said reporter Steve Lackmeyer. According to the outlet, the first phase of the project is to begin in early 2025, although it will not include Legends Tower. Previously, AO partner Bruce Greenfield told Dezeen the height of Legends Tower \"is not something that's necessary\". The images are courtesy of AO.
