The airport features a modular diagrid structure made of glulam timber, adorned with Bhutanese wood carvings. This design, which will be presented at the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale, highlights the balance between ancient traditions and contemporary techniques.BIG has positioned the Gelephu International Airport as Bhutan’s second international gateway, located near the Bhutan-India border and Paitha River. Surrounded by the country’s subtropical forests and mountain ranges, the 68,000 square-meters airport is a key element of the Gelephu Mindfulness City (GMC) masterplan, developed in collaboration with NACO, Arup, and Cistri. Designed to handle up to 123 flights daily, it is projected to accommodate 1.3 million passengers by 2040, scaling up to 5.5 million by 2065.visualizations © BIGbjarke ingels draws from bhutan’s woodcarving heritageDesigning its Gelephu International Airport, the team at Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) pays special attention to showcasing Bhutan’s woodcarving traditions. Local artists will create intricate carvings that will adorn the timber structure, inspired by the revered ‘Kachen’ pillars of Bhutanese architecture. This approach celebrates the country’s cultural heritage while incorporating modern technology. An installation at the 2025 Venice Architecture Biennale will showcase this blend of craft and innovation.The Gelephu International Airport, designed by Bjarke Ingels Group, features modular timber frames that allow for future expansion. The glulam timber diagrid structure is designed for disassembly and reassembly as the airport grows, ensuring flexibility. The airport’s roof will be equipped with photovoltaic panels, supporting Bhutan’s commitment to remaining carbon-negative.Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) unveils the design for Gelephu International Airport in BhutanA Forest Courtyard Connects Passengers to NatureBjarke Ingels Group embeds Bhutan’s natural environment and cultural values into the design of the Gelephu International Airport. The arrival plaza, for instance, is divided into four zones, each dedicated to native plants from the surrounding forests. The airport’s terminal, which resembles a stylized mountain range, integrates elements of traditional Bhutanese design, including carved timber dragons symbolizing the past, present, and future.Bhutan’s biodiversity is brought to the heart of the architecture. A central courtyard, called the Forest Spine, divides the terminal into domestic and international sections. It provides travelers with a calming connection to nature, featuring green spaces, a treetop walkway, and native flora. This design element reflects the emphasis on mindfulness and well-being, core values of Bhutan’s culture.The structure highlights Bhutanese craftsmanship, including traditional techniques such as Shing-Zo (carpentry), Par-Zo (carving), and Lha-Zo (painting). The wooden carvings extend throughout the airport’s interior and exterior, creating a cohesive aesthetic that mirrors the country’s architectural heritage.the airport blends Bhutanese traditional craftsmanship with modern architectural innovationBIG plans to create a mindful travel experience at the Gelephu International Airport, where natural light floods the spaces through expansive windows and skylights.
