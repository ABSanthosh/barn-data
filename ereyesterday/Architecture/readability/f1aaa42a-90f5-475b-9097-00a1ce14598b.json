  "text": "El Departamento Designs Siroko’s Barcelona Concept StoreSiroko, the Asturian sportswear and accessories brand, has opened its first concept store in Barcelona in collaboration with architecture and interior design studio El Departamento. Located at 113 Rambla de Catalunya, the 149-square-meter space explores the relationship between natural environments and sports technology through a series of spatial and material transitions. This is the second collaboration between Siroko and El Departamento, following the brand’s flagship store in Madrid. The Barcelona project continues the established design direction while introducing new conceptual and material strategies. The store is organized as a sequence of interconnected rooms, each treated as a discrete volume that accommodates a specific part of the retail program. These spaces are defined by their independent lighting schemes and distinct atmospheres, creating a spatial rhythm that supports the brand’s narrative.El Departamento’s approach references elemental natural forms, such as ice, stone, earth, and vegetation, and translates them into a spatial language informed by sports technology. This creates a continuous dialogue between organic textures and synthetic materials. The palette relies on earthy tones, with an emphasis on blue, and includes modular, reconfigurable display systems that balance adaptability with visual coherence.all images by Jonathan RistagnoModular Systems and Lighting schemes Shape the spaceLighting plays a central role in defining the spatial experience. Each room is equipped with ceiling-mounted light panels operating independently, reinforcing the segmented structure of the space. Integrated lighting within the display cabinetry further supports visual continuity and enhances product presentation. At the core of the store is the ‘Siroko Custom’ zone, which reprises elements from the Madrid location. The space features an open-grid ceiling (tramex) supported by a structural system that also functions as a vertical product display. Materials such as micro-perforated metal sheets and stainless steel contribute to a tactile and technical visual identity, while also allowing textures to shift under changing light conditions.Ultimately, this project encapsulates studio El Departamento’s vision of contemporary retail, where spatial experience transcends traditional commercial function to become a full immersion into Siroko’s values. Through the interplay of material, light, and spatial sequence, the store presents a considered response to contemporary retail design. With this opening, Siroko expands its physical presence in Spain, reinforcing a brand image defined by technical precision and engagement with the outdoor environment.Siroko opens its first concept store in Barcelona in collaboration with El Departamentoa sequence of rooms creates a rhythm of distinct spatial experienceseach room functions as an individual volume within the retail journeyindependent lighting schemes define atmosphere and orientationmodular display systems adapt to different product arrangementsceiling-mounted light panels operate independently in each roomorganic textures are combined with synthetic materialsintegrated lighting enhances product presentation and material deptha distinctive open-grid ceiling links this store to its Madrid counterpartmicro-perforated metal sheets contribute to a technical visual identitythe design balances retail functionality with brand storytelling",
