However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Even if you’re living in a small space, you can still think big on chic balcony ideas if you’re fortunate enough to have your very own outdoor oasis. “Balconies present the opportunity to do something fun and think outside the box to create a unique space you typically wouldn’t find indoors,” says Bryan Yates, the founder of Yates Desygn in Dallas. Though they typically come with less square footage, a balcony can still function as a bite-size backyard, meaning everything from furniture to lighting to landscaping can still be incorporated tastefully and functionally. Below, we’re sharing 15 inspiring balcony decor ideas—including small balcony ideas—that will help you make the most of your personal retreat.Go big with greeneryGreenery injects life and color into this balcony’s neutral palette. Photo: Kirsten FrancisMolly Torres Portnof, the founder of Date Interiors in Brooklyn, New York, took advantage of the rarity that is a New York City balcony by adding lattice fencing and vines “to create a little oasis for our client that feels open, yet cozy,” she explains. Specific plants used in this outdoor area include ivy, clematis, and climbing hydrangea. An array of potted plants also add a luscious touch to the urban escape—Torres Portnof is a proponent of perennials such as milkweed, mountain laurel, rhododendron, and windflowers. She says, “I love how these plants are hearty, beautiful, and work for a variety of outdoor spaces.”Bring in some folding chairsPhoto: Courtesy of IKEAShort on space? Make use of folding chairs that you can easily tuck away indoors if you wish. \"Folding chairs like the SUNDSÖ are a great choice for balconies because they are space-saving, portable, and easy to store when not in use, making them perfect for small spaces,” says Paul Anderson, IKEA U.S. home furnishing and retail design leader. This style of chair comes preassembled and is available in nine different color options.Design an outdoor living roomThe organic materials and earth tones of this living room flow from the indoors onto the balcony. Photo: G CRAWFORDWhen designing the balcony for a penthouse apartment overlooking Beverly Hills, designer Jeff Andrews, the founder of Jeff Andrews Design in Los Angeles, seamlessly fused together indoor and outdoor living. He was intentional about selecting outdoor furniture that is “cohesive with the interiors—nothing that screams ‘outdoors’ in shape, proportion, or materiality.” Andrews urges others to be mindful and consider their balcony an extension of their interiors as opposed to an outdoor afterthought. “It’s important to treat your outdoor space with the same care and attention to your indoor spaces aesthetically,” he says.Use a settee to create a reading nookA settee is the quintessentially versatile balcony furniture pick: It makes for a comfortable lounge seat for one but also provides ample room for more, if you plan to host alfresco soirees. Photo: Lauren TaylorThe balcony is a perfect place to curl up and read while bathing in the sunshine, so think about incorporating a small settee that’s comfortable for lounging, as designer Linda Hayslett did in this apartment balcony space. Hayslett, who is the founder of LH.Designs in Los Angeles, suggests working with outdoor-friendly fabrics that are water-resistant and easy to clean. And these days, you don’t have to worry about sacrificing style in the process: “Outdoor fabrics have come a long way,” Hayslett says. “They have advanced to look and feel like indoor fabric, so stiff outdoor furniture fabric is a has-been.”Lay down a durable outdoor rugBe sure to seek out durable, UV-friendly rugs for your balcony. Photo: Molly CulverMeredith Owen, the founder of Meredith Owen Interiors in Austin, Texas, cozied up this tiny balcony with the addition of an outdoor rug. “Using a rug on your balcony can help to soften the hard surfaces surrounding the space, it also adds texture and pattern to an area that usually lacks much interest,” she says, adding that the right piece has a unique power to elevate a balcony’s style. When shopping for balcony rug, be sure to purchase those made from synthetic, UV-friendly, durable materials like polypropylene or polyester—as Owen explains, this is the best way to prevent mold and mildew.Maximize your seating potentialConsider side tables that double as seating for smaller balcony spaces. Photo: Ethan TweedieTake a cue from Drake Interiors designer and founder Elizabeth Drake and incorporate some recliners to take your balcony design scheme to the next level. “Once seated, being able to put your feet up gives that resort feel—you automatically shift into relaxed mode,” notes the the Winnetka, Illinois–based expert. “A truly comfortable chaise will invite lingering over a drink, slowing down to take in the view.” Plus, she adds, a chaise is long enough for two people to sit on it together side-by-side. When selecting side tables for the balcony, consider going with classic garden stools instead of your typical small table. “They’re drag-able, durable, and decorative,” Drake notes. Plus, she says, they can double as extra seating. And if you opt for ceramic or metal material, you can easily forgo the coasters too.Skip the hammock in favor of a swingSwinging seating provides a touch of whimsy. Photo: Tyler HoganWhy settle for an ordinary bench when you can opt for a swinging one? “The feeling of being suspended in the air with a gentle sway creates a wonderful zen moment,” says Tiffani Baumgart, the founder of Tiffani Baumgart Interiors in San Diego, California. If your balcony offers a bit more space, you can even consider a suspended daybed, which the designer notes is full of all kinds of possibilities: “Read a book, enjoy a cocktail, or go into full siesta mode!” Pro design tip: Place a throw on your swing or daybed to stay cozy on chillier evenings.Look to your home’s interior design for color inspoConsider nodding to your home’s interior color palette on your balcony. Photo: Matthew MillmanWhen selecting textiles for outdoor use, you will, of course, want to opt for weather-resilient fabric, but you should also look to the interior design of your home for cues. “We aim to keep the feeling of the inside of the house…with fabrics that have a similar feel and palette,” says Jeffry Weisman, the cofounder of Fisher Weisman in San Francisco.Add an awning or a trellis to create a cozy indoor vibe outsideAdd an awning to your balcony space to make a personal sanctuary that works rain or shine. Photo: Michael StavaridisAn awning can make your balcony feel more like a true piece of your home when it’s available for lounging regardless of rainy weather. Add height and visual interest to the balcony with a trellis, as Keith Williams, the cofounder of Nievera Williams in Palm Beach, Florida, did here. “They provide the feeling of an outdoor room, while still allowing light and breezes to enter the space,” the designer says. He advises looking to the architectural style of your home to select a trellis but also encourages a bit of experimentation. “Adding a hint of whimsy can enhance a not-so-interesting area,” Williams says.Go vibrantBright colors and lively patterns can invigorate even the smallest of balcony spaces. Photo: Michael WiltbankCustom drapery in a peppy “Palm Springs–meets–psychedelic rainbow” print is “a playful illustration of a whimsical threshold between indoor and outdoor,” Yates says. This balcony is located right off an entertaining area, so it was important to play to that room’s design aesthetic in order to naturally fuse the spaces together.Make use of oversized throw pillowsLarge throw pillows are a versatile, cost-effective alternative to more formal balcony seating. Photo: Björn WallanderIf you prefer a relaxed, minimalist style and don’t wish to spend much on outdoor furnishings, consider laying down some oversized throw pillows for a streamlined yet welcoming look. Opt for fabric with a bit of texture to it, drawing from whatever furniture pieces you have present to create a cohesive looking outdoor space.Adorn your balcony railings with flower boxesOverflowing flowers are the statement feature of this French Quarter, New Orleans, balcony. Photo: Eric PiaseckiEven if you don’t have room for a full-on balcony garden in your small space, hanging some planters on the railing of your balcony will instantly bring life and color to your outdoor retreat. As a bonus, your neighbors will enjoy admiring this setup from across the way too.Put down some faux turfGreen turf gives this modest balcony an earthy feel. Photo: Julie SoeferIf you’re looking for balcony decor ideas that allow you flex those DIY skills, this is the project for you. Just purchase some faux turf, which Courtnay Tartt Elias, the founder of Creative Tonic in Houston, notes is excellent for a small apartment balcony. “You can easily cut it to fit the patio or around any stairs or railings, and the installation is seamless,” she explains. It’ll stay looking good for quite some time, too, she adds, as faux turf is fairly resistant to the elements.Warm up to a fire pitA fire pit that comes complete with its own top covering provides a great centerpiece for any balcony, no matter the season. Photo: Julie SoeferSo that you can better enjoy your balcony space year round, add a fire pit. “It creates ambiance on a cool fall evening and provides cozy heat into the winter,” says Linda Eyles, the founder of Linda Eyles Design in Houston. In this instance, she added a custom top to the fire pit, allowing it to also function as a coffee table in the summer months. “It’s easy to turn on and off, which ensures that it gets a lot of use,” she adds.Don’t forget the wall decorThis balcony embraces its seaside locale with a nautical wall hanging. Photo: Stephen KarlischJust as you would in your actual living room, don’t forget to give the walls some attention when it comes to your balcony design. Here, an artful display of life vests adds a nautical touch to this outdoor space by Houston’s Lucas Eilers Design Associates, but if the maritime aesthetic doesn’t float your boat, worry not—you can truly go in any direction with your balcony wall decor.What are the best ways to decorate a small balcony on a budget?By no means do you need to break the bank in order to design the balcony of your dreams. Take to secondhand stores and Facebook Marketplace in search of preloved yet high-quality furnishings that speak to you, Yates suggests. You can also weave in some faux turf as well as plants that will last for many years on end, notes Courtnay Tartt Elias: “I love that faux turf gives you the illusion of an elevated yard in the sky!”You can also spruce up your balcony by tackling the floors—Elizabeth Drake of Drake Interiors in Winnetka, Illinois, suggests laying down black and white adhesive tiles (there are many removable, renter-friendly options on the market, too).What are some multipurpose furniture pieces to include on a small balcony?The less square footage your balcony has, the more important it is to select balcony furniture that can serve a variety of purposes. Many designers like to make use of daybeds when space allows. “Daybeds are great nap and reading spots and also allow guests to perch on both sides simultaneously for cocktail parties,” says Jeffry Weisman.Additionally, multipurpose tables are a balcony essential, notes Jeff Andrews. “Consider an adjustable height table that can transition from cocktail table to dining table or a small end table that can also double as a stool when you need extra seating in a pinch,” he offers. “Tables and seating that have built in storage are very versatile and provide a great spot to protect your outdoor cushions or accessories when not in use.”Finally, don’t forget about convertible or foldable pieces of furniture, Drake adds. “Convertible furniture offers flexibility, ensuring your balcony remains both practical and stylish,” she says.What are the best colors to decorate with on a balcony?While weighing various balcony decor ideas for your small outdoor space, look to your home’s interior design to determine what colors to bring out onto the balcony, instructs Keith Williams—and don’t be afraid to go vibrant. “Color in fabrics is a great way to add color to outdoor spaces and not have to rely on plants,” he says.What are some durable materials to incorporate on the balcony?Since the furniture and decorative items you place on the balcony will be exposed to the elements, it’s best to stick to a few tried and true materials. Drake cites teak, wrought iron, wicker, and metal as excellent weather-resistant options.As for textiles, Tiffani Baumgart recommends performance fabrics such as Sunbrella. “For many areas, having covers for your patio furniture will help ensure they last longer,” she adds.What are some items one might not think to include on a balcony but help elevate the space?Don’t be afraid to take a cue from your home’s interiors when decorating your balcony. “Make it feel like a true outdoor room and an extension of your living space,” Andrews says.This means bringing in accents such as floor coverings, decorative textiles, and beyond. “Outdoor rugs and throw pillows bring much-needed texture, coziness and color to a balcony,” says Molly Torres Portnof of Date Interiors.Finally, don’t underestimate the impact of a bit of art, even outside. “A sculptural element or a piece of art are unexpected elements to add to your balcony to elevate the space and start a conversation,” Andrews says.In order to take your balcony from good to great, think beyond the basics. Baumgart suggests weaving a buffet table into the mix; preferably a vintage piece. “The top can be used for a bar cart, inside you can store pillows and other accessories that aren’t weather-resistant,” she says.What are some pieces to avoid displaying on a balcony?While there are many items you can bring onto the balcony, some things simply do not belong there. “Be careful of lightweight furniture or you might find it in your neighbor’s pool,” Baumgart says. You’ll also want to avoid any pieces that are too “delicate” or “fussy,” Drake adds—this is an outdoor space, after all!",
