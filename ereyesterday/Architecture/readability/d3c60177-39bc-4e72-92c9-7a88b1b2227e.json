  "text": "andblack’s Cocoon Redefines Educational SpacesLocated in Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India, Cocoon is the pre-primary extension of the Bloomingdale International School, designed by andblack design studio. The project challenges traditional norms in educational architecture, emphasizing the role of design in shaping modern learning environments. The 4000 sqft extension is distinctively set apart from the main school building by a sunken courtyard that follows the site’s natural topography. Ascending towards the new extension like a hill, this courtyard doubles as a versatile space, functioning as a playground, amphitheater, or classroom, blurring the boundaries between built and natural environments. The design breaks away from conventional box-like classrooms, opting instead for fluid, interconnected spaces that promote free movement and interaction. Full-height glass panels replace solid walls, and skylights invite natural light, integrating the interior with the surrounding landscape.all images by Vinay PanjwaniCocoon’s undulating roof mimics natural hillsA key design feature is the undulating roof, which mimics natural forms such as waves or hills. ‘The building, instead of being a part of the landscape, should be a form of the landscape in itself’, share the architects at andblack. The fluid form of the roof—covered in turf and resting on an unobstructed structural space devoid of any internal supports or partitions—has been conceptualized using computational tools. The structure coats in a green grass-like surface enhancing the building’s connection to the landscape as the built form creates a cocoon-like environment for the children, encouraging play and exploration. Rather than relying on bright colors, the architecture uses the form itself to generate visual interest. The minimalist material palette, including exposed structural elements and prefabricated components, adds an element of simplicity while showcasing the honest expression of the building’s structural framework.Cocoon is the pre-primary extension of Bloomingdale International School in Vijayawada, Indiaskylights create an interplay of light and shadowThe use of prefabricated materials allows for efficient assembly and cost-effective execution. The structural core of the roof has been erected on-site using prefabricated metal sections and construction techniques that involved directing built-up beams along the X and Y axes. The required curvature has been attained by varying their heights at pre-calculated junctions. Structural complexities in achieving the external skin were resolved using ferrocement integrated with prefabricated metal circular hollow sections, which contribute to the structure’s overall tensile strength.Inside, the ceiling’s exposed structure contrasts with the exterior’s green roof, creating a visually stimulating interior space. The visual effect of this austere material palette is heightened by natural light dissipating through the skylights, punctuating the curvature at regular intervals. The interplay of light and shadow enhances the fluidity of the design and provides a dynamic learning environment. The Cocoon project showcases a great example of innovative educational architecture, redefining school spaces by merging built form, landscape, and modern technology into a cohesive, playful design that fosters creativity and learning.the 4000 sqft extension features a sunken courtyard that follows the site’s natural topographythe courtyard and roof ascend like a hill, serving as a multifunctional space for play and learningthe undulating roof mimics natural forms, creating a seamless connection with the environment",
