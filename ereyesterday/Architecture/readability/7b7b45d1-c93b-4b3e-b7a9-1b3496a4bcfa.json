Photo: ajay_suresh/Flickr (CC BY 2.0) The nonprofit National Low Income Housing Coalition has outlined several concerning items in the newly passed stopgap funding bill it says indicates a drastic and ill-timed 'underfunding' of several federal government agencies and initiatives impacting everything from homelessness to affordable housing. Despite increases to Tenant-Based Rental Assistance (TBRA), Section 811 vouchers, and other key programs, the concern is that HUD will be left with inadequate funding to meet the country’s multi-dimensional housing challenges.  This follows the warning last month by five senior Democratic senators stating that the delivery pipeline could \"fall apart completely, only making our current housing crisis worse\" with HUD's expected downsizing.  Trump had been mulling the potential elimination of the Biden-era US Interagency Council on Homelessness (USICH), which the Coalition says \"would likely run afoul of laws prohibiting the White House and administration from refusing to administer Congressionally-approved funding.\" Kate Wagner identified the push for housing justice as a critical issue for architects to become involved in a timely call to action last summer.",
