  "text": "Enter the 13th Annual A+Awards These new jury members are breaking ground in sustainable structural design, cutting-edge construction technology and research, façade innovation, and traditional material craftsmanship. From creating circular construction systems to reimagining prefabrication and exploring the artistry of local materials, their expertise drives architecture toward a more sustainable and creative future. Each brings a distinct vision that pushes the boundaries of material use, inspiring architects worldwide to rethink and elevate their work. Discover how these material pioneers are leading architecture into its next chapter. Philippe Block Professor, Co-director Block Research Group, Institute of Technology in Architecture, ETH Zurich Philippe Block is Full Professor of Architecture and Structures and head of the Institute of Technology in Architecture (ITA) at ETH Zurich, where he co-leads the Block Research Group (BRG) with Dr. Tom Van Mele, and director of the Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research (NCCR) on Digital Fabrication. He studied architecture and structural engineering at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in Belgium and at MIT in the US, where he earned his PhD in 2009. The BRG develops sustainable and circular construction solutions through the advancement of computational structural design and innovation in digital fabrication and construction. Philippe and Tom translate their research into practice, with the consultancy Foreign Engineering and the ETH spin-off VAULTED. Most significant is the development of the Rippmann Floor System (RFS), a low-carbon-footprint, fully circular prefabricated concrete floor solution. Belinda Carr ConTech Communicator and CEO, Carr Builds With a background in architecture, interior design, BIM management, building science and construction, Belinda Carr has a unique take on construction technology and innovation. Identifying a gap in the dissemination unbiased educational info in the construction tech landscape, Belinda channeled her knowledge and passion into launching a YouTube channel, social media outlets and a podcast. This platform serves as a source of truth for industry professionals and enthusiasts alike, providing the critical insights and information that were previously lacking. Belinda’s commitment to advancing the industry’s knowledge base is paralleled by her role at DPR Construction’s prefabrication team. With a vision that aligns with the innovative ethos of DPR, Belinda is helping to steer the construction industry towards a more efficient and sustainable future. Troy Donovan Principal – Façade Designer, Prism Facades Troy is a principal at Prism Façades, a design and engineering consultancy in Sydney, Australia. As a façade designer, he has developed specialist skills in the design of components and custom fabrication, which he applies to the development of new façades. He has a broad range of industry experience, and has worked in Australia, New Zealand, New York. Troy is also an accomplished illustrator and is active in the architectural community as a mentor, blogger and speaker. His enthusiasm and willingness to share has encouraged a sketching and model making culture amongst the architect’s and students he works with. Nguyen Ha Principal Designer, ARB Architects Nguyen Ha is the co-founder of arb architects Vietnam, based in Hanoi. She set up a practice office in Vietnam with two Swiss architects Kurt Aellen and Laurent Cantalou right after she returned from Switzerland, where she completed the MAS programme at the Department of Architecture at the Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETHZ). Creating the sense of serenity that architecture can provide to everyday life in every setting is the focus of architect Nguyen Ha’s work. At the same time, she always wants to search and experiment with new materials in architecture, which is why she also works as an artisan to find new forms of expression in materials. Ha collaborates with craftsmen and multi-disciplinary artists to develop projects that explore traditional materials and produces a number of contemporary installations of ceramics, lighting, and traditional toys. With a diverse jury of global experts and a global voting public, Architizer's A+Awards champions firms around the world.
