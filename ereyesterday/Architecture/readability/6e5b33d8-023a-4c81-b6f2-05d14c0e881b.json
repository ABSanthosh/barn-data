Rather than complete demolition, the design preserves and strengthens the existing building in Vietnam, creating a multi-functional space while reducing costs and construction time. Above the modified original structure, a newly constructed block introduces improved views and a stronger connection to the surrounding neighborhood.all images courtesy of TOOB StudioLong Biên House stands out with vibrant layered exteriorWith the rapid urbanization of Vietnam, many homes built in the early 2000s no longer align with the functional or aesthetic needs of the younger generation. This shift, marked by evolving lifestyles and preferences, has driven TOOB Studio’s design approach to updating Long Biên House thoughtfully, avoiding the wastefulness of unnecessary demolition.A vibrant, layered color scheme on the exterior creates an inviting and playful atmosphere, contributing to a positive connection between the home and the neighborhood.
