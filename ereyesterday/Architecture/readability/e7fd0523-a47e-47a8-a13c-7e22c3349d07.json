  "text": "The renovation of the Burrell Collection museum in Glasgow by British studio John McAslan + Partners has won the RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland award for 2024. Completed in 2022, the museum refurbishment by John McAslan + Partners involved the expansion and renewal of the 20th-century building, originally designed by Barry Gasson Architects. Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland (RIAS) said the jury praised the design for its \"respectful approach\" that retains the museum's \"architectural integrity\". The refurbished Burrell Collection museum has been named Scotland's best new building\"There was a level of ambition to this project, which both was on the part of the client and obviously the architect that reflected quite the importance of the existing building,\" said jury chair and architect David Kohn. \"I think in a context within the UK, within Scotland of dwindling investment in arts, here was a full-blooded decision to absolutely support the arts, support this building and done with complete conviction,\" Kohn added. \"It is a cultural pursuit in which there is excellence,\" he continued. \"And it was a reminder of what architecture can do.\" The refurbishment was completed by John McAslan + PartnersThe redevelopment involved expanding the museum's collection space as well as improving access into and around it. Inside, the updated space is defined by well-lit interiors, centred around a newly-added three-storey atrium with exposed timber and concrete surfaces. The Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland Award is an annual prize named after Scottish architect Andrew Doolan who passed away in 2004. It recognises buildings of all typologies. The Burrell Collection was chosen as this year's winner ahead of four other projects. These have each been featured in a series of videos produced by Jim Stephenson and published by Dezeen and RIAS to showcase the shortlist. The redevelopment expands its collection spaceThe other four projects shortlisted were Ardoch by Moxon Architects, North Gate Social Housing by Page\\Park Architects, and The Fruitmarket Gallery and University of Aberdeen Science and Teaching Hub, both designed by Reiach and Hall Architects. Previous winners of the RIAS Andrew Doolan Best Building in Scotland award include a remote house by Ann Nisbet Studio, which won last year, and a small office and cafe by Moxon Architects, which won in 2022. The film and photography is by Jim Stephenson.
