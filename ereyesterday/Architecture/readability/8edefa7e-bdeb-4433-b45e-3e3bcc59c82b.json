  "text": "Photographs have revealed the Casa de Vidrio greenhouse in Chile by architecture studio Max Núñez Arquitectos, which has vaulted roofs made of glass bricks. Located in a private garden, Casa de Vidrio was completed late in 2018 but was recently captured by Chilean photographer Cristóbal Palma to show the fullness of the tropical plants inside. Max Núñez Arquitectos has created a greenhouse in ChileThe 130-square metre structure was created as a \"building for plants\" according to Max Núñez Arquitectos founder Max Núñez, who took cues from modern greenhouses while emphasizing the \"artificial nature\" of the natural elements contained within. To do this, Núñez created different elevations within the structure, so that the plants sit below ground level, accessible by a series of staircases that lead down from a concrete-and-steel platform ringing the interior. It has a double vaulted ceiling made of glass bricks\"Having the plants at a lower level was a way to differentiate the horizon of these plants, which are strange to the rest of the park,\" Núñez told Dezeen. \"It's a subtle way of changing the relation between the horizons of the tropical plants compared to the exterior flora as visitors move around the perimeter.\" The plants grow below ground levelThis subtle shift in elevation on the interior also allows tropical plants, such as palm trees, to grow to a fuller height. Two large vaulted ceilings also serve practical purposes. They allow the plants to plants to grow taller while refracting light so the plants inside remain in a warm environment without taking on direct sunlight. A walkway lines the perimeterNúñez noted that the use of vaulted ceilings is rare in Chile, which often sees powerful earthquakes. Though the frame of the structure appears slim, extra supports were placed throughout the vaults. Extra steel supports were also placed in the middle of the ceiling where the vaults meet and around the perimeter. These additional supports were then used to hide the water and electrical systems. Because of the low temperatures of Santiago's winter, heating elements were included around the perimeter, below the walkway. The vaults were supported by simple I-beams, and lighting was placed in the recesses to allow access during the night. Extra-translucent glass clads the exterior and the faces of the vaults. \"In this way the plants are more visible from the outside, turning the building into a large showcase that exhibits their habitants,\" said the studio. Lighting and environmental systems were placed in the steel structureOther international greenhouses include the conversion of a steelworks in China into the Expo Cultural Park Greenhouse and a research facility in California designed by Perkins\u0026Will with greenhouses on top. The photography is by Cristóbal Palma.
