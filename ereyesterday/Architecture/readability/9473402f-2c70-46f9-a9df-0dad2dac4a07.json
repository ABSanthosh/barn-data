Temporarily located at 6 East 57th Street while its 5th Avenue flagship undergoes renovation, this store offers New Yorkers a multi-faceted shopping experience. Featuring an exclusive collection of items, a café, and a chocolate shop, the store will showcase Louis Vuitton’s heritage within sculptural interiors designed in collaboration with Shohei Shigematsu of OMA. Louis Vuitton’s long-standing connection to New York dates back to 1898 when the House began selling its products in the U.S. The brand opened its first standalone store in New York City on 57th Street in 1980. Now, this new 57th Street location continues the brand’s tradition of blending ‘French art de vivre’ with New York’s metropolitan energy. The store opens on November 15th, 2024 to become the largest Louis Vuitton space in the United States.images © Louis Vuittona towering atrium of soaring sculpturesLocated near the Fifth Avenue and 57th Street corner, the Louis Vuitton store occupies a landmark Art Deco building known for its large arched windows. While the exterior remains largely untouched, the store’s interior introduces visitors to a grand atrium. Designed in collaboration with designer Shohei Shigematsu of architecture studio OMA, this installation brings the French brand’s trunk-making heritage to life in the form of towering sculptures. Each of the four towers rises sixteen meters. Iconic Courrier Lozine 90 trunks are stacked and aligned to form twisting, zigzagging structures. Materials like Monogram canvas and metallic finishes bring out Louis Vuitton’s iconic designs.The atrium offers more than just towering trunks; a 16-meter-high wall made of mirrored Louis Vuitton bags creates a sculptural architectural feature. This wall, built from rows of alternating Keepall and Speedy bags, adds rhythm and movement to the store’s design. Alongside, oversized murals display the patterns of Yayoi Kusama and Takashi Murakami, nodding to the brand’s collaborations and its ongoing reinterpretation of classic motifs.interiors include repurposed furniture and locally sourced artworkA Five-Floor Exploration of Louis VuittonAcross four of the five floors, each section opens up into the central atrium, allowing natural light and an open, airy feel.
