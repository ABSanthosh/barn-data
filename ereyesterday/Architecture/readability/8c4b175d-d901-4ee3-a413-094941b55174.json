This November, architects and designers from around the world will descend upon the LUXELAKES · The Water Theater, an architectural treasure designed by Antoine Predock Architects and located in Tianfu New District, Chengdu, China. The gala is set for Thursday, November 21 and promises to be a remarkable evening of celebration for the architecture and design community. The A+Awards gala already has a long and illustrious history, and this year’s event promises to be unlike any before it. Chengdu, a thriving hub of architectural innovation, serves as the perfect backdrop for this year’s event. The city boasts more than a dozen A+Award-winning projects, making it one of China’s most significant centers of modern architecture. Guests will have the opportunity to explore Chengdu’s rich architectural landscape and experience the city’s design excellence firsthand. The A+Awards Gala is a global event honoring the innovators behind the world’s most outstanding buildings and spaces. This year’s gala will highlight the winners of the 12th Annual A+Awards, alongside a seated dinner and reception. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage with architects, designers and industry leaders from around the world. The choice of the iconic LUXELAKES · The Water Theater as the venue is symbolically fitting. The event will also serve as a party for the 13th A+Awards — currently open for entries with a Main Entry Deadline of December 5 — which is celebrating the unique talent of architects who expertly balance global challenges with local needs. Designed by the Albuquerque firm, Antoine Predock Architect, the majestic, topographic building is the product of extensive research into the people and surrounding landscape, perfectly embodying a new brand of architecture that is both innovative and deeply rooted in its context. This year’s gala will also feature speeches by this year’s A+Awards Special Honorees. These accolades recognize influential individuals, firms, or organizations that are leading the way in the field of architecture and have left an indelible mark on the built environment. Special Honorees will include: Mecanoo, Firm of the Year Award MUDA, Emerging Firm of the Year Award Vector Architects, Leadership in Design Award Sanjay Puri Architects, Sustainability in Design Award MAD Architects, Innovation in Design Award In addition to the award presentations and celebrations, Architizer will unveil the newest edition of its highly acclaimed book, “Architizer: The World’s Best Architecture.” This renowned publication showcases every winning project from the most recent A+Awards season, providing readers with a captivating journey through cutting-edge, transformative architectural designs — each described by the architects themselves. Architizer is excited to celebrate the world’s best architecture with an unforgettable gathering of glamour, inspiration, and celebration in Chengdu this November. The event will provide a platform for recognizing the extraordinary individuals and projects that shape our world, and inspire future generations of architects and designers.
