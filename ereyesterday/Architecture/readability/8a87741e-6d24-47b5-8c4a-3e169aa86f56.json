He first came to the Mediterranean island in 1971 from the village of Guardamar, in the Spanish province of Alicante, and now he is known by many simply as “Mr. Ibiza.” His long-running boutique Vicente Ganesha, which sells vintage clothes as well as his own fashion line, has reached cult status. More than 30,000 fans follow him on Instagram.Zaragoza’s popular Ibiza-themed shop is just a few steps away from his home on the famous Plaça des Parc, in the main town on the island, where tourists and locals alike sit at terraces sipping drinks or pass through on a stroll between the old town and the nearby harbor.With late-18th-century oil paintings, vases, and jugs, as well as fresh flowers all around, this corner of the apartment is a cozy nook with a wooden banquette. Zaragoza lives on the Plaça des Parc in a historic building dating from 1890 that has a view over the lively city. Two years ago, he had his 500-square-foot apartment redesigned by his friends Jaime Romano, an architect, and Roberta Jurado, an interior designer—together the couple run Romano Arquitectos on Ibiza and in Barcelona.“Vicente has been a friend of ours for years. When he bought his apartment, he thought of us right away for the renovation,” says Romano. “Roberta and I have years of experience together. Vicente wanted a well-oiled team that would work together seamlessly, understand his personality, and meet his specific expectations.”A glimpse of the compact kitchen through a set of wooden doors. Chessboard tiles add a dynamic element to the living room. The two citrus reamers in the kitchen are the iconic 1990s Juicy Salif design by Philippe Starck. One enters Zaragoza’s aerie on the top floor of a five-story building, preserved structurally just as it was built in the late 19th century. The apartment has a clear floor plan and large, beautiful windows, as architect Romano points out. “The building is a protected landmark, with the nice detail that from either side you look out onto very iconic Ibizan landmarks: the great Vara de Rey promenade and the Plaça des Parc. Zaragoza’s apartment faces the latter to the southwest, with a magnificent view of the Renaissance city walls that were part of the old town’s fortifications.”The kitchen is decorated with Indian-themed pictures in wooden frames and traditional Mediterranean tiles that give the floor a pleasant coolness. Contemporary design and art from different eras are mixed with the 1970s touches of a flokati rug, a floral throw blanket, and a transparent bubble seat. Zaragoza, whom Romano characterizes as “pretty strict,” essentially had one major wish from the creative duo. The new space needed to reflect his personality and allow him to enjoy the next stage of life comfortably and quietly. “It’s basically a single open space. The idea is that all your daily activities can take place here,” says the architect.It was a challenge to integrate the design harmoniously into the building while meeting the strict rules of landmark protection. At the same time, the architects were inspired by the heritage of the classic building itself and considered their work a privilege that comes with certain responsibilities.Elements from mobile homes and yachts inspired the design of this staircase that can be tucked away when it’s not being used. Zaragoza is sure that the blue painting he bought at the Sant Jordi flea market was done in Ibiza by an English painter in the 1960s. “Vicente wanted a single bed, like a cot, for just one person, which simplified the design process,” says Romano. “That let us create a more fluid ambience and to connect the sleeping area with the bathroom.”Another innovative feature is found in the narrow hallway where the staircase disappears into a cabinet. “It was an adaptation dictated by the floor plan,” says Romano. “Given the tight space, we didn’t want the staircase to take up too much room. The one we designed works like a staircase you might find in a mobile home or on a yacht as it’s practically built right into the cabinet. It goes up to the loft, which is used for storage space and an extra sleeping area.”Zaragoza decided on a single narrow bed, eliminating one design challenge. The Wire table paired with Wire Cone chair, both by Verner Panton, look light and casual, and at the same time a little over the top in keeping with the character of the homeowner. The apartment is done over almost exclusively in vintage furnishings, pieces that Romano is just as enthusiastic about as the color combinations that Jurado selected with Zaragoza. For the architect, the apartment reflects Zaragoza’s personality just as intended. “I think the design with all those wood elements incorporated into different parts of the apartment—from the closet to the bed, bathroom door, kitchen cabinets, kitchen entrance, and the adjoining room—works in distinct ways while giving the space a sense of unity.”This 500-square-foot apartment tour was originally published by AD Germany. It was translated by John Oseid.Brass fixtures are by the Italian brand Nicolazzi. The washbasin comes from Huguet Mallorca, while the vase is an Ibiza flea market find. Zaragoza enjoys his coffee with a view of Ibiza Town’s old city walls, brightly colored houses, and palm trees unfolding beyond his small balcony.",
