The best hybrid mattress combines the desired traits of both in one versatile build, giving you the classic, pressure-relieving feel of foam and the supportive benefits of sturdy coils. Best of all, hybrid mattresses work for all three primary sleep positions (back, stomach, and side sleeping), and they often come with a structured design that elevates (literally and figuratively) any bedroom space.Searching for the best hybrid mattress for your sleep and style? We've got you covered. We personally tested and reviewed hundreds of mattresses to determine which ones belong in your space, prioritizing hybrid mattress models that provide that coveted balance of comfort and support. Read on for our top picks, as well as what traits to look for in the best hybrid bed.The Absolute Best Hybrid Mattress: Nectar Premier HybridWith its supportive build, pressure-relieving memory foam layers, and cooling qualities, the Nectar Premier Hybrid is the Goldilocks of hybrid mattresses. Offering a luxurious feel at an affordable price, it balances your needs for soft comfort and full-body support with a breathable cotton cover, five inches of memory foam, and edge-to-edge innerspring coils. It also does an excellent job of minimizing motion transfer, which is key for those who share a bed. It’s hard to beat the 365-day trial period and lifetime warranty, too.Our Top Picks for the Best Hybrid MattressesBest Overall Hybrid Mattress: Nectar Premier HybridBest Hybrid Mattress for Back Sleepers: DreamCloud Classic HybridBest Hybrid Mattress for Couples: Helix Midnight LuxeBest Hybrid Mattress for Back Pain: Saatva ClassicBest Hybrid Mattress for Side Sleepers: Bear Elite HybridBest Firm Hybrid Mattress: The WinkBedBest Value Hybrid Mattress: Nolah EvolutionBest Cooling Hybrid Mattress: Leesa Sapira ChillBest Latex Hybrid Mattress: Birch Luxe NaturalWe take sleep seriously—so seriously, in fact, that we worked with a team of certified sleep science coaches, sleep health experts, and seasoned reviewers to test more than 500 mattresses both in their homes and at our dedicated mattress labs. We subject each mattress to a “rest test” that involves lying down or napping on the mattress to see how it feels, as well as conduct a series of objective assessments to determine how well the mattress relieves pressure, isolates motion, supports a range of body types in different sleep positions, and more. Dive into our detailed sleep product testing methodology to learn more about how we test mattresses and other sleep products.Nectar Premier Hybrid | DreamCloud Classic Hybrid | Helix Midnight Luxe | Saatva Classic | Bear Elite Hybrid | The WinkBed | Nolah Evolution | Leesa Sapira Chill | Birch Luxe NaturalBest Overall Hybrid Mattress: Nectar Premier HybridNectar Premier HybridThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: MediumTrial Period: 365 daysWarranty: LifetimeKey Product FeaturesFour inches of pressure-relieving memory foamMoisture-wicking and breathable cotton coverReinforced edge-to-edge innerspring coilsWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? A mattress brand we’re obsessed with here at AD, Nectar sells both memory foam and hybrid beds that are value-friendly yet full of high-end features. One of the brand’s more premium (yet still affordable) buys is the Nectar Premier Hybrid, a bed perfect for those who want a plush-soft feel without losing the support of coils. With its five total inches of foam layers that sit on top of the reinforced spring system, sleepers get plenty of pressure relief and full body contouring. The Nectar Premier Hybrid also has a breathable cotton cover to help regulate your temperature and prevent overheating—which is a common problem on softer mattresses.What does this mattress feel like? Our testers found the Nectar Premier Hybrid comfortable and soft to the touch, with the gentle sinking feel of memory foam. The five inches of foam up top nicely contoured around our joints, and although memory foam is notorious for trapping heat, the cover felt cool and breathable for a mattress with that much foam. Overall, the Nectar Premier Hybrid feels deeply cushioning while also supportive, and it generated only minimal movement across the bed when we shifted around, making it a great choice for those who share a bed.What do we love about this mattress? The Nectar Premier Hybrid aced our back sleeping test with virtually no pressure buildup on our pressure map, which was mostly blue (indicating low pressure). While there was a tiny bit of pressure buildup while side sleeping, we still felt very comfortable and would definitely try side sleeping on this bed. The great value is another winning factor. Between affordable price points (which are almost always lower thanks to ongoing sales), a 365-day trial period, and a lifetime warranty, you can easily feel like you’ll get your money’s worth with the Nectar Premier Hybrid.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? We’d improve the responsiveness to make changing positions easier. Foam is naturally tougher to move around on than a mattress with more spring simply because foam material is so contouring. Since the Nectar Premier Hybrid has a stacked four inches of foam on top of its coil system, we had to put in extra effort to change sleeping positions and move around on the bed. If you’re an active sleeper, you may want to seek out a more responsive bed.Overall Rating: 4.2 out of 5Support level: 4Durability: 4Motion control: 4.5Cooling: 4Edge support: 3.5Shipping, warranty, and trial: 5Best Hybrid Mattress for Back Sleepers: DreamCloud HybridDreamCloud Classic HybridThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: FirmTrial Period: 365 daysWarranty: LifetimeKey Product FeaturesBreathable cashmere blend quilted coverEight layers, including three cooling gel foam layersReinforced edge-to-edge individually-encased coilsWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? The DreamCloud Hybrid stacks eight comfortable, supportive layers in one compact package. Inside you’ll find a total of five foam layers, including three made out of cooling and contouring gel memory foam. It also has individually encased coils that work independently of one another to push back on heavier areas of the body, like the hips and low back, for increased pressure relief. Around the edges you’ll find reinforced edge support with two rows of thicker coils, making this bed easy to get in and out of (a bonus for those with injuries or mobility issues). Lastly, its yearlong trial period and lifetime warranty is hard to beat, so you can feel truly confident in your purchase.What does this mattress feel like? With its firmer feel, we found ourselves resting nicely on top of the DreamCloud Hybrid with our spines properly aligned, which is important for preventing back pain. Our back and stomach sleepers found great support and pressure relief in those two primary sleep positions. The mattress surface was also easy to move around on (a bonus for active sleepers) and the mattress did a great job of isolating motion (another bonus for couples who share a bed). With its breathable cashmere blend quilted cover, elegant design, and cushioning gel memory foam interior (paired with lifting and sturdy coils, of course), this hybrid bed feels like a luxury buy without the high price tag.What do we love about this mattress? We love that each of the DreamCloud Hybrid’s layers work differently and can be felt doing their job while laying on the bed. For instance, the transition layer, which is made of denser and thicker foam, helped absorb movement so our fellow testers weren’t disturbed when we shifted around. The upper gel memory foam layer gently cradled our hips and lower back. Just underneath, firmer foam added a layer of stability to prevent “bottoming out,” or sinking too far into the bed. The value is also top-notch—the DreamCloud Hybrid costs less than $1,000 for any size (except the split king size), is made with quality materials, and has the best warranty and trial period a buyer could ask for.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? We’d offer multiple firmness options, including a softer version. We found the DreamCloud Hybrid too firm for side sleeping and noticed pressure buildup along our shoulders. Instead, side sleepers may want to opt for a medium-soft to medium-firm mattress to ensure their shoulders and hips have enough contouring to prevent any pain.Overall Rating: 4.6 out of 5Support level: 5Durability: 5Motion control: 4Cooling: 4.5Edge support: 4Shipping, warranty, and trial: 5Best Hybrid Mattress for Couples: Helix Midnight LuxeHelix Midnight LuxeThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: Medium-firmTrial Period: 100 daysWarranty: 15 yearsKey Product FeaturesZoned lumbar support that follows the natural curvature of the spineDesigned for couples, side sleepers, and people who toss and turnAdd-on cooling pillow top available for an additional $249Why should you choose this hybrid mattress? Helix is one of our favorite mattress brands because of its use of quality materials (like breathable Tencel covers) and structured, supportive designs. Its hybrid Helix Midnight Luxe, which is one of the brand’s higher-end buys, has pressure-relieving foam layers and zoned lumbar support, or firmer and softer areas of the bed that match the natural curvature of your spine. This feature improves pressure relief without compromising on low back support. The Helix Midnight Luxe also has a luxurious pillow top layer, which you can upgrade to a cooling cover for an additional $249. Nonetheless, we found that even the bed’s standard cover has excellent cooling properties suitable for couples who overheat while sharing a bed.What does this mattress feel like? Our testers likened laying on the Helix Midnight Luxe to floating—a sensation brought out by its soft pillow top layer. If you love that “ahhhh” feeling of sinking into your bed (but not too far as to be suffocated), the Helix Midnight Luxe is one of your best bets in the hybrid category. Despite its cushioning pillow top, this mattress has excellent support along the lumbar (or lower back) region of the spine. Those of us with sensitive joints felt like our hips and shoulders were gently hugged by the plush pillow top and contouring foam layers underneath, while the thick coil system kept us sleeping on top of the mattress, rather than it. This mix of both soft and supportive should appeal to couples who need a medium-firmness that works for different body types and sleep positions. The bed also did an excellent job of isolating motion from one side to the other, which is important for couples who share a bed.What do we love about this mattress? We tested a version of the Helix Midnight Luxe with its standard cover, but even though we didn’t upgrade to the GlacioTex cooling cover it was still cool to the touch and excelled at dissipating heat. The cover felt plush and breathable, so the added cooling cover will likely amp up the chill factor even more. Its coils also pushed back on heavier parts of our bodies, like the hips and low back, which tend to need more support. The coils also added plenty of bounce to the bed, making it easy to move around on. As for our favorite and most comfortable sleeping position on this mattress, side sleeping easily took the cake. Between its ample cushioning around the hips, shoulders, and neck and plush yet contouring top feel, this bed is just soft enough to make side sleeping a pleasant experience. Stomach and back sleepers, don’t fret—this bed also offered great pressure relief in those positions as well.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? We’d improve the edge support. If you have mobility issues or trouble getting in and out of bed, note that the Helix Midnight Luxe scored lower in edge support than other mattresses on our list. If you sleep on the edge of the bed or simply need more support in those areas, you may want to seek out a firmer mattress or a mattress with reinforced edge support, like the DreamCloud Hybrid.Overall Rating: 4.2 out of 5Support level: 4.5Durability: 4Motion control: 4.5Cooling: 5Edge support: 3Shipping, warranty, and trial: 4Best Hybrid Mattress for Back Pain: Saatva ClassicSaatva ClassicThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: Plush soft, luxury firm, and firmTrial Period: 365 daysWarranty: LifetimeKey Product FeaturesDouble layer of coils for extra pressure reliefCenter-third of the bed is raised to lift the low back and hipsCradling plush Euro pillow topWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? Saatva is known across the mattress space for making back-pain-friendly beds. The brand promises chiropractor-approved back support with two independent coil layers that push back on areas that need extra lift. The center-third of the bed is raised to support the low back and hips to keep the spine in a natural gentle S-curve. As one of the most springy beds we tested, the Saatva Classic has only one foam layer of high-density memory foam to cradle the joints and contour the body for that gentle hug-like feeling many crave in a mattress.What does this mattress feel like? We tested the luxury firm version of the Saatva Classic, which we found falls in the medium-firm range. The zoned support was comfortable to sleep on and kept us lifted in a neutral spinal alignment. The three-inch pillow top added a touch of softness, and the dense memory foam layer created gentle body contouring. Edge support also stood out in this bed, and although we laid on the perimeter with our arms draped off the mattress, we never once felt like we were going to slide off the bed. This makes the Saatva Classic a good fit for those who sleep on the edge of the bed or people with mobility issues who require more support getting in and out of bed.What do we love about this mattress? The Saatva Classic feels supportive and looks high-end with its luxurious pillow top. Since it has dual coil layers (double the amount of most standard hybrid beds), the Saatva Classic is also bouncier than most and a breeze to change sleeping positions on thanks to the springy nature of coils. In fact, one of our testers belly flopped onto the mattress and bounced up like they were on a trampoline, so if you’re an active sleeper, rest assured you won’t find yourself stuck in the middle of this bed. We also love this bed for back sleeping, which is one of the best sleep positions to try if you have back pain, since it keeps your spine naturally aligned (with the help of a supportive mattress, of course). Our pressure map showed only blue, signaling no pressure buildup at all while back sleeping.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? One downside to the spring-heavy Saatva Classic is that it scored poorly for motion control, which is true of many mattresses with coils. We could feel our fellow testers moving around on the bed, and our seismograph test showed lots of motion transfer from dropping a steel ball on the bed. Couples who bed share and are sensitive sleepers may find themselves feeling every toss and turn on this hybrid mattress.Overall Rating: 4.3 out of 5Support level: 4.5Durability: 4.5Motion control: 3Cooling: 4Edge support: 5Shipping, warranty, and trial: 5Best Hybrid Mattress for Side Sleepers: Bear Elite HybridBear Elite HybridThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: Soft, medium, and firmTrial Period: 120 daysWarranty: LifetimeKey Product FeaturesCradling hand-quilted cushion coverInfused with copper, which helps dissipate heatReinforced edge coils around the perimeterWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? As our best mattress for side sleepers in the hybrid category, the Bear Elite Hybrid has a plush, hand-quilted cushion cover that cradles sensitive joints, and contouring memory foam that generates pressure relief along the shoulders and hips. While the Bear Elite Hybrid has three firmness options, we recommend the medium variation for side sleepers who want a balanced blend of plushness and support. Hot sleepers will also love the Bear Elite Hybrid, which is infused with copper throughout the top foam layer to naturally draw away heat, so the mattress stays cooler even while you’re laying on it. If you’re a side sleeper who curls up at the edge of your bed, the Bear Elite Hybrid also has reinforced edge coils to help prevent that dreaded feeling of rolling off the bed.What does this mattress feel like? We tested the medium version of the Bear Elite Hybrid, which offered gentle contouring yet kept us lifted with our spines aligned thanks to its sturdy coil system. While some hybrid beds, especially those with thicker foam layers, start to naturally sink simply due to the effects of gravity and contouring, we found the Bear Elite Hybrid suitable and equally supportive for most body types. For that reason, our testers called this bed durable. The excellent edge support also makes the Bear Elite Hybrid a good choice for people with injuries or mobility issues who require a sturdy perimeter around the bed to make it easier to get in and out of.What do we love about this mattress? The Bear Elite Hybrid has an airy and plush feel that makes it a joy to climb into. The copper-infused memory foam did its job to dissipate heat and cool our testers down. Plus, if you’re a super hot sleeper, you can also add an optional Celliant-infused cover (Celliant is another highly breathable fiber) to help regulate your body temperature even more. While the Bear Elite Hybrid is certainly a more expensive hybrid mattress, this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for when it comes to the reinforced edge coils, copper infusions, and luxurious hand-quilted cushion cover. Plus, the bed did an excellent job with motion control, making it a good choice for couples who bed share.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? Similar to the Nectar Premier Hybrid, we’d improve the responsiveness of the Bear Elite Hybrid. Since it has two foam layers just underneath the cover, you get that classic, slow-moving feel of memory foam, which, although contouring, takes away from the bed’s ease of movement. While it wasn’t exactly a challenge to shift around on this bed, it wasn’t easy either, and we had to put in more effort to change sleeping positions or get from one side of the bed to the other. This is something to keep in mind if you’re an active sleeper, since you’ll probably want a bed with a bit more bounce to prevent any middle-of-the-night frustration.Overall Rating: 4.4 out of 5Support level: 4.5Durability: 4.5Motion control: 4.5Cooling: 4.5Edge support: 4Shipping, warranty, and trial: 4.5Best Firm Hybrid Mattress: The WinkBedThe WinkBedThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: Soft, medium-firm, firm, and plus optionsTrial Period: 120 nightsWarranty: LifetimeKey Product FeaturesReinforced coils for extra supportPressure-relieving pillow topDesign emphasis on support and breathabilityWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? With its plush pillow top, pressure-relieving zoned support, and multiple firmness options, the WinkBed universally appeals to those who love a cloud-like feel as well as fans of firmer sleeping surfaces. “It has the firmest option for those who love a firm bed,” adds WinkBed tester and contributor Mark Burka. It also has a breathable and temperature-regulating Tencel cover made out of eucalyptus fibers that wicks away sweat to help keep hot sleepers cool.What does this mattress feel like? “Bouncy” and “supportive” are two words our testers used to describe the firmer option of the WinkBed. They said they felt comfortable sleeping on both their backs and stomachs because the mattress is firm enough to push back a little on the hips instead of just preventing them from dipping. They also highlighted the mattress’s extra support around the edges that allowed them to sit or lie along the sides of the bed without feeling unsteady.What do we love about this mattress? “The mattress’s hybrid components truly give you the best of both worlds at a more affordable price,” said Burka. “The WinkBed mattress technology provides strong edge support and wicks away heat, ensuring sleepers have a calm, peaceful night. Plus, for those who are hesitant about purchasing an online mattress, WinkBed provides a 120-night trial period, which is plenty of time to decide if the money was well spent.”What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? Since the firmer WinkBed offers very little body contouring, pressure relief was lacking when testers tried sleeping on their sides. And while its bounciness makes it nice and responsive, the mattress doesn't absorb a lot of motion for people who share their bed—not to a disruptive degree, but testers still noticed the other person's movement.Overall Rating: 4.4 out of 5Support level: 5Durability: 4.5Motion control: 3.5Cooling: 4.5Edge support: 4.5Shipping, warranty, and trial: 4.5Best Value Hybrid Mattress: Nolah EvolutionNolah EvolutionThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: Plush, luxury firm, and firmTrial Period: 120 daysWarranty: LifetimeKey Product FeaturesTargeted pressure relief with zoned supportOrganic cotton cover, over five inches of foam, and supportive spring coilsOption to remove 120-night trial to save $100Why should you choose this hybrid mattress? While hybrid mattresses may be somewhat more expensive than all-foam beds, it doesn’t mean you have to break the bank to bring a high-quality hybrid bed into your sleep space. Enter the Nolah Evolution, an affordable hybrid build with luxury features like zoned support and perforated foam to help circulate air throughout the bed. This mattress starts at $1,499, although the price is almost always lower with ongoing promotions, and it comes with an industry leading lifetime warranty.What does this mattress feel like? Commerce editor Audrey Lee said, “Falling asleep in this bed feels like a treat, especially after a long day. In the past I’ve experienced adjustment periods where my body needs time to get used to a mattress, but not with Nolah, which let me get a full night of solid sleep from the get-go.” She also called the luxury firm model a true medium, which was the perfect sweet spot for side sleeping. “Prior to testing the Evolution, I had slept on both a too-firm mattress and a too-soft all-foam mattress that just didn’t do any favors for my back,” Audrey continued. “As someone who's suffered chronic joint and back pain, I found this design’s contouring quality was top-tier for pressure relief, but I still had ample support thanks to the coils.”What do we love about this mattress? We love that Nolah Evolution is inclusive of all potential buyers and offers a Comfort+ option with more support for individuals who weigh more than 300 pounds. We also appreciated that the luxury firm version kept our spines aligned in all three primary sleep positions, making it a universal bed for side, back, and stomach sleepers. The Nolah Evolution also has an impressive 15-inch height without a muffin-top look, which will add dimension to any bed (but keep in mind you may need deep-pocketed sheets). With its high-end look and value price, the Nolah Evolution is a steal—and you can save even more by foregoing the 120-night trial.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? One of our testers found the luxury firm version of the Nolah Evolution generated slight shoulder pressure. While this shouldn’t bother most sleepers, those with sensitive shoulders or shoulder injuries may want to opt for the plush version of the bed to get a bit more cradling around these sensitive areas.Overall Rating: 4.3 out of 5Support level: 4Durability: 4Motion control: 4Cooling: 4.5Edge support: 5Shipping, warranty, and trial: 4.5Best Cooling Hybrid Mattress: Leesa Sapira ChillLeesa Sapira ChillThe BasicsMattress type: HybridFirmness: Plush, medium-firm, and firmTrial Period: 100 daysWarranty: 10 yearsKey Product FeaturesAiry quilted top coverCooling gel-infused foam layersBreathable coils base that helps circulate airWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? The good news about hybrid beds is that most are naturally cooling thanks to the combination of coil systems, which circulate air throughout the bed, and foam layers often infused with cooling gel or copper. If you’re looking for an ultracool bed that takes it up a notch, look no further than the Leesa Sapira Chill. Besides its clever name, the Leesa Sapira Chill has plenty of cooling properties that help it live up to its title. For instance, it has a quilted top cover that helps regulate temperature, as well as a copper-infused memory foam layer that naturally dissipates heat. With its more than 1,000 individually wrapped coils, you’ll also get great air circulation throughout the bed (compressing the coils pushes air upwards, helping you stay cool at night). You can also tailor your comfort level by choosing from a plush, medium-firm, or firm hybrid mattress.What does this mattress feel like? We tested the medium-firm model of the Leesa Sapira Chill and can indeed confirm it kept us cool while laying on it. We found ourselves staying at a comfortable temperature, and the various cooling properties worked well together. In addition, we found the medium-firm bed had a great blend of softness from its plush top layer and excellent lift from its firmer foam layers and durable spring interior. In fact, our spines stayed in proper alignment in all three primary sleep positions (and our pressure map confirmed almost no pressure buildup), making this bed a universal choice for all sleepers. Combo sleepers will also be happy to know that we had no issues at all moving around on this bed, so you don’t have to worry about active sleeping or shifting around from side to side.What do we love about this mattress? The Leesa Sapira Chill has a high-end feel with its cooling properties, support, and plush pillow top layer. We also loved how well the medium-firm model worked for all sleeping positions, but appreciated being able to tailor this bed to our ideal level of firmness (which isn’t always the case, because some hybrid beds come in only one firmness option). With its low-to-no pressure buildup and excellent spinal alignment, we also feel confident in sleeping on this bed with back, shoulder, or hip pain.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? Our testers who weigh more than 130 pounds found that the Leesa Sapira Chill was slightly too plush for stomach sleeping. While lightweight stomach sleepers likely won’t experience any issues, heavier stomach sleepers may want to opt for a firmer mattress to stay lifted up on top of the bed while sleeping.Overall Rating: 4.2 out of 5Support level: 4.5Durability: 4Motion control: 4Cooling: 4.5Edge support: 4Shipping, warranty, and trial: 4Best Latex Hybrid Mattress: Birch Luxe NaturalBirch Luxe NaturalThe BasicsMattress type: Latex hybridFirmness: FirmTrial Period: 100 daysWarranty: 25 yearsKey Product FeaturesMade with naturally hypoallergenic latex foamUses organic materials, like cotton and woolUp to 1,000 individually wrapped coils for targeted supportWhy should you choose this hybrid mattress? A latex hybrid mattress is an excellent choice for people with allergies or sensitive skin, since latex is naturally hypoallergenic. The Birch Luxe Natural is our best latex hybrid mattress because it’s also made with premium materials like organic cotton and wool (both temperature regulating), which is a bonus for hot sleepers and those who care about what materials their beds are made out of. You’ll get gentle cradling from the plush Euro top cover, but plenty of lift and support from up to 1,000 individually wrapped coils. Latex material also tends to last longer, so you may get extra years out of this mattress.What does this mattress feel like? Our testers found that the coil zoning worked accordingly by keeping the hips lifted and lower back supported, which is essential for preventing back pain. While the Birch Luxe Natural doesn’t have any additional built-in cooling features, we also found that its array of breathable materials, like cotton, wool, and latex, did a fantastic job keeping our mattress at a comfortable temperature. If you sleep hot, the Birch Luxe Natural may help prevent overheating that can then lead to tossing and turning. Motion transfer was also minimal, and our seismograph detected only slight movement during our steel ball drop test. This is surprising for a latex bed, since latex tends to be a naturally bouncier material. Nonetheless, the Birch Luxe Natural still maintained good responsiveness, and we found it easy to change sleeping positions on this bed. Whether you’re a hot sleeper, active sleeper, or you have allergies, the Birch Luxe Natural is a versatile choice that suits various needs.What do we love about this mattress? The Birch Luxe Natural’s organic and sustainable build is what really stands out to us. While it may be pricier, you get what you pay for with high-end materials like organic cotton, wool, and latex, plus recycled steel coils that help make this bed eco-friendly. The 25-year warranty is excellent, and you’ll also get free shipping with this mattress, which helps offset the higher price point. It’s also a great choice for those who prefer a firmer-feeling bed, such as back and stomach sleepers.What would we change, if anything, about this mattress? The Birch Luxe Natural was too firm for side sleeping, and we experienced pressure buildup at the shoulders and hips. If you have hip or shoulder pain, you’ll want to avoid this bed and opt for a softer hybrid mattress, like the Nectar Premier Hybrid. Edge support was also average, and although the sides held up well while laying on them, they sank substantially when we sat on them. If you have mobility issues, you may find the edges not supportive enough for easily climbing in or out of the bed.Overall Rating: 4.1 out of 5Support level: 4.5Durability: 4Motion control: 4Cooling: 4.5Edge support: 3Shipping, warranty, and trial: 4.5More AD-Approved MattressesOur team determined several runner-up hybrid beds that didn’t make our final list but are still top hybrid mattresses worth considering for your bedroom and sleep.Emma Mattress Hybrid Comfort: A great pick for back and stomach sleepers alike, the Emma Hybrid Comfort packs in plenty of comfort features that rival those of luxury mattresses at an affordable price. For instance, it has five support zones that match the natural curvature of your spine, so your body stays lifted in all the right places. It also has perforated foam that helps push air throughout the bed, promoting cooler sleep at night.Purple RestorePremier Hybrid: The Purple Hybrid is an excellent choice for those who adore a seriously contouring bed. Its trademark flexible Purple Grid and comfort foam layers adapt to your body shape and movements, and an edge-to-edge coil system also keeps your body lifted and spine naturally aligned.Layla Hybrid: Infused with copper, which naturally dissipates heat, the Layla Hybrid is one of our top picks for hot sleepers. It’s also a flippable bed with a firm side and soft side, so you can pick and choose (or change up) your ideal level of firmness for sleep.How We Choose the Best Hybrid MattressesWe brought out our (admittedly) nerdy side to test and vet more than 100 mattresses to determine which were truly the best of the hybrid bunch. While we laid on each mattress the same way you might in a store to gauge its subjective comfort, responsiveness, and edge control, we went above and beyond to check factors like cooling, motion control, and pressure relief. Wondering how it’s all done? Here’s a quick snapshot of our extensive mattress testing process.Cooling: We broke out our thermal gun to measure the temperature of each mattress before, during, and after laying on it, which helped us determine the starting temperature (was it cool to begin with?) and how much a mattress heated up from our body temperature. We also measured how quickly the mattress cooled down.Motion control: Beyond simply moving around on a bed while a fellow tester relaxed on the other side, we dropped steel balls from various heights to determine how much movement they generated. These movements were measured by an instrument known as a seismograph.Pressure relief: We have a pressure map that lights up red, yellow, green, or blue from heat signals to correspond with how much pressure a mattress creates. Red signals high pressure buildup (a.k.a. lots of aches) while blue means no pressure buildup was detected. We employed our pressure map in all three primary sleep positions (side, back, and stomach).Lastly, we factored in other elements important to buyers like price, warranty, trial period, brand reputation, and hybrid mattress reviews from verified customers. These details helped us identify common themes that customers might experience with their mattresses—both good and bad.For a full rundown of our mattress testing process (and to discover how much we nerd out on sleep technology), check out our full sleep product testing methodology.What You Should Look for in a Hybrid MattressNo two hybrid mattresses are exactly the same, which is why you should take a few factors into consideration to determine which hybrid mattress is ultimately right for you. Keep these tips in mind when shopping for a hybrid bed that matches your sleep style, preferences, and budget.FirmnessFirmness is subjective, so what might feel comfortable to one person might feel too firm or too soft for your taste. Here are a few quick guidelines for determining your ideal firmness: Firm beds are generally best for back and stomach sleepers who require the extra support to keep their low backs and hips lifted, which prevents “bottoming out” and sinking into the bed (a potential precursor for back pain). A medium or medium-soft bed, meanwhile, best suits side sleepers who require gentle cradling and a softer feel around sensitive joints like the shoulders and hips. While ultra-plush beds may feel heavenly at first, they likely lack the support you need to maintain the natural S-curve of your spine, and you may also wake up feeling stuck in the middle of the bed.Torn between firmness levels? Opt for a flippable mattress that has a soft side and a firm side. Remember, the right firmness for you is any level that feels comfortable and keeps your spine naturally aligned. If your hips are sinking, the bed is probably too soft, and if you wake up achy and feel like you’re sleeping on a brick, there’s a good chance your bed is too firm for you. You should feel like your weight is evenly distributed and that you’re sleeping on the bed, not in it.SupportHybrid beds are naturally more supportive thanks to their coil interiors, but there are a few other features to look for that signal a mattress has great support. Check for added lumbar support, which often comes in the form of reinforced sections around the center-third of the bed that lift your lower back. Edge-to-edge coils also boost edge support, which makes a bed easier to climb into and out of for people with injuries or mobility issues.Zoned support is another feature to keep an eye out for. This means the bed has slightly firmer and softer sections (similar to added lumbar support) that match the natural S-curve of your spine. Seeking out pressure relief in particular? Look for beds with contouring memory foam. Be sure to check coil count, too. The more coils a bed is made with, the more it can contour to the curves of your body.MaterialsThe materials your mattress is made out of can make a huge difference in your comfort and quality of sleep. Hot sleepers want to look for a bed with a breathable cotton cover and copper- or gel-infused foam, which both can help dissipate heat. Coils, likewise, help circulate air through a mattress. Latex is another naturally temperature-regulating material that’s also hypoallergenic, making it an excellent material for those with allergies or sensitive skin. Keep in mind that memory foam is prone to trapping heat, so if you’re looking for a cooling bed, you may want to consider opting for a hybrid build, which still has contouring foam layers but gets more air moving throughout the bed thanks to its coil interior.Motion ControlHybrid beds tend to rank lower in motion control than their foam-only counterparts simply because foam material does a better job of absorbing movement. But that doesn’t mean all hybrid beds won’t give you the motion control you’re seeking. In short, motion control, or motion isolation, is the ability of a mattress to isolate movement on one side of the bed that would otherwise be felt by a bed partner on the opposite side. This means that if you toss and turn, a bed with good motion control will absorb the movements enough that the person sharing a bed with you won’t be disturbed. A bed with multiple contouring foam layers will probably do better in motion isolation than a bed with only one or two foam layers. Motion control is also important for people with pets or small children that like to share a bed with them.ResponsivenessWhile hybrid beds don’t always score high in motion control, they tend to offer great responsiveness. Responsiveness is the ability to easily move around on top of the mattress, which is important for active sleepers who often shift positions. Since coils are naturally springy, they make a bed more bouncy, which helps prevent feeling stuck while changing positions or moving from one side of the bed to the other. While beds with thicker foam layers may offer better motion control, the opposite is true for responsiveness. Memory foam contours around your body, which may require you to put in more effort to move around. You’ll likely get more bounce out of a bed with a higher coil-to-foam ratio.ValueValue goes beyond simply the price tag of a mattress (which, of course, matters). For the best price, we always recommend checking out mattresses on Amazon and their official brand websites for any ongoing deals or promotions that you can take advantage of. A mattress-in-a-box will also likely be less expensive than a mattress delivered to your room with white glove delivery.However, you want to dig deeper than face value to determine whether a mattress is ultimately worth buying. Look for generous trial periods that let you test your mattress for multiple months to a full year. Since a mattress can take awhile to break in, you want enough time to determine if the final feel of your mattress is right for you. Likewise, if you try a mattress in a store, remember that the brand new mattress that arrives at your door may not feel the same way at first.Warranty is also important since it covers any defects, and some warranties even cover spills and stains. Many warranty programs replace your mattress in the event there’s something wrong with it, which is why a lifetime warranty is such an attractive feature.Benefits of a Hybrid MattressA hybrid bed comes with many perks that make it a leading mattress type. Here’s why you may want to consider investing in a hybrid mattress:A hybrid mattress will likely be cooler than an all-foam bed (which is prone to trapping heat) because the coil system helps push airflow throughout the mattress.A hybrid mattress offers excellent low back and hip support because the study coils help keep your body lifted and spine in natural alignment.A hybrid mattress offers targeted pressure relief because the coils have more give under wider body parts, like the shoulders.A hybrid mattress will likely be easier to move around on than an all-foam bed because the coils create plenty of bounce, which makes changing sleeping positions a breeze.A hybrid mattress tends to have stronger edge support because of its coil base.Who Are Hybrid Mattresses Best for?Hybrid mattresses are a great choice for active or combination sleepers who move around often and change positions throughout the night. They’re also excellent for people with back pain thanks to their increased support from coils, which help lift the body into proper spinal alignment. Hybrid beds are also good for hot sleepers, since the coils help push airflow throughout the mattress.Should Anyone Avoid a Hybrid Mattress?While no one should necessarily avoid a hybrid mattress, they may not be the best choice for everyone. If you prefer a classic slow-moving memory foam feel without the additional spring of a coil system, an all-foam bed will likely be better for you. Likewise, those seeking out a highly structured bed that’s extra supportive may want to opt for an innerspring mattress with minimal cushioning.FAQsIs it better to have a foam or hybrid mattress?Whether a foam or hybrid mattress is best for you is ultimately a personal choice. A foam bed will likely do a better job of isolating motion since foam material soaks up movement, making it a good choice for couples. Meanwhile, a hybrid mattress may be more structured and supportive than a foam bed, especially around the edges, which may make it safer to lay on for edge sleepers or people with mobility issues who have a tough time getting in and out of bed.Do hybrid mattresses sag over time?Any mattress is prone to potentially sagging, including hybrid beds. As coils lose their tension over time, you might start to notice areas that sag, especially near the middle of the bed. When this happens, it’s usually a sign that your mattress is due to be replaced.Do I need a box spring for a hybrid mattress?A box spring isn’t necessary for a hybrid mattress and may actually hinder its stability. Instead, a foundation, platform, or adjustable base can help lift your mattress to a comfortable height without taking away any of its structure or support.Are hybrid mattresses good for side sleepers?A hybrid mattress can be a great choice for side sleepers looking for the gentle contouring of foam and the support of coils. The trick is to choose a hybrid mattress that’s slightly softer—ideally a medium-soft to medium-firm build—because a mattress that’s too firm will create pressure buildup under sensitive shoulders and hips.Are hybrid mattresses worth it?While hybrid mattresses tend to be more expensive than their all-foam and innerspring counterparts, many sleepers find them to be worth the cost due to how well they balance overall comfort and support. Hybrid designs are especially helpful for people who need to prioritize their spine alignment, as well as those two tend to sleep hot and switch sleeping positions throughout the night.",

\u003cem\u003eAD,\u003c/em\u003e Nectar sells both memory foam and hybrid beds that are value-friendly yet full of high-end features. One of the brand’s more premium (yet still affordable) buys is the Nectar Premier Hybrid, a bed perfect for those who want a plush-soft feel without losing the support of coils. With its five total inches of foam layers that sit on top of the reinforced spring system, sleepers get plenty of pressure relief and full body contouring. The Nectar Premier Hybrid also has a breathable cotton cover to help regulate your temperature and prevent overheating—which is a common problem on softer mattresses.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e Our testers found the Nectar Premier Hybrid comfortable and soft to the touch, with the gentle sinking feel of memory foam. The five inches of foam up top nicely contoured around our joints, and although memory foam is notorious for trapping heat, the cover felt cool and breathable for a mattress with that much foam. Overall, the Nectar Premier Hybrid feels deeply cushioning while also supportive, and it generated only minimal movement across the bed when we shifted around, making it a great choice for those who share a bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e The Nectar Premier Hybrid aced our back sleeping test with virtually no pressure buildup on our pressure map, which was mostly blue (indicating low pressure). While there was a tiny bit of pressure buildup while side sleeping, we still felt very comfortable and would definitely try side sleeping on this bed. The great value is another winning factor. Between affordable price points (which are almost always lower thanks to ongoing sales), a 365-day trial period, and a lifetime warranty, you can easily feel like you’ll get your money’s worth with the Nectar Premier Hybrid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would we change, if anything, about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e We’d improve the responsiveness to make changing positions easier. Foam is naturally tougher to move around on than a mattress with more spring simply because foam material is so contouring. Since the Nectar Premier Hybrid has a stacked four inches of foam on top of its coil system, we had to put in extra effort to change sleeping positions and move around on the bed. If you’re an active sleeper, you may want to seek out a more responsive bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverall Rating: 4.2 out of

Inside you’ll find a total of five foam layers, including three made out of cooling and contouring gel memory foam. It also has individually encased coils that work independently of one another to push back on heavier areas of the body, like the hips and low back, for increased pressure relief. Around the edges you’ll find reinforced edge support with two rows of thicker coils, making this bed easy to get in and out of (a bonus for those with injuries or mobility issues). Lastly, its yearlong trial period and lifetime warranty is hard to beat, so you can feel truly confident in your purchase.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e With its firmer feel, we found ourselves resting nicely on top of the DreamCloud Hybrid with our spines properly aligned, which is important for preventing back pain. Our back and stomach sleepers found great support and pressure relief in those two primary sleep positions. The mattress surface was also easy to move around on (a bonus for active sleepers) and the mattress did a great job of isolating motion (another bonus for couples who share a bed). With its breathable cashmere blend quilted cover, elegant design, and cushioning gel memory foam interior (paired with lifting and sturdy coils, of course), this hybrid bed feels like a luxury buy without the high price tag.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e We love that each of the DreamCloud Hybrid’s layers work differently and can be felt doing their job while laying on the bed. For instance, the transition layer, which is made of denser and thicker foam, helped absorb movement so our fellow testers weren’t disturbed when we shifted around. The upper gel memory foam layer gently cradled our hips and lower back. Just underneath, firmer foam added a layer of stability to prevent “bottoming out,” or sinking too far into the bed. The value is also top-notch—the DreamCloud Hybrid costs less than $1,000 for any size (except the split king size), is made with quality materials, and has the best warranty and trial period a buyer could ask for.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would we change, if anything, about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e We’d offer multiple firmness options, including a softer version.

mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e Helix is one of our favorite \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattress-brands\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emattress brands\u003c/a\u003e because of its use of quality materials (like breathable Tencel covers) and structured, supportive designs. Its hybrid Helix Midnight Luxe, which is one of the brand’s higher-end buys, has pressure-relieving foam layers and zoned lumbar support, or firmer and softer areas of the bed that match the natural curvature of your spine. This feature improves pressure relief without compromising on low back support. The Helix Midnight Luxe also has a luxurious pillow top layer, which you can upgrade to a cooling cover for an additional $249. Nonetheless, we found that even the bed’s standard cover has excellent cooling properties suitable for couples who overheat while sharing a bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e Our testers likened laying on the Helix Midnight Luxe to floating—a sensation brought out by its soft pillow top layer. If you love that “ahhhh” feeling of sinking into your bed (but not too far as to be suffocated), the Helix Midnight Luxe is one of your best bets in the hybrid category. Despite its cushioning pillow top, this mattress has excellent support along the lumbar (or lower back) region of the spine. Those of us with sensitive joints felt like our hips and shoulders were gently hugged by the plush pillow top and contouring foam layers underneath, while the thick coil system kept us sleeping on top of the mattress, rather than it. This mix of both soft and supportive should appeal to couples who need a medium-firmness that works for different body types and sleep positions. The bed also did an excellent job of isolating motion from one side to the other, which is important for couples who share a bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e We tested a version of the Helix Midnight Luxe with its standard cover, but even though we didn’t upgrade to the GlacioTex cooling cover it was still cool to the touch and excelled at dissipating heat. The cover felt plush and breathable, so the added cooling cover will likely amp up the chill factor even more. Its coils also pushed back on heavier parts of our bodies, like the hips and low back, which tend to need more support. The coils also added plenty of bounce to the bed, making it easy to move around on. As for our favorite and most comfortable sleeping position on this mattress, side sleeping easily took the cake. Between its ample cushioning around the hips, shoulders, and neck and plush yet contouring top feel, this bed is just soft enough to make side sleeping a pleasant experience. Stomach and back sleepers, don’t fret—this bed also offered great pressure relief in those positions as well.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would we change, if anything, about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e We’d improve the edge support. If you have mobility issues or trouble getting in and out of bed, note that the Helix Midnight Luxe scored lower in edge support than other mattresses on our list. If you sleep on the edge of the bed or simply need more support in those areas, you may want to seek out a firmer mattress or a mattress with reinforced edge support, like the DreamCloud

The center-third of the bed is raised to support the low back and hips to keep the spine in a natural gentle S-curve. As one of the most springy beds we tested, the Saatva Classic has only one foam layer of high-density memory foam to cradle the joints and contour the body for that gentle hug-like feeling many crave in a mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e We tested the luxury firm version of the Saatva Classic, which we found falls in the medium-firm range. The zoned support was comfortable to sleep on and kept us lifted in a neutral spinal alignment. The three-inch pillow top added a touch of softness, and the dense memory foam layer created gentle body contouring. Edge support also stood out in this bed, and although we laid on the perimeter with our arms draped off the mattress, we never once felt like we were going to slide off the bed. This makes the Saatva Classic a good fit for those who sleep on the edge of the bed or people with mobility issues who require more support getting in and out of bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e The Saatva Classic feels supportive and looks high-end with its luxurious pillow top. Since it has dual coil layers (double the amount of most standard hybrid beds), the Saatva Classic is also bouncier than most and a breeze to change sleeping positions on thanks to the springy nature of coils. In fact, one of our testers belly flopped onto the mattress and bounced up like they were on a trampoline, so if you’re an active sleeper, rest assured you won’t find yourself stuck in the middle of this bed. We also love this bed for back sleeping, which is one of the best sleep positions to try if you have back pain, since it keeps your spine naturally aligned (with the help of a supportive mattress, of course). Our pressure map showed only blue, signaling no pressure buildup at all while back sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would we change, if anything, about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e One downside to the spring-heavy Saatva Classic is that it scored poorly for motion control, which is true of many mattresses with coils.

mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e As our \u003ca href=\"https://architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattresses-for-side-sleepers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebest mattress for side sleepers\u003c/a\u003e in the hybrid category, the Bear Elite Hybrid has a plush, hand-quilted cushion cover that cradles sensitive joints, and contouring memory foam that generates pressure relief along the shoulders and hips. While the Bear Elite Hybrid has three firmness options, we recommend the medium variation for side sleepers who want a balanced blend of plushness and support. Hot sleepers will also love the Bear Elite Hybrid, which is infused with copper throughout the top foam layer to naturally draw away heat, so the mattress stays cooler even while you’re laying on it. If you’re a side sleeper who curls up at the edge of your bed, the Bear Elite Hybrid also has reinforced edge coils to help prevent that dreaded feeling of rolling off the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e We tested the medium version of the Bear Elite Hybrid, which offered gentle contouring yet kept us lifted with our spines aligned thanks to its sturdy coil system. While some hybrid beds, especially those with thicker foam layers, start to naturally sink simply due to the effects of gravity and contouring, we found the Bear Elite Hybrid suitable and equally supportive for most body types. For that reason, our testers called this bed durable. The excellent edge support also makes the Bear Elite Hybrid a good choice for people with injuries or mobility issues who require a sturdy perimeter around the bed to make it easier to get in and out of.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e The Bear Elite Hybrid has an airy and plush feel that makes it a joy to climb into. The copper-infused memory foam did its job to dissipate heat and cool our testers down. Plus, if you’re a super hot sleeper, you can also add an optional Celliant-infused cover (Celliant is another highly breathable fiber) to help regulate your body temperature even more. While the Bear Elite Hybrid is certainly a more expensive hybrid mattress, this is one of those cases where you get what you pay for when it comes to the reinforced edge coils, copper infusions, and luxurious hand-quilted cushion cover. Plus, the bed did an excellent job with motion control, making it a good choice for couples who bed share.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would we change, if anything, about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e Similar to the Nectar Premier Hybrid, we’d improve the responsiveness of the Bear Elite Hybrid. Since it has two foam layers just underneath the cover, you get that classic, slow-moving feel of memory foam, which, although contouring, takes away from the bed’s ease of movement. While it wasn’t exactly a challenge to shift around on this bed, it wasn’t easy either, and we had to put in more effort to change sleeping positions or get from one side of the bed to the other. This is something to keep in mind if you’re an active sleeper, since you’ll probably want a bed with a bit more bounce to prevent any middle-of-the-night

They said they felt comfortable sleeping on both their backs and stomachs because the mattress is firm enough to push back a little on the hips instead of just preventing them from dipping. They also highlighted the mattress’s extra support around the edges that allowed them to sit or lie along the sides of the bed without feeling unsteady.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e “The mattress’s hybrid components truly give you the best of both worlds at a more affordable price,” said Burka. “The WinkBed mattress technology provides strong edge support and wicks away heat, ensuring sleepers have a calm, peaceful night.

In the past I’ve experienced adjustment periods where my body needs time to get used to a mattress, but not with Nolah, which let me get a full night of solid sleep from the get-go.” She also called the luxury firm model a true medium, which was the perfect sweet spot for side sleeping. “Prior to testing the Evolution, I had slept on both a too-firm mattress and a too-soft all-foam mattress that just didn’t do any favors for my back,” Audrey continued. “As someone who\u0026#39;s suffered chronic joint and back pain, I found this design’s contouring quality was top-tier for pressure relief, but I still had ample support thanks to the coils.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e We love that Nolah Evolution is inclusive of all potential buyers and offers a Comfort+ option with more support for individuals who weigh more than 300 pounds.

that most are naturally cooling thanks to the combination of coil systems, which circulate air throughout the bed, and foam layers often infused with cooling gel or copper. If you’re looking for an ultracool bed that takes it up a notch, look no further than the Leesa Sapira Chill. Besides its clever name, the Leesa Sapira Chill has plenty of cooling properties that help it live up to its title. For instance, it has a quilted top cover that helps regulate temperature, as well as a copper-infused memory foam layer that naturally dissipates heat. With its more than 1,000 individually wrapped coils, you’ll also get great air circulation throughout the bed (compressing the coils pushes air upwards, helping you stay cool at night). You can also tailor your comfort level by choosing from a plush, medium-firm, or firm hybrid mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e We tested the medium-firm model of the Leesa Sapira Chill and can indeed confirm it kept us cool while laying on it. We found ourselves staying at a comfortable temperature, and the various cooling properties worked well together. In addition, we found the medium-firm bed had a great blend of softness from its plush top layer and excellent lift from its firmer foam layers and durable spring interior. In fact, our spines stayed in proper alignment in all three primary sleep positions (and our pressure map confirmed almost no pressure buildup), making this bed a universal choice for all sleepers. Combo sleepers will also be happy to know that we had no issues at all moving around on this bed, so you don’t have to worry about active sleeping or shifting around from side to side.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e The Leesa Sapira Chill has a high-end feel with its cooling properties, support, and plush pillow top layer. We also loved how well the medium-firm model worked for all sleeping positions, but appreciated being able to tailor this bed to our ideal level of firmness (which isn’t always the case, because some hybrid beds come in only one firmness option). With its low-to-no pressure buildup and excellent spinal alignment, we also feel confident in sleeping on this bed with back, shoulder, or hip pain.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat would we change, if anything, about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e Our testers who weigh more than 130 pounds found that the Leesa Sapira Chill was slightly too plush for stomach sleeping. While lightweight stomach sleepers likely won’t experience any issues, heavier stomach sleepers may want to opt for a firmer mattress to stay lifted up on top of the bed while sleeping.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverall Rating: 4.2 out of 5\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport level:\u003c/strong\u003e

Latex material also tends to last longer, so you may get extra years out of this mattress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mattress feel like?\u003c/strong\u003e Our testers found that the coil zoning worked accordingly by keeping the hips lifted and lower back supported, which is essential for preventing back pain. While the Birch Luxe Natural doesn’t have any additional built-in cooling features, we also found that its array of breathable materials, like cotton, wool, and latex, did a fantastic job keeping our mattress at a comfortable temperature. If you sleep hot, the Birch Luxe Natural may help prevent overheating that can then lead to tossing and turning. Motion transfer was also minimal, and our seismograph detected only slight movement during our steel ball drop test. This is surprising for a latex bed, since latex tends to be a naturally bouncier material. Nonetheless, the Birch Luxe Natural still maintained good responsiveness, and we found it easy to change sleeping positions on this bed. Whether you’re a hot sleeper, active sleeper, or you have allergies, the Birch Luxe Natural is a versatile choice that suits various needs.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we love about this mattress?\u003c/strong\u003e The Birch Luxe Natural’s organic and sustainable build is what really stands out to us.

The 25-year warranty is excellent, and you’ll also get free shipping with this mattress, which helps offset the higher price point.

Keep these tips in mind when shopping for a hybrid bed that matches your sleep style, preferences, and budget.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirmness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFirmness is subjective, so what might feel comfortable to one person might feel too firm or too soft for your taste. Here are a few quick guidelines for determining your ideal firmness: Firm beds are generally best for back and \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-mattress-for-stomach-sleepers\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estomach sleepers\u003c/a\u003e who require the extra support to keep their low backs and hips lifted, which prevents “bottoming out” and sinking into the bed (a potential precursor for back pain). A medium or medium-soft bed, meanwhile, best suits side sleepers who require gentle cradling and a softer feel around sensitive joints like the shoulders and hips. While ultra-plush beds may feel heavenly at first, they likely lack the support you need to maintain the natural S-curve of your spine, and you may also wake up feeling stuck in the middle of the bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eTorn between firmness levels? Opt for a flippable mattress that has a soft side and a firm side. Remember, the right firmness for you is any level that feels comfortable and keeps your spine naturally aligned. If your hips are sinking, the bed is probably too soft, and if you wake up achy and feel like you’re sleeping on a brick, there’s a good chance your bed is too firm for you. You should feel like your weight is evenly distributed and that you’re sleeping on the bed, not in it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSupport\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHybrid beds are naturally more supportive thanks to their coil interiors, but there are a few other features to look for that signal a mattress has great support. Check for added lumbar support, which often comes in the form of reinforced sections around the center-third of the bed that lift your lower back. Edge-to-edge coils also boost edge support, which makes a bed easier to climb into and out of for people with injuries or mobility issues.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eZoned support is another feature to keep an eye out for. This means the bed has slightly firmer and softer sections (similar to added lumbar support) that match the natural S-curve of your spine. Seeking out pressure relief in particular? Look for beds with contouring memory foam. Be sure to check coil count, too. The more coils a bed is made with, the more it can contour to the curves of your body.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaterials\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe materials your mattress is made out of can make a huge difference in your comfort and quality of sleep. Hot sleepers want to look for a bed with a breathable cotton cover and copper- or gel-infused foam, which both can help dissipate heat. Coils, likewise, help circulate air through a mattress. \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/best-latex-mattress\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLatex\u003c/a\u003e is another naturally temperature-regulating material that’s also hypoallergenic, making it an excellent material for those with allergies or sensitive skin.

But that doesn’t mean all hybrid beds won’t give you the motion control you’re seeking. In short, motion control, or motion isolation, is the ability of a mattress to isolate movement on one side of the bed that would otherwise be felt by a bed partner on the opposite side. This means that if you toss and turn, a bed with good motion control will absorb the movements enough that the person sharing a bed with you won’t be disturbed. A bed with multiple contouring foam layers will probably do better in motion isolation than a bed with only one or two foam layers. Motion control is also important for people with pets or small children that like to share a bed with them.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eResponsiveness\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile hybrid beds don’t always score high in motion control, they tend to offer great responsiveness. Responsiveness is the ability to easily move around on top of the mattress, which is important for active sleepers who often shift positions. Since coils are naturally springy, they make a bed more bouncy, which helps prevent feeling stuck while changing positions or moving from one side of the bed to the other. While beds with thicker foam layers may offer better motion control, the opposite is true for responsiveness. Memory foam contours around your body, which may require you to put in more effort to move around. You’ll likely get more bounce out of a bed with a higher coil-to-foam ratio.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eValue\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eValue goes beyond simply the price tag of a mattress (which, of course, matters).

Look for generous trial periods that let you test your mattress for multiple months to a full year. Since a mattress can take awhile to break in, you want enough time to determine if the final feel of your mattress is right for you. Likewise, if you try a mattress in a store, remember that the brand new mattress that arrives at your door may not feel the same way at first.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWarranty is also important since it covers any defects, and some warranties even cover spills and stains.
