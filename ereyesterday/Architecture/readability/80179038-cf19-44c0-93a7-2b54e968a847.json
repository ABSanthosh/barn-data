  "text": "This week on Dezeen, we reported that construction of the world's tallest skyscraper, the Jeddah Tower by Adrian Smith + Gill Gordon Architecture, officially resumed in Saudi Arabia. Previously known as the Kingdom Tower, Jeddah Tower is slated to be completed by 2028. Developer Kingdom Holding Company announced that the Adrian Smith + Gill Gordon Architecture-designed project, which has been on hold since 2018, had restarted at a ceremony last week. Albania's Downtown One Tirana is one of 10 major skyscrapers expected to be completed this yearIn other architecture news, we rounded up 10 upcoming skyscrapers around the world that are set to  complete this year. Included on the list is The Henderson, a Hong Kong tower by Zaha Hadid Architects that is being constructed on the world's most expensive plot. MVRDV's Downtown One Tirana, Albania's tallest building, is also expected to make waves when completed with its distinctive pixelated facade. Elsewhere, US editor Ben Dreith outlined everything you need to know about Oklahoma City Legend's Tower – America's next tallest building. Marina Tabassum is the architect of this year's Serpentine PavilionIn the UK, Bangladeshi architect Marina Tabassum was revealed as designer of the 2025 Serpentine Pavilion, which will mark the 25th anniversary of the first pavilion created by the late Zaha Hadid. Renderings of Tabassum's design show a lightweight timber structure called A Capsule in Time – an homage to the many temporary pavilions that have graced the outside of the Serpentine Gallery in Kensington Gardens each summer. \"When conceiving our design, we reflected on the transient nature of the commission, which appears to us as a capsule of memory and time,\" said Tabassum. We published the alarming results of a survey about conditions for workers in the architecture and design industryWe also published the results of our working-conditions survey.  The survey revealed that one in five architecture and design workers are planning to leave the industry, citing high workloads, low pay and unacceptable workplace behaviour as motivators to quit their trade. \"It's important to note that these only represent a small proportion of the total responses and are among the most extreme cases,\" wrote Barker. \"Most people that responded to our survey indicated that they enjoy their jobs overall. However, they demonstrate that the very worst types of professional conditions in the field are more than isolated incidents.\" Justin Shubow spoke to Dezeen about Donald Trump's classical architecture executive orderFollowing last week's news that recently inaugurated US president Donald Trump signed an executive order to promote \"beautiful federal civic architecture\", Dezeen spoke to National Civic Art Society president Justin Shubow about the \"extremely concerned\" reaction from the American Institute of Architects (AIA). Despite the AIA's belief that the order would \"stifle innovation\", Shubow claimed that the architecture profession is overreacting in this interview with editor Tom Ravenscroft. Hyundai revealed concept designs for electric rickshawsIn design news, car manufacturer Hyundai revealed concept designs for electric rickshaws that aim to provide a practical and low-emissions solution for urban transportation.
