  "text": "Nestled in the heart of Manhattan Beach, California, Zen House by Minarc fuses modern design with a tranquil, nature-inspired ambiance. Created for software developers and their family, this residence accommodates both daily living and visiting loved ones, all while emphasizing an active and outdoor lifestyle. The property consists of a sleek two-story main residence and a well-integrated Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) guest suite. Zen House draws heavily from the family’s travels, particularly their fondness for Bali, Indonesia. Guests are welcomed by an inviting outdoor courtyard featuring a koi fish pond and a calming water feature, which serves as a natural buffer to minimize street noise. The soothing sounds of flowing water and the visual serenity of the pond create a meditative environment. Complementing this serene entry, olive trees evoke cherished memories from family vacations in Greece and Italy, reinforcing the home’s connection to nature and travel. A key element of the design is the fluidity between indoor and outdoor spaces. Large sliding doors and expansive windows maximize natural light and facilitate cross-ventilation, ensuring that the home remains airy and bright throughout the day. An open roof deck, strategically placed above part of the first floor, provides a versatile outdoor area with sweeping views of the pool and surrounding landscape. Additionally, a basketball court adjacent to the pool links the ADU to the main home, establishing a dynamic recreational space for the family and their visitors. The interior of Zen House reflects a carefully curated blend of natural materials and a restrained color palette. Wood, concrete, and fire elements come together to create a warm, peaceful atmosphere that encourages relaxation. The subdued hues allow the raw beauty of these materials to take center stage. The homeowners played an active role in the design process, with the husband handcrafting all the cabinets throughout the home. Using sustainable Valchromat MDF, finished with natural wood veneers or high-pressure laminates, the custom cabinetry adds a personal and environmentally conscious touch to the living spaces. The residence balances openness and privacy by incorporating modest yet functional private spaces. Bedrooms and five accompanying bathrooms provide ample room for both family members and guests, ensuring comfort without compromising the home’s minimalist aesthetic. Thoughtful space planning allows for easy transitions between communal and private areas, enhancing the overall livability of the home. Minarc’s dedication to sustainability is evident throughout the project. The home utilizes Kebony modified lumber for cladding, decking, and fencing, chosen for its durability and minimal environmental impact. Prefabricated mnmMOD panels were employed during construction, offering superior insulation and reducing waste through precise assembly. This approach not only enhances energy efficiency but also helps maintain consistent indoor temperatures, minimizing the need for traditional heating and cooling systems. The integration of radiant floor heating powered by heat pumps and high-efficiency appliances further reduces the home’s carbon footprint, contributing to a sustainable and comfortable living environment.
