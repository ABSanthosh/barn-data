However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.My impression of bath mats, from years of owning ones that end up getting soggy on contact, was that there was little to nothing to do about mildew, puddles of water, and discoloration. A bath mat was one of those things in the home that was, and would always be, gross—much like a sponge, or a shower curtain. Mold would slowly, surely, and then viciously appear, and the least you could do was be grateful for its brief, mediating performance before you inevitably considered tossing the whole thing.When Dorai (the Japanese word for “dry”) pitched me their diatomaceous earth bath mat, my instinct told me this was some As Seen On TV gimmick. Many times I have been promised this bath mat doesn’t mold, or dries quickly, or doesn’t slide around, or lasts beyond a six-month mark. But this research-backed bath mat caught my attention. Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring mineral made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, hard-shelled microalgae with silica-rich skeletons. It’s essentially super compressed minerals that, when compacted, feel like stone. It’s incredibly porous, causing moisture to evaporate rapidly, and holds up to 150% of its weight in water. According to marketing, it’s allegedly quick-drying and hygienic, too, so I thought, Sure. We’ll just see about that.Dorai Bath Stone MatThe specsThis bath mat is the size of about any other—23.6” x 15.6”. It’s made of the aforementioned diatomaceous earth, which looks and feels like natural stone or a ceramic-like material, only it adapts to the temperature of the room so you can avoid chilling your toes when stepping out of a hot shower. The natural, non-toxic and eco-friendly material is also bacteria- and odor-preventing, and dries so quickly that it stops the molding process in its tracks. It’s also blessedly anti-slip, with four rubber corner pads for traction and an an accompanying non-slip mat for good measure. The diatomaceous earth has a natural groove that keeps it from becoming slippery, even so.Another perk is its attention to design, with two minimal pattern options (a stripe and a swirl) that feel like a gorgeous blank slate compared to other squares of colored fabric that bill themselves as bath mats. My bathroom isn’t modern at all—it’s sort of twee—and still the Dorai bath stone looks perfectly suited to its environment. Along with the rubberized bottom pad, Dorai has included sandpaper for scrubbing stains or dirt off your bath mat, though after six months I’ve not had to use this once. (The stone sink caddy is another story.)The verdictThe Dorai bath stone in Harrison's aforementioned “twee” bathroom. Julia HarrisonI was compelled to write this mat review because I won’t stop talking about the Dorai. It—and I mean this as casually as possible—changed my perception of what’s possible for a bathroom mat. Water disappears within about six minutes of landing on the bath mat with 360-degree drying capability. It has revolutionized the state of my bathroom floor. This product does everything it promises: prevents mold, shows exceptional absorbency, presents an unmatched functionality in bathroom accessories, and looks good to boot.The cherry on top is that the Dorai Home is also eco-friendly, sustainably-made, and the company is female-founded. And yeah, they make a forever bath mat. I’ve even extended my fanaticism for these miracle silica-skeleton products: I now own their stone sink caddy, as well as their dish drying mat. Find mold in my home, I dare you.",
