Start your entry to receive global recognition for your work! This November, architects from around the world descended upon Chengdu, gathering to celebrate the innovators and trailblazers of the 12th Annual A+Awards program. As the warm glow of the setting sun illuminated the rosy stones and twinkled on the lake, Architizer’s vibrant celebration of the world’s best architecture began. The event was a truly global celebration graced by an inspirational line-up of emerging architectural talents and established industry leaders alike, hailing from Australia, Brazil, Philippines, Slovenia, South Africa and more. Set in the Sichuan capital’s majestic LUXELAKES · The Water Theater, a masterful design by Antoine Predock Architects, each winner in attendance took to the stage to celebrate their achievement and receive their iconic A+Awards trophy, with stunning projects showcased on the big screen. The dazzling evening also served as the perfect launch party for the 13th A+Awards season — which is now open for entries! Later, five standout firms took to the stage to receive Special Honoree Awards, starting with Nuno Fonterra of Mecanoo, winner of the Firm of the Year Award. As an architect and partner who has been with Mecanoo for over 20 years, Nuno’s career reflects the wider firm’s incredible trajectory as it has spread its wings to grow from a small and dedicated studio working in the Netherlands to a multidisciplinary architectural firm of over 130 people from 25 different nationalities, whose work remains grounded in its humanistic approach. “Receiving the Architizer Firm of the Year Award is more than just an accolade; it is a celebration of the creativity, dedication, and diversity that has defined Mecanoo for nearly four decades,” Nuno said in his acceptance speech. “It reaffirms our philosophy to design with purpose, connecting people and places, and brings the poetry of architecture to life.” While there are thousands of new architectural voices emerging each year, Architizer’s The Emerging Firm of the Year award reserved for up-and-coming firms that are challenging existing paradigms and bringing fresh perspectives for the next generation. This year, the honor when to MUDA-Architects, whose work has significantly shaped Chengdu. Founder and principal Lu Yun’s heartfelt and elegant words touched everyone in the room: “I still remember last year’s awards ceremony in Paris, and this year, being here at LUXELAKES in Chengdu feels especially meaningful, as we practice in this city. I’m also very happy to spend this wonderful evening here, with so many outstanding designers and architects from around the world.” The third speech of the night was given by special guest Dong Gong of Vector Architects, who received the accolade of Leadership in Design and explained the powerful shift underway in Chinese design: “As we witness the gradual evolution of urbanization in China, we find that architecture is not just adapting to these changes; it is transforming. The role of architecture is shifting from being a symbol of power or a landmark to becoming a mediator and coordinator in the collaborative development of our urban and rural landscapes. This transition does not imply a compromise in construction quality. Instead, it reflects a more thoughtful and intentional approach. It allows architecture to coexist harmoniously with the social, historical and natural contexts that sustain us, thereby fostering a vibrant and dynamic vitality in our cities.” Next, Sanjay Puri took to the stage to accept the visionary Sustainability in Design award in recognition of his innovation in climate-responsive architecture. Given that the firm is based in India, where roughly 90 percent of the country is considered an extreme heat danger zone, their work is remarkable, emphasizing energy efficiency, heat mitigation and passive cooling techniques. “In most cases , it is a constant battle with clients to use design elements and principles that are sustainable since the clients concerns are focused mostly on the “looks” and the “cost” of the project,” Sanjay stated. “Winning this award for sustainability makes all those numerous battles fought worthwhile and is an encouragement to search and implement more ideas creating more sustainable environments and contribute in any small way to making and ensuring that the world will be a better place, reducing carbon emissions and reducing climate change.” Finally, the Innovation in Design award went to MAD Architects, accepted by associate partner Fu Changrui: “The year 2024 marks the 20th anniversary of MAD, and it is a great honor to receive such praise and recognition. We will certainly prioritize innovation in our practice. We hope that in the future, we will continue to share more exceptional and innovative works with you.” The gala was a truly magical occasion, one where architects from around the world not only gathered to honor and celebrate each other’s work, but also engaged in meaningful conversation, grounded in inspiration, and built bridges between cultures and design approaches. This was a unique gathering of some of the industry’s brightest minds, and if it taught us anything about the state of our industry, it is this: Led by these extraordinary pioneers, the future of architecture is in good hands. Congratulations once again to the Winners of the 12th Annual A+Awards, and best of luck to this season’s participants in the world’s largest architectural awards program! Architizer's 13th A+Awards features a suite of sustainability-focused categories recognizing designers that are building a greener industry — and a better future.
