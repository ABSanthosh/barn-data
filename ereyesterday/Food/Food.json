    "description": "Everyone needs a recipe for classic, foolproof skillet french toast, even stubborn people like me who, despite making it at least once a month and more often when there’s leftover challah, are so easily bored by and restless with simple recipes that I’ve resisted writing this up for almost 19 years. I’ve filled the french toast vacuum on the site instead with customizations: casserole-style baked french toasts with cinnamon sugar toast and, uh, bailey’s (ah, the child-free years). There’s even a fancy french toast akin to individual crème brûlées. But eventually, through a combination of friends texting on random weekend mornings [“Do you seriously not have a challah french toast recipe?!”] and the existence of a teenager, who I cannot teach to make french toast for us if I haven’t written it down, I’ve come to my senses. I mean, mostly. Read more »",

The way I figure it, the sidewalks are currently covered in pink and white petal confetti, the ramps are here, and the asparagus is close, thus I’m crossing my fingers that this can be our last hurrah with heavy winter vegetables until at least November. We’re going to make it a good one. Read more »",

    "link": "https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2025/1/23/tomato-soup-with-spicy-sausage-and-orzo",
    "description": "Less of my friends are having babies and needing deliverable meals these days, but there will always be something happening in life when it feels good to give someone a dinner off. I brought this to my sisters’ family last week, after they’ve had to make a sudden move from the Palisades due to the recent fires, and I thought I’d share it here. Not only is it deliverable, but we are running a soccer schedule lately where I don’t often have time to make dinner at dinner time. I am ubering to all the sports, and I need to come home to dinner mostly made, whether I have time earlier in the day or over the weekend. This soup holds!. We’ve tried a few crockpot things, I love a sheetpan situation with a sauce, or with practice, I now remember to marinate chicken in advance, but a delicious soup like this is my favorite (not the kids per se, but we can only eat so many tacos). You can leave the soup all textured and chunky or blend the vegetables into the broth so it’s smoother (veggie averse kids may prefer this). I have this immersion blender, which has held up great the past 15 years I’ve had it. See instructions. I’ve made it both ways and everything gets eaten. Someone will ask about Instant Pot and I don’t have one so if you know them well, chime in in the comments. As for slow cookers, I think it’d all work in there if you browned the sausage on the side, but I am a brat and I like the vegetables to concentrate more like they can in a pot in shifts as opposed to being just slowly boiled in the slow cooker. I know this is a luxury of working from home, work being making said soup, but figure I’d give it to you straight ;) xoTOMATO SOUP WITH SPICY SAUSAGE + ORZOSERVES 6If you could entertain your nostalgia and imagine an adult spaghetti O’s, with a rich tomato soup, chunks of browned spicy Italian sausage, some cooked orzo and lots of parm on top, this the soup. It is perfectly deliverable too, should you want to deliver some to a sick friend or new neighbor.Keep things vegetarian by replacing the sausage with another 14 oz. can of drained white beans in its place.If you don’t have white wine open or want it to be open, a splash of any white vinegar here will be a good substitute. To keep it dairy free, just use a vegan butter or skip it. Recipe from Sprouted Kitchen Cooking Clubolive oil, as needed1 lb. spicy Italian sausage1 small yellow onion, minced2 stalks celery, minced1 large carrot, minced1 small bulb of fennel, mincedsea saltfresh ground pepper1 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped4 cloves garlic1 tsp. dried Italian seasoning2 Tbsp. tomato pastesplash of white wine1 28 oz. can crushed, fire roasted tomatoes1 qt. chicken stock1 14 oz. can cannellini beans, drained2 tsp. better than boullion, chicken flavor2 Tbsp. butter1 small bundle parsley, chopped1/3 cup orzo or ditalini pastaparmesan, for servingIn a large dutch oven, heat a generous drizzle of olive oil. Squish the sausage out of the casing and brown, breaking it up as well as you can and cook it through. Remove the sausage and set aside. Heat another drizzle of oil and once it’s hot, add the onion, celery, carrot, fennel and a big few pinches of salt and pepper. Saute these vegetables for a good 5 minutes to cook them down and just soften. Add the bell pepper, and saute another 5-10 minutes to soften. Add the garlic, Italian seasoning, tomato paste and saute another minute or two. Add a generous splash of white wine to deglaze the bottom. Stir in the roasted tomatoes and stock and put the cover on ajar, cook another 20 minutes. While you wait, start some salted water on to boil to cook the orzo or pasta. Cook al dente and drain the pasta. I know you’re thinking “can’t we just do this in the soup?” but i feel like it changes the texture and drinks up too much moisture. Turn off the heat and stir in the boullion and butter. If you like your soups chunky, you can skip the blending step, if you want it smooth, use an immersion blender to get the soup completely smooth. Add the sausage, parsley, beans and desired amount of the orzo in. Season to taste, add red pepper flakes if you want it spicier. This soup is great made in advance. It’s fine to leave the orzo in there, but it does absorb some of the moisture from the soup, so can also be held separately and added in with the reheat. Finish your bowls with some fresh parmesan.",

    "description": "She told me about what she thinks about her body; that people at her table are talking about getting married. She listens to my feedback about her effort at soccer practice and asks me to speak in a more calm voice (I wasn’t yelling for the record, but I do get passionate when I want to make a point. That point being: please act like you want to be there). He wants me to listen to the fart joke in his audio book or the techno song that he likes, even though it “feels stressful” (it does). He tears up over feeling like everyone at school just argues over football rules everyday and remarks he wants to live with us forever. I get so much from them at bed time, like everyone is ready to unload, and maybe this is a season, and one I’ll miss if it is, but when did they become people? Messy ones who still need to be reminded to put their clothes away 385798410 times, but these complicated feelings over friendship and motivation and little and big questions are pretty remarkable. I am planning some travel for a few book events, and it struck me how much I really love the ages of our kids. It’s so much easier now - they’re more flexible to take along, their thoughts are interesting and funny. I’d want to be both of their friends if I got to go back to elementary school. Curran is turning 10, I’m turning 40, a book that feels like it took forever to make it finally coming out this Spring and in a good way, it feels more like New Years than January did. At a glance, zooming out, asking questions and reorienting perspective. Here we are, and isn’t that just amazing.All those memes about how people hate that bloggers write musings instead of just post recipes. It’s not always for you, dearest recipe searcher, sometimes the writing is just as much the connection as the food is, so you’re going to have to bear with me. Many people I know who connect through making people food, are also writers and thinkers and communicators, so it’s a package deal, folks. It’s pillow talk and pasta over here. Speaking of the cookbook! Most every recipe in there has a photo except for, maybe 4? There are factors that contribute like page count and price etc. so a few final shots just didn’t make it in. Unfortunately, no photo usually means less intrigue and the recipe can get overlooked, so I’m going to highlight one of my favorites here. I love pasta with lots of bits in it and this one is heavy on the bits. My kids will eat this, picking around the extra kale and Cleo won’t actually like it, but they eat it. Either way, I do think you should put this one on your list soon.I also wanted to post a few dates for some cookbook events coming up around the time of publishing. If you live in any of these areas, I would really love to meet you! If more get added, I will include them here as a landing page.

You may end up with more kale pesto than you need for this recipe, but it has lots of other uses, such as with eggs, atop roast potatoes, or as a veggie sandwich spread. We don’t want the fresh sausage-like chorizo in tube form; instead, look for a dry chorizo, typically from Spain, not Mexico, that you will find in a well stocked cheese and deli section. It looks like salami. I do think sucessful dinner prep takes a bit of planning. The pesto can be made a few days in advance to save time. Vegetarian? Replace the chorizo with some chopped, sun dried tomatoes. Printed from Around Our Table by Sara ForteFOR THE WINTER PESTO2 cloves garlic1/4 cup pine nuts2 Tbsp. lemon juice1 cup cilantro or parsley1 packed cup lacinato kale, deribbed and chopped1 tsp. sea salt1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil1/4 cup grated parmesan cheeseFOR THE CAULIFLOWER1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 tsp. dried oreganosea salt and fresh ground pepper2 oz. dried chorizo, cut in 1” ribbons1 small bundle lacinato kale, deribbed and cut in ribbons12 oz. any short pastahalf of one lemongrated parmesan, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, for garnishMake the kale pesto. In a food processor, pulse the garlic, pine nuts and lemon juice together. Add the cilantro and/or parsley, chopped kale, salt and pepper, and run it again until well chopped. With the motor going, drizzle in the olive oil and parmesan cheese. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 425’. On a rimmed baking sheet, pile the cauliflower, and drizzle it with the olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Toss well to coat and roast for 30 minutes until the edges are toasty. To the baking sheet, add the chorizo and kale ribbons, toss everything to coat. If the sheet looks dry, add another drizzle of oil. Roast an additional 3 minutes to warm. Set aside.Cook your pasta according to instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta and put it back in the pot with a few heaping spoonfuls of the pesto and a giant splash of the pasta water. Stir to mix, we want it generously sauced. Add the contents of the baking sheet, squeeze of fresh lemon and stir again. Add more pesto if you’d like or more pasta water to loosen things up. Serve portions with a generous sprinkling of parmesan, red pepper flakes, a grind of pepper and some fresh parsley.",

But when you're a professional chef, a pizza date is almost like a cooking class. At least according to Michelle Jimenez it was. And in case you’re doubting her, she and her now-husband Andrea Meggiato turned one of those so-called pizza dates into a business—one you might’ve seen on Shark Tank or in stores like Target. “He said it would be the most unforgettable date I'd ever go on,” Michelle told me, “and he couldn't have been more right.” They went on to create The Pizza cupcake, now expanded under the new name Incredifulls.

    "description": "A lot of people grow up watching their mom cook—I was lucky enough to be one of them. Even before I could reach the counter, I was trailing behind her in the kitchen, hoping to graduate from taste tester to mixer. And while I’ve since picked up tips from test kitchens, TikTok chefs, and a lot of Ina Garten, the core of my love for cooking will always come back to my mom. That’s probably why I was so taken with Marjorie Taylor and Kendall Smith Franchini’s story. Their new cookbook, French at Heart, isn’t just a collection of classic French recipes, it’s a celebration of their shared life in food. The mother-daughter duo first made waves when they opened The Cook’s Atelier in 2008, a cooking school, culinary, and wine shop nestled in the heart of Beaune, France. Their classes now sell out months in advance, drawing guests from around the world. And yet, what makes their story stand out isn’t just the stunning Burgundy backdrop or their rustic tartines—it’s the relationship at the heart of it all. Read More \u003e\u003e",

I remembered that my Mom bought me smokebush tree for Mother’s Day maaaaaany years ago. It’s at my old house (if they didn’t get rid of it). A tree full of yellow flowers. On a walk with Lisa. In a free mini library. How appropriate. Landed on me. Mustard artistry at Phyllis’ Are you doing the most good? YAY! I am enjoying strawberry season. I am on my second draft now. We had a good cloud day. A steak salad with rice and chimichurri. Oh and picked onions too. Recipe coming soon OMG. Racing to a baseball game. HI MOM Casey was parked in this spot. I was racing through my bag trying to find the keys so I could get my umbrella out of the car and looked down and saw this. Here comes trouble. Summoning light. Bing! Mmm blueberry buckwheat pancakes with banana and peanut butter. Tracking my Tiny Little Joys in my hobonichi. THANKS FOR BRINGING JOY BACK INTO MY LIFE, MC! Reading: The Joy Reset (it came out this week!) Steak and zucchini grilled salad thing. With a feta dressing too! A new mug to bring in better energy. She is part seal. Mis en place. Baseball game snacks. Thanks for the reminder, Mom. One of the things she used to say! Found this. Old notes! This shade of red. Went for a hike with Casey. Mom and Dad say HI. I wish I could capture how beautiful the wild bachelor buttons are in the hills. A whole array of things. Trying to propagate another zz plant. Breakfast quesadilla with scrambled eggs and avocado. Tons of tapatio. Free mini library score! The light was just right. The goal is to get here in the bowl. Snack lunch. Grandpa’s Christmas cactus is having another round of blooms. Earlier this week. I captured something. Mother’s Day bonsai! Are you being naughty? Do you need to be sprayed? Leaving love notes. And then we add more. First layer. Layered. Tracy connecting with Walter at Neiley’s. She’s got craft paper on her table and I love it. BAM! First peony in my yard.",
