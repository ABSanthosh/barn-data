    "description": "Confession time! As someone with more opinions than I can fit in three cookbooks, one audiobook, and even 18 years of archives on this website, sometimes when I want to grumble about something food-related but it’s not the time or place, I tuck it in a little document called “rants” that is so full of cringe, you only have my permission to publish posthumously. But I can’t write a headnote for this particular cake without first owning up to #23 on the list in advance: “Apple cider cakes are lies.” Which begs the questions: Who hurt you, Deb? What gives? Essentially, my quibble is that you can put all of the wonderful fresh-pressed apple cider you want in a cake, but it rarely comes through to actually taste like apple cider. The flavor is not robust enough. I’m not saying it can’t be wildly delicious with all of the cinnamon spice we also put in these cakes, but it rarely, to me, tastes like an accurate representation of its name. Read more »",

Sure, I’ve got preferences (dry, easy drinking, cheap enough where I could consider buying two bottles) but they’re not deep-seated. I’ll let the person behind the counter—or bar or dining table—take me wherever they think is best. And I’m always better for it. That said, this year, we’re turning our Thanksgiving wine advice over to the professionals.

    "description": "One thing New York City always does well is host a multi-hyphenate business. Pick two or three things you love, and I guarantee there’s an existing store that offers the perfect fusion. If you love books and pickles, you can go to Sweet Pickle Books (yes, that’s a real place). If your jam is playing chess and having a drink, head to Greenwich Village. And as of last week, if your personal Venn diagram includes vintage homewares, upscale groceries, and specialty coffee, there’s now Gem Home in Nolita. Photo by Sean Davidson The shop comes from chef and restaurateur, Flynn McGarry, who got the idea from the grocer-cafes he visited as a kid in California. When he was still a teen, he became a chef and ran the cool-kid fine dining restaurant Gem in New York City for five years until he closed its doors last summer. He still runs its accompanying wine bar, Gem Wine, and the cool kids, such as Kaia Gerber, still flock. Read More \u003e\u003e",

    "description": "She told me about what she thinks about her body; that people at her table are talking about getting married. She listens to my feedback about her effort at soccer practice and asks me to speak in a more calm voice (I wasn’t yelling for the record, but I do get passionate when I want to make a point. That point being: please act like you want to be there). He wants me to listen to the fart joke in his audio book or the techno song that he likes, even though it “feels stressful” (it does). He tears up over feeling like everyone at school just argues over football rules everyday and remarks he wants to live with us forever. I get so much from them at bed time, like everyone is ready to unload, and maybe this is a season, and one I’ll miss if it is, but when did they become people? Messy ones who still need to be reminded to put their clothes away 385798410 times, but these complicated feelings over friendship and motivation and little and big questions are pretty remarkable. I am planning some travel for a few book events, and it struck me how much I really love the ages of our kids. It’s so much easier now - they’re more flexible to take along, their thoughts are interesting and funny. I’d want to be both of their friends if I got to go back to elementary school. Curran is turning 10, I’m turning 40, a book that feels like it took forever to make it finally coming out this Spring and in a good way, it feels more like New Years than January did. At a glance, zooming out, asking questions and reorienting perspective. Here we are, and isn’t that just amazing.All those memes about how people hate that bloggers write musings instead of just post recipes. It’s not always for you, dearest recipe searcher, sometimes the writing is just as much the connection as the food is, so you’re going to have to bear with me. Many people I know who connect through making people food, are also writers and thinkers and communicators, so it’s a package deal, folks. It’s pillow talk and pasta over here. Speaking of the cookbook! Most every recipe in there has a photo except for, maybe 4? There are factors that contribute like page count and price etc. so a few final shots just didn’t make it in. Unfortunately, no photo usually means less intrigue and the recipe can get overlooked, so I’m going to highlight one of my favorites here. I love pasta with lots of bits in it and this one is heavy on the bits. My kids will eat this, picking around the extra kale and Cleo won’t actually like it, but they eat it. Either way, I do think you should put this one on your list soon.I also wanted to post a few dates for some cookbook events coming up around the time of publishing. If you live in any of these areas, I would really love to meet you! If more get added, I will include them here as a landing page.

You may end up with more kale pesto than you need for this recipe, but it has lots of other uses, such as with eggs, atop roast potatoes, or as a veggie sandwich spread. We don’t want the fresh sausage-like chorizo in tube form; instead, look for a dry chorizo, typically from Spain, not Mexico, that you will find in a well stocked cheese and deli section. It looks like salami. I do think sucessful dinner prep takes a bit of planning. The pesto can be made a few days in advance to save time. Vegetarian? Replace the chorizo with some chopped, sun dried tomatoes. Printed from Around Our Table by Sara ForteFOR THE WINTER PESTO2 cloves garlic1/4 cup pine nuts2 Tbsp. lemon juice1 cup cilantro or parsley1 packed cup lacinato kale, deribbed and chopped1 tsp. sea salt1/2 tsp. fresh ground pepper1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil1/4 cup grated parmesan cheeseFOR THE CAULIFLOWER1 head cauliflower, broken into small florets3 Tbsp. extra virgin olive oil1 tsp. dried oreganosea salt and fresh ground pepper2 oz. dried chorizo, cut in 1” ribbons1 small bundle lacinato kale, deribbed and cut in ribbons12 oz. any short pastahalf of one lemongrated parmesan, red pepper flakes, fresh parsley, for garnishMake the kale pesto. In a food processor, pulse the garlic, pine nuts and lemon juice together. Add the cilantro and/or parsley, chopped kale, salt and pepper, and run it again until well chopped. With the motor going, drizzle in the olive oil and parmesan cheese. Set aside. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Preheat the oven to 425’. On a rimmed baking sheet, pile the cauliflower, and drizzle it with the olive oil, oregano, salt and pepper. Toss well to coat and roast for 30 minutes until the edges are toasty. To the baking sheet, add the chorizo and kale ribbons, toss everything to coat. If the sheet looks dry, add another drizzle of oil. Roast an additional 3 minutes to warm. Set aside.Cook your pasta according to instructions. Reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta and put it back in the pot with a few heaping spoonfuls of the pesto and a giant splash of the pasta water. Stir to mix, we want it generously sauced. Add the contents of the baking sheet, squeeze of fresh lemon and stir again. Add more pesto if you’d like or more pasta water to loosen things up. Serve portions with a generous sprinkling of parmesan, red pepper flakes, a grind of pepper and some fresh parsley.",

    "link": "https://www.sproutedkitchen.com/home/2022/2/15/after-school-banana-chocolate-chip-chunkers",
    "description": "I always buy a bundle of bananas at the market, only 1 of 4 of us actually snacks on a banana, which leaves lots of moments of overripe bananas that are too ripe for snacking but perfect for baking. 4 of 4 like the baked goods with the bananas. You’re welcome for my elementary math equation proving it is in fact, worth buying the bananas. These are my favorite sorts of treats to make for and with the kids. Everything mashes up in one bowl, they’re easy on the sugar, packs in a lunchbox and they are free of the glutens and dairy so any person that comes over with a dietary preference, has a snack. I know when we’ve made them a dozen times, they are worth sharing here, so hope you have bananas ready to go soon (extra extra brown! don’t bother if they are pretty and yellow!). xoAFTER SCHOOL BANANA CHOCOLATE CHIP CHUNKERSMakes 12Gluten free, dairy free and honestly, you can skip the egg if you need to and I believe they’ll still hold. I’ve been making these when I have dead bananas, but banana bread feels like too much. A tray of these will be gone before the end of the day and they hold up in a lunch box too. Nut allergy folks, all-purpose flour is fine. Replace the almond and coconut flours with 1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour. They will look different than what is pictured. The flax does help absorb some extra moisture, and you can pick that up and nearly any supermarket these days. Recipe riffed from Joy the Baker2 overripe, medium bananas (about 1 cup)1 egg4 Tbsp. coconut oil or warmed butter1/3 cup light brown sugar1 tsp. vanilla extract1/2 tsp. cinnamonbig pinch of salt1 cup almond flour1/4 cup old fashioned oats2 Tbsp. flax meal3 Tbsp. coconut flour1/4 tsp. baking soda 1/2 tsp. baking powder2/3 cup dark chocolate chips (or chopped chocolate)Into a mixing bowl, smash up the bananas super well, we don’t want big chunks left. Add in the egg, oil or butter, sugar, vanilla , cinnamon, salt and whisk everything together to mix. Add the almond flour, oats, flax, coconut flour, baking powder and stir again to combine. Fold in the chocolate chips. Chill the mixture for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 360’ and line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment. I make ours free-formed, not perfect balls 1) because they are tough to get into a ball and 2) I like those craggle edges! We want about 2-3 Tbsp. sized lumps, arranged with 2” of space between (they don’t spread much). Bake on the middle rack for 12-15 minutes until toasty on the edges, but still tender in the center. Remove to cool. Keep the cookies in a covered container at room temperature for up for 3 days, and in the fridge any longer than that.

    "description": "Here’s what this past week looked like- My Everyday Life Week 45 I walked to drop off our ballots. It brought up so many memories of being with my mom at the polls. She would take me every time she went and I would hang out waiting for her. It made me want to ask her so many questions. What would she have thought of our country right now? What would she have thought about Kamala?  She only experienced one year of Trump’s presidency. She’s been gone for almost 7 years. How is that possible? I asked for signs from her this week. I got them immediately.  (this was a fun one)  Here’s another sign:             View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Tracy Benjamin + MC McDonald, PhD (@keepgriefweird) Keep Grief WEIRD. Collected some of these leaves on the way and tucked them into a book.  The neighborhood plays. His hair is taffeta.  Graphic designers taking liberties. Keep libraries forever, please.  \u003c3 Speaking of libraries. Free mini library score.  The last of the zinnias. They ended up attracting ants in my bathroom.  Thanks, Mom.    Golden hour. Watching Cooper make a cappuccino.  Currently Workbooks are ready for 2025! I wrote a bit about them and my 6-year creative journey on my Substack.  I’m also selling a digital version of it too if you want to download it.  My coworker sleeps on the job. I am working on a food zine.  I made popovers this week. Perfect comfort food.    Sending out good juju to Oregon.  Got rid of stuff.  Found a rainbow in my soup.  The salvia in my front yard is making me happy.  Visitor! A messy paint job.  Laying down the layers.  Stopped by to get some emotional support.  Walter is a therapy doggo.  My favorite hoodie is so worn.  I grew this. Look at how little it is!! There was only one and it came from my compost.  The card I pulled the night of the election.  (this is the deck)    I also had this tea bag. Yes, we have a lot to learn from/about one another.  November is grief month.  Living in layers.  Comfort me in sweet potatoes.  I added granola to my salad. I think I liked it? I watched the Martha Stewart documentary (which I loved) and it brought up all of these old memories of my Mom. I found this photo this week of a party at our house when I was little. Look at the BAGEL SPREAD. My Mom looked so pretty.  This is that same spot in my house: Connecting with my spirit over milky almond tea. Grandpa’s cactus is about to bloom. I am quite excited. Beans being stoic.  Before bouncing on the trampoline for an hour.  Protein forward.  I am proud of my work,  Getting vitamin D.  I laid down on the floor to ground myself and found a french fry. oof. Cooper was away for a school retreat so I made us meatloaf because he doesn’t like it.  Saturday morning huggles.  Casey named her Laney. She has visited us twice this week.  The cards I pulled for the week. I forgot to take notes on the master healing part.  The last of the cookies that were made by girls from Cooper’s class (they dropped them off!!!). I am going to make this a postcard but I need to figure out what I am going to put on the other side. Thoughts? This is always so jarring when I get an altoid.  Saturday night fresh rolls. I prepped them for Casey to wrap. Cozy. I forgot how easy it is to make mint tea when you grow mint.  MORE OF MY EVERYDAY LIFE WEEK 45: Week 45 in 2023 Week 45 in 2022 Week 45 in 2021 Week 45 in 2020 Week 45 in 2019  Week 45 in 2018 Week 45 in 2017 Week 45 in 2016 Week 45 in 2015 Week 45 in 2014 Week 45 in 2013  Week 45 in 2012 Week 45 in 2011 I also have a newsletter! If you subscribe, you have first access to sales, fun printables, news of workshops and events!
