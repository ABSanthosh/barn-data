  "description": "One of the best ways to turn a store-bought rotisserie chicken into something truly comforting is to make a simple, homemade Chicken Soup. I made a batch before we left for Idaho earlier this month, and when we got back, I was so happy to find it waiting for me in the freezer—like a little gift to myself. I always stash some away for a rainy day because there’s nothing better than having homemade soup ready when you need it. My Chicken Soup is packed with celery, carrots, and a good dose of green from the spinach. If you know someone who’s under the weather (’tis the season!), a batch of this soup will help get them back on their feet—especially with a shot or two of my fire cider. Stay healthy out there, folks! Here’s your ingredient reference: We start with chop therapy. And my favorite – Better Than Bouillon I haven’t bought chicken stock in quite some time cuz I have this in my fridge ready to go. We sweat the onions in olive oil. Followed by the garlic. We cook the celery and carrots a little bit. We follow up with water. And then the bouillon. We give it a good stir and let it cook on the stove. We add in our chicken when the vegetables are tender. By adding the chicken at the end, we don’t overcook it. It remains nice \u0026 tender. Also if you didn’t pull off the chicken meat from the rotisserie chicken when you brought it home (it’s easier when it’s hot!), you can always drop the chicken in the soup and heat it up to make it easier. Spinach goes in. Watch it shrink! A full pot of soup. Excuse me while I huddle around this bowl… and huff in the health. If you’re also a fan of soups, here’s a link to my whole archive! This Coconut Curry Chicken Soup is one of my favorites. xo Chicken Soup Note: There is a print link embedded within this post, please visit this post to print it. makes about 4-5 servings a glug of olive oil 1 medium onion, chopped 3 cloves garlic, minced 5 stalks celery, chopped 5 carrots, chopped 5 cups water 1 heaping Tablespoons Better than Bouillon a pinch of red pepper flakes 2 cups cooked chicken, shredded 4 cups fresh spinach salt \u0026 pepper to taste Heat large pot with a glug of olive oil over medium high heat.
