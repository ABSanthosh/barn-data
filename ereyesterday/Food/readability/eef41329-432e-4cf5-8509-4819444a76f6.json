Altadena residents were familiar with one of the dozen or so wooden structures she had scattered around the neighborhood marked “Altadena Seed Library,” where people could take or leave free seeds.“Plants do so many amazing things,” she said. “They’re so intelligent.”ImageNina Raj put out a call for seeds to help rebuild Altadena gardens and wilderness.Credit...Courtesy of Nina Raj Fire is a natural part of the ecosystem in Southern California, so much so that some native plants have adapted to germinate in the ashes, while others have been shown to clean scorched soil and prepare it for new growth.As wildfires become more dangerous, extreme and fast-moving, the re-establishment of native plant life, coupled with clearing away invasive species that dry out, becoming kindling, is urgent work for conservationists across Los Angeles.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
