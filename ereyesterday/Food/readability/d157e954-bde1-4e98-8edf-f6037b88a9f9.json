  "description": "I looked out the bathroom window this week and—boom—the trees have exploded in green buds overnight. We knew it was spring, but the absolute evidence of it snuck up on me. Time feels faster these days, which means it’s probably time to catch up. Are we spring cleaning, friends?  Do you have the mop and bucket and squeegee out?  Are we opening the windows and letting the fresh air in? (Caution: I did this the other day and spent an hour try to get to small birds out of my house.)  Are we making a list of nemeses for personal growth?  Continue reading A Nemesis for Spring at Joy the Baker.",

(Amazon)•  If I take anyone’s advice this week it’s going to be from 95 year old deadlifting record holder Catherine Kuehn and Catherine Kuehn alone.  Please see: Strong Grandma.  (The New Yorker)•  We’re getting closer to 95 by the day so what are we doing for movement lately? I’ve cut back on going to my Crossfit style gym several days a week because I noticed that I’m getting rather bulky… like the sleeves of my dresses aren’t fitting comfortably… like I need to ease up on the weights.

Tell me you!  (YouTube, Self)•  This is the chocolate pudding I try to make every month around my period. It can be made with either cocoa or cacao powder and if I’m feeling a little splurgy, I top it with pomegranate seeds, hemp seeds, and black sesame.  I’ll take my luxuries where I can get them.  (Joy the Baker)•  After you read The Quiet Joy of Doing the Dishes, I’m going to need a full report on your dishwashing strategy. I like to say my real profession is dishwasher—and as a trained expert, my method is highly specific: knives first, then all the reachable silverware, most of the plates, the glasses, the sneaky silverware hiding at the bottom of the sink, and finally, the big pots and pans. I do it this way every time… unless, of course, I do it completely differently. You get it. (Savuer)•  This week on Instagram I had a litttle spiral bake featuring Banana Nut Muffins (Instagram)•  From 2018 through 2020 I was making these Almond Flour Snickerdoodle Cookies at least once a month. They’re so simple, chewy, just all around satisfying. They completely fell off my radar until this weekend I’ve been hit hard by a craving for them.  Throw these on the bake list with me!   (Joy the Baker)My love to you, friends.",
