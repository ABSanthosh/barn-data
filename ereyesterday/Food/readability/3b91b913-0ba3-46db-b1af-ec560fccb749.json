  "description": "I thought I’d give Homemade Chocolate Syrup because my 16 year old man-child uses it for his protein shakes and it’s getting crazy expensive. Store-bought chocolate syrup averages somewhere between $6-8 here my are of California. I already had a surplus of sugar and cocoa powder in my pantry, so why not make some?? Don’t get me started on how much chips cost… During the pandemic (ugh), I learned how to make Simple Vanilla Ice Cream. We went through a whole sundae phase and I didn’t think to make homemade chocolate syrup cuz we don’t use it as much as we do now. Add a couple of spoonfuls to milk chocolate milk. Add some to your coffee for a mocha. My favorite way? Frothed in my frother with oat milk for an afternoon pick-me-up. I like knowing that we are almost always 20 minutes away from a batch of homemade chocolate syrup…This counts as a meal prep item, right? Ingredients involved! Mix everything together except for the vanilla! Magic happens over the stove. You’re going to reduce it! Takes about 15-20 mins. When it has thickened up nicely, add the vanilla. Let cool. Let’s put it in a jar for safe keeping! Afternoons are better… When you have homemade chocolate syrup in your fridge!
