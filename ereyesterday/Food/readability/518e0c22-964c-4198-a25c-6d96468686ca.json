On one hand, it’s nice to know you’ve got easy meals ahead, but on the other, it can start to get a little repetitive. But what if you could give those leftovers a new life with just a little creativity? Enter savory turkey pot pies, crispy stuffing waffles, and mashed potato flatbreads—and that’s just the start. We've rounded up our 25 favorite recipes to help you repurpose your Thanksgiving leftovers into an entirely new feast that you’ll actually want to eat. This year, you don’t have to settle for sad turkey sandwiches. Instead, turn to these inventive, delicious meals that make the most of what’s left in your fridge. 1. Thanksgiving Leftover Breakfast Burritos Kickstart your day with a burrito that’s basically Thanksgiving in a tortilla. Wrap up leftover turkey, mashed potatoes, stuffing, and eggs for a filling breakfast, or even lunch. 2. Turkey Bolognese This turkey bolognese is a great recipe if you’re left with plenty of turkey but not as many sides. It also makes use of that half-empty bottle of wine that’s likely hanging around, along with any leftover cream or herbs you might have on hand. 3. Thanksgiving Leftover Potato Fritters These crispy little fritters are a genius way to use up mashed potatoes (if you have any left over, that is). With just a handful of ingredients, you get the perfect crunch on the outside, and soft potato goodness on the inside. 4. Hanetsuki Gyoza Forget casseroles and sandwiches, this gyoza recipe is a total game changer for post-Thanksgiving meals. A little unexpected? Yes. But these hand-pressed, crispy dumplings are the perfect way to repurpose turkey and veggies into something new and delicious. 5. Leftover Turkey Banh Mi If you make this, you’ll probably wonder why you didn’t try it sooner. Pickled veggies, tangy mayo, and a fresh baguette come together to make this banh mi the ultimate way to give your leftovers a whole new life. 6. Turkey and Potato Soup This soup channels all the comforting vibes of Thanksgiving in a bowl, with its tender pieces of turkey, potatoes, and mix of seasonal veggies. We’ve also found that making this soup or this stock is the best way to use up every part of the bird—neck, giblets, and all. 8. Turkey Jambalaya Smoky, spicy, and packed with all the right seasonings, this Turkey jambalaya is a fun way to add some new flavors to your Thanksgiving leftovers and mix things up a bit. 9. Mashed Potato Flatbread Three words: mashed potato flatbread. It's a fool-proof recipe that makes a great base for pizzas or for dipping in any leftover sauces and gravy you might have. 10. Thanksgiving Leftover Hand Pies If you've got more than just one or two leftovers, these hand pies are a great way to use them all. While the recipe calls for the turkey, stuffing, potatoes, and gravy, you can really get creative and toss in whatever leftovers you have—the beauty of puff pastry is that it can transform anything. 11. Turkey Birria Tacos Another great recipe if you’re tired of the usual soups, sandwiches, and stews. These birria tacos are a bit more involved than the other recipes here, but very much worth it. There’s even a recipe for homemade cranberry salsa to serve on the side. 12. Stuffing Waffles These waffles will make you wish you’d made an extra batch of stuffing because they’re that good. The waffle itself is mostly just stuffing and buttermilk, with a few extra seasonings to taste, but the real star of the show is the whipped cranberry butter. 13. Turkey Curry Another way to transition your Thanksgiving leftovers into a whole new cuisine—this turkey curry is the perfect swap. The coconut milk, ginger, and spices create a super flavorful sauce that comes together in just 30 minutes. 14. Cranberry Cookie Bars Since most of the other recipes are savory, we had to throw in at least one dessert— but don’t worry, it’s not another pie. If you’re still craving something sweet and all the other desserts have disappeared, these cranberry cookie bars are the way to go. 15. Sweet Potato Shepherd’s Pie This Thanksgiving shepherd’s pie, topped with sweet potatoes, is the ultimate cold-weather as December approaches. There's plenty of room for customization, but it’s primarily packed with leftover vegetables which is always welcome after a big feast. 16. Turkey Sandwiches with Cranberry Relish We said no more sad turkey sandwiches, and this one is anything but. Revive dried turkey by gently warming it in a buttery, almost caramel-like maple glaze. Then, top with cranberry relish, brie (or any leftover cheese you’ve got), and a few butter pickles for an actually exciting turkey sandwich. 17. Holiday Monte Cristo If you want to do even more with your sandwich, then this holiday montre cristo is your answer. Think of it as the ultimate upgrade—a crispy, golden sandwich with turkey, ham, cranberry sauce, and a melty cheese layer. 18. Turkey Pot Pie This turkey pot pie takes your Thanksgiving leftovers and turns them into an entirely new meal. It has a rich, creamy filling packed with leftover turkey and vegetables, all encased in a flaky, golden crust. 19. Harissa Turkey Chili If any of your dishes fell flat on the day, spice up your leftovers with this harissa turkey chili. The turkey gets a flavor-packed kick from harissa, and the chili itself is rich and hearty with just the right amount of heat. 20. Turkey, Cranberry, and Cream Cheese Sandwich If you’re over cooking and need a quick lunch, this sandwich is a satisfying and quick way to repurpose your leftovers. It’s easy, delicious, and just the right mix of sweet and savory. 21. Turkey Hash Salad If you skipped the vegetable dishes on Thanksgiving, don’t worry, this turkey salad totally makes up for it (at least, we think so). And if you can’t imagine turkey in a salad, trust us, this one gets the flavors just right. 22. The Best Leftover Turkey Casserole This turkey casserole skips canned condensed soup and instead takes inspiration from baked macaroni and cheese and turkey tetrazzini. The result is a creamy, flavorful dish that’s way more satisfying than your average leftover 23. Turkey Shawarma Pitas Another easy but flavor-packed meal if you're over cooking. The only stove time is melting butter, and after that, it's just stirring everything together and assembling. Mix the turkey in a blend of spices, then add to a warm pita with fresh veggies and a creamy garlic sauce. 24. Mashed Potato Focaccia Even more leftover mashed potatoes? This focaccia is the perfect way to use them up. It’s one of those breads that sounds more complicated than it actually is. Soft, pillowy, and topped with plenty of olive oil and sea salt, it’s easier than it looks and just as delicious as you'd expect. 25. Turkey Pho If you’re over the usual post-Thanksgiving meals or don’t want something heavy, turkey pho is a refreshing change. The broth is aromatic, and with the turkey and herbs, it’s light but still satisfying. We want to know: What holiday leftover do you look forward to every year?",
