  "text": "Hi, hello. I hope you’re having a lovely week!  May I ask — are you doing okay? The reason I ask is that I’ve been privy to some meltdowns this week. A woman at the gym was taking forever in one of the two showers they have available (signs say to limit it to five minutes…she’d been in there for 30 minutes!) and I knocked on the door to remind her that other people were waiting. She emerged huffy and mean and threw her big old Hoka shoes out the door — not at me, but also not *not* at me. Thankfully, I was able to access my un-crazy side (if you know this reference, let’s be friends) and see that whatever she had going on was most certainly not about me.  It didn’t stop there: I was working in a coffee shop last weekend, and a woman walked in fully sobbing, and the baristas gave her free coffee and a pastry and everyone just left her alone to collapse into a chair and stare at her phone while nibbling her free muffin. I was headed to meet some friends yesterday, and I saw two near-miss car accidents because people were confused! A lesson plan did not come together today and I had to remind myself not to cry (middle schoolers can sense weakness).  The world feels frazzled and fragile. So many people I know are going through it in big and small ways. Someone I’m close to said they feel like they’re strung together with dental floss and duct tape, and I felt that. Minus my near-cry this morning, I’m holding myself together for now, with a healthy dose of exercise endorphins, sleep, and reveling that the sun does not set until nearly 8 PM (!!!) right now, and that we have 80-degree temperatures in next week’s forecast. I’m holding tight to my routines and exchanging voice memos with friends that are long, silly, and honest. Soon, I’ll be on our first vacation abroad in quite some time, which always leaves me feeling inspired and refreshed, even with jet lag. When we’re back, I’ll tell you all about it. I hope you’re finding ways to enjoy these days. Sending love to you! • Speaking of long travel, I’m curious if you have great tips for making long plane rides bearable. So far, I’ve bought this salmon sperm mask that is allegedly excellent at moisturizing (doing my best to rid my brain of that phrase now that I’ve ordered it), this cute travel set from Pact, and compression socks. I have headphones and a good bag, but I welcome any tips! (Amazon, Pact, Bombas) • The case for telling total strangers to shut up. This article speaks to me on a soul level. A few months ago, a friend and I were at a Maggie Rogers concert and the women in front of us were shouting about getting their nose’s pierced and what they wanted to do after the show. My friend and I were annoyed but scared to say anything, but the woman next to us did — politely and directly. I wanted to buy her a pony. We live in a society! And this article made me feel much better about reminding people when they’re killing the vibe. (NYT Gift Link) • As someone who works in a helping profession, I enjoyed this article about what to do if your people-focused job drains your battery (which mine does!). (SELF) • I turn 42 this month, and as a proper Taurus, I’m very concerned about the cake. I’m considering this Distinguished Guest Birthday Cake, though my very favorite is Funfetti. I supposed I’ll just send my wife Joy’s list of best birthday cakes and let her choose (the right answer is Funfetti). Speaking of Joy’s cakes, I visited her in LA (ages ago) and said that I was dying to try the incredible cake on the front of her second cookbook, Homemade Decadence, and she PULLED THAT CAKE OUT OF THE REFRIGERATOR and I promptly got to share a piece with Tron. Being friends with Joy remains an excellent decision. (Joy The Baker, Amazon) • Harper’s beauty editors shared 20 products they loved in March. I am cosigning for the Biotyspa Body Sculpting Kit (not sure it will eliminate my cellulite as it promises, but it feels so dang good — like doing cupping in your own shower without looking like you made out with an octopus!) and Dieux’s Auracle eye mask, which I use daily and credit with my lack of eye wrinkles at nearly 42 years old! (Harper’s Bazaar, Credo Beauty, Sephora) • Love these easy pastas to welcome spring! These look great, but may I also suggest that you make my favorite pasta dish of all time: One-Pot French Onion pasta. (NYT Cooking, Joy The Baker) • I’ve been longing for a good girl’s trip and the idea of going on a reading retreat sounds amazing. (The Everygirl) • Surely I’m not the only one doing spring and summer shopping, right? So far, I’ve purchased these beautiful, minimalist Madewell sandals that I plan to pair with cute summer dresses and linen pants, AYR’s Half-Day and Early Morning tees, which are sturdy enough to be warm-ish and will be ideal with shorts (I have the grey but I’ve been dithering about purchasing the red, despite my commitment to neutrals!), these perfectly springy pajamas for the hot nights ahead, and this dress that’s nice enough for work but casual enough for dinners on the patio at my favorite restaurant. (Madewell, AYR, LAKE, Ann Taylor) • I loved this post by Leslie Stephens about what most lifestyle content is missing, and her subsequent “plant studies” series. (Substack) • We are big asparagus fans in this house, and it’s asparagus season! I’m going to make this delicious Spring Asparagus Salad with White Beans and Almonds with our first bundles. (Joy The Baker) • What are you reading these days? I’m reading Long Bright River because one of the ways I am deeply not fun is that I force myself to read a book before I watch a show! I’m always on the hunt for my next read, and these new spring reads have me excited. (The Everygirl) • I’m obsessed with The White Lotus right now, and I, too, would like to join The White Lotus book club. (Vogue) • 10 Small Things Neurologists Wish You’d Do For Your Brain. It’s important to keep your brain sharp, and while none of this was brand new or life-altering, it was full of good reminders! (NYT Gift Link)  • The age of being extremely online is over. Thank goodness! (Mashable) • I’ve been itching to get away to the desert, and these destinations all seem magical. (Travel and Leisure) 5 Responses It’s not a cure-all, but I can highly recommend listening to the music you loved when you were a teenager. I got a song from 10 Things I Hate About You stuck in my head on the weekend, which prompted me to listen to music from 1999 for the rest of the weekend. Everything isn’t all better, but somehow it’s slightly less bad. Which in the current economy, I’ll take. My. current favourite is Every Morning by Sugar Ray :D Living for the “uncrazy side” —one of the more underrated Office quotes. Thanks for the book recs!! I’m in a phase where I’m reading multiple books at once, which feels both chaotic and comforting as this time requires. I’m finally reading Bel Canto by Ann Patchett and loving it (no surprise). My husband accused me of “caressing” the book the other night and I don’t think he was wrong. I’m also reading Fatal Grace by Louise Penny—the Inspector Gamache series is so weirdly comforting for books centered around murder. Thanks again for your post! Amazing as always :) I suggest N95 mask and SIP valve for long flights to not have vacation ruined by getting sick from the person next to you on the plane For long travel in economy, I got a foot hammock online and it was so great to be able to rest my calves up in it to snooze. It hooks over the arms of the tray table and it got my comfortably from Boston to Thailand last year! For long flights, I suggest one of those u-shaped travel pillows or something similar that makes your heart happy. Makes all the difference when dozing for me. If you have space, a cashmere wrap big enough to be a blanket. Noise canceling headphones, or earplugs or both. (I know you said headphones, but I have 6 sets of headphones and no noise canceling atm.) Ebooks/audiobooks/podcasts/media for entertainment. Travel packet of wet wipes \u0026 one of facial wipes, lotion too. Package of nuts or similar energy food. Eye coverage to block light – my top choice is a lightweight handkerchief that I can moisten in cold water. Travel toothbrush \u0026 toothpaste, lip balm. Portable charger \u0026 cords for your electronics, and if you feel fancy invest in a leather portfolio that slips into your purse that will organize all of your electronics. I am a paranoid overpacker, so I tend to pack spare socks \u0026 undies, meds, tiny travel toiletries, spare glasses, tiny brush, and hair ties. Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.
