All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.In 2025, Oreo is kicking things off strong with a series of exciting releases — from its collaboration with Post Malone to its new double chocolate Cakesters. The cookie brand is clearly focused on staying relevant, even as it prepares to celebrate its 113th birthday on March 6. And just in time for the milestone, it’s bringing back a fan-favorite flavor, leaving people counting down the days.According to @snachwithzach, a digital creator on Instagram and TikTok who posts about the latest food products, Oreo plans on releasing the previously discontinued Birthday Cake Golden Oreos on March 3. If you’ve never tried the Birthday Cake Golden Oreos before, they feature the brand’s vanilla-flavored wafer cookies filled with a creamy, sprinkle-specked filling.Fans absolutely love this flavor. On Reddit, one user shared a story about how, with the golden version discontinued, his wife bought him the Birthday Cake Chocolate Oreos. She scraped out the birthday cake filling and put it between the yellow Oreo cookies after removing the regular cream. (True dedication!) That was over three years ago, which makes the return of this new Oreo flavor even more highly anticipated.Fans are super excited about the return of Birthday Cake Golden Oreos. On @snackwithzach’s TikTok post, people were quick to share their thoughts. One person commented, “I’ve been waiting for the golden Oreos. I’ve missed them so much,” while another said, “Those are my favorite Oreos!” If you spot them in stores next month, grab them while you can. People are pumped about this festive flavor, so they’ll probably sell out fast.",
