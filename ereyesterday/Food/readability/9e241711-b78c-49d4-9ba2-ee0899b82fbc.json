The air has been heavy this week with warm rainstorms and thunder in the distance (to Graham’s dismay), and I’m fresh off a successful Pool Dad Memorial Day weekend. Vibes are on the up!  I’ve decided to ease into the season relaxed, with Diet Cokes stocked in the coldest shelf in the fridge and chilled washcloths on another.  Luxury in the small things, you know?This isn’t a bucket list. There’s no pressure to “make the most” of anything. It’s just a not-so-definitive guide to a great summer season: a collection of little pleasures, small rituals, and nostalgic nods that make this season feel sweet as cherry pie. (And yes, there will be lil pies.) The Only Shorts Worth Wearing Have An Elastic WaistThe era of squeezing myself into stiff , ripped denim for the sake of summer is behind me now. I’m living in the golden age of comfort, and the shorts I’m wearing on repeat have both an elastic waistband and a button closure, because I like options and room the eight pounds of cherries I’m going to eat. I found them at Gap Factory, in a deep wash denim that makes me feel pulled-together but not trying too hard (because I’m not). The pockets are deep enough for my phone and a handful of rocks I might feel emotionally compelled to bring home from a walk. I also got them in white and lavender because when something’s good, you buy it in multiples. That’s math, mathing. (Gap Factory) The Perfect Cocktail Hour SnackThis summer, my fridge has a new non-negotiable: a big ol’ container of Texas Caviar Salad , nestled right next to the half watermelon. I’d argue it’s one of the original dense bean salads, packed with enough fiber and feeling to carry you from “just one bite before dinner” to “this is dinner now” without a hint of shame. For when a weekend cocktail hour drifts into a sunset which, frankly, is the goal. Serve with limey tortilla chips or a sturdy salt and vinegar chip. Add a cold glass of rosé a single ice cube and – perfection. (Simply Recipes) A Hat That Makes You Feel Like Diane KeatonIt’s got a sturdy brim and a no-nonsense energy—equal parts “Hamptons in August” and “Bellville before 9am.” It’s the Monterey Straw Rancher Hat and yes, the sweat around the rim just gives it character.(Hemlock) Three Things You’re Allowed to Cancel for No ReasonA Friday meeting. Plans that require a bra. Any event described as “networking”. Networking is only allowed in sweater weather. My Slightly Over-the-Top Pool/Beach Bag Packing List Let’s start with the unsung hero: a Trader Joe’s insulated tote. It’s chic in an ironic way and, with a few ice packs tossed in the bottom, it turns your pool bag into a portable summer survival kit. I think a pool bag should be equal parts functional and luxurious. Inside mine you’ll find: A damp, frozen washcloth with a few drops of eucalyptus oil (packed in a ziplock and guaranteed to resurrect your soul to wipe off sweat or sticky sunscreen). A thrifted paperback I won’t cry over if it falls in the water. An affordable SPF 50 bronzing spray that makes me feel vaguely like a Bond girl. Talc-free baby powder for post-beach sandy feet because prolonged sandy feet gives me the chills. And an emotional support Yeti—filled with something hydrating, like iced hibiscus tea with a splash of agave, coconut water, and coconut cream. One Thing to Grill That Will Raise Eyebrows (in a good way) Consider dessert on the grill. Think: thick slices of pound cake (store-bought or homemade, no one’s asking) brushed with melted butter and toasted on the grill until golden and just a little smoky. Top with macerated sliced strawberries, a dollop of whipped cream, and a pinch of flaky salt if you’re feeling fancy.  See: Grilled Strawberry Shortcake (Joy the Baker) Fridge Essential: Very Crisp Diet Coke Extra ice. Add True Lime and a glass straw. Rewatch: Moonrise KingdomFor a summer night when it’s too hot to think and the only plan is couch, kettle corn, and air conditioning. Moonrise Kingdom is my favorite dreamy little escape featuring young love, khaki scout badges, and the most whispy, old Polaroid color palette. (Amazon Prime, Joy the Baker) The Smell of SummerIf I don’t smell like a cherry pie this summer, I’m not doing it right. (Allure) A Baking Project for the Hottest Day of the YearComing soon to the blog: Banana Malt Icebox Cake. It sets in the fridge (next to the Diet Coke and Texas Caviar). One Good Deed That Costs You NothingOk but what if this is the summer we befriend all the dogs in town? I’m going to carry a few dog treats in your pocket because once you get a dog on your side, the dog owner is soon to follow.  One of Will’s neighbors gives our dogs treats and we have one dog that escapes the backyard to go look for this man so  – I know it’s a powerful force. That’s the vibe this summer: low-stakes delight, elastic waistbands, and cold Diet Cokes. We’re not doing it all—we’re just doing what feels good. Wishing you long golden hours and deep tans.",
