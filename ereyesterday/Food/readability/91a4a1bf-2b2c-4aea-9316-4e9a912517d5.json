Guys, I literally lost my mind in December and one day I got a cup out of our drawer for Jordan and it was filled with moldy milk. Yes. I am almost positive that it was me who put it in there. I must have been putting dishes away one night and thought it was a clean cup. How long was it in there? No one knows. OMG. Into the trash it went. 4. White kitchens are OUT. I love my white kitchen, forever and ever. But we do have a kitchen in our basement in this house that is peacock green/blue. I love it! 5. My outs for 2025 are ins and outs lists. Not a fan. 6. TV things!! Oh man, we’ve watched so much the last few weeks. We love Landman, like Yellowstone-level obsessed. The end of Shrinking was so good! I watched Missing You on netflix. Also more that I can’t think of at the moment. 7. So many of the golden globes dresses were incredible, but if you haven’t seen it, you have to look up Viola Davis’ dress. Her dresses are always my #1, it’s like she can do no wrong. I looooove it. 8. Look at your house like a stranger. 9. Huge announcement today!!! Eeeeep.",
