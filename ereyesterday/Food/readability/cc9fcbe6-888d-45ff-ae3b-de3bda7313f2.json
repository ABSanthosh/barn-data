All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Veroniksha/ShutterstockWhile we always recommend supporting your local cheese shop for all of your dairy needs, if you don’t have one in your area, you can always go to bigger retailers like Eataly or even Trader Joe’s for your wedges.If you look closely enough, you’ll find popular staples like burrata hidden in the cheese section of Trader Joe’s. This famous Italian cheese is garnering a lot of attention right now because Trader Joe’s just rolled out a new version of its packaging. (The nice part? This burrata is more than half the price of ones you’ll find at retailers like Eataly.)If you’ve never savored a bite of burrata before, you’ll swoon over this semisoft Italian cheese that’s buttery, creamy, subtly sweet, yet fresh in flavor. The viral appeal of this hollow pouch made of mozzarella stuffed with a mixture of cream and cheese curds is that when you cut it open, the molten center slowly seeps out, making it ideal for enjoying on bright salads, decadent sandwiches, rich pastas, or cheesy pizzas. At Trader Joe’s, you can find a carton filled with two 4-ounce balls of burrata for $4.99. The grocery store mentioned on its website that shoppers might have “walked right past the tub in the eight or so years” that the grocer has carried it, which prompted the redesign of its packaging. And the new upgrade is working because people can’t stop posting about this cheese on social media as if it’s a new find.Trader Joe’s shoppers have been obsessed with this Italian cheese. For years, creators have been posting recipes on TikTok with this burrata.With this new packaging, this Italian cheese may become more popular at Trader Joe’s, attracting customers who haven’t noticed it before. So, the next time you go shopping, especially since this burrata is more affordable at TJ’s compared with other retailers, consider picking up a carton and infusing this creamy cheese into your weekly meals.",
