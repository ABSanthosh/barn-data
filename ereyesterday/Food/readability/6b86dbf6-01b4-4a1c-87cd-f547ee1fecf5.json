Spring Root Veggie Galette A flaky, golden galette loaded with turnips, sweet potatoes, and goat cheese. While the dough and filling do require some prep, you don't need to be a food stylist to make to make it look impressive—the naturally bright, spring colors do the work. 2. Lemon Curd Rolls These bakery-style cinnamon rolls are made with a homemade dough (though you could easily start with store-bought) and a jar of lemon curd. Sweet, tart, and shockingly easy to make. 3. Crudités with Feta-Pistachio Dip A refreshing, no-cook option to round out your table. Blend pistachios with dill and feta, and round out with bright seasonal veggies. 4. Cheesy Hash Brown Breakfast Casserole Crispy, cheesy, and made with a bag of frozen hash browns. You can make this ahead of time and then pop in the oven the morning of. 5. Store-Bought Cinnamon Rolls, Upgraded Start with two rolls of store-bough cinnamon roll dough and cover in a mixture of milk, eggs, cinnamon, and pecans. Pop them in the oven, then drizzle with browned butter or top with freeze-dried strawberries for a festive look. 6. Mini Southwestern Frittatas Bake these in a muffin tin for a make-ahead, eggy bite that travels well and reheats beautifully. These use chiles, tomatoes, and cheddar but you can really add whatever. 7. Grown-Up Fruit Salad A blend of cherries, strawberries, and oranges with dollops of goat cheese—finished with a pistachios and balsamic and elderflower dressing. 8. Deviled Egg Salad on Toast This egg salad tastes like a classic version of deviled eggs—only it’s easier to make and travels well. You can either serve the egg salad on toasts topped with chives and paprika or as a spread with crackers on the side. 9. Cold Brew Negroni A fun drink moment: mix cold brew, gin, Campari, and vermouth for a smooth, caffeinated cocktail. 10. No-Bake Pistachio Cheesecake Cups Layer crushed graham crackers, whipped cream cheese, and pistachio paste in small muffin tins and let the fridge do the rest of the work. 11. Asparagus, Leek, and Ricotta Quiche A flaky pie dough (use store-bought for an even quicker prep time) topped with tender asparagus spears, buttery leeks, and whipped ricotta. This elegant dish is both visually appealing and delicious. 12. Lemon Poppy Seed Pancakes Bright and zesty pancakes inspired by the classic muffin flavor .Serve with citrus jams, powdered sugar, and/or whipped cream. 13. Savory Bread Pudding with Prosciutto and Mushrooms A hearty, vegetarian-friendly dish combining crusty bread, chevre, mushrooms, and fresh thyme. It's a comforting addition to any brunch spread. 14. Strawberry Basil Shortcakes Sweet biscuits layered with macerated strawberries, a unique basil-infused topping, and whipped cream. A fresh twist on a classic dessert. 15. Smoked Salmon \u0026 Dill Toasts A buttery French baguette with good-quality smoked salmon, fresh dill, and a hint of lemon juice. Serve warm or at room temperature for a versatile brunch option. 16. Carrot Cake Pancakes Fluffy pancakes flavored with grated carrots, warm spices, and topped with a dollop of cream cheese glaze. A fun and festive nod to traditional carrot cake. 17. Jelly Bean Mimosas A jelly-bean infused mimosa. Combine the vodka and jelly beans in a jar and seal—allow to sit for about 2 hours. Then top with champagne and juice of choice. A bit stronger than your average mimosa but fun and festive. Still planning your holiday menu?
