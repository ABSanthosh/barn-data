And this Father’s Day—June 16—we’re celebrating all the dads, grandfathers, uncles, and mentors who’ve made life sweeter. Maybe your dad was the one who taught you how to flip pancakes on Sunday mornings or the guy who told you ghost stories on camping trips. Maybe he’s the one who texts silly jokes just to brighten your day. Or perhaps you’re honoring a father figure who always showed up, even when you didn’t expect it. Not all dads love cake, and not everyone who loves cake is a dad. But we’re willing to bet there’s a healthy overlap. From classic chocolate and fruity favorites to inventive twists and easy-to-make treats, we’ve gathered 25 of our best Father’s Day cake recipes to help you celebrate the special guy (or guys) in your life. Dive in and find the perfect cake for your celebration. From Our Shop 1. Louisa's Cake The simple, fruity, ricotta-laced cake that’s launched a thousand ovens. No wonder it’s our site’s most popular cake recipe. We like it with a dusting of powdered sugar, but no one's going to stop you from dolloping more ricotta on top. 2. Food-Processor Pistachio Cake With Raspberry Cream Don't want to do a lot of work? Don't! This pistachio-dense cake comes together entirely in a food processor and topping, while optional, is as easy as mashing up some raspberries and folding them into soft cream. 3. Simple Summer Peach Cake A childhood snack of peaches with milk, sprinkled with sugar and a dusting of nutmeg, in cake form. Best served on a warm, sunny day. 4. Sam's Favorite Chocolate Cake This chocolate-cherry cake has a sweet backstory: It helped bridge a 40-year gap between father and daughter. 5. 'World's Best Cake' With Banana \u0026 Coconut Yes, “World’s Best” is a lofty claim from this towering cake—but it’s got a pretty clever trick to create such puffy, golden layers. 6. Yellowest Yellow Cake With Fudgy Chocolate Frosting Inspired by boxed yellow cake mix, this layer cake is very fluffy and very moist. Chocolate frosting is a classic combo, but feel free to swap in your dad's favorite—say, vanilla buttercream or penuche. 7. Chocolate Bundt Cake A ring of deep, dark, fudgy goodness is the perfect way to show someone they're alright. The secret to this cake's tender, moist crumb is not one, not two, but three liquids: black coffee, vegetable oil, and sour milk (feel free to substitute buttermilk). 8. Blueberry Snack Cake with Toasted Pecan Topping If your dad drives you a little nutty, then bake up this simple snack cake. (Forgive the dad joke, please.) It's got fresh blueberries, pecans (or walnuts or really any nut you love), and a hint of lemon zest. 9. Almond Cake with Orange-Flower Water Syrup Bake a cake that can do dinner or breakfast. (Psst—that’s this one!) It joined our site back in 2010, when the editors wrote: \"Almond meal lends the cake a hearty texture yet it remains light and sweet. It would pair nicely with tea and a dollop of crème fraîche or unsweetened whipped cream.\" 10. Rye \u0026 Rhubarb Anytime Cake What started as improv transformed into a tart, warm cake you'll probably want at least two slices of. The compote is one-of-a-kind with golden raisins, orange zest, and white wine. (That means this cake is good with white wine, too, right?) 11. The Snake Bite Inspired by the bright-yet-complex snakebite cocktail—equal parts lager and cider—this cake combines a chocolatey stout cake with fermented pear cider frosting for an unforgettable dessert. 12. Flourless Pecan Cake If your dad doesn't like flour (or just loves pecans), this is the cake for him. All you need are pecans, brown sugar, eggs, and a pinch of salt, and you're ready to go. 13. Maialino's Olive Oil Cake The olive oil cake that will ruin you for all others. And to make it even more decadent, top it with Michelle Polzine’s slow-roasted strawberries. 14. Melissa Clark's Instant Pot Chocolate-Bourbon Lava Cakes This boozy chocolate cake recipe can be made entirely in everyone’s favorite multicooker. The combination of rich chocolate and smoky-sweet bourbon will be beloved by the patriarch in your family. 15. Citrus Cake From Yasmin Khan This cake looks and tastes like pure sunshine. And since Dad never wants you to lift a finger, he’ll be happy to know that it is so easy—it comes together in one bowl with just one step. 16. Key Lime Cake From Isabel Coss Sadly for Dad, he’s not getting a vacation to St. Lucia for Father’s Day this year. The closest I can get is this tropically-inspired cake, which has a hint of aromatherapy from a eucalyptus-infused water bath, which the cake bakes in for extra moisture. 17. Powdered Donut Cake Hands down, this is the most fun cake we’ve ever laid hands (and lips) on. It’s essentially a giant donut—minus the frying—that’s completely covered in confectioners’ sugar. 18. 1 Fruity Cake, 3 Ways Do you have an indecisive dad too? I get it, and that’s why this versatile cake batter comes in such handy. You can use any fruit Dad likes, but we recommend stone fruit or berries, both of which are in season during June. 19. Blueberry Biscuit Buckle This isn’t exactly a cake, but it’s not not a cake. It’s Dad’s new favorite dessert, featuring a whole lot of blueberries, which are at their peak around Father’s Day. 20. Naturally-Dyed Red Velvet Cake with Beets \u0026 Cream Cheese Frosting Instead of artificial red food coloring, the batter for this red velvet cake is dyed using red beets. 21. Chocolate-Carrot Cake With Cream Cheese Frosting Moist, spiced, and packed with shredded carrots and espresso powder, this chocolate carrot cake topped with cream cheese frosting is a fun twist on a timeless favorite that dads and kids alike will love. 22. Cornmeal Peach Whiskey Cake A tender cake with warm peaches and a whiskey glaze, this cake combines cozy flavors with a grown-up twist that’s sure to impress. 23. Lemon, Poppy Seed \u0026 Olive Oil Cake Bright and refreshing, this moist lemon poppy seed cake with a light glaze adds a sunny touch to your Father’s Day dessert table. 24. Irish Coffee Cupcakes If your dad’s ideal dessert is one he can eat with a cup of coffee and a wink of whiskey, these cupcakes are it. Inspired by the classic after-dinner drink, they’re rich with espresso and Irish whiskey flavor. 25. Peanut Butter Sheet Cake with Chocolate-Cream Cheese Frosting It’s rich, nostalgic, and the kind of dessert that’ll have people sneaking forkfuls straight from the pan.
