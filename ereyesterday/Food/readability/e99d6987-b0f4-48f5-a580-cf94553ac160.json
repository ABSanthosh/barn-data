The last few weeks I got hit with bronchitis and an all-night cough, so I made it through a lot of books as I sat up at night and read. Lots of good ones here! I also shared my holiday reading list here! I do have a book of the month membership – I love it so much. That’s where I got a few books from this month. I get so many of my new releases and debut author books there. You can sign up for one here. Most of these books are linked through bookshop (if available!) and I highly suggest shopping through there because it will support your local indie bookstore. You can choose the local bookstore to support! I support Penguin Books when I buy which is my fave here in Pittsburgh. Let me know what you’re reading below! WHAT I READ IN OCTOBER \u0026 NOVEMBER 2024 Be Ready When The Luck Happens I could not love Ina more!!! I absolutely LOVED this – I listened to it because she narrates but then I also ended up buying it because I wanted the physical book. I thought I knew a ton about Ina but I loved the little bits and stories in here. She is the best best best. How My Neighbor Stole Christmas – 3.5 stars This book was a little ridiculous, but funny. It is absolutely hilarious how the author takes the exact grinch storyline and uses it throughout the whole book – she plugs the characters right into the story and even uses similar (or the same!) names. I could not figure out if this was a parody at first! The Off Limits Rule – 3.5 stars This was a cute one. In this book, we follow Lucy who ends up moving in with her brother and falling for his best friend. She’s a little whiney at times (a bit cringe because she is a mom), and it felt somewhat YA to me, but I really loved her and Cooper’s relationship. I liked his character a lot. The Pumpkin Spice Cafe – 3 stars This huge tiktok read was cute but didn’t completely do it for me. It felt a little YA to me and almost like a direct copy of gilmore girls and stars hollow. It was fun for the fall season and a very easy quick read. We follow Jeanie who inherits her aunt’s coffee shop in an adorable town and meets a grumpy farmer that everyone in town loves. So many tropes in this one and it was adorable. Intermezzo – 4 stars Another Sally Rooney win! Her books are so deep and more of the literary reads for me (ah!) – and this one is no different. Here, we follow two brothers who are grieving the death of their father. Their lives are so different. The writing in this book is incredible. Sometimes a little slow for me (felt like nothing was happening) but I ended up LOVING the ending (just perfect) and thinking about the characters so long after. Definitely a good read. The Third Gilmore Girl Speaking of Stars Hollow!!! I couldn’t wait for this to come out. I love Kelly Bishop. This is another one that I listened to and it was fabulous. It was heart warming, honest, funny and just so interesting. What a life and career. Highly recommend. This Spells Love – 3.5 stars This was a fun little October read! We follow Gemma who with her friends, tries to cast a spell to remove her toxic ex from her life. The spell actually works except it does other things too – like makes her best platonic guy friend forget about her. The friends to lovers trope in this is fabulous and it’s very cute. Really enjoyed it! Blue Sisters – 5 stars Oh my gosh, this one is excellent. Here, we follow three sisters who are mourning the death of their fourth sister. They come home to deal with their childhood apartment and there is SO much family drama. There is a ton going on in this and the sisters could not be more different, meaning there is a ton of incredible character development, side characters and more. I loved this so much, it was heart breaking, heart warming and more. Still thinking about it Is She Really Going Out With Him – 4 stars This one is SO cute. This story is about Anna who is recently divorced and in order to try and keep her job, she decides to have her kids pick dates for her (matchmaker!) and she writes about it. This is so funny, so adorable, I laughed the entire time. Pictures of You – 4.5 stars I knew this would be a heartbreaker because of the author’s last novel. In this book we follow Evie who wakes up from a car crash and thinks she’s still a teenager… but she is actually much older and married to the man who died in the car with her. This whole book is her trying to figure out her life and remember and the details she comes across are heartbreaking and unbelievable. This book is heavy (triggers!) and intense at times but I really loved it. I could not put it down. Variation – 5 stars I LOVED this one. I always love Rebecca Yarros’ contemporary novels. I found this so interesting and while a little crazy dramatic, it was so good. We follow a career ballerina who reconnects with her teen best friend who is a rescue swimmer. They never dated as kids but were in love… and we go from there. There is SO much family drama in this and it’s great – on both sides. I absolutely loved the ending. Wolf.e – 3 stars Can’t believe I read this, ha. If I’m being honest, I only read this because I was such a huge fan of sons of anarchy. This is so super dark and steamy – unlike anything I’ve ever read. The story follows Brinley who meets the president of a motorcycle club. He is kind of bad… but kind of good! I swear this was taken straight from a sons of anarchy storyline, but I couldn’t really put it down either. Holding the Reins – 3.5 stars This came up after I finished the above book and I started it right away. No darkness here in this one, and I liked it a lot. The characters were all cute (the whole family was amazing). We follow Cece who comes back to her hometown and ends up working with their very close family friend, Nash. Sparks fly, but they shouldn’t – he is best friends with her brothers and her parents took him in when his died. Also a hockey storyline in this! Loved the ending of it.
