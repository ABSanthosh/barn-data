All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Joni Hanebutt / ShutterstockWhen you think of buying in bulk, you probably imagine big warehouses like Costco and Sam’s Club, but there is actually a bountiful bulk section hiding in plain sight at your local grocery store. And it’s not just grains and nuts (or other snacks) — it’s vegetables too! Some vegetables are priced per weight and are very light, like mushrooms. Credit: The Image Party / ShutterstockA five-ounce package of shiitake mushrooms runs about $5.99 at almost any store I’ve gone to, but I can get at least twice as many mushrooms by weight for less money (at around $10.99 per pound) just by bagging them myself from the bulk bins in the produce section.Why I Always Buy Mushrooms (and Other Lightweight) Vegetables in BulkThis savings applies to almost anything that is usually packaged in a plastic carton or wrapped container, but can also be purchased loose by weight. It has to be a relatively lightweight item, like green beans and spinach, and this can be done at a standard grocery store or a farmers market, depending on their per-pound pricing. By always opting to bag my own mushrooms and other light (by weight!) veggies, I’ve saved at least $10 per shopping trip. I shop once or twice per week, so that $10 per trip adds up to hundreds of dollars saved per year.Although this won’t apply for everything you’re shopping for in the produce section, it’s a good reminder to always compare unit prices. I buy lemons, limes, apples, and onions in multi-pound bags because the price is usually cheaper than by weight or by item. One lemon costs about 99 cents at many stores I shop at, but a two-pound bag of lemons is $4 and contains at least six to eight lemons (that’s basically half the price!). It only takes a minute to whip out your calculator or do mental math to see if it’s cheaper to buy per piece, per pound, or per bag, and the savings are well-worth the time and effort. Got a tip for saving money at the grocery store?
