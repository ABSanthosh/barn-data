All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Trong NguyenNothing says fall like a big Costco shop. In addition to stocking up on lunch-box snacks and autumnal treats (have you tried the bakery’s apple pie? It’s two desserts in one!), it’s a great time to pick up some bottles of wine for fall activities and entertaining. The bulk warehouse’s strength is high-quality wines in classic styles, and it continues to overdeliver while keeping prices the same — proving that even in 2024, it can be done. I’ve worked in wine retail and hospitality for close to 20 years (doing that math in my head just made me feel really old!), so I know my way around a wine aisle. Here are my top 12 recommendations for fall fun and entertaining — grouped by activity, because sometimes vibes are just as important as aromas. I’ve also included a few wine and food pairing suggestions to help you decide what bottle to pop (or twist 😉).Everyday Dinners1. Valminor Albariño Rias Baixas, $13.99 for 750ml Casual weeknights are all about versatility and ease. Albariño is mostly found in Spain and Portugal, and Albariños from Spain’s Rias Baixas region tend to be especially crisp and fresh (and I find they stay tasting zippy even after a couple of days in the fridge). You could have this refreshing, tropical, and citrus-inflected white from Spain with fish tacos one night and Thai food the next.2. Bodegas Luis Gurpegui Muga Rioja, $9.99 for 750mlIf you like full-bodied reds but don’t like the full-bodied price tags of premium California regions, Spain is a great place to look. This tempranillo from Spain’s most famous wine region features ripe plum and black raspberry fruit topped with a sheen of vanilla and tobacco. It’s ready to level up a simple meal of juicy burgers or a classic meatloaf.3. Kirkland Signature Columbia Valley Cabernet Sauvignon, $8.99 for 750mlIf you’re looking for an affordable alternative to Napa cabernet that’s similarly rich and lavishly oaked, keep an eye out for cabernets from Washington’s Columbia Valley. They tend to be made in a similar style, but because the vineyard land isn’t so eye-wateringly expensive and it doesn’t have Napa’s cachet, the wines are much more reasonably priced. The Kirkland Signature brand always delivers, and the rich flavors of blackberry and black cherry with a hint of earthiness in this cabernet are no exception.4. Gerard Bertrand Kosmos Languedoc Red Blend, $8.99 for 750 mLFrance’s Languedoc region boasts a warm climate and more lax winemaking regulations, making it a less expensive place to make wine than more famous French wine regions. This red blend’s deep plum flavors and hearty tannins, and would be great with richer dishes like a hearty chili, classic meatloaf, or stuffed mushrooms that have enough fat, protein, and salt to stand up to a gutsier wine.At-Home Movie Night5. Kirkland Signature Brut Champagne, $19.99 for 750ml  As a new parent who doesn’t get to leave the house as much as I used to, I’ve really gotten into at-home movie nights. Buttery popcorn and Champagne are amazing together, so why pay a bajillion dollars for an artificial butter-flavored tub and soda when you can have homemade popcorn with toasty, bright, refreshing, actual Champagne for less than $20?6. Kirkland Signature Prosecco Rosé, $7.99 for 750ml  If gummy candy is your go-to movie snack, this rosé Prosecco — with notes of strawberry and watermelon that harmonize with fruity candy and exuberant bubbles to clear your palate for the next bite — would be a fun pairing.7. Seghesio Sonoma Zinfandel, $17.89 for 750ml  If your favorite “couch wine” is a full-bodied red, Costco’s price on this delicious, classic Zin — with brambly blackberry and dried strawberry notes and a balanced, dry finish — is very competitive. And in my opinion, it’s just a lot more classy and balanced than other Zinfandels I’ve tried at this price point. Fall Activities8. King Estate Pinot Gris, $13.89 for 750mlAfter a full afternoon of Instagram-worthy fall activities like finding the perfect pumpkin, raking leaves, or picking out mums, trade in the apple cider for this Oregon Pinot Gris full of ripe pear and golden apple flavors.9. Kirkland Signature Pinot Grigio Friuli, $4.99 for 750ml  If a post-fall activity hangout has resulted in a full house of thirsty friends, you won’t cringe at opening multiple bottles of this crisp, lemony, refreshing Pinot Grigio with a hint of floral aroma and some lovely pear and honeydew melon flavors. I don’t know which price is more shockingly low: this, or Costco’s famous rotisserie chicken. It seems to be almost as popular, too, because as I was creeping around the wine section taking photos, a woman came up to me just to tell me how much she loves it!10.  Duckhorn Decoy Merlot, $14.89 for 750ml Even 20 years later, we’re still feeling the effects of Sideways and Paul Giamatti’s week-long trip through California wine country. People think Merlot is unsophisticated, despite the fact that it’s used in famous wines from Bordeaux with eye-popping prices. (If it helps, think of Merlot as Cabernet Sauvignon’s softer, more easygoing cousin.) Less than $15 is a great price for this medium-to-full-bodied, plush, yet juicy red, with flavors of raspberry and bing cherry and a hint of vanilla and cinnamon. Pairs well with a throw blanket after a hike on a chilly afternoon.11. Allegrini Palazzo Della Torre, $14.89 for 750ml  This Italian red blend is made in the ripasso method, where some of the grapes are dried before being made into wine. This gives it rich flavors of currants, ripe berries, and dried cherries — its lush texture and almost sweet fruit flavors make it a delicious standalone glass that would be perfect to curl up with in front of a firepit on a cool night.Dinner Parties12. J Vineyards Pinot Noir, $16.89 for 750ml  My advanced years and many dinner party #fails have taught me that when people come over, they want a good time, not a geography lesson in the form of some esoteric wine made by monks who live on a mountaintop. A food-friendly and accessible Pinot Noir, with ripe cherry flavors along with a bit of tart pomegranate and refreshing acidity, will quietly impress everyone with your good taste. It doesn’t hurt that Costco has a very competitive price on the Pinot from classic producer J Vineyards.13. Kirkland Signature Barolo DOCG, $19.99 for 750mlIf you know anything about Barolo, the famed nebbiolo-based wine from Italy’s Piedmont region, you know it’s not cheap. I’ve always been intrigued by the Kirkland Signature Barolo and wondered if it could possibly stack up to the famous producers whose wines go for more than twice the price. I was pleasantly surprised by the classic aromas of tart cherry, balsamic, and varnished cedar, along with firm tannins and food-friendly acidity. Throw this in a decanter (or a pitcher, if that’s what you’ve got — don’t let the wine accessory industrial complex convince you expensive decanters that take up half the table are necessary) for an hour or two, braise some short ribs, and have a fancy night in for a fraction of what it would cost at a restaurant. 14. A to Z Chardonnay, $10.49 for 750ml  An unoaked Chardonnay will usually please both die-hard fans and haters whose main objection to the wine is its sometimes excessive oak. This Oregon Chardonnay has some zingy lemongrass and citrus notes that make it refreshing enough to serve pre-dinner. The rounder melon and apple flavors would also make it work with a main course like seared scallops or chicken in a buttery, herby sauce.15. Oberon Cabernet Napa Valley, $19.69 for 750ml  A Napa cab for under $20 is a rare find and perfect for a dinner party small enough to break out the good stuff! The juicy blackberry and dark cocoa and coffee flavors scream BRAISED SHORT RIBS and SWEATER WEATHER.Have I missed any amazing wine finds at Costco? Let me know in the comments!",

People think Merlot is unsophisticated, despite the fact that it’s used in famous wines from Bordeaux with eye-popping prices. (If it helps, think of Merlot as Cabernet Sauvignon’s softer, more easygoing cousin.) \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLess than $15 is a great price for this medium-to-full-bodied, plush, yet juicy red, with flavors of raspberry and bing cherry and a hint of vanilla and cinnamon.

A food-friendly and accessible Pinot Noir, with ripe cherry flavors along with a bit of tart pomegranate and refreshing acidity, will quietly impress everyone with your good taste. It doesn’t hurt that Costco has a very competitive price on the Pinot from classic producer J Vineyards.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e13.

I’ve always been intrigued by the Kirkland Signature Barolo and wondered if it could possibly stack up to the famous producers whose wines go for more than twice the price. I was pleasantly surprised by the classic aromas of tart cherry, balsamic, and varnished cedar, along with firm tannins and food-friendly acidity. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/made-in-decanter-review-23273474\"\u003eThrow this in a decanter\u003c/a\u003e (or a pitcher, if that’s what you’ve got — don’t let the wine accessory industrial complex convince you expensive decanters that take up half the table are necessary) for an hour or two, \u003ca href=\"https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-make-braised-short-ribs-105868\"\u003ebraise some short ribs\u003c/a\u003e, and have a fancy night in for a fraction of what it would cost at a restaurant. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003ch3\u003e14. A to Z Chardonnay, $10.49 for 750ml  \u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAn unoaked Chardonnay will usually please both die-hard fans and haters whose main objection to the wine is its sometimes excessive oak.
