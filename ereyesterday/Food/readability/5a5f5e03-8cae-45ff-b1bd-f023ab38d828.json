Suddenly, drivers entering the Nutmeg State on Interstates 95 and 84 were greeted by this slogan: “Welcome to Connecticut: Home of the Pizza Capital of the United States.”It was an obvious bid to trigger New Yorkers, who yield to no one in their claim to the best slices and pies — even New Haven, Conn., whose place in the pizza pantheon is (with the possible exception of its clam pizza) widely accepted. But beyond some light mockery by Stephen Colbert, the signs drew no serious pushback.So last Friday, the Connecticut Office of Statewide Marketing \u0026 Tourism doubled down, starting a rollout of 11 billboards around New York City plastered with taunts like: “The Nation’s Best Pizza: Not You, New York” and “There’s No Shame In 2nd Place.” Several are provocatively placed close to the city’s top pizzerias: in Bushwick, Brooklyn (near Roberta’s), in Little Italy (near Lombardi’s) and in Greenwich Village (near John’s of Bleecker Street and Joe’s Pizza). Additional billboards are posted in subway stations and Times Square, and in Chicago, Detroit and New Jersey.ImageConnecticut has strategically placed its billboards near popular pizzerias and busy spots like Times Square.

The two have traveled together to eat pizza in Detroit, Chicago and Naples, Italy, but never to New Haven. “Incredibly shocking.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
