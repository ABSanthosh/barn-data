  "description": "I LOVE LISTS A walk down memory lane- Mother’s Day Things How much protein do you really need? People weigh in on cooking rules you can ignore. This camera is a work of art. Let’s learn about honey! I love a princess cake. How to pick strawberries. Spot the difference! I love these games I started a collection of sundresses on Amazon. The pantry in this kitchen is so charming! This yard is dreaaaaaaamy. Why you should make lasagna the day before eating. A Japanese monk explains what Zen is really about. Let’s look at amazing weather photos. I’m curious how much these lego masterpieces cost to make. Here are some facts about Alcatraz. Some big hotels are getting into glamping. This sauna in Japan looks incredible. These photos will give you some perspective. Weekend treat: Gluten Free Popovers I wrote about my grief project- Mom Yourself on my Substack this week. You can get a postcard pack in my Etsy shop. 12 reminders of how to Mom yourself. Happy Mother’s Day if you’re celebrating. Big hugs if you are experiencing Mother’s Day without your Mom. xo The post I LOVE LISTS appeared first on Shutterbean.",
