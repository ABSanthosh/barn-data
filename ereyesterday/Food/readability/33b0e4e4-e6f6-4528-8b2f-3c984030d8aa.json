Happy new year!! I can’t believe it’s 2025! This is one of my most favorite posts to share every year. Each year it’s similar but I add in/swap at least 40 to 50 of healthier meals that I really loved over the previous year and then remove the ones I wasn’t as drawn to making. I reference this post approximately ten million times over the the course of the year, especially when I’m really struggling for dinner ideas! Coming up with dinner meal plans is tricky, even for me who develops recipes for a living! I’ve mentioned before that in our perfect weeks, planning and shopping for three full meals works best for us. This way, we don’t get sick of our “menu plan,” we always end up with leftovers (but not too many leftovers), it allows for a night or two of eating out on the fly, whether it’s both of us or one of us for work, and usually will allow one night of breakfast for dinner, which we adore. This has changed a bit with the pandemic – we’ve cooked at home SO MUCH MORE than we used to. Some weeks I did five or six meals. Some weeks I only do two and we have leftovers and take out! You have to find what works for you. I always want to make sure our meals are super balanced, always including a vegetable, consistent and most of all – planned ahead of time. This is KEY and even I fall out of practice sometimes. But when our dinners our planned, we just generally eat BETTER. I’d love to hear some of your favorite meals below, along with your meal planning tips and how you plan your weeks! xo 49 WEEKS OF HEALTHY DINNER IDEAS Chipotle Roasted Cauliflower Pitas Chicken
