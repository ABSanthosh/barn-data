All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Tada Images/ShutterstockIf you tend to hit up Costco’s food court — whether to grab one of their famous hot dogs, get a slice of pizza, or snag a chicken bake — you’ll want to listen up. Starting in 2025, you won’t be able to wash any of those meals down with an ice-cold, fizzy Pepsi-branded soda because of a potential new store policy change going into effect.It’s hard to resist grabbing an ice-cold drink while you’re at Costco. While the option to enjoy fizzy sodas won’t go away at the warehouse store’s food court, your choices may change.A dedicated creator, @costcoinsider, who shares the latest news about the warehouse store, recently posted on Instagram that the brand is switching from Pepsi products in its food court to Coca-Cola ones. “Costco originally made the switch to Pepsi in 2013 as a cost-saving measure to keep their famous $1.50 hot dog and soda combo,” said the caption. “But after a standoff where Costco pulled all Coke products for a month, Coke lowered their prices, allowing Costco to switch back in early 2025.” This rumored store change would eliminate Pepsi, Mountain Dew, and Dr. Pepper, and replace them with beverages like Coke, Sprite, and Fanta. This decision to switch over the soda line is controversial for shoppers. People flooded the comments of this Instagram post created by @costcoinsider to share their take on this new change. One user said, “Thank goodness. Sorry, Pepsi, but Coke products taste better.” Others weren’t so happy. “It’s a sad day,” one Pepsi fan wrote.Costco has yet to confirm this news. And in response to this Instagram post, Costco workers shared what they know as insiders. One worker commented, “I get that your name is “Costco Insider” lol, but is this actually confirmed? I have a friend that works for Costco, and they’ve told me news about next year’s 2025 food court menu changes, but they haven’t heard anything about this yet.” Another employee mentioned, “I work at Costco and haven’t even heard of this change. I asked like seven coworkers.”If you’re a Pepsi fan, you might want to enjoy your Dr. Pepper and hot dog combo while you still can — and hope this is just a rumor. As for Coca-Cola lovers, you’ll have to wait and see if the new year brings any changes to the Costco food court.",
