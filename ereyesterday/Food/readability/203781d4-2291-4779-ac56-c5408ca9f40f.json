She was 55.“Anne was a beloved wife, sister, daughter, stepmother and friend,” her family said in a statement, which did not mention a cause of death.“Her smile lit up every room she entered. Anne’s light radiated far beyond those she knew, touching millions across the world. Though she is no longer with us, her warmth, spirit, and boundless love remain eternal.”Ms. Burrell spent years working in Italian restaurants in Manhattan, including Savoy Restaurant and Felidia Ristorante, before ascending to household fame on the Food Network. She began as a sous-chef on “Iron Chef America” to the chef Mario Batali, but her distinctive swagger made her stand apart from even the effusive Mr. Batali, prompting the network to offer her a show of her own. That show, “Secrets of a Restaurant Chef,” premiered in 2008 and ran for nine seasons.Ms. Burrell remained a staple of the Food Network, hosting the hit show “Worst Cooks in America” and appearing regularly on network favorites like “Chopped” and “Food Network Star.”In a statement, a spokeswoman for the Food Network said, “Anne was a remarkable person and culinary talent — teaching, competing and always sharing the importance of food in her life and the joy that a delicious meal can bring.”Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
