General contractors and heavy equipment operators, cleanup crew members and internet linemen rush to grab sustenance and get back to work restoring the neighborhood ravaged by January’s fire. Waiting to serve them is a line of taco trucks.“Food trucks are like first responders,” said Rodolfo Barrientos, the owner of the Gracias Señor taco truck. “We’re able to get nourishing food, not pre-prepared, where the need is.” He looked out at the smoke-scarred rubble of what was once a Ralph’s supermarket and added, “It’s sad food trucks are not as accepted as they should be.”In tourism advertising and popular media, taco trucks are celebrated as Los Angeles’s mascots. But they are a rare sight in the downtowns of exclusive neighborhoods. In 2024, Ralph’s threatened legal action against him, accusing his customers of using its parking lot, although Mr. Barrientos had parked his truck outside the grocery store on Sunset Boulevard for years without complaints.In the aftermath of the fire, he’s returned to this parking spot to serve the new arrivals and his former regulars alike.ImageBefore the fires, Rodolfo Barrientos, who owns Gracias Señor, was given a cease-and-desist order from a Ralph’s grocery store he used to park nearby.Credit...Gabriella Angotti-Jones for The New York TimesOne former regular, Jaden Tash, stopped by to get a surf-and-turf burrito. He discovered Gracias Señor when he was a student at Palisades Charter High School, known locally as “Pali High.” When he came home from college to his mother’s house, which still didn’t have water service, the truck was his first stop.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
