Pomodoro 2.0 – an update to the timing method! Photos of Jupiter are mind-blowing. What are some of the best Martha Stewart hacks?  New items at Trader Joe’s this month.  I forgot about Lifesaver holes. I love this stained glass series.  The fascinating evolution of watches.  Let’s daydream about going to a wellness resort. Sling bags: one / two / three I’ve never made a poke cake. I probably should. What’s the best frozen pie crust?  Look what you can pet at the PDX airport! I always like perusing Oprah’s favorite things list.  Here are some of my favorite things!  Check out this mainframe computer from 1953. Wow.  Need a sweet treat?
