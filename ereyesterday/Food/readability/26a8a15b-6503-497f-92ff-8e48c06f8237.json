  "description": "I LOVE LISTS Things no one tells you about starting a vegetable garden. I have a soft spot in my heart for Eichlers. Watch Pablo Picasso draw. Wow! A sketchbook restaurant! I want to color it all in. RIP George Wendt. How Norm became one of the greatest sitcom characters. How to make boxed cake mixes taste homemade. Audrey Hepburn was such a stunner. Researching- long-blooming shrubs. The healthiest/unhealthiest things to order at a Mexican restaurant, Soon we’ll have no new pennies. Daydreaming of a new sundress? I have gathered a few cute ones. Did you read about my love for crayola markers? I didn’t know grocery stores cover potatoes at night. Let’s learn about dining etiquette in Italy. Hidden interiors of musical instruments. Again, I’m curious how much all of these Legos cost. Should you shower at night or in the morning? Need a weekend breakfast idea? How about ricotta pancakes?
