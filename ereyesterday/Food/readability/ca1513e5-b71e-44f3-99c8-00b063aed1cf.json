All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Joe LingemanFor most of us, butter is a household staple that’s virtually impossible to cook without. Butter makes everything taste better, from eggs to mashed potatoes to toast to spaghetti and just about everything in between. And while you might think that all butter is created equal, that is definitely not the case. Just ask the International Cheese and Dairy Awards (ICDA) who recently named the best butter in the world for 2025.The oldest and biggest dairy show in the world, the ICDA knows a thing or two about butter. Still, to anyone who has ever tried Kerrygold Grass-Fed Unsalted Pure Irish Butter, it’s likely not a surprise that the Dairy Awards named it number one in the world. Its official gold medal title is in the “Unsalted Butter Open to Non-U.K. Producers Only” category. In simple terms: it’s the best unsalted butter from outside the United Kingdom.What makes Kerrygold Grass-Fed Unsalted Pure Irish Butter so special, you ask? For starters, it’s made from the milk of grass-fed cows, which results in a particularly rich, European-style butter with a bright yellow color and a subtle tang. It’s got more butterfat in it than typical American butter, so it’s creamy, more flavorful, and has a different texture, too. It’s perfect for baking, spreading on toast, cooking — basically, once you try it, it’s hard to go back! But, don’t just take our word — or the ICDA’s word — for it! “By far the best butter I’ve ever had. Don’t waste your money on the cheap stuff, spend a little more, it’s so worth it!” wrote one reviewer. “This butter is wonderful! The beautiful golden color and the unique creaminess is far beyond any other butter. Tastes like Ireland!” commented another. Fortunately, you don’t have to go to Europe to buy the world’s best butter. You can buy Kerrygold Grass-Fed Unsalted Pure Irish Butter at most grocery stores across the country, including the likes of Walmart and Target. Buy: Kerrygold Grass-Fed Pure Irish Unsalted Butter Sticks, $9.27",
