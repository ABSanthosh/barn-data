  "text": "Inspiration for this apple pie struck not long after posting a Shaker lemon pie earlier this year. I stumbled on a book about Shaker life and design in a used book store. My head was still in Shaker world, so I picked it up. It was a large book, the most comprehensive I’ve come across, and including entire sections about communal life, Shaker tools, and even a page about raising flowers. On the topic of flowers, Shakers traditionally did not grow them for beauty or decoration, but only for their culinary purposes or medicinal uses. Shaker Apple Pie: The Inspiration I brought the book home with me and continued reading. The account by Sister Marcia’s Bullard (1821-1899) goes on to inform, “rose petals were gathered and distilled into rose water, which was used medicinally and also as a flavoring in cooking.” Much like we use vanilla today. She then says, “rose water was a traditional ingredient in Shaker apple pies.” And that was the record scratch for me. An apple and rose scented pie? That sounds amazing (and it is!). So here we are. Apparently, rose water was an important flavoring agent in America prior to the availability of vanilla extracts. Why I love this Pie I understand what people love about the type of apple pie that is popular in the United States today. They're big on cinnamon, warming, nostalgic and cozy. This pie is all those things, minus the warming spices. And because it plays a beautiful floral wildcard, starting now, it will forever have my heart. That one move, one ingredient, changes the entire personality of the pie. If you love apple pie, and want to switch things up a bit this year, give this a try.  What Kind of Apples for Apple Pie? Honeycrisp apples are great for pies (and snacking), but they can be a bit tricky to finding certain areas outside of peak apple season. Granny Smith apples are ubiquitous and easy to buy just about anywhere, anytime. Keep your eyes open for pink lady and Braeburn apples as well. And you can always do a blend of apple types. This pie pictured here was baked with honey crisp apples. Basic Steps to Making an Apple Pie If this is your first pie, or maybe you're still gaining confidence on the pie baking front, here are the big steps and general process that goes into making an apple pie.Step one: make the apple pie filling by mixing the ingredients in a large bowl. No pre-cooking of the apples is necessary for this pie.Step two: roll out bottom pie dough and line the pie dish with the crust. (above) Step three: roll out and make the top crust. I share how to make this lattice crust below this section. Alternately, keep it simple! Roll out the top crust into a full circle and use that, cutting a few vents prior to baking to allow steam to escape. Seal and crimp. Step four: Brush with egg, sprinkle with sugar, chill and bake! To Make a Lattice Pie Crust You don't have to make a latticed top for this pie, but you can if you like. Here's how:Step one: Roll the pie dough top crust out into a 12 x 12  shape and cut into 1-inch thick strips (pictured above). My shape was too circular here, go for more of a square. Step two: Arrange 6-7 strips horizontally on a piece of parchment paper. Then, starting in the middle, working quickly with a single strip, make your strips look like this. (above) Under two, over two, under two, at 45 degree angle.Step three: Grab another single strip and do the opposite next door. So - over two, under two, over two. Keep going working outward, alternating. When you've used all your strips transfer the crust to the refrigerator for 5 minutes or so to set a bit. You'll be able to slide it off the parchment paper into place on the pie. Trim just beyond the edge of the pie dish, crimp or seal, and proceed with the recipe. What Kind of Pie Crust is Best? I’ve baked pies using a range of crusts over the years, but this is my all-time favorite pie dough now. It’s simple, incorporates all the tweaks and techniques I've experimented with, and results in a super-flaky all-butter pie crust. It's absolutely delicious. And, for this pie, it bakes up golden and beautiful thanks to a sugar-crusted egg wash prior to baking. It's also use it regularly for tarts and this deep dish quiche.I hope you enjoy this pie as much as I do! You see it server here with a dollop of whipped cream sweetened with a bit of sugar.
