I read some wonderful ones this month. I also shared my giant summer reading list, which is my favorite thing ever. Can’t wait to hear what’s on your list. I do have a book of the month membership – I love it so much. I read SO many books from this box. I get so many of my new releases and debut author books there. You can sign up for one here. Most of these books are linked through bookshop (if available!) and I highly suggest shopping through there because it will support your local indie bookstore. You can choose the local bookstore to support! I support Penguin Books when I buy which is my fave here in Pittsburgh. Okay, keep me posted on what you’re reading below! WHAT I READ IN MAY 2025 The Names – 4.5 stars I ordered this in my book of the month box and it was excellent. This story is stunning and heartbreaking and one that I could not put down. I had to know what happened. We meet Cora who is trying to escape an abusive husband and has to name her newborn son. She and her daughter want different names and the book goes off based on which name the son would have. The storyline can be a little confusing and I really had to pay attention (I think it would be difficult on audio), and some scenes were absolutely hard to read and devastating. One Golden Summer – 5 stars O.M.G. – Every Summer After is one of my favorite books ever and I didn’t think this could compete. It absolutely did and I loved it JUST as much. This is Charlie’s story – the brother from the first book – and it is incredible. Funny, heart warming, a storyline with a grandma – it’s lovely and such a feel good and thoughtful book. I adored it and am so sad it’s over. The Griffin Sisters Greatest Hits – 3.5 stars Jennifer Weiner is a must read for me every summer and and has been for almost 20 years. This was super cute and I loved the 2000s nostalgia (obviously). We follow a pop star sisters who shoot to fandom and then break up and disappear. It does give Daisy Jones vibes but I loved the timing of it all and the 90s/2000s references. Cute and was definitely hard to put down. My Favorite Bad Decision – 5 stars Oh how I LOVED this. It was so, SO good. Our female lead is forced to climb mount kilamanjara by her father (right? weird?) and ends up on the trip with a previous crush. It’s an enemies to lovers, sort of a second chance romance (kind of) trope and I adored it. I was afraid I wouldn’t – the climbing storyline did not interest me – but oh my gosh it was FABULOUS. Spicy but not until at least 60%+. The Last Trip – 4 stars Oooh this is a twisty one. I was almost afraid to read it because the story follows a couple on their babymoon. It is definitely crazy and not something I would normally pick up but I was craving a thriller. There is a twist that happens with the husband, the owners of the cabin – it’s a bit crazy but definitely something you can’t stop reading. I had to know what happened! Problematic Summer Romance – 4 stars Just finished this over the weekend and I really liked it so much. At first I thought it was a little cringe – it is a (big) age gap romance and the constant talk of him knowing her as a child, her childish behavior, etc – I didn’t think I would get past it. It made me feel a little weird, ha. But I love Ali Hazelwood books soooo much and this one did not disappoint. The setting was stunning and incredible. Definitely Better Now – 3 stars Another book of the month find. In this one we follow Emma who is a year sober after she stopped drinking and following the program. She is very young so it is from a different perspective and at time it seemed all over the place but I ended up really liking the ending! The character development really is wild and the ending is promising after some trainwreck scenes (ha IYKYK). It was very raw and real!!",
