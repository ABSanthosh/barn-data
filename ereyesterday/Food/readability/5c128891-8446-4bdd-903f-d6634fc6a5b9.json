All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Sometimes a tiny house is a smaller version of your dream home (with a mini price tag to match). But more often than not, your Pinterest-worthy compact RV, barn, or even mid-century modern home might lack the luxury features and appliances you’d get with a full-size house. Not having a bathtub, oven, or even a nice countertop can get old after a while — even if your pared-down space checks all your other boxes.So, one newcomer that takes Amazon’s tiny house inventory into luxury territory — for only $28,865 — quickly caught my eye. It’s hard to believe that, according to the Amazon listing, the two-story Luxury Portable Shipping Container Home, manufactured by Hamon, is actually made out of a 40-foot-long steel shipping container at first glance, thanks to a number of home features that would be a bonus to find in a normal-sized home, let alone a tiny one. (Learn more about standard vs. custom shipping container sizes here.) Measuring a little over 19 feet in length, 9.5 feet in width, and almost 8 feet in height, this open-plan structure includes floor-to-ceiling windows throughout, a wooden staircase, a modern kitchen with a slab counter and white tile backsplash, built-in cabinets, and nice dark gray tile flooring in the bathroom. Unlike many tiny homes that are better used as a backyard guest space, this luxury house looks like its kitchen and bathroom are completely ready to go for full-time living. The photos on the listing reveal the possibility of creating a tiny home that’s a luxury-loving entertainer’s dream: a large island with what looks like a granite-style slab top, an electric stovetop and oven, a large covered wooden deck that can easily fit a long rectangular dining table, and a bathroom with a tub, as well as a toilet, bidet, and basin sink. As an added bonus, this tiny home also advertises an eco-friendly and waterproof design with superior insulation, so it’s possible that you could also save on your utility bills, and it’s “off-grid ready.”Like all Amazon tiny homes, you can order this two-story house online to be delivered wherever you want it to be. Considering this option is cheaper than other similar small abodes currently on Amazon, like the Barn Homes brand Double Story Flat Pack House that also has two floors and outdoor space, you’ll want to order it soon to ensure that you get it before it potentially sells out.",
