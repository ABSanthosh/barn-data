All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.For every wannabe homebuyer, there’s someone who dreams of owning a tiny house — the bite-size homes with aesthetic (and compact!) living designs that have taken Pinterest home inspiration boards by storm. With a bank account-friendly price tag, a tiny home can make it feel like the only thing you’re really giving up is the extra space (and expensive mortgage payments). Luckily, Amazon just dropped a new gorgeous tiny home that comes with three bedrooms (and six total rooms) for under $100,000, making it the perfect bridge between your compact space dreams and the dream house that’s currently out of your price range.First covered by People, unlike other tiny homes, Amazon’s Barn Homes Double Story Flat Pack House is pretty spacious, giving you many features you can expect from a regular house. The barn-inspired home includes a main bedroom, two regular bedrooms, a wet-dry bathroom with a toilet, shower, and sink, an open kitchen with cabinets, French doors, plumbing and electrical systems, and two generously sized outdoor spaces where you can hang out with your morning latte or entertain guests during the warmer months. But that’s not all! There’s also a balcony on the left side of the house that comes off one of the bedrooms, as well as a large porch in front of the house right next to the glass door. Featuring a stylish black steel and dark wood design, the home also looks much more expensive than it is. The smaller, 20-foot design with just two bedrooms starts at just $39,500, while the 40-foot design that comes with three bedrooms is $79,999. Large windows promise plenty of natural light, and the bedrooms come with shiplap detailing on the walls and ceilings that Joanna Gaines would probably love. You can choose between the 20-foot design or the 40-foot design depending on your needs, but the latter really delivers on the square footage. The two-story home’s floor plan measures 113 inches in height, 630 inches in diameter, and 472 inches in width, giving you a lot of space to work with. The customizable living room and open kitchen plan measures just over 425 feet in size, and the master bedroom is almost double the size of the standard bedrooms at 207.36 feet versus 94.46 feet and 92.12 feet. Despite its relatively large size, Amazon’s newest tiny home is easy to assemble and dismantle, meaning you can fold it up and move it whenever you want. Reviewers are already raving about the “foldable barn,” with one saying, “I’ve never quite known life until I’ve owned this building. I feel like a landlord, farmer, and Minecraft advocate all in one little tornado proof cube,” while another called it the “solution to the housing crisis.”If you’re looking for something cheaper and a little bit more compact, you’ll want to keep an eye out on Amazon, as the online storefront has been dropping a number of popular tiny homes recently. In July, Amazon dropped a two-bedroom tiny home that looked like a sleek modern cabin for only $35,000, and it’s already sold out. So, if this double-story barn is calling your name, you might want to consider purchasing it before it’s also gone.This post originally appeared on Apartment Therapy.
