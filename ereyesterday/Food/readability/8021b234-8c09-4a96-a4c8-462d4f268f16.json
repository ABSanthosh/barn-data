This was too sweet for me at first because I only use plain greek yogurt. But once I cut it with plain, I ended up loving it. It’s amazing with grape nuts and fruit! Definitely tastes like dessert. Torres fried egg chips. This brand makes my favorite truffle chip and when I heard about these, I had to try. They are DELISH. HOME Corn brush. Corn on the cob season! I live for it but if there is one strand of silk, I’m done. This is saving me. Dock and Bay beach towels. These are the best because they dry SO fast – they don’t get soaking wet like terry towels. They also fold up super small to go in your bag. Mini travel umbrella. I am the worst and never ever have an umbrella. This saved my life about 50 times this month. I keep it in all my bags and it’s SO tiny! BEAUTY Naturium restoring body lotion. I go through body lotion and oil like a crazy person and this one is fantastic. Has a pump, super thick and nourishing. No scent! YSE skin glow. This was a fave last summer and it’s great. I use it for minimal makeup or no makeup days. I use it as sunscreen but with a glow. It has such a pretty finish on the skin. Kosas heartbeat blush. This color is incredible. I am such a blush fiend – this is like a hot firey red/orange/coral and so lovely for summer. I adore it! FASHION Lulu align dress. I know I talk about this over and over again but it’s just the best one. I have worn it ten million times and it holds up SO well. Crewneck flowy dress. I bought this a few months ago and it’s another dress I’ve been living in. Alo visor. I LIVE in a hat outdoors. Spring, summer and fall – constantly. I love this alo one. It is cute and looks a little more fun that my regular black ones. And the sweat band is good! MEDIA Atmosphere. Best book of the month. Unreal. Her characters kill me. Ginny \u0026 Georgia. I really loved this season so much! KIDS No leak googles. We saw a few kids have these on vacation and ordered some instantly. My kids live in goggles and these are by far the best. Comfortable, don’t fog up, don’t leak – they are so good. Toy camera. Jordan got this for his birthday and he adores it. He takes it everywhere! It is so cute. Chroma blends watercolor markers. My kids are obsessed with these, especially Emilia. They are so satisfying to use too.
