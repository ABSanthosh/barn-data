My job entails product testing and reviewing, as well as writing serviceable shopping guides for furniture and home decor. I received my undergraduate journalism degree at the University of Missouri and wrote for local publications in my college town. published nowWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.As an apartment dweller, I love small organizers that work hard for my bite-sized home. Sinkside caddies make me unreasonably excited, as do those little storage carts that can hold any number of items. My bedroom has many of these small organizers, in fact, including an over-the-door organizer and a few storage solutions for makeup that sit atop my dresser. The only problem? Small organizers ultimately fail to make up for the lack of a proper storage cabinet if that’s what your space calls for. At some point, you just have to admit that you have too much stuff and that it’s time to invest in a piece of furniture that’ll effectively corral all of the clutter. That said, finding the right unit isn’t always easy, especially when you consider that a model large enough for your needs can cost hundreds of dollars.Enter Walmart. Known for its stylish and spacious but low-cost storage solutions, the retailer has gradually become our staffers’ go-to destination for all kinds of furniture pieces. Our most recent wishlist addition? The Aiho kitchen pantry cabinet, which is selling for just $89. Despite its name, you can use the cabinet in every room and we’re certain that once you own it, you will want another.What is the Aiho Kitchen Pantry Cabinet?Although $89 might seem too good to be true, Walmart shoppers agree that the cabinet really does live up to expectations. At 47 inches tall and 26 inches wide, it’s a normal size for a cabinet; some reviewers even mentioned that it was a tad larger than they expected, especially for the price. In any case, the Aiho cabinet boasts an impressive storage capacity. The center section boasts three tall shelves, as well as shelving integrated into the back of each door. Below that, you get two short but wide easy-glide drawers that help keep miscellaneous items out of sight. The cabinet is also easy on the eyes, with a white wooden finish that blends in with a variety of interior decor styles. As a result of its versatility and homey design, the cabinet can be used for several different storage purposes, whether you place it in your bathroom, kitchen, or home office. You can even use it as a pantry cabinet to hold non-perishables or keep it in the bedroom as a supplement to your closet. One Walmart reviewer even mentioned using the cabinet as a crafting station — there are zero restrictions on how you use yours.The only small area of concern that shoppers repeatedly talked about is assembly. According to reviews, you’ll want the help of at least one other person when putting the cabinet together. You’ll also want to pay close attention to the instructions to ensure you don’t miss a small but important step. But once it’s assembled, you’ll find that the cabinet is sturdy and able to hold up to 180 lbs.What Walmart Reviewers Are Saying “It took us a while to put together, but the end result was exactly what I wanted! My old cabinet didn’t have enough space, and this one is perfect! It’s sturdy enough to hold all of my baking sheets and supplies on the bottom and snacks, chips, etc. on the top. Very happy with it!” — Renfred283 “After making sure we had the right tools, my son put the thing together during a fun afternoon visit. I moved to a very small apartment and therefore needed more pantry space. This is perfect! It’s also sturdy, and I can put shelves wherever I want. I love the cottage-style look, too.” — Esmeralda268 “Cute and functional. I’m honestly so happy with the whole setup! Before purchasing, I was very concerned about the quality because I wasn’t sure if the item would live up to expectations and hold everything I wanted to put in it. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I have more space than I expected.” — Eliza Cook/ShopA weekly newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest cooking gadgets, must-have kitchen tools, and can’t-miss sales to shop.",
