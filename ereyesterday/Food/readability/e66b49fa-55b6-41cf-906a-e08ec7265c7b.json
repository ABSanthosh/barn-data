From creamy hummus and crispy falafel to hearty soups, stews, and pasta dishes, these chickpea recipes highlight just how versatile garbanzo beans can be. Whether you prefer them roasted, stewed, or straight from the can, there’s a dish here to make your weeknights way easier (and way tastier). 1. Hummus With Aleppo, Asparagus \u0026 Sumac Radish Salad This homemade hummus from cookbook author Danielle Oron uses dried chickpeas for an ultra-creamy texture. This chickpea recipe is great on its own but even better with grilled asparagus and lemony radishes. . 2. Zahav’s Hummus Tehina As the recipe author writes, \"The secret to great Israeli-style hummus is an obscene amount of tehina (tahini).” A little different from a classic greek-style hummus, this version is extra nutty and spiced with cumin and paprika. 3. Spiced Sweet Potato Hummus Inspired by Brooklyn's Miss Ada, this hummus has a sweet and spicy spin. It blends roasted sweet potatoes with chickpeas, tahini, and lemon juice, and adds hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. 4. Smoky Fried Chickpeas Consider putting out a bowl of these smoky fried chickpeas at your next party. The trick to getting them extra crispy is drying them as possible before frying. 5. Marinated Fennel \u0026 Chickpea Salad Tartines With Whipped Feta The whipped feta on this alone will keep you coming back to this easy chickpea recipe. Prep the fennel in advance and pair with some eggs for an easy, flavorful lunch. 6. Beet Chickpea Cakes With Tzatziki These vibrant beet and chickpea cakes are great on their own, but even better with a dollop of the homemade tzatziki. It’s hearty, a little earthy, and packed with fresh dill. 7. Herby Falafel Making falafel at home is easier than you think. With just a can of chickpeas, fresh herbs, and a few spices, you’ll have crispy, golden bites in no time. 8. Chickpea, Fennel, Halloumi \u0026 Dill Salad If you’ve ever wondered what a Test Kitchen creator eats after work, it’s a salad like this. It’s Nea’s go-to recipe on busy weeknights, or when she doesn’t feel like cooking. 9. Roasted Sweet Potato, Chickpea \u0026 Kale Sheet Pan Salad A top-rated sheet-pan recipe for a reason. Sweet potatoes, chickpeas, and kale get roasted to perfection, then tossed with apple slices and a lemon-balsamic vinaigrette. 10. Spiced Chickpeas With Wilted Kale \u0026 Roasted Carrots Warming spices, tender greens, and caramelized carrots make this chickpea recipe an easy, comforting meal and lends itself to a family-style serving. 11. Mediterranean Veggie Bowls With Quinoa, Toasted Chickpeas \u0026 Harissa-Tahini Save this recipe for the next time you want to prepare meals. You can customize your bowl with any kind of in-season produce and dress it up with this delicious harissa tahini sauce. 12. Chickpea Vegetable Bowl With Peanut Dressing There’s a reason everyone’s given this chickpea recipe five stars. As the reviews say, it’s “super easy and delicious, surprisingly filling.” Plus, it makes plenty of dressing to have throughout the week. 13. Chickpea Salad With Mozzarella, Cucumbers \u0026 Tomatoes This Mediterranean-inspired salad is best in summer, but it’s so good you’ll want to make it all year long. It’s also one of those bean salads that only gets better in the fridge. 14. Panzanella With Marinated Chickpeas \u0026 Chimichurri Panzanella is already amazing (who doesn’t love bread in a salad?) but this version is even better with marinated chickpeas and a chimichurri dressing. 15. Chickpea Taco Bowls Chickpeas act as a stand-in for ground beef here, making for an unexpected yet delicious taco bowl. The secret to getting extra flavorful chickpeas is simmering them in a mixture of crushed tomatoes, vinegar, and sugar. 16. Chickpea \u0026 Lentil Salad With Shallot-White Wine Vinaigrette A salad that’s light on greens and heavy on legumes. Between the chickpeas, lentils, feta, and avocado, this bowl is filling and satisfying. 17. Warm Squash \u0026 Chickpea Salad With Tahini This salad makes the most of fall and winter produce like squash, or even pumpkin for a more seasonal spin. Have it on its own or spoon over some rice and make it a bowl. 18. Skillet Chickpeas, Chorizo \u0026 Chevre Another reminder why you should always keep a jar of roasted red peppers in your pantry. Spicy chorizo, creamy goat cheese, and smoky chickpeas come together in this quick and hearty skillet meal. 19. No-Chop Chickpea Salad True to its name, this chickpea salad recipe requires zero chopping—just mix, toss, and serve in minutes. 20.

It’s a marinade and drizzling sauce that will up your roasting game on just about everything. 23. Smoky Minestrone With Tortellini \u0026 Pesto Start by cooking onion, garlic, leeks and bacon to create the perfect base for a truly smoky minestrone. The tortellini and pesto strike this wonderful balance between a hearty soup and a pasta. 24. Kale \u0026 Chickpea Soup With Lemon This chickpea soup recipe is a great way to use up extra kale or spinach. It’s rich, bright, and the kind of soup that makes you dream of warmer days. 25.

Potato Leek Soup With Spiced Chickpeas Because a creamy potato leek soup deserves a little crunch. A handful of crispy, spiced chickpeas adds texture (and an extra punch of flavor) to this classic, comforting soup. 29. Stewy Chickpeas With Tomatoes, Capers \u0026 Feta Chickpeas simmered with tomatoes and capers get finished with feta for a salty-tangy richness that’s perfect for scooping up with crusty bread. 30. Crispy Yangnyeom Chickpeas With Caramelized Honey These get crispy and spicy-sweet thanks to a coating of caramelized honey and gochujang. Perfect for snacking straight from the pan. 31. Joy the Baker’s Olive Oil-Braised Chickpeas Sometimes the simplest ingredients make the best dishes. These slow-braised chickpeas soak up all the goodness of olive oil, garlic, and herbs, making them perfect for spooning over toast or eating by the forkful. 32. Garbanzo Aguachile Verde This bright, herby aguachile swaps seafood for garbanzos, giving you all the freshness of a ceviche with a totally plant-based twist. 33. Curried Chickpea Sandwich You don’t need chicken to make a killer salad sandwich. Mashed chickpeas, curry powder, and a little mayo (or yogurt) come together to create a creamy, flavorful filling for any sandwich. 34. Falafel Burger With Black Beans \u0026 Chipotle Have your falafel as a burger too in this smoky, spiced version. It’s crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and just the thing to pile high with toppings. 35 Chipotle Chickpea Tacos Give your taco night a plant-based twist.

This one packs in smoky chorizo, chickpeas, and wilted greens for a hearty meal any time of day. 39. Slow Cooker Pot Roast With Chickpea Salad If you can't decide between something rich and meaty or fresh and bright, this dish gives you both. Tender, slow-cooked beef meets a zippy chickpea salad for the perfect balance. 40. Sheet Pan Chicken With Broccoli, Chickpeas \u0026 Parmesan Sheet pan dinners are weeknight winners. Roast chickpeas, broccoli, and chicken thighs and finish with a sprinkle of Parmesan. 41. Warm Garam Masala Chicken Salad With Naan Croutons This spiced, warm salad has juicy chicken, chickpeas, and the best part—crispy naan croutons to soak up all the goodness. 42. Baked Chicken Legs With Tahini, Chickpeas \u0026 Dates Tahini and dates are a dream team, especially in this dish. It brings nutty, sweet, and savory flavors together—all with a perfectly roasted chicken. 43. Chicken Thighs With Chickpea Ratatouille This version keeps the best parts of a classic Ratatouille—jammy tomatoes, tender vegetables—while adding hearty chickpeas and juicy chicken thighs. 44. Slow-Roasted Salmon With Kale, Chickpeas \u0026 Fried Lemons If this chickpea recipe proves anything, it’s that crispy fried lemons take everything up a notch. The slow-roasted salmon and kale portion is equal parts bright, herby, and savory. 45. Punjabi-Style Chicken Curry For something a bit warmer than a salad, this rich, spiced Punjabi-style chicken curry is comfort in a bowl. 46. Savory Shrimp With Chickpeas, Green Olives \u0026 Preserved Lemon Briny, citrusy, and umami-packed flavors make for the best kind of seafood dish—which is exactly what this one is. Marinate chickpeas, shrimp, and green olives in a garlicky lemon sauce. 47. Cornish Game Hen Tagine This slow-cooked, spice-laden tagine is a showstopper, with game hen, chickpeas, and warming aromatics. 48. Chickpea Pot Pie Pot pie doesn’t need chicken to be rich and cozy. This version swaps in chickpeas for a creamy, hearty filling tucked under a flaky crust. 49. Pasta e Ceci (Pasta With Chickpeas) As this chickpea pasta recipe proves, pasta and chickpeas are the ultimate pantry power duo. This Roman classic is brothy, cozy, and just the right amount of creamy. 50. Farro Salad With Carrots, Preserved Lemon \u0026 Crispy Chickpeas This dish is vegan and works great as a side or a main. Perfectly crispy chickpeas give the farro and roasted carrots a nice crunch and a bit of smokiness. 51. Linguine With Chickpeas Another dish for when you’re running low on ingredients. It keeps it simple with linguine, chickpeas, and a garlicky, herby sauce. 52. Vicky Bennison’s Cupboard-Is-Bare Pasta With Chickpeas This dish proves that pantry staples can be magic. With just a few ingredients, this pasta is creamy, comforting, and ridiculously easy to pull together. 53. Victoria Granof’s Pasta con Ceci If there’s one person we trust with a chickpea recipe, it’s Victoria Granof, who has a cookbook dedicated to them. This recipe is a true one-pan pasta that only needs a few ingredients and 20 minutes of simmer time. 54. Spanish Baked Rice With Chorizo \u0026 Chickpeas This Spanish baked rice is of those minimal effort, maximum flavor dishes. The top layer of rice gets crunchy while the bottom layers stay softer and creamier. 55.
