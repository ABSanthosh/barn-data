I’m based in New York, NY.published nowWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Because I cook at home all the time, I am often putting quite a bit of my cookware to use. And while I don’t see myself ever using anything more frequently than my nonstick frying pan, there is one other piece in my collection that’s been giving it a run for its money lately: the humble saucepan. Between browning butter, making new syrups for my coffee, and warming up sauces for pasta, I have been finding myself breaking out my saucepan multiple times a week. That’s why I noticed that my old saucepan was looking like it had seen better days, so I went looking for a replacement.The one I landed on is the Little Saucy from editor-loved brand Great Jones. This saucier is very close in size to my old one (which was part of the criteria for me) and is, without a doubt, the prettiest piece of cookware I’ve ever seen (and I’ve seen a lot of cookware). It looks so nice that I just keep it out on my stovetop permanently, right beside my beloved nonstick pan.   What Is the Great Jones Little Saucy?First, you probably noticed I called Great Jones’ Little Saucy a saucier and not a saucepan. Based on the bit of research I’ve done on the topic and some visual observation, the most notable difference between the two is that the base and sides of a saucier are rounded. Truthfully, I haven’t found that the change in shape matters much when it comes to the things I normally made in my saucepan.  (Though, a saucier is ideal for keeping food from getting caught in corners and burning, according to our former tools editor.)The Little Saucy in particular is made from stainless steel and can hold as much as 1.5 quarts. It’s also induction-friendly, so no matter what stovetop you have, you’ll be good to use it. Plus, the pan has a pouring spout on one side, which makes for an easy transfer of soups, melted butter, hot chocolate, and more. Most uniquely, on the inside of the pot, there are measurements provided in quarts and liters. Why I Love the Great Jones Little SaucyI was blown away by the design of the Great Jones Little Saucy right from the start. With its mixed metal look and ultra-shiny surface, I found the Little Saucy to be even prettier than it appears in photos (which is saying something, because it photographs extremely well). Beyond how beautiful this saucier is, I also love its size. It’s perfect for my day-to-day small cooking tasks, like heating pasta sauce and soup, melting butter for baking or garlic bread, and whipping up a quick gravy to go with chicken cutlets. Another thing I love about this saucier? It doesn’t have rivets on the inside of the pot. I despise rivets when I go to clean my cookware because food always gets stuck around it. But because this pot doesn’t have them, it’s so much nicer to clean than my other pots that do.I’m lucky to have some really cute cookware in my kitchen, but Great Jones’ Little Saucy is the one I can’t help but stare at whenever I enter my kitchen. It’s just so stunning! I can’t get over it. But aside from that, it works as great as it looks: It’s impressively easy to clean, heats up quickly and evenly, and has those handy little markers inside it, which eliminates any measuring guesswork. I anticipate loving this small saucier for a long time to come.",
