The kind of news I’m going to need you to swallow your sip of coffee for:  Will and I got married!We’ve been together for a very sweet five years, and the whispers behind our backs about “when they’re finally get hitched” started to become overt open discussions, oh, four years and six months ago. This year, with everyone already gathering for Thanksgiving, we thought, we’re already making dinner, let’s throw a surprise wedding, too! No engagement, no Pinterest inspiration boards, no bridal shower games. Just a white dress I bought online one night, well past my bedtime, and a relatively impromptu wedding right there on the front porch of the Texas Bakehouse.My dad officiated, Will’s mom played the piano, and my family kicked it into high gear once the surprise was revealed Wednesday afternoon.  My mom lead the charge and everyone turned into sous chefs and event planners in a flip of a switch. It was perfect in the kind of way where you look around and realize the people you love most are holding you up, literally and figuratively.I’ll share pictures and all the sappy details soon (if you’re into that sort of thing), but for now, I wanted you to hear the news straight from me. My heart is full, my cheeks are sore from smiling, I’m done fussing people to keep the front door closed, and this year feels like it’s ending on the sweetest possible note which is a blessing indeed.  I’m most grateful for steeping our new house in memories I’ll cherish forever.I hope this Sunday is treating you with the same warmth and joy.  It’s been a wild year, but hot coffee next to Christmas tree lights is a balm, right?Let’s dig into this week’s links together.•  It doesn’t matter if I’m sleeping on an air mattress in my childhood bedroom or have my family visiting me in Texas, the question remains: Why Do I Revert Back to My Moody Teenage Self Whenever I’m Around My Family? Related: sorry, Mom! (Self)•  Should we get matching Ring Theory and Kvetching Order tattoos?  How Not To Say The Wrong Thing (LA Times)•  How To Have People Over When You’re a Clean Freak.  Clean freak I am not, but I am a Keep The Front Door Closed Freak and apparently when you have loads of people over that particular freak will very much be tested. (The Cut)•  Are you a winter, a summer, maybe an autumn?  I’m talking actual seasons, not the colors you might look best in.  I’m a summer so this particular list is helpful:  9 Ways To Embrace Winter Even If You Think You Hate It.  I really like the idea of “slow hobbies”, which begs the question:  are we all latch-hooking rugs this winter?  (TIME, Latchhooks)•  Related, I’m adding house plants to our list of slow hobbies as I currently have a growing collection of potted babies in my upstairs bathtub. Houseplants Can Make You Happier (NYT Gift)•  I did this fun interview with Better Homes \u0026 Gardens.  We cover my hosting philosophy, being a laid back Californian (laid back?), and spoiler alert: I did not personally make the Cheesecakes during my time working at The Cheesecake Factory.  Those are, in fact, made in a factory.  Joy the Baker’s House Rules (Better Homes \u0026 Gardens)•  Our friend Toby with The Best Big Kid Toys of 2024.  Can confirm I would dabble in all of these selections. (Parents)•  The Kitchn has a pretty solid list The 38 Best Food Gifts For Everyone Who Loves To Eat.  One of  my recent flexes is gifting a hunk of Parmigiano-Reggiano Cheese from Williams Sonoma. It’s both random and elite and always goes over with delight.  (The Kitchn, Williams Sonoma)•  I’m gearing up to dive head first into holiday cookie baking. I’ve not been my most neighborly self this year, just trying to keep my head above water putting the house together BUT – it’s together enough for me to devote a few weeks to making and baking cookies for elaborate holiday cookie tins for my neighbors. Can I just give my neighbors a dozen cookies in a reused tupperware container? I’m afraid that’s not who I am – not when I’ve spotted these cute cookie tins!   I’m still nailing down the exact cookie combo but there’s more than a few good ideas in this post, the new holiday magazine has cheddar and pecan cookie/cracker (because I love a savory  surprise in a cookie itn), and sure to be on the list is this recipe for Polkagriskola (Swedish Peppermint Caramels). (Amazon, Joy the Baker, Magazine Shop, Saveur)•  One thing I do miss about New Orleans is sitting at Suzonne’s kitchen counter eating a batch of her New Orleans Style BBQ Shrimp.  To be fair, it’s basically shrimp swimming in seasoned butter but there’s such art to this dish.  It’s a very cozy winter offering. Just tuck it in the back of your mind for next time you want to stand at the stove and swirl butter around a pan for dinner. (Joy the Baker)•  Our friend Timothy with a deeply satisfying bowl of Black Bean Soup.  Have you ever added a splash or fresh orange juice to black bean soup? Game changer. (Mississippi Vegan) •  I want to say that I’m currently watching The Day of the Jackal on Peacock, but mostly I’m currently falling asleep to The Day of the Jackal on Peacock.  (Youtube)•  Song of the week: As by Stevie Wonder (Spotify)My love to you!xo Joy 84 ResponsesCongratulations!!

Yes, I am a big sap that has been baking and crafting with you since your days in California so I want to see all the pics and news (that you and Will are willing to share, of course). Beautiful surprise although I may have been secretly hoping there would be a future zine for laid back wedding planning with the most fun shower / wedding appetizers, pies, DIY crafts…just sayin, haha! Much happiness to you both! You might be a close the door freak with guests, but I am a wipe down and spray the glass shower with overnight guest freak, lol!Congratulations! I am a long time read, sometime baker and am thrilled to read of your good news.Joy! I have been quietly reading your newletter for years with much pleasure! This morning I screamed: Joy and Will got married! My husband said: Who? I feel like I know you both and I am so happy for you. Sending all good wishes for a happy life together!OMG the gasp I gasped! I love how you’ve always seemed to do love in your own way…really inspires me!Joy for Joy!!! As a complete and utter nerd who has been following you since your “laid back” California days, this could not bring me more happiness for you. I still feel weird about being excited for a person I care about who I only know from the internet, but as this very weird year comes to a close, I am going to fully embrace every opportunity I have to tell absolutely everyone that I am so proud of them for how far they’ve come and how much they’ve accomplished. More than anything thank you for including us in your life as well as your culinary journey. I loved your recipes when they had fun, self conscious, single girlie anecdotes, and I’ve loved growing into my forties and reading them as the anecdotes are more about the things that I too am concerned with in this strange middling time, like eking out pleasure when it feels like I shouldn’t, caring for our communities in real time, sourcing delight from old things with new twists, and finally getting comfortable in my own skin. Anyway, enough about me, Congratulations Joy! wishing you all the happiness and true delight of both the season and the matrimony! Hugs for all!So cool! Congratulations! He’s a lucky man ?Why the question mark? No, I meant to say Will is a lucky man! Thanks for sharing this big news. So happy for you.Congratulations and so happy for you! I’m totally into wanting to see all the pictures and every tiny detail!! Wishing you a lifetime of happiness! ???I could not love this surprise DIY wedding more! I love how your families pitched in! Our son got married two days before you. The bride’s sister officiated, we baked cookies and scones and made tea sandwiches for a lovely tea party reception, they made a great playlist for dancing, had board games because they met in DnD club in college, and the families and wedding party worked their you know whats off setting up, taking down, cleaning…it was fabulous! I definitely team intimate wedding. Congrats and best wishes to you and Will!Wheeeeee!!!!!!! Confession, I’m totally one who has been wondering “will they get married?” for the past 5 years, since your trips to Dallas became more frequent from New Orleans..then the move..motorcyle camping…Scottland- and to open this newletter, my heart sings for you!! YAYYA!!!!! Wishing you both the best! Can’t wait for all the sappy details and so wonderful that you did it in a totally Joy-ful way ;) xoxSo happy for you, congratulations!!
