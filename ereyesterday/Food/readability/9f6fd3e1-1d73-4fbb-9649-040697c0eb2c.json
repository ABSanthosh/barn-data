  "text": "A peek at everything I loved in March 2025! FOOD Sour cherry preserves. I’m on a real english muffin, almond butter, cherry jam kick. It’s so good. Bees Knees salted honey. This… is amazing. I thought I loved hot honey? New obsession unlocked. Blueberry yogurt pretzels. I first had blueberry pretzels 12 years ago and I constantly think about them. They are so good. Like deliciously artificially good. Such a fun snack! My kids are loving them too. Starbucks Iced Cherry Chai. I can’t get enough of this. It is so super delicious! The cherry cold foam… oh my gosh. HOME Breville air fryer pro. I’ve had this for years but am instantly reminded how wonderful it is. It’s super easy and such a great air fryer! Easy plant. I’ve wanted to get house plants since we moved in. We have TONS of natural light and I knew I needed to find the right plants but I also wanted good, high quality ones. We just don’t have many places around here that fit the bill. In my search I discovered easy plant and I bit the bullet a few weeks ago. I got a trio and two stands and I LOVE them!! The pot makes the watering process so easy and there is no guessing game. I don’t have a green thumb so this is key. I am so happy with them! Fresh Wave odor absorbing gel. I use this in my car under the front seats. If you have kids and they are in activities and you basically live in the car every evening… um you get it. This is great! No scent – it doesn’t make the car smell fragrant – but it does absorb odors. I change it out every two to three months or so. Artificial tulips. These fake flowers are the most realistic ones I’ve ever seen. They are so good and I’ve used them for years. Make it instantly feel like spring! BEAUTY RMS magic luminizer. If you’ve followed along, then you know I’ve loved this for years. This provides the most natural glow that is so so pretty. I use it on my cheekbones, bridge of my nose, cupids bow, brow bone, etc. It’s so natural and you only need the tiniest amount. I love it. Kitsch XL thermal rollers. I’ve been using these to add body to the top of my hair and am so happy with them! Crown Affair hair towel. I’ve now used this for over a year (or more) and I have two that I can switch between. They just released it in black and if you have dark hair that is dyed, it’s such a game changer. I use this daily and can’t live without it. The strap and the back makes it SO worth it. FASHION Varley Zip Through Knit. Particularly in the azure blue! I got one of these a few years ago and LOVE it for spring and summer. Their new blue shade is absolutely stunning and I’m so glad I grabbed it. It’s much brighter than their usual neutrals. Joy lab high rise skort. I LOVE THIS. It is so comfortable, so cute and such great quality. And the leopard print is so good (so are the solids) – you know how leopard can be iffy? This one is super cute! MZ Wallace Denim small sutton. Maybe it’s because I love the 90s at heart but a denim bag is my favorite. I have multiple MZ Wallace bags that I’ve used for well over 10 years (my first diaper bag with Max!) and the quality is incredible. They are just so easy to use and fit so much. MEDIA Substack! In case you missed it I launched a substack this month to celebrate one month out from Easy Everyday and I love it. It feels like old school blogging – more personal – and it’s such an incredible community. You can subscribe here! Care and Feeding. Definitely my fave this month – a hard read but so good. Paradise. What an incredible thrilling show! The cast is awesome. KIDS Scented water wow books. My kids loved water wow books when they were younger. I grabbed the scented ones for something fun for Jordan to do at his siblings’ sports and activities. He (and Emilia!) both love them and it keeps them entertained for quite a while. Gemstone name necklace. These are sooo cute – I’ve got them for my nieces and Emilia and just bought another for a birthday. The downside is that they take forever to arrive but they are adorable and great quality! Daise foaming body wash. Both Max and Emilia LOVE these. All of the scents are so good! I mentioned this sundae one last month, but this is a fraction of the price! [none of this is sponsored, i just love to tell you what i love every month! there are a few general affiliate links above! xo]",
