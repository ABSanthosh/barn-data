Yes, it’s adorable with its little tree-like appearance, but it doesn’t excite me the way other vegetables do. However, I do appreciate a recipe that accentuates broccoli’s positive attributes — namely, its intriguing bitterness and subtle sweetness. It’s one of the reasons I enjoy Ina Garten’s recipe for Parmesan Roasted Broccoli. The recipe, which can be found in her cookbook Barefoot Contessa Back to Basics, has been recreated over and over again — and for good reason. It’s a celebration of broccoli, in the best way.How to Make Ina Garten’s Broccoli Recipe Preheat the oven to 425°F and prepare the broccoli by cutting off florets from the thick stalks. Place the florets on a large baking sheet and add a few cloves of sliced garlic and drizzle with a healthy glug of olive oil. Season the broccoli with salt and pepper, then toss and roast until the broccoli is crisp-tender and golden in spots, about 20 to 25 minutes. Remove the broccoli from the oven, add a bit more olive oil, then toss with lemon zest, lemon juice, pine nuts, Parmesan cheese, and fresh, julienned basil. My Honest Review of Ina Garten’s Broccoli RecipeI’ve had a lot of tasty broccoli salads and broccoli cheese soup, but I’m a fan of simplicity. I’d much rather make a recipe that chooses to celebrate the main ingredient versus hide it. For that reason, I’m drawn to chefs and recipe creators who know the best method of prep to accomplish that task. Garten’s recipe for Parmesan Roasted Garlic is a lesson in cooking basics. She expertly explains how to prepare and combine the ingredients to execute a dish that leaves everyone at the table wanting more. The recipe was easy to prepare, with clear instructions that included time and visual cues. The broccoli came out crisp-tender, with golden-brown tips. The addition of both lemon zest and lemon juice gave the broccoli a sunny disposition. I enjoyed the creamy, toasty pine nuts and the salty Parmesan as well, and the basil provided a lively, fresh finishing touch!Tips for Making Ina Garten’s Broccoli Recipe Preheat the baking sheet. My favorite hack for roasting vegetables is adding my baking sheet to the oven to warm up while it preheats. This shortens the cooking time and allows for more even browning. Use two baking sheets. The recipe calls for 8 cups of broccoli florets, which isn’t a small amount. I like to use two baking sheets to allow ample room cooking, without steaming. Consider blanching and shocking. For brightly colored roasted broccoli, consider blanching and shocking the vegetable first. A quick trip in some salted water followed by a brief ice bath is all it needs. Blanching and shocking also partially cooks the broccoli, which also means less time in the oven.",
