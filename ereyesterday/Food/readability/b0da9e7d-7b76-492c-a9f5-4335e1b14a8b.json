For the celebrity chef, restaurants are in her blood. Her mom and grandmother both worked as waitresses in Los Angeles diners. Later, her family opened a diner in Beverly Hills called Fred’s of New York, which brought the old-school New York City deli elements to LA.“I was always in the atmosphere of food,” Lofaso tells The Kitchn. “When I was a teenager and my parents were like, ‘You guys got to get a job.’ The first initial thought was, ‘I got to get a job in food.’” Lofaso found a job at a hot dog place in the Sherman Oaks Galleria and later a Chinese restaurant chain called Chin Chin. During college, she worked as a server and hostess for New York City restaurants. “The only thing I never did was bartend,” she says before adding, “I was always just drawn to the restaurant world.”She eventually began studying at the French Culinary Institute in Manhattan. After graduation, she started working for the legendary Wolfgang Puck. “Basically right out of school, I was like, I want to work for the biggest and the best in Los Angeles. And that was Wolfgang Puck at Spago. I spent about 10 years there just honing every skill I could possibly imagine,” she explained.Flash forward to 2025 when she now owns the LA restaurants Black Market Liquor Bar, Scopa Italian Roots, and DAMA, and frequently is invited to appear at food festivals all over the world. At a recent culinary festival called Autentico in Aruba, hosted by the Aruba Tourism Authority, Lofaso helped oversee the island’s first-ever Iron Chef competition. “Everyone was so welcoming and so excited about the island,” she continues. “I was really kind of blown away by the food component and not just the influences of the different islands in the areas that make up the true Caribbean or even food that’s local to that area. It was the influence of so many chefs that have traveled and have brought back ideas. And there was so much integration of Korean style food, Japanese style food, Italian style food that was all sort of brought onto the island.”For this edition of Fridge Diaries, Lofaso walks us through what she keeps in the fridge. Expect snacks, a delicious roasted chicken, and a sweet frozen treat.Sparkling WaterI have two different brands that I like. I use Mountain Valley Spring Water, which delivers. I love the spring water. People laugh at me all the time because I’m so specific about my water. I’m like, “Oh, I don’t like the way that water tastes.” And everyone’s like, what are you talking about? I’m very specific about my sparkling water, so I drink Topo Chico or Mountain Valley. CheeseThere’s literally always cheese and crackers and something to make a charcuterie board. So there’s also salami. There’s always a couple of different versions of cheese.CucumberI’m always snacking on cucumbers. There’s always a tub of hummus, too. I’m a big fan of just getting in there and snacking. Everyone yells at me all the time. They’re like, you need a meal. And I’m like, or just a snack is fine? So you’ll always find salami, cheese, cucumbers, mustard. Mustard is my condiment, so you’ll find mustard and hot sauce. EggsI’ll have a big breakfast. My breakfast always includes an egg. I’ll do breakfast burgers where I’ll make a good burger, put an egg on it, bacon, and avocado. There’s usually a big gap between breakfast and lunch, or I should say my early dinner. And that’s where you’ll see me pull out the hummus and the cucumbers and have just a snack.Roasted ChickenI will roast chicken every single week. I don’t care. I am a big fan of a whole roast chicken. I try to eat as healthy as possible. So it’s just a lot of protein. It’s steak, it’s chicken, a good amount of fish, avocado, tomato, cucumber, vegetables, a little bit of rice, and some potatoes. Pasta is very rare. I leave that for when I’m out, but when I’m home, it’s just complex carbohydrates, protein, and vegetables, Ice CreamI don’t veer off the path of chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. If I’m in Italy, I’ll eat pistachio. That’s my go-to or fior di latte, I’ll eat that. But other than that, it’s chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry.",
