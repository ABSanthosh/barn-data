From juicy burgers and flame-licked steaks to smoky veggies and unexpected desserts, these are our best grilling recipes—perfect for beginners, pros, and everyone in between. So fire up the grill and get ready for your tastiest summer yet. For even more inspiration check out our favorite Genius grilling recipes and best pasta salad recipes to bring to the party as well. Jump to: Salads, Veggies \u0026 Snacks Breads \u0026 Pizza Sandwiches, Sausages \u0026 Lunch Ideas Dinner \u0026 Mains Grilled Desserts Salads, Veggies \u0026 Snacks Think beyond burgers—these grilled vegetables, salads, and smoky snacks bring fresh, flavorful energy to your cookout. Great for vegetarians or anyone looking to lighten up the grill menu, this mix of charred greens, grilled dips, and colorful skewers are as easy as they are impressive. 1. Fully Grilled Caesar Salad When grilled, romaine becomes tender and smoky while retaining the structural integrity necessary to hold a heavy dressing like Caesar. Better yet, since you’re already by the grill, you might as well top your salad with blackened shrimp or chicken. 2. Grilled Bread Salad With Broccoli Rabe \u0026 Summer Squash Marinated in spicy mayo and then charred to a desired crisp, this recipe transforms broccoli rabe and summer squash into the ideal base for a grilled, panzanella-like dish. Serve this alongside your favorite piece of fish for one of the an easy summer grilling meal. 3. Grilled Marinated Tomatoes “Balance the inherent sweetness of summer’s tomatoes with piquant flavors of nuoc cham—lime, fish sauce, chili, and shallot—and a kiss from the grill. Because you want the tomatoes to soak up the marinade, it’s a good dish to prep before guests arrive,” writes former Food52 editor Ali Slagle. 4. Grilled Eggplant \u0026 Peach Caprese Salad Recipe developer Emily puts it best: “This caprese salad ditches the tomatoes, calls in grilled eggplant and peaches, and upgrades to burrata. It’s charred and juicy, savory and sweet, warm and cool, creamy and snappy. It’s a salad interesting and satisfying enough to call dinner one night, and then repeat the next.” 5. Ignacio Mattos’ Grilled Favas A combination of briny anchovy, spicy chili, and bright lemon imparts an irresistible, complex flavor to the grilled beans. Serve—and snack on—these beans like you would a plate of blistered shishitos. 6. Grilled Avocado with Ponzu Sauce “Adapted from a menu item at Bird Dog in Palo Alto, this dish combines creamy, lightly smoky grilled avocado with homemade ponzu and freshly grated wasabi,” writes our Test Kitchen. 7. Grilled Broccolini Salad With Basil-Walnut Vinaigrette This broccolini salad is quick to make (just 20 minutes), packed with flavor (shout-out that basil-walnut vinaigrette), and—most important for a best grilling recipe—technically flexible (you can make this in the oven if the grilling conditions are sub-optimal). 8. Grilled Eggplant Agrodolce With Mint \u0026 Fresno Pepper The sweet and sour notes of agrodolce combined with fresh mint give this eggplant dish a vibrant flavor perfectly suited for any outdoor cookout. 9. Grilled Okra Pasta Salad Grilled okra partners with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, garlic-infused olive oil, and lemon to create a savory pasta salad that is both bright and acidic. 10. Very Good Grilled Artichokes Boiled with lemon and garlic, charred on the grill, and then served with separate bowls of melted butter and mayo—these artichokes are an ideal companion for a backyard hang. 11. Grilled Chicory Salad With Chile-Fennel Dressing “Something truly magical happens when you grill chicories,” writes recipe developer Asha Loupy. “Their sharpness starts to mellow, giving way to a subtle sweetness and nutty flavor. Their outer leaves caramelize and char, taking on a delicate smokiness. Their cores retain a pleasing crunch and fresh, bitter bite. Chicories’ bold flavor pair well with equally vibrant, punchy dressings, like this one bolstered by spicy serrano chiles, a hearty dose of garlic, and aromatic fennel seeds.” 12. Paul Kahan's Charred Radicchio With Arugula, Cherries \u0026 Parmigiano More grilled chicories, because they’re the best type of grilling recipes. Here, Paul Kahan—chef and owner of Chicago’s Avec and The Publican—combines sweet cherries, savory Parmesan, and peppery arugula to create a bold but balanced flavor. 13. Next Day Grilled Corn, Pineapple \u0026 Peach Salsa Transform leftover grilled corn into a crunchy, spicy-sweet salsa that works great with tortilla chips or alongside your favorite grilled fish. 14. Grilled Eggplant with Miso \u0026 Doenjang Deeply flavored by miso, sesame, and mirin, this 30-minute grilled eggplant is a last-minute side perfect for any cookout. It’s worth noting that leftovers can be repurposed into a delicious dip by blending them with tahini and olive oil. Breads \u0026 Pizza The grill isn’t just for meat. These crispy, blistered flatbreads and grilled pizzas are total crowd-pleasers. Toss dough directly on the grates for a no-oven-needed weeknight dinner—or grill up pita or naan to go with dips and spreads. 15. Grilled Green Onion Dip (Charred Scallion Dip) “This dip is a summery spin on the classic onion dip flavor,” writes community member Megan. “This is a nice recipe to have in your back pocket when you need a quick appetizer for a backyard barbecue. Don’t be shy with the salt.” 16. Grilled Bread with Thyme Pesto \u0026 Preserved Lemon Cream Move over, toaster—it’s time to throw that slice on the grill. Smear on a heavy serving of thyme pesto, top with preserved lemon, and you’ve got yourself the best grilled snack recipe. 17. Steamed Clams with Grilled Bread “This recipe is special because it explicitly instructs you to place a piece of grilled bread at the bottom of your bowl, and then to ladle the clams and broth over the top of the bread,” writes recipe developer Josh Cohen. “If you eat the clams first, you will be left with a piece of grilled bread turned soft after absorbing the broth.” 18. Grilled Bread with Goat Cheese \u0026 Green Olives In an article praising this snack’s convenience and flavor, Managing Editor Erin Alexander said the following: “Easy enough to pull together for a super-quick snack yet impressive enough for a laidback get-together, this versatile recipe combines a handful of familiar flavors (and ingredients you likely already have lying around) in an inspired way.” 19. Pan con Tomate With Burrata A member of the “five ingredients or less” club, this unassuming Italian toast becomes quite the looker when topped with burrata. Enjoy this on a warm afternoon with a glass of chilled red (one of the easiest grilling recipes on here). 20. Crostini With Ricotta, Honey and Lemon Zest According to recipe developer and Food52 co-founder Merril Stubbs, this straightforward crostini is “quite simply, good enough to eat every night.” 21. Grilled Corn \u0026 Ranch Pizzas Re: Repurposing leftover corn. Store-bought dough makes this ranch-topped pizza an ideal way to find value in what you’ve shucked but not yet eaten. 22. Speedy Romeo's Grilled Pizza With Marinated Tomatoes \u0026 Ricotta As long as you rely on the convenience of store-bought dough, this best grilled pie from Brooklyn’s Speedy Romeo’s offers a low-maintenance technique for celebrating tomatoes at the height of their season. 23. Grilled Flatbread This summer, bring bread-making outdoors with this simple grilled flatbread recipe from Resident and baking expert Erin McDowell. Serve with hummus—or use the flatbread in place of store-bought dough for any of the grilled pizzas mentioned above. Sandwiches, Sausages \u0026 Lunch Ideas From charred hot dogs and sausage rolls to smoky tofu banh mi and pressed sandwiches, these grilled lunch ideas are built for long weekends and laid-back hangs. They're easy to prep, fast to cook, and guaranteed to hit the spot. 24. Italian \"Sausage\" Sandwiches With Spicy Grilled Peppers \u0026 Fennel-Onion Mustard A classic sandwich made markedly better with the simple addition of homemade mustard. Also, don’t you want to eat the sandwich from this scene in Goodfellas? 25. Just-So-Good Grilled Portobellos If I’m doing a meatless cookout, I’m using portobellos instead of meat substitutes every time. Juicy, rich, and perfectly sized for a burger bun, this recipe is a solid ‘shroom burger entry point. 26. Beef Hot Dogs With Dirty Onions \u0026 Whole Grain Mustard If you want to tackle hot dogs made entirely from scratch, this easy grilling recipe from Romelo Bruno is what you’ve been looking for. 27. The Architecture of the Hot Dog Interested in making Chicago-style hot dogs at home? This recipe from beloved community member Pierino gives you a detailed blueprint on all things Windy City Weiner. 28. Banh Burgers There’s no shortage of texture or flavor when pickled vegetables, cilantro, jalapeño, and spicy mayo surround a pork patty seasoned with fish sauce, garlic, and onion. 29. Salmon Burgers With Avocado Aioli It’s easy to fall into a routine of preparing salmon filets the same way every time. Don’t do this: Instead, transform a single, one-pound filet into three patties, then smother them in avocado aioli. 30. Pistachio Lamb Burger With Tzatziki “These lamb burgers were a great change of pace for us and were so easy to make,” writes community member Sophie. “The yogurt-cucumber sauce was also so easy and really made the dish.” 31. Grilled Chicken Caesar Lettuce Wraps Imagine chicken Caesar wraps, but lighter, more finger food-friendly, and without the hassle of properly wrapping anything. Also, this recipe proves that Caesar is as perfect a marinade as it is a dressing. Dinner \u0026 Mains These are the stars of the grill: juicy chicken thighs, perfectly charred steaks, smoky seafood, and more. Whether you're feeding a crowd or just your weeknight crew, these mains make outdoor cooking feel effortless. 32. Za'atar Grilled Chicken Wings With Fava Bean Feta Dip Marinated overnight with lemon and za’atar, quickly grilled, then tossed in even more za’atar, these wings carry an exciting blend of heat, acid, and smoke in every bite. Also, the fava bean feta dip might become your new preferred wing condiment. 33. Cedar Plank Grilled Loup De Mer (Sea Bass) When grilled over cedar, fish takes on a gentle layer of smoke that only heightens its natural flavor. Serve this with the grilled broccoli rabe and bread salad mentioned above. 34. Grilled Peanut Tofu Marinated in a semi-spicy peanut sauce and topped with fresh herbs, this grilled tofu recipe has enough flavor to star in any barbecue, vegetarian or not. 35. Grilled Ribs With Salt \u0026 Pepper Former Food52 editor and current New York Times columnist Eric Kim explains his close relationship with these well-seasoned ribs: “This is my father's specialty—and the single thing he knows how to cook in the world. Growing up in the South, we were surrounded by American families who fed us sweet and saucy baby back ribs, but in our own home, my dad liked his ribs super simple: salt, pepper, grilled.” 36. Salt-Grilled Salmon Collar From Food52 contributor Jun comes a Japanese-inspired, salt-grilled (aka shioyaki) recipe that proves that—when cooked right—the collar is the best cut of salmon. Serve with rice and a bright, acidic side—like the marinated tomatoes above. 37. Grilled Chicken Thighs With Lemongrass Glaze Lacquered in a lemongrass, ginger, garlic, chile, and fish sauce glaze and then finished with lime and cilantro, these chicken thighs strike the right balance of heat, salt, acidity, and brightness. Serve these to your friend who thinks grilled chicken is boring. 38. Grilled Sambal Shrimp With Peach Salsa The combination of spicy, grilled shrimp and a sweet, homemade peach salsa doesn’t need to be explained—you already know this works. 39. Thai Grilled Chicken With Hot \u0026 Sweet Dipping Sauce In a comment section filled with compliments, here are some of my favorites: “Holy MOLY was this good!” says Cliff. “By far the best BBQ chicken recipe we've ever made,” writes Twinjadojo. “My husband is still raving about this dish, and he's not the overly-emotional sort,” says Flourgirl. 40. Grilled Flank Steak With Cherry Tomato Vinaigrette A cherry tomato vinaigrette—composed of roasted tomatoes and shallots, sherry vinegar, Dijon, and garlic—adds sweetness, acidity, and heat to the often convenient, always delicious flank steak. 41. Alabama-Style Chicken Kebabs Pairing tender, grilled chicken kebabs with tangy, Alabama-style “white” barbecue sauce makes a classic (albeit plain) barbecue staple much more interesting. 42. Salmon Kebabs With Nigella Swap out your boring salmon recipe for this cumin-forward grilling recipe. Serve with those grilled favas from earlier. 43. Lamb Biftekia With Anchovy, Sun-Dried Tomato \u0026 Mint Fact: Lamb skewers seasoned with anchovies, capers, lemon, mint, and sun-dried tomatoes will never not be delicious. 44. Grilled (or Broiled) Oysters With a Sriracha Lime Butter For another way to enjoy oysters at home: The grill concentrates the bivalve’s natural flavor while lime and Sriracha offer a welcomed kick (another one of our best grilling recipes). 45. Grilled Spatchcock Chicken With Herby Green Sauce Recipe developer Alexis deBoschnek says it best: “No dish screams summer quite like grilled chicken. That said, it can take time to master the grill, and chicken cooked over those ripping-hot grates runs the risk of drying out. Enter this herby green sauce, made with yogurt and loaded with a bevy of tender herbs and alliums. This recipe acts as a twofer—the sauce is used to marinate the meat, and you save some for serving, too.” 46. Grilled Pork Tenderloin With Black Plum Sauce \u0026 Peach Relish This bright, fruit-forward tenderloin is an easy way to incorporate some of summer’s greatest produce (plums and peaches) into your next cookout. 47. Grilled Red Snapper With Cara Cara Oranges \u0026 Chiles “Grilling whole fish may seem like a big fuss, but this simply grilled red snapper—which you can also make in a cast-iron pan on the stovetop—proves that it doesn’t have to be,” writes recipe developer Max Rappaport. 48. Grilled Rib Eye Steaks With Whiskey Peppercorn Sauce At its core, this is a sauce recipe. You’ll combine peppercorns, shallots, whiskey, cream, and white miso to provide a unique twist on a classic steak condiment. 49. Grilled Swordfish With Lemon \u0026 Caper Sauce Lemon, capers, butter, grilled swordfish—these are things that will always belong together. 50. Coffee-Marinated Flank Fajitas With Pico de Gallo The coffee marinade tenderizes and flavors your steak, helping it develop a subtly sweet, spicy taste while producing that perfect, easy-to-eat consistency that all good fajitas need. 51. Leftover Steak and Cheddar Sandwich Whether you made the flank or the rib eye, you’ll want to hold onto this steak sandwich recipe for the day after. Grilled Desserts Yes, dessert belongs on the grill. Let the heat do its magic on summer fruit, turn pound cake golden, or even caramelize a banana split. These sweets are simple, satisfying, and shockingly good. 52. Grilled Bananas with Buttered Maple Sauce and English Almond Toffee If you’ve got bananas, butter, maple syrup, a candy bar, and a hot grill, you might as well throw together this simple, crowd-pleasing dessert. 53. Grilled Mint Julep Peaches Inspired by the classic Southern cocktail, this easy grilled dessert combines ripe peach halves with a warm bourbon-brown sugar glaze infused with fresh mint. After a quick char on the grill, the peaches are topped with vanilla ice cream, creating a simple yet elegant summer treat. 54. Coconut Shortcakes with Grilled Pineapple These tender coconut shortcakes are layered with honey-glazed grilled pineapple and topped with a zesty lime whipped cream. A tropical twist on classic shortcake, perfect for summer grilling. 55. Grilled Strawberries Romanoff Fresh strawberries are lightly grilled to enhance their natural sweetness, then tossed with Grand Marnier and served over vanilla ice cream. A simple yet elegant dessert that brings a smoky depth to a classic treat. What’s your favorite grilling recipe? Let us know in the comments below!
