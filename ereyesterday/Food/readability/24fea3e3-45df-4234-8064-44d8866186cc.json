All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Kohler, GE, Sherwin-WilliamsNorth America’s largest trade show for all things kitchen and bath — KBIS (the Kitchen \u0026 Bath Industry Show) — took place this week, and our editors were on the scene to sneak a peek at all the new products coming out in 2025. We sent our industry experts to report back on our “Best in Show” finds, so that we could share them with you! Keep these 10 products on your radar this year — from smart podless coffee makers to the perfect finishing coat for your cabinets — we can’t wait to see these picks hit the market. Credit: Danielle BlundellSMEG Built-In Electric BBQ Grill One of our favorite aesthetic kitchen brands is venturing outside with its first outdoor appliance: the SMEG Built-In Electric BBQ Grill. This showpiece makes it easy to grill, sauté, and sear multiple dishes at once and can be installed in a kitchen island or cooktop for a sleek look. It comes in sleek stainless in three sizes — 24”, 36”, and 48” width — to fit a variety of spaces. All sizes even have independent zone controls for heat management and don’t produce any smoke. Rumor has it that SMEG will also release these grills in cart form at some point in the future, too!Credit: SharpSharp Celerity High Speed OvenThis new oven from Sharp has more than just good looks — it’s got the brains to back it up! The Celerity High-Speed Oven has nine manual modes including microwave, convection bake, air fry and grill — helping you declutter your countertops of all extraneous appliances. You can even connect it to the SHARP HOME App to control it right from your phone! It’s powerful, efficient, and would be the start of any kitchen reno. Buy: Sharp Celerity High Speed Oven, $3,299.99Credit: MideaMidea 50/50 Flex 3-Way Convertible FreezerAre you a freezer-on-top, fridge-on-bottom kind of person, or vice versa? With Midea’s new 50/50 Flex 3-Way Convertible Freezer, you don’t have to choose. This first-of-its-kind appliance’s two compartments can actually convert between all-fridge, all-freezer, and bottom-freezer modes to suit your changing food storage needs. And if that wasn’t enough for you, it even offers features like automatic defrosting and SmartHome Connectivity. As a bottom-freezer person stuck with a top freezer, may I just say: Where do I sign up? Buy: Midea 50/50 Flex 3-Way Convertible Freezer, $1,299.99Credit: Danielle BlundellJennAir 36” Induction CooktopThe world of cooktops has seen many exciting innovations in the last few years, and this new release from JennAir is no exception. In great news for people like me (who have lost all their kitchen thermometers,) this induction cooktop lets you set a precise temperature for cooking, unlike most others that work in levels of power. Pancakes that never burn? Once again — it’s not a want; it’s a need. Credit: KohlerKohler Billet Kitchen Faucet Having recently replaced my own kitchen faucet for the first time all on my own (yes, I’m very proud), I’ve spent a lot of time looking at faucets. Kohler is known for its gorgeous fixtures, and the Billet collection is no exception. The two-function pull-down spray head has touch control to toggle sprays, while its round handle makes adjusting the water temperature easy, even with one hand. This faucet comes in several classic Kohler finishes, as well as the brand’s newest innovation, Vibrant Brushed Graphite — a unique and perfect mix between black and silver. Credit: Sherwin-WilliamsSherwin-Williams Gallery Series Waterbourne Topcoat PaintOne of these things is not like the others. But don’t be fooled; this new paint product from Sherwin Williams is just as much a kitchen staple as the rest of the products on this list. The Gallery Series Waterborne Topcoat is the ultimate finishing touch for your kitchen cabinets. Designed for spray application, this smooth-finish coating is moisture- and chemical-resistant, meaning your cabinets will stay looking fresh for longer, no elbow grease required. And yes, you can expect a factory finish with this product, too, even as a DIYer. The drying time is also first in class — you can spray and reinstall your whole kitchen in about a weekend’s time, give or take. Credit: Danielle BlundellSamsung Bespoke 4-door Flex Refrigerator with AI Family HubWe’ve long been fans of Samsung’s Bespoke appliance line — especially its French door refrigerators. The perfect combination of form and function, and they just got even smarter: Samsung’s latest model now uses AI to track your food’s best-by dates and suggest recipes from what you already have in stock. No more kale will ever go to waste stuck at the bottom of your crisper drawer! This model is worth the investment in the long run, using technology to combat food waste — both for your wallet’s sake and for the environment. Credit: Danielle BlundellLG Flush Depth DishwasherThere’s nothing that looks more luxe than a clean line. We love LG’s Flush Depth Dishwasher because it fits perfectly with all standard-depth cabinets for that custom look. And this LG model has all the latest tech, too: Its QuadWash Pro and Dynamic Heat Dry capabilities provide a thorough one-hour wash and dry cycle, using “microbubbles” to remove even the toughest of stains. My favorite part though is the AutoVentDry function, which automatically opens the dishwasher door after the completion of a cycle, meaning no more musty-smelling dishes or condensation spots on your silver!Credit: GEGE Profile Smart Grind \u0026 Brew Coffee MakerThis podless, single-serve coffee maker claims to be able to grind up a barista-quality cup of coffee right from your own counter. You can adjust just about everything to your exact preferences, from brew volume to temperature to bloom time and brew strength to get the perfect cup every time. And with WiFi capabilities, you can connect it to the SmartHQ App to start brewing from bed or “order up” a cup with voice control. Buy: GE Profile Smart Grind \u0026 Brew Coffee Maker, $349.00Credit: WhirlpoolWhirlpool 36” Wide Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator  At The Kitchn, we love organizing almost as much as we love food. That’s why the Whirlpool Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator made our best-list: With its thoughtfully designed flexible spaces zoned to make the items you use the most the easiest to access, this fridge helps you keep track of what you have so that nothing goes to waste.",

This model is worth the investment in the long run, using technology to combat food waste — both for your wallet’s sake and for the environment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cfigure data-testid=\"Figure\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCredit: Danielle Blundell\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eLG Flush Depth Dishwasher\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere’s nothing that looks more luxe than a clean line. We love LG’s Flush Depth Dishwasher because it fits perfectly with all standard-depth cabinets for that custom look. And this LG model has all the latest tech, too: Its QuadWash Pro and Dynamic Heat Dry capabilities provide a thorough one-hour wash and dry cycle, using “microbubbles” to remove even the toughest of stains. My favorite part though is the AutoVentDry function, which automatically opens the dishwasher door after the completion of a cycle, meaning no more musty-smelling dishes or condensation spots on your silver!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cfigure data-testid=\"Figure\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCredit: GE\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eGE Profile Smart Grind \u0026amp; Brew Coffee Maker\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis podless, single-serve coffee maker claims to be able to grind up a barista-quality cup of coffee right from your own counter.

And with WiFi capabilities, you can connect it to the SmartHQ App to start brewing from bed or “order up” a cup with voice control. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBuy: \u003ca rel=\"noopener nofollow sponsored noreferrer\" data-link-type=\"product\" data-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5385182614913024\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://atmedia.link/product?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.geappliances.com%2Fappliance%2FGE-Profile-Smart-Grind-and-Brew-Coffee-Maker-with-Podless-Single-Serve-P7CGAAS2TSS\u0026amp;referralSource=%7BREFERRAL_SOURCE%7D\u0026amp;id=23712345\u0026amp;site=KT\u0026amp;refUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thekitchn.com%2Fbest-of-kbis-2025-23712345\" data-gtm-teaser-product-id=\"TextLinkProduct:5385182614913024\" data-gtm-teaser-product-name=\"[PLACEHOLDER NAME]\" data-gtm-teaser-product-retailers=\"GE\" data-gtm-teaser-product-url=\"https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-Profile-Smart-Grind-and-Brew-Coffee-Maker-with-Podless-Single-Serve-P7CGAAS2TSS\" data-gtm-trigger=\"element-visible click\" data-gtm-event-category=\"ecommerce\" data-gtm-ui-component=\"post_product_text_link\"\u003eGE Profile Smart Grind \u0026amp; Brew Coffee Maker\u003c/a\u003e, $349.00\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"Post__item\"\u003e\u003cfigure data-testid=\"Figure\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCredit: Whirlpool\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp data-testid=\"base-html\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhirlpool 36” Wide Counter Depth French Door Refrigerator  \u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAt The Kitchn, we love organizing almost as much as we love food.
