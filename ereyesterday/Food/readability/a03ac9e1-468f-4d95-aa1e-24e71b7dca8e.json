And his work, creating excellent natural wines, has continued through the war.Winemaking is not widely practiced today in the West Bank, though Mr. Khoury cited one other producer near Bethlehem, Cremisan Winery, which has been making wine since 1885 and is run by the Salesians of St. John Bosco, a Roman Catholic order.Since the war in Gaza began, Israel has intensified raids and arrests of Palestinians across the West Bank in what it describes as a campaign against terrorism. Mr. Khoury, who works in the West Bank, lives in Beit Hanina, a neighborhood in East Jerusalem.Going back and forth to the vines he tends near Bethlehem is tricky because it is separated from Jerusalem by a wall and several checkpoints. “Checkpoints are not predictable,” he said. “Sometimes it’s 45 minutes, sometimes two hours, especially exiting the West Bank.”Throughout history, in times of conflict, farmers and winemakers have tried to carry on as best they can. In Lebanon, where Israel has been fighting Hezbollah, Israeli airstrikes across the south and in the Bekaa Valley, prime winemaking regions, have made these areas hazardous to farm. Yet the wine growers continue, just as they did through 15 years of civil war in the 1970s and ’80s.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
