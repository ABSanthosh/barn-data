I oscillate between wanting to be informed and being so inundated with information it feels like my head will detach from my body. If you are feeling like I am, friends, I wish there were good words for this. There are no good words for this. In my all-or-nothing Taurus-logic brain, I want to flip over the proverbial table, but I cannot. What I can say is resistance and revolution can look like rest. It looks like dancing in the living room, laughing with your friends, and spending time doing things you love. It looks like focusing your mind and energy towards nurturing yourself and your community.So, what am I holding onto? Watching Kendrick at the Super Bowl, getting Beyoncé tickets this week, and leaving for Dublin on Thursday evening – a trip to celebrate my 3 year anniversary with my girlfriend, Bre. That is something my brain is excited about focusing on, and I can’t wait to share all the unreal photos from Ireland. The land where KerryGold comes from?! Tuh! I’m already crying.If you need a hug or encouragement, I will send you some. If you need family, hey girl I’m your new fun aunt. Sticking together is what will get us through. As always, take what you need, and take it easy on yourself.• Optimism in the face of uncertain times, is also revolutionary. From a 2004 archived article, these words have ripple effects in the present. (The Nation)• Just a silly lil thing to make you chuckle. When you and your bestie show up dressed the same – a dilemma, or an opportunity? (Instagram)• Not planning to watch Emelia Pérez amid the controversy? That’s okay, JP Brammer has his thoughts in a post that will make you cackle and cringe, rightfully so. (Substack)• Are you familiar with Miss Rachel? Well, she’s basically the modern day Mr. Rogers.  A theatre kid turned YouTube sensation, she’s known for teaching your kids how to do everything from sign, to learn and recognize colors/words/emotions, complete with earworm songs. Even in my nannying days, Miss Rachel remains a slam dunk, helping to educate and entertain. She’s built an empire, one cute rhyme at a time. (YouTube, Fortune)• Apparently, we are living in a post-feminist world, whatever the heck that means, especially since equality has definitely not been achieved. Today’s long read is an interesting one; reheat your coffee y’all. (The Point Magazine)• Are you a Super Bowl Party host, or an attendee? Bre and I will be walking over to our local dive bar, mostly to devour the free White Castle burgers and drink many glasses of Yuengling before rushing to my friend’s place to watch halftime. Even if you’re a party of two, these ham \u0026 cheese croissants are so easy, and so pop-able. If you need wings, crispy baked wings are on my agenda for Sunday. (Joy the Baker, The Kitchn)• The constant need for stimulation is different from whining, “I’m booooored,” when I was little. It’s an affliction now. Is what we deem as boredom actually ennui, or frustration? Has boredom become a catchall word? (The Guardian)• Fashion for my upcoming trip is leggings, layers, and this cat sweater. Honestly, the cat sweater is now my personality. (Lala)• Can I share a secret with you? Chili’s and Olive Garden have come back into my life as my favorite restaurants. *ashamed* But, hear me out, it’s so dang good. Somehow Chili’s got ahold of the TikTok generation and flipped their entire business profitable amid many corporations failing. It should be studied! Also, if you go, please get a triple dipper and their coconut margarita. Watch it BLESS YOUR LIFE. (Wall Street Journal)• Please, tell me what you’re watching these days. Apparently I need to get AppleTV+ because Severance is so popular right now. Bre and I are… we’re old. We watch High Potential, The Rookie, Celebrity Jeopardy, and Abbott Elementary, all on live television. There is nothing better than being in bed by 7pm to watch tv with someone you love. We’re truly in our Sleepytime Bear era, and I love that. (T3, Celestial Seasoning)• I will take any and all recommendations for Dublin, y’all! We are taking a tour of Giant’s Causeway, doing a cocktail making class at the whiskey distillery attached to the Guinness Storehouse, and drunk bingo. A time will be had!  For the plane, I’ve packed my eReader with a ton of books, but I need podcast req’s, please! I will definitely be downloading a backlog of Levar Burton Reads, though. (Apple Podcasts)• You will need dessert today, and why not make it two giant chocolate chip cookies or a single cinnamon roll. Either way, all the treats have to be for just you. That’s the only way this works. (Joy the Baker) 17 ResponsesI so much enjoy your Sunday posts (actually EVERYONE on Team Joy)! ? If you like High Potential, we LOVED the original French show High Intellectual Potential (HIP) on Hulu. It’s wackier \u0026 Audrey Fleurot is a whirlwind of color \u0026 flamboyance!How I miss Yuengling beer!! Please have one (or 3?) for me!!! They don’t distribute into AZ yet but still staying hopeful!!Watch “Bad Sisters” on Apple TV+ It’s about five, middle-aged sisters in Ireland and the sheer-evil man one of them is married to. There’s murder, plus comedy, in this drama you’ll want to binge. And there’s a second season! Highly recommend! ??????????Abby! Made my Sunday to hear that you are traveling to Ireland! I went in November, 2015, and it is just one of those trips that I cherish and could never recreate the awesomeness! I recommend the Little Museum of Dublin – I read that they are doing renovations in their main building but have a pop up right now. If they still do a tour / walk of Stephen’s Green, I would recommend that too since it has a great history! It’s a cool / silly / interesting museum and small enough where it doesn’t commit your entire day! Eat at Hatch \u0026 Sons cafe while you are at the museum / on Stephen’s Green – one of the best pastry breakfasts that I had while in Ireland (outside of staying at a B\u0026B where the owner made her own scones and jam!). My friend and I randomly ended up at a pub called The Confession Box. We hung with the locals, and sang loudly to Irish folk songs and mainstream rock music, haha! We were arm and arm with a couple locals, holding our Guinness high! Also, book a tour of the old library and Book of Kells at the Trinity College of Dublin – I love libraries and they had a great collection of first editions and old literature when I went. The main area of campus is beautiful so if this is your jam, I wouldn’t miss this! I wasn’t in Dublin when I went to an Irish farm with mead, but if you can find a great Meadery, I would bring some home if you can! Pack a Uniqlo ultra light down vest. I couldn’t have lived without these wonderful layering pieces! I live in Southern California, which doesn’t require too much cold weather gear, haha, so you may already have your favorite layers being in Chicago! I love that the vest squishes up into its own little bag or pocket, and it washes and dries well. I still wear mine from 10 years ago – pants, boots, long sleeve shirt, vest, and beanie – that’s what I wore the whole time! Hope you find some hidden gems while walking around!Love these tips! Makes me want to go to Ireland (more than I already do…!)The Telepathy Tapes podcast is incredible! Happy Anniversary!!Came here to say this! Obsessed and pushing this pod on anyone and everyone I can. Have a great trip! Enjoy some hot crispy fish and chips with a side of mushy peas alongside a cold cider or Harp. The best!Podcast recs: Smartless, pick and choose guests. High Grant was great, as was Keri Russell, particularly if you’re old like us and watch The Diplomat ;). Still and always, Serial. The recent one, The Kids of Rutherford County is good and restores some faith in the legal system. Have a great trip!!Happy Anniversary, have a wonderful trip!One of my favorite places in Dublin is……Marsh’s Library. It is a tiny, 18th Century still operating research library.https://marshlibrary.ie/If you like scones and coffee or tea, head to Bewley’s on Grafton Street for a nice break. Hopefully Trinity Library has reopened. Combine that with the Book of Kells. Kilmainham Gaol is a good way to learn some history. If you go, don’t miss the Proclamation sculpture across the street.I always love your posts Abby-thank you!Podcast recommendations The Amber \u0026 Lacey, Lacey \u0026 Amber Show! Sloppy seconds Black Fat Femme Podcast Text Me BackWishing you both safe travels and a trip of a lifetime!If you get AppleTV, you must watch ‘Shrinking’. So worth it. Slow horses is great too on Apple TV. It has a slower start but it’s very good.Safe travels to Ireland.Good column today!Have a wonderful trip! The EPIC museum is incredible and definitely worth your time. We also really loved Bread41 for out of this world food and Johnnie Fox’s for irish pub music and dance. I get a little teary when I rewatch videos from that night because it was so incredible. We loved all of the touristy things too, like the Book of Kells. Get to know the locals—I am a southerner and the Irish people we met even have us beat on friendliness. :) Enjoy!14 Henrietta Street is an incredible museum- similar to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in NYC. EPIC, about Irish emigration, is also great. Rick Steves has free walking tours you can download and listen to while you walk all over Dublin!Yes I second the Rick Steves rec- he is the best in the biz!Ireland!! That is at the top of my bucket list. Have the best time and tell us everything.Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

Made my Sunday to hear that you are traveling to Ireland! I went in November, 2015, and it is just one of those trips that I cherish and could never recreate the awesomeness! I recommend the Little Museum of Dublin – I read that they are doing renovations in their main building but have a pop up right now. If they still do a tour / walk of Stephen’s Green, I would recommend that too since it has a great history! It’s a cool / silly / interesting museum and small enough where it doesn’t commit your entire day!\u003cbr/\u003e Eat at Hatch \u0026amp; Sons cafe while you are at the museum / on Stephen’s Green – one of the best pastry breakfasts that I had while in Ireland (outside of staying at a B\u0026amp;B where the owner made her own scones and jam!).\u003cbr/\u003e My friend and I randomly ended up at a pub called The Confession Box. We hung with the locals, and sang loudly to Irish folk songs and mainstream rock music, haha! We were arm and arm with a couple locals, holding our Guinness high!\u003cbr/\u003e Also, book a tour of the old library and Book of Kells at the Trinity College of Dublin – I love libraries and they had a great collection of first editions and old literature when I went. The main area of campus is beautiful so if this is your jam, I wouldn’t miss this!\u003cbr/\u003e I wasn’t in Dublin when I went to an Irish farm with mead, but if you can find a great Meadery, I would bring some home if you can!\u003cbr/\u003e Pack a Uniqlo ultra light down vest. I couldn’t have lived without these wonderful layering pieces! I live in Southern California, which doesn’t require too much cold weather gear, haha, so you may already have your favorite layers being in Chicago! I love that the vest squishes up into its own little bag or pocket, and it washes and dries well. I still wear mine from 10 years ago – pants, boots, long sleeve shirt, vest, and beanie – that’s what I wore the whole time!\u003cbr/\u003e Hope you find some hidden gems while walking around!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1580755\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1580755\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eLove these tips!

The EPIC museum is incredible and definitely worth your time. We also really loved Bread41 for out of this world food and Johnnie Fox’s for irish pub music and dance. I get a little teary when I rewatch videos from that night because it was so incredible. We loved all of the touristy things too, like the Book of Kells. Get to know the locals—I am a southerner and the Irish people we met even have us beat on friendliness. :) Enjoy!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1580687\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1580687\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e14 Henrietta Street is an incredible museum- similar to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in NYC.
