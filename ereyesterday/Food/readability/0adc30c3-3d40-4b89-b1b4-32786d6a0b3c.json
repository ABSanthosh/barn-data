So when Grant Wood—a brewmaster with decades of experience—floated the idea of nonalcoholic beer to major players like MillerCoors, it didn’t exactly land. Everyone was still riding the fizzy wave. NA beer? That felt like a niche at best. But flash forward to today and the numbers—and fridges—tell a different story. Between THC seltzers, adaptogen blends, and nonalcoholic wine and beer, the low-ABV and booze-free categories are booming. And the quality? It's no longer just “good for a nonalcoholic option”—it's good, period. One brand making waves is BERO, the premium NA beer company co-founded by the incredibly likable actor Tom Holland. It launched last fall with three styles: a crisp Pilsner, a juicy Hazy IPA, and a refreshing Wheat beer. Now, they’ve just dropped their first new release since launch: Double Tasty, a bold, West Coast-style IPA brewed with premium Colorado malt and a trio of hops that bring serious citrus and pine character without any of the booze. Photo by BERO To mark the launch, I caught up with the man behind the beer: Grant Wood, BERO’s brewmaster and employee #2, who came out of retirement to help rethink what nonalcoholic beer could actually taste like. In the fall, BERO entered the scene with three core beers—and I’ll admit, I was skeptical. I’ve never been a big NA beer drinker. If I’m having a beer, I want the real stuff. And if I’m not drinking, I’ll usually reach for something light and non-beer-y. But BERO surprised me. It's citrusy and crisp, with an actual beer finish. It’s not overly sweet or watery. And that’s not by accident. The guy behind that flavor is Grant Wood, who’s worked in the brewing industry for 40 years. He worked at several major names, launched Revolver Brewing in Texas (which was later acquired by MillerCoors), and was happily retired—well, mostly. He was consulting here and there, but admittedly a bit bored until the BERO opportunity came along. “There just wasn't any interest back in 2018 at least at that larger brewery scale,” Wood told me. But he saw something others didn’t. Just like he did with craft beer before it took off in Texas. And once again, he was early. Now, nonalcoholic beer is one of the fastest-growing beverage categories. Wood decided to go all in. “We have to be able to make beer that people want to drink,” he said. What’s the Double Tasty IPA? When we spoke, Wood cracked open a can of BERO’s latest release—Double Tasty—right at the top of the call. It’s a fitting intro for someone whose job is (quite literally) making beer for a new era of drinkers. The new IPA is a West Coast style, known for its bright bitterness and clear finish. And while it’s distinctly American, the brand notes its lineage traces back to Britain—“where pale ales and IPAs first laid the groundwork for hop-centric brewing.” Photo by BERO This isn’t just a hazy trend piece either. Double Tasty leans hard into craft flavor, with a hop profile that actually pops. “These hop flavors really bring the flavor,” he explained. “You’re getting a full beer flavor, particularly from the hops.” They use a custom brewing method, a maltose-negative yeast, and just enough fermentation to give what Grant calls “beer-ness”—without letting the alcohol go above 0.5%. There’s a slight bitterness and a clean bite, just like the IPAs you’d drink on a warm afternoon—minus the nap that usually follows. So why now? Why is NA beer having this moment? Grant credits a few factors: better options on the market, a cultural shift in how we drink, and more people—like Tom Holland—reaching for booze-free alternatives beyond just Dry January. “People want the flavor of a beer, the body of a beer, the experience of holding this beer that looks like a beer, has a head of foam on top, enjoying it with friends,” he said. He also gets it on a personal level: “I’m getting to a place that a couple of beers makes me very sleepy,” he laughed. These days, he alternates between alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers depending on the vibe. I asked him what sets BERO apart from the growing number of competitors and his answer is telling. Unlike traditional breweries that start with an alcoholic beer and try to remove the alcohol after the fact, BERO was designed to be nonalcoholic from the start. “We’re creating these styles based on world-known styles, but bringing them into the less-than-0.5 alcohol space, and formulating it from that perspective,” he said. It’s a detail that matters. You can taste it. While the brewing process is shorter and uses less sugar, it’s still a technical feat. “If you're making regular beer, you're using maybe 12 to 20% of a sugar solution,” he explained. “In the case of our beer, we’re using way less. We’re only making about 6% sugar.” That tweak means the yeast can’t make much alcohol but it can still create the aromas and flavors we expect from real beer. With Double Tasty now out in the world, I had to ask: What’s next? Will we be getting new drops every season? Don’t count on it. “At BERO, they’re always innovating,” Wood told me, “but we’re also avoiding doing too much.” Instead of rushing to release new styles every month, the brand is focused on doing a few things really, really well. “I always say three flavor profiles,” he said when talking about keeping things simple. “Give them all an opportunity to bring something to the flavor profile. So you can go, you know—it brings these three things. In this case, it’s citrus, it’s piney, it’s passion fruit.” Where can I find BERO? For now, BERO’s fourth brew is here—and it’s proof that NA beer doesn’t have to feel like a compromise. Whether you’re sober-curious, skipping booze for the night, or just looking for something crisp with actual flavor, Double Tasty lives up to its name. You can find it at Target nationwide, order directly on BERObrewing.com, or find it in select stores using their locator.",

isn’t just a hazy trend piece either. Double Tasty leans hard into craft flavor, with a hop profile that actually pops. “These hop flavors really bring the flavor,” he explained. “You’re getting a full beer flavor, particularly from the hops.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eThey use a custom brewing method, a maltose-negative yeast, and just enough fermentation to give what Grant calls “beer-ness”—without letting the alcohol go above 0.5%. There’s a slight bitterness and a clean bite, just like the IPAs you’d drink on a warm afternoon—minus the nap that usually follows.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003ch2\u003eSo why now? Why is NA beer having this moment?\u003c/h2\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eGrant credits a few factors: better options on the market, a cultural shift in how we drink, and more people—like Tom Holland—reaching for booze-free alternatives beyond just Dry January.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“People want the flavor of a beer, the body of a beer, the experience of holding this beer that looks like a beer, has a head of foam on top, enjoying it with friends,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eHe also gets it on a personal level: “I’m getting to a place that a couple of beers makes me very sleepy,” he laughed. These days, he alternates between alcoholic and nonalcoholic beers depending on the vibe.\nI asked him what sets BERO apart from the growing number of competitors and his answer is telling. Unlike traditional breweries that start with an alcoholic beer and try to remove the alcohol after the fact, BERO was designed to be nonalcoholic from the start.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“We’re creating these styles based on world-known styles, but bringing them into the less-than-0.5 alcohol space, and formulating it from that perspective,” he said.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eIt’s a detail that matters. You can taste it.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eWhile the brewing process is shorter and uses less sugar, it’s still a technical feat. “If you\u0026#39;re making regular beer, you\u0026#39;re using maybe 12 to 20% of a sugar solution,” he explained. “In the case of our beer, we’re using way less. We’re only making about 6% sugar.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eThat tweak means the yeast can’t make much alcohol but it can still create the aromas and flavors we expect from real beer.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eWith Double Tasty now out in the world, I had to ask: What’s next? Will we be getting new drops every season?\nDon’t count on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“At BERO, they’re always innovating,” Wood told me, “but we’re also avoiding doing too much.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eInstead of rushing to release new styles every month, the brand is focused on doing a few things really, really well.\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003e“I always say three flavor profiles,” he said when talking about keeping things simple. “Give them all an opportunity to bring something to the flavor profile. So you can go, you know—it brings these three things. In this case, it’s citrus, it’s piney, it’s passion fruit.”\u003c/p\u003e\n              \u003ch2\u003eWhere can I find BERO?\u003c/h2\u003e\n              \u003cp\u003eFor now, BERO’s fourth brew is here—and it’s proof that NA beer doesn’t have to feel like a compromise.
