Back in Louisiana, today would find me perched at my friend Suzonne’s kitchen island, a Bloody Mary in hand, taste-testing her gumbo and potato salad before we made our way to the parade route (or let’s be honest, her front porch). There’s nothing quite like the rhythm of Mardi Gras Sunday—the buzz of floats rolling, beads flying, and friends packed into the kitchen, reveling in the best kind of chaos. Meanwhile, in Bellville, my grand festivities include planting a batch of spring hopefuls in the garden and finally—finally—getting the garage painted. Honestly, that might call for a celebration, too. A fresh coat of paint, a little dirt under my nails, and very likely, a bowl of red beans soaking for tomorrow—it’s not a parade, but it’s a beautiful season worth celebrating all the same. Now, let’s get to the links. There’s good reading, good music, and if you’re looking for a sign to treat yourself to a new purse, obviously I’ve got you covered. •  My two favorite reads of the week are on parenting and being human in the world.  The writing, as beautiful and honest as it gets.  First, Will Leitch memory, parenting and baseball  and Stacia Brown’s Last Call: on motherhood and alcohol (Substack) •  Interesting:  Can you really get a buzz without booze? (Savuer Magazine) •  I love how New Orleans will celebrate even a stray dog with so much heart:  How a Runaway Dog Became a Hero for New Orleans (The New York Times gift article) •  Speaking of New Orleans, today is a very good day to soak your red beans for tomorrow’s Lundi Gras!  You can have the New Orleans spirit wherever you are, you just have to make it! (Joy the Baker) •  I know we’ve only reached March, but I’m already brainstorming Easter lunch (Sunday, April 20th if you don’t know).  I (along with the rest of the aesthetic internet) am leaning in a classic, collected, warm, and welcoming Nancy Meyers-style Easter meal.  I already have the lavender on order for a Lavender Honey Cheesecake.  I’m thinking there must be some sort of risotto.  With a Nancy Meyers Aesthetic, it’s bound to come together beautifully and, of course, I’ll share the recipe for the entire menu with you well before Easter.  (Style by Emily Henderson) •  In our last voicenote catch up, Amy joked about us starting a podcast. Lol.  I told her we already had, it was just relegated to our private text thread.  Podcast of two. Audience of two.  if I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a thousand times:  Voice Notes Are a Small Act of Love.  (Time) •  I think we’re collectively taking up clapping onboard planes when they land successfully:  7 Tricks to Manage Anxiety About Flying.  (National Geographic) •  I’ve joined a book club with, admittedly, zero motivation to actually read the books? Not great. I can do better.  How to get back into reading (Self) •  I did some spring shopping to refresh the wardrobe.  My shoes and purses were just looking a little…. ratty, and there was just no way around it.  As a girlie with genetically problematic feet, I splurged on a pair of loafers from Calla Shoes and hallelujah!  I’ll also be wearing this Gap Dress everyday I can. It’s so comfortable and a lady at the grocery store came up to me and said “you look so classic”, which is such a solid compliment.  Lastly, I splurged on a Coach purse (I’ll only shop from the Outlet, ha!) and it’s beautifully made. The leather is so thick, I think it will also age gracefully. •  A profile of Nara Smith whom I find just *fascinating.*  (Harpers Bazaar) •  On this week’s menu I have our friend Timothy’s Vegan Daahl.  It’s so comforting but not too heavy – and fantastic for leftovers.  (Mississippi Vegan) •  The sun is shining and this is the playlist of the week. (Spotify) My love to you, friends.  Make it a great Sunday! xo Joy 9 Responses Nara Smith is indeed fascinating. I am puzzled by her, in awe of her, and also very curious about how “real” all her content is! Hah Just looking at your new dress makes me feel that spring is around the corner. I like that Coach refurbishes bags and sells them. Classic bags that look like new! I’m going to look into those flying tips, because I’m nervous about getting on a plane these days. Hi. Did you know you can return old Coach bags for a credit? And they also do repairs There is nothing like a real Coach bag…they last a lifetime. I have been slackimg off big time in the reading department but will read the article for motivation. My most favorite author…Elinor Lipman…just publihed her (14th?) book entitled “Evrey Tom, Dick and Harry”. It received a very positive review in the WAPO today. Lipmans books are written with a quick whitted, humorous, perspective that holds many truths and often a worm kind of sentimantality that often makes me sad when I reach the end of the story. I highly recommed any of her books to get you motivated again. Finally, I am very confused about your property…especially today’s photo. Do you own a second building or is that very large 2 story structure the garage? Also, a few weeks ago, there was a picture of a pool posted. Do you have one of those too? Seems like you purchased one great piece of property My “youngest” coach bag is almost 10 years old and still looks new. They’re a wonderful investment. And if you ever damage them (like break a zipper etc) or want to have them professionally cleaned, take your bag to a coach store and they will ship it off to have it repaired and refurbished. I’ve done that with several of my bags and they come back looking wonderful. I hope you enjoy your new purse! How to get back into reading Really only one correct answer…Hockey Smut! I love Hockey Smut…really all Sports, but Hockey is best 3 yrs ago, splurged on a Coach purse on sale during a ridiculously long airport layover – it is still in almost new condition and I still love it. Enjoy your treat! I miss the days that you used to comment on social and political issues going on. What happened? Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam.

It received a very positive review in  the WAPO today.\u003cbr/\u003e\nLipmans books are written with a quick whitted, humorous, perspective that holds many truths and often a worm kind of sentimantality that often makes me sad when I reach the end of the story. I highly recommed any of her books to get you motivated again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, I am very confused about your property…especially today’s photo. Do you own a second building or is that very large 2 story structure the garage? Also, a few weeks ago, there was a picture of a pool posted. Do you have one of those too? Seems like you purchased one great piece of property\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli id=\"comment-1583327\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1583327\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eMy “youngest” coach bag is almost 10 years old and still looks new. They’re a wonderful investment. And if you ever damage them (like break a zipper etc) or want to have them professionally cleaned, take your bag to a coach store and they will ship it off to have it repaired and refurbished. I’ve done that with several of my bags and they come back looking wonderful. I hope you enjoy your new purse!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli id=\"comment-1583306\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1583306\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eHow to get back into reading Really only one correct answer…Hockey Smut!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003col\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli id=\"comment-1583793\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1583793\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eI love Hockey Smut…really all\u003cbr/\u003e\nSports, but Hockey is best\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/article\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\t\u003cli id=\"comment-1583305\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1583305\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e3 yrs ago, splurged on a Coach purse on sale during a ridiculously long airport layover – it is still in almost new condition and I still love it.
