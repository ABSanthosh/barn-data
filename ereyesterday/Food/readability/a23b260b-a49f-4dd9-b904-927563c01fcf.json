The discount store’s viral appeal is that shoppers can leave with a bag of goodies for just a few dollars. Now, a few years later, shoppers are getting used to seeing higher prices on the shelves, and some even feel that the slightly higher costs allow them to splurge on stunning finds while still sticking to a budget.Recently, right in time for the holiday season, Dollar Tree stocked its shelves with the most darling-looking soap dispensers — and shoppers are racing to the stores to get their hands on them. The soap dispensers at Dollar Tree are $3 each, which makes them an affordable option for folks looking to update their bathroom or kitchen decor (or anywhere in your home with a sink). You’ll spot four different ones made of stoneware with a metal pump: a Christmas tree, snowman, snowflake, and red truck carrying an evergreen. Each pump can hold a seven-ounce container of dish soap. Dollar Tree has released these holiday stoneware soap dispensers in the past. In 2023, shoppers spotted these pumps, which went viral (one post detailing the find gained nearly 152K views!).",
