Be it crispy bacon, french fries, or a delicious vinaigrette, it will at some point try to claim your clothing for the dark side of the closet. Even worse, grease stains are extremely difficult to get out (because, you know, oil and water don’t mix).Since everyone seems to have a recipe for what works best, I decided to put five popular methods to the test. The good news is that one method really stood out, and a very close combo took second place. Here’s how to get grease stains out of clothes without breaking the bank.What’s the Best Way to Get Grease Stains Out of Clothes?How We Tested the Different MethodsHairsprayChalkDish SoapBaking SodaCredit: Photo: Ghazalle Badiozamani; Design: The KitchnWhat’s the Best Way to Get Grease Stains Out of Clothes? Immediately sprinkle salt on the grease stain. Let the salt sit and absorb the grease for a few minutes, then use Shout Advanced Grease-Busting Foam as a spot treatment before laundering the garment in hot water. Make sure the stain is completely gone before drying the garment. How We Tested the Different MethodsI tested five similarly sizable splatters of bacon grease on a 100% cotton white dress shirt. I waited 15 minutes for each stain to set (I used that time to eat the bacon!), and then got to cleaning. The ratings: Each method received a rating of one to five, with five being the best method overall and one being the least favorite method. Along with the rating, you’ll find notes on how easy or difficult the method was, how much elbow grease it took (pun intended), and how much time it took to remove. Credit: Ghazalle BadiozamaniGrease Stain Removal Method: Hairspray  Total time: 30 minutes (active time: a few seconds of spritzing) Rating: 1 / 5 The method: Lay the soiled clothing on a paper towel and saturate the stain with hairspray. Let it sit for 30 minutes, then launder in hot water. If you can still see the grease stain, spray again and let sit for another 30 minutes. Do not dry the item until the stain has been lifted.How it went: I saturated the stain with TRESemme non-aerosol hairspray and let it sit for about 30 minutes. According to my research, I should have started to see the stain lift at that point. Because the area was saturated, it was difficult to tell if what I was seeing was grease or hairspray — so I went ahead and laundered it in hot water. After removing it from the washing machine, it looked as if the stain was completely gone, but the fabric was wet, so it was hard to tell. I went ahead and tossed it in the dryer. Huge mistake — I was bummed to learn that the stain hadn’t lifted much at all, and I had set it into the fabric deeper. Out of all the methods tested, this was the least effective. I could see how you might use this method if you’re out and about and need something to intercept the stain until you can launder your clothing, but I wouldn’t recommend hairspray being your only line of defense. Definitely use dish soap, or a stain-fighting agent to spot treat your garment before laundering at home. (More on this below.)Credit: Ghazalle BadiozamaniGrease Stain Removal Method: Chalk  Total time: 15 to 20 minutes (active time: a few seconds)  Rating: 2 / 5 The method: Rub chalk over the grease stain and let it absorb the oil. Then, brush the chalk off and launder. If the stain persists, continue rubbing chalk on the fabric until the stain lifts. The idea is that the chalk will absorb the oils that hold dirt in. How it went: I definitely saw the chalk absorb the grease (it turned brownish and got gross pretty quickly), but I also noticed that rubbing the chalk seemed to move the stain around and make it bigger. When the shirt came out of the washing machine, it looked like the stain had disappeared. But once it was dry, the stain was clearly visible. I might use this method as a band-aid of sorts to absorb the grease stain until I could take the clothing item home and properly treat it with a stain-fighting agent, but would not recommend chalk on its own to fight grease stains. Credit: Ghazalle BadiozamaniGrease Stain Removal Method: Dish Soap  Total time: 10 to 30 minutes (active time: seconds) Rating: 3 / 5 The method: Squeeze a dab of Dawn dish soap onto the stain and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Place the stained garment in the washing machine and once the cycle is finished, check to be sure the stain has disappeared. If you don’t see it, you can transfer the item to the dryer; if the stain persists, repeat with more dish soap. How it went: I dabbed the dish soap right over the stain and let it sit for about 30 minutes before popping it into the washing machine on hot. (More time is better than less time, right?). Once the cycle was finished, I held up the wet cloth and couldn’t see the stain anymore, so into the dryer it went! I pulled it out of the dryer with high hopes (dishwashing detergent is a degreaser, after all!) and was disappointed to find that the stain hadn’t completely disappeared. It did work at removing quite a bit of it, but I think it’s necessary to first soak up the grease with baking soda (see below), then treat it with dish soap.Credit: Ghazalle BadiozamaniGrease Stain Removal Method: Baking Soda  Total time: 6 to 12 minutes (active time: 1 to 2 minutes)  Rating: 4 / 5 The method: Sprinkle baking soda on a fresh stain and let it absorb the grease for 5 to 10 minutes. Next, use a brush (a toothbrush or a clean kitchen brush work great) and scrub the baking soda into the stain. Once the powder changes to a brown color, scrape it off and repeat until the baking soda no longer changes color and the stain is lifted. How it went: I sprinkled the baking soda on the stain in a nice little mound and let it sit undisturbed for about 10 minutes. I shook the excess soda into the sink, grabbed my cleaning toothbrush, and started scrubbing. I definitely saw the baking soda turn a dingy brown color, so I scraped it all off, poured more soda on the stain, and let it sit for 15 more minutes. After the second pass there was so much baking soda pressed into the fabric that I really couldn’t see much of the stain at all, so I went ahead and popped it into the washing machine on hot. When the shirt came out of the wash I couldn’t see any of the stain at all, so I happily chucked it into the dryer, feeling victorious. Once out of the dryer it looked like the stain was completely gone — until I took a photo of it with my phone, then I could see the faintest ghost of the stain. I was still really happy with this method, but think it could be perfected if used in combination with dish soap after the baking soda step. It’s definitely the least harsh method! Credit: Ghazalle BadiozamaniGrease Stain Removal Method: Salt + Stain Remover Total time: 1 to 5 minutes (active time: a few seconds)  Rating: 5 / 5 The method: Immediately sprinkle salt on the grease stain (it works like baking soda to absorb the grease). After the salt absorbs the grease for a few minutes (or once you make it back home), use Shout Advanced Grease-Busting Foam as a spot treatment before laundering the garment in hot water. As always, make sure the stain is gone before drying the garment. How it went: In almost every sort of light, the stain looked like it was completely gone. Even when photographed there’s just the slightest, faintest ghost shape of the stain. This method worked just a bit better than the baking soda method, although I’m not sure how effective the salt really was.I liked this method so much, I also tried it on a yellow dinner napkin. I noticed that, once again, the grease came out, but it emerged from the dryer looking a bit worn, which tells me that this treatment is pretty harsh. I’m giving this the highest rating because it did the job and I would 100% use it again, but only on an all-white garment. I would not recommend using it on black, or anything colorful. (If you hesitate to use extra chemicals or products in your household, go with the dish soap and baking soda combo.)My Final Thoughts on the Winning Grease Stain Removal MethodOverall, with every method I tested, one thing was clear: you have to act fast. The longer time the grease stain sits, the harder it’ll be to lift it. It’s also best to only dry the garment once you’re confident the stain is completely gone. (If you have the time, you can even let it air dry.) As always, check the manufacturer’s instructions as well to ensure you don’t damage the fabric any further.
