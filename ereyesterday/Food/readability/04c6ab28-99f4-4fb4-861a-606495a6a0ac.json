  "description": "I LOVE LISTS  How do we feel about a stuffing bundt cake?  Payment apps are about to be more regulated.  These chicken parm stuffed peppers intrigue me.  How much alcohol do you need for a party? Alternately, here are some non-alocholic bevies!  Kodak is temporarily pausing film production.  Why do we cook so many things at 350F? What I ordered vs. What I got.  SF Food Bucket List.  These cakes are incredible! Whoa.  The history behind Jones soda.  I think I’d like to make a butter sculpture.  How to meditate through exercise.  Male statues wearing babies.  Metal vs. Glass baking pans.  Cute Robes: one / two / three / four Let’s look at some incredible pictures of Jupiter.  I will get getting these stamps of Betty White for sure.  Why bubble gum flavor doesn’t last.  Weekend Reading: Be Ready When the Luck Happens        Need help navigating the holiday season \u0026 New Year?
