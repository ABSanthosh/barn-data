The beauty of this recipe isn’t so much in the technicalities but in mastering a life skill: how to make a quick breakfast feel like it’s worth more than the grocery store receipt.Thick slices of brioche get the Texas Toast treatment—slathered in a garlicky, herb butter and griddled to golden perfection, crisp at the edges, soft in the center. (Texas Toast, for the uninitiated, is not just toast from Texas—it’s extra-thick, buttery with herbs and garlic powder, and kissed by the griddle to create the perfect balance of crunch and chew.) From there, we carve out a cozy littlenook for an egg to settle in and cook to golden brown perfection. The toast round is used for dipping into the soft egg yolk and *just like that* a very lovey breakfast. Description Thick slices of buttery brioche get the Texas Toast treatment—golden, garlicky, and crisp—before cradling a perfectly cooked egg in the center. This easy, elevated take on egg in a hole makes weekend mornings feel extra special with minimal effort. 2 small cloves (or 1 large) finely grated garlic  1/2 cup (1 stick, 113 grams) unsalted butter partially melted in the microwave 4 tablespoons olive oil ½ teaspoon kosher salt ½ teaspoon garlic powder ½ teaspoon each dried thyme, parsley, and oregano (or whatever dried green you have on hand and like) 1 loaf brioche bread sliced into thick slices 2 to 8 large eggs, depending on how many you’re serving For serving: sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper, hot sauce, a smear of sour cream, pickled jalapenos, fresh chopped chives Cook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark In a small bowl stir together grated garlic, soft melty butter, olive oil, salt, garlic powder, and dried herbs. Stir into a loose paste. Brush (or spread) prepared butter across both sides of each slice of bread. Use a 2 ½-3 inch round cookie cutter to cut a round out of each slice of bread. Place all the parts on a baking sheet and set aside. Heat a cast iron griddle over medium heat until very warm. Add as many slices of bread and their rounds to the griddle as will fit. Crack a large egg into the center of each bread. Cook until golden brown and flip, cooking to golden on the other side as well. Flip the rounds too! Flip the bread for as long as it takes to cook the egg to your desired doneness. Slide each slice and its round onto plates. Serve with a sprinkle of salt and pepper, a few dashes of hot sauce, maybe a dollop of sour cream, a sprinkle of chives, and jalapeno slices.",
