All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Jonathan Weiss/ShutterstockThis year’s biggest holiday trend seems to be all about nostalgia, as stores like Target and World Market have been busy taking inspiration from decades past for their most popular finds. Now, you can even give your sinks an adorably retro finish, because Costco’s viral Seasons of Joy hand-wash set is officially back in stock. Selling for just $11.99 in Costco Warehouse, per a video shared by influencer @Costco_doesitagain, the Home \u0026 Body Seasons of Joy Liquid Hand Wash collection is a holiday miracle. Just like last year, the nostalgia-inducing set comes with four differently scented soaps in vintage-inspired containers that you’ll want to keep long after you’ve used up the product.Each 21.5-fluid-ounce plastic soap dispenser features shiny gold trim around the pump and takes a look back in time with a different holiday theme set on a white background. For example, the Peppermint soap is covered in images of a a smiling snowman with flushed cheeks and decorative peppermint canes, while the Orange Spice design features a choir of wee mice dressed in holiday red singing in front of a wrapped present with bundles of pine cones, oranges, and cinnamon nearby. You can make your hands smell like a Christmas tree with the Balsam Fir soap, which is decorated with a large red bell and a red vintage car bursting with lit Christmas trees in the trunk. Lastly, the Holly Berry soap is covered with a cheerful vintage Santa Claus with rosy cheeks, a fluffy white beard, and a sprig of holly and berries. These painstakingly decorated designer soaps look a lot more expensive than they are, at approximately $3 each. And people are already starting to put up the soap collection for three times as much on eBay.While the Home \u0026 Body Seasons of Joy Liquid Hand Wash collection is bound to be a hot ticket item this year, you have a few different options (that’ll cost you quite a bit extra) if you’re not able to find the $11.99 set in stores or you don’t have a Costco membership. Unfortunately, the festive soap set is only currently available to order online via Instacart for Costco members in Australia for a steep upcharge of $29.99.",
