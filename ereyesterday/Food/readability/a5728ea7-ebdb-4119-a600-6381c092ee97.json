All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Shutterstock/Everyonephoto StudioNearly 36 percent of people living in the U.S. cannot digest lactose — a sugar found in dairy, reports the National Institutes of Health. As a result, plant-based milks like oat, almond, and soy have shown up as lifesavers for people who want to enjoy their morning cup of joe without suffering from an upset stomach afterward. The only problem? Most cafes charge extra for adding a splash of oat or almond milk to your latte, which can get pretty pricey over time. However, Starbucks — a chain that typically charges extra for plant-based milk — just rolled out a new policy that will completely end this in specific locations. On October 30, 2024, Starbucks announced that starting soon, customers will no longer have to pay extra to customize their beverages with the following non-dairy milks: soy, oat, almond, and coconut. “Core to the Starbucks experience is the ability to customize your beverage to make it yours. By removing the extra charge for non-dairy milk, we’re embracing all the ways our customers enjoy their Starbucks,” said Brian Niccol, the Starbucks Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, in a statement on the company’s website. As a result of this new policy change, Starbucks fans will see upwards of a ten-percent price reduction for the costs of their drinks. For example, a grande Pumpkin Spice Latte from Starbucks without any customizations costs $6.69, but if you order it with oat milk, it’ll run you $7.44. Starbucks shared the exciting news on Instagram, and their loyal fans could not contain their anticipation. One person commented on the post, saying, “This is actually making me tear up. I’m so excited.” Another user mentioned, “Finally, because my lactose intolerance shouldn’t be taxed.”The new policy is slated to go into effect for Starbucks customers in the U.S. and Canada starting November 7, 2024. So, as you load up on beverages this holiday season in those famous red cups, at least you can do it while saving some coins.",
