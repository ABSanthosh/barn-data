  "description": "Here are my On-the-Go Office Bag Essentials! I was up late looking through the ChatGPT subreddit and I found this ChatGPT prompt: “Based on what you already know about me and only what you already know, try to extrapolate or imagine which fantastic, mythological, movie, music, or any other famous character or person- real or fictional-best represents who I’d like to become. This could include a character from a book, a movie, a video game, or anyone from the entire range of professions and notable figures, both real and from fantasy.” Wanna know what it said? MARY POPPINS hahahahahaaaaaaa! (I’ve always wanted her bag) Let’s have a look inside… \u003cspan data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e Turns out, I have already been working hard to become Mary Poppins.

If you’ve been around here, checking out My Everyday Life, you’ve seen that I have started venturing out and doing a huge chunk of my computer work at local libraries. Over the years of working from home, I’ve realized just how easily I can get derailed by my surroundings. One minute, I’m getting up to make a cup of tea and the next… I’m folding laundry, watering plants, filming Instagram videos, getting distracted by the cats, and—somewhere between a spontaneous fridge purge—I finally rediscover my tea, now ice-cold, hours later on the dining room table. Ooof. Because of this, I often find myself working late into the night to make up for lost time. That’s why I started working away from home—fewer distractions help me focus. In the process, I’ve honed my On-the-Go Work Bag Essentials and even created a checklist to make sure I don’t forget anything. Because, yes, I have left my laptop at home. Twice. This is my Mary Poppins Bag!! Here’s the bag I use (they don’t make it anymore- sad face!) I wrote about it when I figured out my carry-on essentials which turned out to be a great resource in making this post. I also gave it a facelift with black gesso and paint pens since I wrote that post. Here’s what I carry with me: Things I MUST have to get work done: iPad laptop currently workbook hobonichi cousin planner intentions for the week planner headphones notebook It doesn’t stop there. I also have two other bags with me. Accessory Bag My Everyday Essentials On-the-go bag Say hello to my new accessory bag that holds EVERYTHING I COULD EVER WANT ON THE GO. The best part –there’s a built-in organizing system with three different colors! TECH/ PENS/ TOOLS Let’s break it down: TECH: powerbank + the charger for it laptop charger headphones charger iPhone/iPad charger a wall plug lens cloth/lens wipes polaroid printer (I don’t always carry this) I once wrote a post about how I organize my cords. This bag replaces that bag now! PENS: All of my favorite pens can be found here. I’ve written about most of them here. This whole selection here is what I bring when I’m journaling and planning on the go. TOOLS: bone folder (you never know) a ruler scissors all the things! I made a little mobile toolkit by putting these fun little things in a photo storage container. (it can also fit pens in it!). I’ll probably throw it in my baseball bag if I want to journal on the go. Mobile unit includes: tape runner correction tape washi tape exacto knife transparent sticky notes little stamps pencil sharpener eraser glue stick This is my mobile essentials kit I also carry with me. I wrote about it in my Baseball Bag Essentials post. This little kit hops from one bag to another in a snap. I try to go through it every few weeks to make sure I still have all the things I need. Things I Might Need: lip balm lipstick essential oils (I like to have a peppermint, eucalyptus or orange with me) hairbands sanitizer gum cough drops flossers nail clippers nail file advil tweezers eye drops In true Shuterbean fashion, I made myself a list! Now I have a reference! I made a big note to bring my water bottle! Here’s my make magic sticker :). If you see me working on the go… Say hello! I’ll probably give you a tour of my On-the-Go Work Bag Essentials Until next time! The post On-the-Go Office Bag Essentials appeared first on Shutterbean.",
