Then immediately went on and ordered it on amazon. I love it. It’s not too spicy and just tastes so darn good. The crunchy peanuts are everything. Good \u0026 Gather mini peanut butter pretzels. This is another snack I adore. We’ve been eating these for months, and since having kids, peanut butter filled pretzels are one of my go-to things to grab. I love that these are mini!! And that they are in snack packs. Easily transportable! Ellenos pumpkin pie yogurt. I was SOOOO excited to find this. I’ve seen others rave about it in previous years. It is just as good as I thought. It’s definitely more of a dessert yogurt. But it’s the perfect fall treat/dessert right now. And so satisfying! The yogurt is so thick and creamy. HOME Lola blankets. The hype is real, this blanket is amazing. I have tried many faux fur blankets and this one is the best. We all fight over it! It’s going to be my christmas gift for my family this year. It’s a dream. Swell salad bowl container. This salad bowl is a dreamy, especially if you want to pack a lunch for work. I don’t have to leave the house, but I still use this in my fridge to prep or store leftover salad (with a paper towel on the bottom). It’s great to eat right out of the bowl. And bonus: it can all go in the dishwasher. If something can’t go in the dishwasher? Well… yes it can. According to me. Tineco vacuum mop. I have mentioned this so many times but oh my gosh do I LOVE it. I have two now in different parts of the house and I can’t even explain how effective and wonderful this is. It cleans my floors like nothing else. It is SO worth it. Over 30K reviews don’t lie! Also such a great gift. BEAUTY Victoria Beckham eyeliner. This reminds me of urban decay liners, but better. The colors are so good. I now have 5. It stays on forever too. Rhode blush in piggy. I’ve been loving this blush for months. The color is wonderful. The lipgloss is good too but it doesn’t have any pigment. The blush is fab though. Wonderskin lip stick in bella. This color is my new favorite thing. I have never loved lip stains because they always come off red and pink. This one is more mauve and cool toned. I will use it in the morning and put gloss over it all day. Makeup by Mario moonlight palette. This was a recent purchase and it is SO good. It’s so cool toned, which I need. Every color is perfect. Isdin body lotion. I’ve used this as an after-shower lotion for a year now. I love that it has a pump, a barely-there pleasant smell and really soaks in. FASHION Spanx air essentials jumpsuit in truffle. BEST EVER. I have two other air essentials jumpsuits and was so excited to see this one in my favorite chocolate brown color. It is so pretty and I love that it has the v-neck zipper. I’m going to wear this on thanksgiving. Steve Madden leopard print sneakers. I’ve always loved leopard print everything so I’m thrilled this year. Just about died over these sneakers. They have the flattering shape like new balance 327s and are very comfortable. Vince Camuto samara mule. I also am into everything sherpa, faux fur, etc for the season. These are SO fun. They are super fluffy and furry. I will probably live in them. Athleta stellar trench. This fabric is INCREDIBLE. This trench is slightly heavier than ones I’m used to – think lululemon fabric in a trench. It doesn’t wrinkle, it lays so nicely and just looks so good over everything. Even hoodies. MEDIA Nobody Wants This. Can’t even express how much I loved it! I want to watch it over and over! Be Ready When The Luck Happens. Such a fun read for the month. I listened to it since Ina narrates. I love it. KIDS Taylor Swift sticker mosaic book. Emilia loves T Swift so this was a must! She adores the sticker puzzles too – no brainer. Palm pals. I mentioned this around christmas but they are just so cute and fun. I got the kids pumpkins and they love them. Da bomb bath fizzers. Emilia has loved these for years, but now Jordan is really into the hot wheels ones for a special bath. They are so cute. [none of this is sponsored, i just love to tell you what i love every month! there are a few general affiliate links above! xo]",
