Lay’s gave snack lovers everywhere the chance to choose the newest potato chip flavor, and the people have spoken: Bacon Grilled Cheese Lay’s potato chips have arrived.The new flavor, based on the quintessential classic American comfort food, was one of three finalists in Lay’s Do Us a Flavor Contest, which returned this year for the first time in seven years. The fun snack-centric sweepstakes gives fans the opportunity to vote for which new Lay’s potato chip flavor they love the most. This year’s finalists were nothing if not surprising and inventive: Valentina \u0026 Lime, Wavy Korean-Style Fried Chicken, and the winner, Bacon Grilled Cheese.Bacon Grilled Cheese Potato Chips are savory, cheesy, and oh-so-comforting. It’s no surprise they quickly became a fan favorite. “I kind of taste the buttery bread, gooey American cheese, and the saltiness of the bacon,” wrote the user behind the Snaxium Instagram account who broke the news. “I didn’t really get alI of it in one bite, but the more I ate, the more I picked up.”While some potato chip connoisseurs have not yet had the pleasure of sampling the new variety, they’re excited all the same. “Ooh! Yum! My tastebuds’ imagination is running wild!” wrote one Instagram commenter. “OK, keeping my eyes peeled for these!!!” another said. However, the fans who have tried the grilled cheese-inspired flavor definitely see why it won. “They need to keep these on the market, the best chips ever,” wrote one enthusiastic Lay’s Bacon Grilled Cheese fan. “My very favorite,” another said. “I’ve had these and their [sic] pretty good 👏,” wrote yet another chip-loving fan.",
