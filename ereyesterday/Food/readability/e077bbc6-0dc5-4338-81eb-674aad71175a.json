All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.One fact about my family is that we love to bake. I have a cousin who makes sculpted cakes, but not all of us are that skilled. Even so, if you open the pantry at any of our houses, you’re liking to find ingredients for everything from cookies to cakes to brownies. As a result, I’ve built up quite a collection of baking pans and mats, mixing bowls, measuring cups, rolling pins, whisks, and more. However, there is one tool that I’ve used ever since I was a child and first learned how to cook and bake on my own: Tupperware’s Mix-N-Store Pitcher.It wasn’t until I recently came across the Mix-N-Store on Amazon that I knew you could still buy them — or that this particular mixing bowl even had a name! When I was growing up, we always had one in my house and it was the first thing I’d grab because my parents often had it on hand. Plus, it didn’t hurt that it was easy for me to use, even at a young age.What Is the Tupperware Classic Mix-N-Store Pitcher?The Mix-N-Store Pitcher essentially functions as three kitchen items in one: a mixing bowl, measuring cup, and storage container. If you include its obvious use as a pitcher, then that’s four different ways to use it for meal prep and entertaining! The four-piece set includes two bowls, in four- and eight-cup sizes, and a corresponding ready-to-pour lid for each. Starting at a single cup, the bowls have measuring units etched on both sides in ounces, cups, pints, milliliters, and liters. And since they’re integrated into the bowl itself, you don’t have to worry about the numbers washing off with time and use.The wide-mouth pitchers are dishwasher-safe, microwave-safe, and equipped with sturdy, ergonomic handles that make them even easier to maneuver. Best of all, despite the pouring lids, the pitchers are able to be sealed securely for storage by simply pressing down the cover over the spout.Why I Love the Tupperware Classic Mix-N-Store PitcherEver since I was a child, the Mix-N-Store Pitcher has been a staple in our kitchen. I can remember my parents using it to mix and pour pancake batter and muffin mix into skillets and baking pans, and thanks to the ergonomic design, my brother and I could help stir and pour as kids, too. For the holidays, my mom (and now me) was often tasked with bringing the yams, and we’ve always used that pitcher to soak them in water for hours before cooking them. The Mix-N-Store is also my go-to for brownies and cookies, and while it doesn’t fully eliminate the need to pull out measuring cups, it definitely makes the cleanup a hundred times easier! I just put a little dish soap and warm water into the pitcher and wash all the spoons and gadgets I used without having to fill up the sink at all. Our Mix-N-Store Pitcher is so old that the red color (that matched the lid at one point) on the units of measurement has rubbed off significantly over time, but because the numbers are built into the bowl, I’m still able to read it clearly. From what I can see, that’s one improvement Tupperware has made to the Mix-N-Store Pitcher’s design. While the pop of color on the bowl was nice, it didn’t serve a real purpose outside of style. The pitchers having a colorful lid is just as nice, and those last much longer!If you have a small kitchen, are looking for a highly convenient set of mixing bowls, or just love Tupperware in general, these Mix-N-Store Pitchers are the real deal. Take it from someone who can’t remember a home without one in the kitchen cabinet!Buy: Tupperware Classic Mix-N-Store Pitcher Set, $32.99Cook/ShopA weekly newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest cooking gadgets, must-have kitchen tools, and can’t-miss sales to shop.",
