  "text": "Kitchen \u0026 HomeDesign \u0026 Renovationpublished about 8 hours agoWe independently select these products—if you buy from one of our links, we may earn a commission. All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Unlike in other parts of the home, when it comes to smart tech in the kitchen, there can be a fine line between utility and gimmick. Several designers and real estate pros were quick to point out their least-favorite smart “upgrades” in the kitchen for everyday use, and as Laura Chappetto, principal designer at Element Design Network, sums up, “Much like anywhere else in life, some tech can bring ease and convenience … but too much can be overwhelming and remain unused.”So what’s the sweet spot? What appliances can you add to your kitchen that will actually enhance your aesthetic, simplify your life, and possibly increase your home value? I talked to design experts, Realtors (and real home cooks!) for the best kitchen upgrades you’ll regret not splurging on.1. Smart Lights“Hands down, smart lighting is the most popular and accessible smart upgrade,” says Angelique Kreller, an interior designer with Australian brand Yabby. Sebastian Jania, owner of Ontario Property Buyers, adds that there’s great bang for your buck on this investment, since “it’s relatively inexpensive and the kitchen experience can be greatly enhanced by this. Dimming, color adjustments, scheduling, and other capabilities are available with smart lighting, which can consist of switches, fixtures, and light bulbs that can be operated via voice commands or applications,” he says. Ariel Baverman, a top Realtor for Coldwell Banker Realty, says she puts smart bulbs in regular fixtures so she can turn on all or some of the lights in a room without even getting up. “Also, I can turn them on and off remotely or by command, meaning if my hands are full carrying things at night, I don’t have to put them down and won’t be stumbling around in the dark.”2. Washers and DryersWhile technically not a kitchen or cooking appliance, the washer and dryer can often be found in the kitchen due to the convenience of sharing a water line. If this is the case, having smart laundry appliances can add a lot of appeal and usefulness to its nook in the kitchen. “The big draw on those is a remote start and being able to see if the cycle is complete,” Baverman says. “App connectivity lets you know where it is in the cycle. And if you go to work all day and don’t want your clothes to sit there wet, you can load it up in the morning and start it remotely to sync with the time you get home, then put it in the dryer immediately. Or, if you’re one of those people who just forgets that you put a load in the wash, the app will remind you!” Goodbye, mildewy rewashes!3. Full-Size Smart OvensBuilt into your range or wall, smart ovens are conventionally sized ovens that allow you to control and monitor their functions through an app. Chappetto says they’re even the “most-loved smart appliance in our clients’ homes.” Sell My House Fast Owner and Founder Daniel Cabrera adds that the preprogrammed settings common to them “facilitate better results for home cooks — it’s an investment you’ll never regret, especially when the situation requires precision and convenience.” Kreller confirms that preprogrammed settings can be particularly valuable for home cooks, taking the guesswork out of cooking by adjusting the temperature and time based on the dish. “It’s nice to be able to put your dish in the oven and trust it will be hot and perfectly cooked when dinnertime rolls around,” she says. Jania adds that it’s especially nice to be able to control and keep an eye on your cooking while running errands or being elsewhere. Additionally, Baverman adds a spiritual note to the value of smart oven functionality. “Some people also like having a Sabbath feature on their wall ovens or ranges because depending on how observant you are, these settings can help you have hot food during Shabbat and other holidays where turning on and off a ‘fire’ or power is prohibited.”4. Countertop Smart OvensIf you don’t want to splurge on a high-end built-in smart oven, no worries. They come in countertop sizes, and Braverman says she “loves” hers. “They often have an air-fryer setting, and if you’re cooking for just one to two people, it’s the perfect size for my Le Creuset stoneware baking dishes for cooking or reheating.” She’s used the programs for chicken, fish, steaks, burgers, cookies, and mini pizzas, yet is impressed that “there are still dozens of settings I haven’t even yet explored on it, even though I’ve had it for years!”5. Digital Pressure Cookers“Anything with a timer to delay start is really great, especially for people who can prep the meal ahead of time like an in-appliance mise en place,” Baverman says. And best of all, they’re useful investments you can take with you into any home.  For instance, slow cookers do all the work of making dinner for you while you’re out during the day. You can program micro computerized rice cookers to start cooking or steaming your meal to be ready at a specific time, and digital pressure cookers cover nearly any kind of cooking. “There’s nothing better than setting things up in a cooking appliance so that it starts later in the day, and I can come home to a freshly cooked meal,” she says. 6. Smart Coffee Makers Some of us can’t go without our morning joe, and programmable coffee makers have been around for quite some time. Kreller enjoys the freedom of being able to have fresh-brewed coffee “before you even step into the kitchen,” and advanced technology has made it possible to go far beyond your old-school drip. For instance, different models like the KitchenAid KF8 fully automated espresso machine or the Spinn coffee maker can make espresso, Americanos, cappuccinos, cold brew, and a medley of other barista-level concoctions using centrifugal brewing tech via one tap, or even directly from an app.Making Your Kitchen “Smarter”Other than lighting swaps, some of the brightest “smart” choices you can make for your kitchen are ones you can take with you, making them a doubly beneficial investment. For big buys, smart ovens might be the only major built-in kitchen appliance worth splurging on, unless your washer and dryer are also located in the kitchen and you plan on leaving them behind, according to the pros. Either way, the most important thing to keep in mind is how often you plan to use the features these appliances offer to justify the upgrade.Do you have a favorite “smart” kitchen upgrade you swear by?
