So glad you’re not Midwestern. ???I’m not from the Midwest, but that was my initial reaction to that statement as well! Relieved that such was not the case :)As a past resident of Bellville (class of 04) I can tell you they are not ready for Mardi Gras! Love that you bought the house down the street from Neuman’s Bakery! I know the town is small, but it has a lot of love! If you haven’t been to the Austin County Fair in the spring, make it a priority this year!Joy, I love you more every year! With all the things you have accomplished and the love you put into each and every blog, book, magazine, recipe…on and on I could go…it just seems you keep getting better. Now with a true partner in Will, your life seems to be complete. We send our love and best wishes for a fantastic 2025, all starting out for you as a married lady! WooHoo! XXOOThat 24 hour calendar piece… has some funny moments but good lord, is that the timetable most people live by?! I say No thank you, ma’am! I also still live by baker hours after over a decade of having lived that work lifestyle. I consider a 6am wake-up sleeping-in as I usually naturally wake up between 4:30-5am… which means anything done after noon is an Accomplishment and I’m typically down for the count and passed out on the couch by 8pm most nights. My friends know better than to invite me to anything that starts after 6pm. Maybe I’m no fun, but that’s my timetable!I read the 24 hour calendar with amusement! Though I’ve been retired for 3 years, I can’t shake the 5 am wake up call my brain provides. And if I’m going to wake up at 5, I’m sure as hell not going to wait until 10-10:30 for my first Diet Coke. The first DC generally is consumed by 5:30 am and then I make myself wait until lunch for the second. I love reading this post every Sunday…..since I’m up early, I probably get to share you with fewer readers. Best of luck with the new (old) home. Fill it with love, baking and quilts!That was what struck me, too – first Diet Coke at 10?! No chance! Definitely within the first few minutes of waking up. I like to start my “treats” much earlier in the day. Cheers!!Hi Joy,Thank you for yet another year of the blog, I hadn’t realised until just now that this has become my Sunday morning ritual too. Wishing you all a very healthy and happy 2025.Leave a Reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.",

Relieved that such was not the case :)\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1575698\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1575698\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs a past resident of Bellville (class of 04) I can tell you they are not ready for Mardi Gras! Love that you bought the house down the street from Neuman’s Bakery! I know the town is small, but it has a lot of love! If you haven’t been to the Austin County Fair in the spring, make it a priority this year!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1575689\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1575689\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eJoy, I love you more every year! With all the things you have accomplished and the love you put into each and every blog, book, magazine, recipe…on and on I could go…it just seems you keep getting better. Now with a true partner in Will, your life seems to be complete. We send our love and best wishes for a fantastic 2025, all starting out for you as a married lady! WooHoo!

I say No thank you, ma’am! I also still live by baker hours after over a decade of having lived that work lifestyle. I consider a 6am wake-up sleeping-in as I usually naturally wake up between 4:30-5am… which means anything done after noon is an Accomplishment and I’m typically down for the count and passed out on the couch by 8pm most nights. My friends know better than to invite me to anything that starts after 6pm. Maybe I’m no fun, but that’s my timetable!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1575648\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1575648\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eI read the 24 hour calendar with amusement! Though I’ve been retired for 3 years, I can’t shake the 5 am wake up call my brain provides. And if I’m going to wake up at 5, I’m sure as hell not going to wait until 10-10:30 for my first Diet Coke. The first DC generally is consumed by 5:30 am and then I make myself wait until lunch for the second.  I love reading this post every Sunday…..since I’m up early, I probably get to share you with fewer readers.  Best of luck with the new (old) home.  Fill  it with love, baking and quilts!\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli id=\"comment-1575656\"\u003e\u003carticle id=\"div-comment-1575656\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat was what struck me, too – first Diet Coke at 10?! No chance! Definitely within the first few minutes of waking up. I like to start my “treats” much earlier in the day.
