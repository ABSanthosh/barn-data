  "description": "Here’s what this past week looked like: My Everyday Life Week 14 SPRING TIME!!! IS HERE! My yard is popping with color. And JASMINE. The abutilon I planted is bringing in a lot of color too. Herb garden is herby. This is the before photo. I’ve been working in here all weekend. I processed March over on The Handwriting Club . All the workouts I did for March using my month template. Raining on the way to baseball. I found one of my I LOVE YOUS on the bathroom floor. Life imitates art. Chicken piccata over mashed potatoes with spinach. AMAZE Jacked up arrow. On a night walk with Casey. The moon is somewhere in there. There’s a guy riding an elephant here. 3MPH. Foraging things in the dark. We are breathing the same air. Morning visit with Jane! Here’s Penny Can you find her here? Jane gave me some plants and I am excited to see grow in my yard! I love seeing her Currently Workbooks Stripes on stripes. How I reuse my meal prep labels- here’s the video! I like my tape hoard. For the person who asked about my wedding bouquet! Straight to voicemail. Thinking about how the women I know use GRACE and then men I know use SLACK. Deep breath. What I see when I open the fridge. Leftovers with TONS of spinach this time. Cord junky. Face off. Writing time! Don’t break What is hard to replace! I wanted something to hide my products on my bathroom counter and found this guy at the thrift store. Painted it and now it’s in this corner on my bathroom counter! Wisteria blooms. Kitten visit! Sample sale at Crow Canyon Home. It’s that time of year again… What I packed for the baseball game. I FORGOT IT IN THE FRIDGE I match the page. Watching my child pitch. Another perspective. Art on the bay with Neiley. Blurry captures. Painter’s tape blue. I look like my Mom here. A genuine, blurred out smile. CHEEEEESE. Wildflowers spread across the road.
