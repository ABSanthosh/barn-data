These are all recommendations – things I have and personally love. I do include my beauty picks in my favorites every month if you’re searching! But… mostly because once 2020 hit, I just wasn’t wearing makeup as much and in the last fives years or so, I’ve made a serious switch to skincare over makeup. So many of you have told me this as you’ve gotten older and I can totally relate. I have been getting back into makeup a lot in the last few months. Probably because Jordan is finally more independent. I still love makeup and beauty products, but skincare definitely comes first for me at the moment. I’m sharing a few items that I have in my cart that are new to me. EVERYTHING else below is something I use and love (or have used and loved) – these are all my personal recommendations. I ramble about them too. They probably come as no surprise considering I’ve talked about almost everything before, but here we are! I’d love to hear what you love so I can build out my wishlist! I like to get the big items like dyson hair tools at this sale. Also, good skincare (Bader!), value size shampoo and sunscreen. I also love it to buy perfume during the sale, because you can rarely find that on sale (if ever!) – especially Tom Ford, Jo Malone, Killian, etc. All those good ones that are so expensive and never go on sale. None of this is sponsored, I just loooove talking beauty products with you. 2024 SEPHORA FALL VIB SALE FAVORITES SKINCARE Augustinus Bader The Rich Cream . I never stopped using my rich cream – at the height of the PD, I just used it as an eye cream! I LOVE how this works under makeup, both on my face and under the eyes. I will never be without this product. Yes, it is insanely expensive but if you do some research on it, it is a great product. If you’ve wanted to try, now is the time. It is rarely on sale for more than this. Tower 28 SOS spray. Can’t live without this either – a very soothing spray that has so many uses. Luna Sleeping Oil. I have loved this retinol for years. I’ve used it off and on (when not pregnant and breastfeeding!) but am now back on it and LOVE. I use it three days a week. Supergoop Value Size Sunscreen. I buy this every summer and it’s incredible. We keep it in the garage or right by the door so we always have sunscreen on hand. It lasts all summer and into fall. Supergoop Glow screen . I still love this sunscreen. I use it both on non-makeup days and under light makeup. It evens out my complexion so much and the glow is incredible. If you don’t like a glow, do NOT get this. Only thing is that if I get it REMOTELY close to my eyes, it migrates into them. Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen . I love this equally as much as the above, it’s just a different product. The formula of this is incredible. It’s almost like a primer and it’s great under makeup. This is a matte look – so nothing like the glowy one above. Tan Luxe The Butter. I’ve repurchased this so many times – it blends incredibly and is such a nice self tanning cream to use. It is a gradual tanner and doesn’t transfer to clothes once dry. The smell isn’t terrible either. Sol De Janiero Bum Bum Cream. My favorite forever, this scent is one that will immediately transport me back to pre-2020 days with so much happiness. I use this constantly and it is a wonderful moisturizing product. Sol De Janiero Bom Dia Bright Cream. This is also such a great scent. I love how delish my bathroom smells after using this. Dr Dennis Gross Facial Steamer. I bought this last year and it has changed my life! Facials at home!! It’s wonderful. Would make a great gift (for yourself?! Ha). Dr. Dennis Gross Daily Peel Pads. I haven’t stopped raving about these since I bought them and they really changed the texture of my skin. First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Cream. I love this cream for all over the body – everyone in our family uses this. It’s also fragrance free. It’s mild and great for eczema. Fresh Sugar Advanced Therapy Lip balm. Definitely my holy grail lip balm. It’s pricey and not one I keep in my purse (because they always go missing!), but it’s amazing for dry lips. Laneige Lip Glowy Balm. I love every single scent and have one in every bag. Live for these. Summer Fridays Lip Butter balm. Another excellent balm! The flavors are great. Kate Mcleod body brush. I use this before every shower. It’s so comfortable to hold. MAKEUP Beauty Blender. I am never without a beauty blender for foundation/bb cream/concealer/etc. Iconic London Underglow Blurring Primer. I don’t like primers but LOVE this. It just evens out the skin and smooths it – I use it on its own or mix with a tinter moisturizer or foundation. Iconic London Blurring Skin Tint. Also love this!! I’ve been mixing it with the above. Still light coverage, but very natural and nice. Ilia Super Serum Skin Tint. I still don’t like heavy foundation on my skin, and this is my current fave if I want a little more coverage. I’ve used this for two years and love how much it evens out my skintone. I’d say it’s light to medium coverage. bareMinerals Complexion Rescue. If you like really light coverage, this is still my absolute favorite. I’ve used it forever. Too Faced Born This Way Concealer. My favorite concealer under my eyes. It is so perfect and not too drying. Iconic London Liquid Highlight. Adore this highlight for mixing with foundation or moisturizer. It’s very liquidy and it’s pretty golden (almost too golden for me!) but it is wonderful for mixing. I use this almost everyday. Westman Atelier Contour Stick. My favorite contour stick of all time. I use the shade biscuit. I’m on my second one and it is a great formula. Rare Beauty Silky Touch Highlighter. This is such a gorgeous highlighter and creamy formula. It’a almost always sold out too. If you see it, grab it! Rare Beauty Blush. Best blush ever, with a little highlight built in. The formula is wonderful. Gucci Blush. This is also an incredible blush that is totally matte. I usually put it on first, then the rare beauty one. Fenty Instant Warmth Bronzer. I love this bronzer – it’s so natural, not orange – it’s perfect. Makeup By Mario Moonlight Palette. Current favorite eye palette. It’s so pretty. Westman Atelier Super Loaded Tinted Highlight. I have all 3 of these and love them. Rose is in the photos you see. The peau de peche is more warm. The soleil is bronzy. I love them all for different makeup looks and different times of year. Westman Atelier Baby Cheeks. This is the only blush I’ve used for over a year! My favorite shades are poppet and minette. Hourglass Unlocked Mascara. I hate buying expensive mascara but omg this is WORTH IT. It’s a tubing mascara and does not flake or smudge, plus gives excellent length. Benefit Gimme Brow. The ONLY thing I use on my brows. It’s so natural. Nothing compares to the tiny brush. Kaja Wink Stamp Liner. If you like to do a cat eye but always mess it is, THIS IS FOR YOU! You just stamp on the cat eye. It’s awesome. Nars Pro Prime Smudgeproof Base. This is my favorite for eyeshadow base. Have used it forever. Shesheido Microliner Eyeliner. I just bought this last month and am STUNNED at how great it is. So easy to use and almost like liquid liner, but not. Makeup by Mario Moistureglow Lip. Obsessed with this. It is SO moisturizing and love the colors. Like a balm with a lot of color! Sephora Pro Foundation Brush. This is the brush that I use for my westman atelier products. I love how it blends! It’s super soft and I find it to be a great brush for the price. One/Size Setting Spray. Best setting spray ever. Nothing moves! HAIR Dyson Hair Dryer. Eddie got this for me for Christmas last year. It is life changing. I would only ever buy it if it is on sale, and if you have a lot of hair. It adds so mcu volume and body! Dyson Air Wrap. Another thing I didn’t think I’d ever buy, but last year I did. It is AMAZING! This can definitely be a one stop shop for your hair. If I could only take one hair tool with me to a deserted island, it would be this. It’s so pricey and rarely ever on sale! Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Shampoo. Favorite shampoo ever! Get the value size if you can. Bumble and Bumble Invisible Oil Conditioner. Same as the above. The scent is so good too. Moroccan Oil Root Boost. I love this for some volume when styling. I use on wet hair before drying. Living Proof  Restore Perfecting Spray. My favorite leave in condition. Doesn’t weigh down my hair at all. Oribe Dry Texturizing Spray. This is my favorite spray to use on dry hair. Adds texture and volume but isn’t sticky. Sol de Janiero Leave In Conditioner. Again, the best scent. T3 Whirl Trio. I bought this at a VIB sale a few years ago and still use it weekly. It is an amazing high-quality set that took me a long time to buy (so pricey!) but I use it SO much. And I love that it comes with three sizes of the wand. FRAGRANCE I am a warm fragrance person. I love all things vanilla, amber, mush, a very very light hint of floral – those are the scents I gravitate towards. These are a few of my all-time faves that I highly recommenced. Fragrance never goes on sale so this is the perfect time to try. I also always try travel sizes first when possible before buying a big bottle. Jo Malone Ginger Biscuit. This is limited edition and only comes out every few years. It’s SO GOOD. Smells for warm and fabulous for fall! Afternoon Delight. This has been my go-to scent for the last for months. It smells absolutely incredible. Glossier You. This has been one of my favorites for YEARS. It’s delicious. Carolina Herrara Good Girl. As a note, I hate this bottle. It kept me from buying it for years. But this is basically the best scent ever. Tom Ford Soleil Blanc. My go to summer scent. A light coconutty but warm fragrance. Tom Ford Lost Cherry Warm and delicious with a hint of red cherry. It’s so good. Kilian Paris Love Don’t Be Shy. This is kind of marshmallowy and sweet but also light with light floral. It’s delicious. Jo Malone Mimosa and Cardamom. A longtime favorite of mine. Warm and floraly.
