She’s one of a few chefs interpreting Black cooking with a measured specificity, making well-researched dishes that are rooted in tradition but also immediate, infused with ingredients from other cultures or countries.At Good Hot Fish, her casual 18-seat restaurant in Asheville, N.C. which reopened last month after Hurricane Helene tore through the western part of the state, she takes Southern dishes and inflects them with Appalachian notes. In her hands, sweet potatoes become crispy pancakes with cabbage, Sea Island red peas are stewed until tender and local catfish gets breaded and fried in benne seed flour, then served on squishy white bread.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
