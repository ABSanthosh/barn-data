All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: BLGKV/ShutterstockIf you own an LG-branded oven, then you need to listen up. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has recently announced that these stoves may present a significant safety risk.Here’s what we know: On February 6, 2024, LG Electronics recalled almost 500,000 Slide-In and Freestanding Electric Ranges due to fire hazard concerns. According to a statement from the CPSC, the front-mounted knobs on these ranges can be easily turned on by accidental contact from people or pets, creating a fire hazard.The recalled ovens were sold at Best Buy, Costco, Home Depot, Lowe’s, and other major retailers across the U.S. and online at LG.com. Depending on the model, these ranges were sold from 2015 to January 2025, with prices ranging from $1,400 to $2,650. For a complete list of the recalled ovens, check out this statement.So far, the CPSC has received at least 86 reports of the front-mounted knobs being accidentally turned on. On top of that, these LG electric ranges have been linked to over 28 fires, five of which caused property damage totaling more than $340,000. It doesn’t stop there — there have also been at least eight minor injuries, including burns, and three pet deaths caused by these stoves.In response, LG announced it won’t offer refunds or exchanges. Instead, the company is providing stickers with a reminder to press the lock button when the oven isn’t in use to prevent people from accidentally turning the stove on. The brand also dropped an instruction video, too. Fans weren’t happy with LG’s response. In a CNN article covering the story, people quickly took to the comments section to share their opinions. One person wrote, “LG leaves a lot to be desired in customer service.” Another commenter shared their own experience, saying, “Our LG stove started a house fire just last week! We think our younger son accidentally bumped one of the front knobs, turning it on. It was on for about two hours while we were gone, and my daughter came home to the alarms going off.”While you might not be able to get your money back for the recalled LG ranges, the CPSC recommends keeping children and pets away from the knobs and clearing any objects near them to avoid accidentally turning the stove on. If you have any questions about the recall, you can reach LG’s customer service at 800-399-3265, Monday through Friday, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. ET.",
