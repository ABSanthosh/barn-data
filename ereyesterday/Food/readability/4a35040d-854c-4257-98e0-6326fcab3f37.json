All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Mara WeinraubThe Costco bakery may be located way in the back of the warehouse (no doubt, to encourage shoppers to walk the entire length of the store), but it’s typically the first section I visit. It’s where so many of the best Costco desserts can be found — including my new favorite: Kirkland Signature Tiramisu Cheesecake. I initially learned about this dessert after costcohotfinds, an Instagram Costco fan account, posted about it over a week ago. It quickly captured the social media hearts of nearly 120,000 people, me being one of them. TikTok’s The Sushi Guy, a self-described “Costco Fanboy”, was another (he rated it a 9.7/10 and called it “the second best dessert” at Costco — ever).The next thing I knew, I found myself driving to not one but two different Costco locations (the first one was completely sold out!) to find this delicious-sounding and gorgeous-looking dessert. I wanted to taste it for myself and report back, of course.What You Should Know About Kirkland Signature Tiramisu CheesecakeLike so many Costco pies, this tiramisu cheesecake weighs in at 4-and-a-half pounds. Just how big is that? Well, it’s enough to make my arms feel tired while standing in the self-checkout line. It was all so worth it!The bakery newcomer is a riff on the beloved Italian dessert combined with cheesecake. Unlike a classic tiramisu, there’s not a drop of rum (or a layer of lady fingers) in this cheesecake. Though it does contain mascarpone and coffee, like another iconic mashup: tiramisu brownies.It’s $23.99, which is more expensive than most other desserts I’ve at the warehouse — and yes, that includes the “dangerously delicious” peanut butter chocolate pie. It could easily serve at least 12 people (more on that below). That breaks down to a little less than $2 per slice. I’d have a hard time finding a plain slice of cheesecake for that price where I live, let alone a fancied-up one.My Honest Review of Kirkland Signature Tiramisu CheesecakeThe first two ingredients are cream cheese and mascarpone cream, so I knew right away this cheesecake was going to be rich — and from top to bottom, this is an all-star mashup. The whipped topping (think: Cool Whip) is light and airy, almost cloudlike with a hint of sweetness and coffee, thanks to the dusting of powder on top. There is plenty of cold brew coffee flavor folded into the cheesecake filling, which is extra velvety and creamy, thanks to the mascarpone, and ever so slightly tangy. If the warehouse sold this on its own in a container (à la Magnolia’s banana pudding), I’d gladly purchase and snack on it by the spoonful throughout the week.Then, there’s the all-important base. Unless I’m eating a Basque cheesecake, I want a generous layer of buttery graham cracker crust to balance out the filling. This crust is well over a quarter-inch thick (yes, I measured) and has a bit of mocha-meets-burnt-caramel flavor to it. I’m a fan.I cut myself a decent-size slice, roughly one-twelth of the cake, and kept going back to it throughout the evening. I finally tapped out with two or three bites remaining, which is very unlike me. But it did get me thinking: It’d make a great stand-in for a Costco birthday cake — especially for my dad, who loves tiramisu and cheesecake, and was born in March.Find it in stores: Kirkland Signature Tiramisu Cheesecake, $23.99 for 4.5 pounds at CostcoSpot any new Costco bakery items lately?
