As of March 19, we’ve entered one of the superior seasons for fresh flavors, vibrant cocktails, and lazy afternoons with a spritz in hand. Maybe it’s the seasonal fruit, maybe it’s the sunshine, but suddenly, Prosecco tastes bubblier, white wine is crisper, and the garnish possibilities are endless. To celebrate, we’ve rounded up some of the best spring cocktails and mocktails—each one easy, delicious, and perfect for making the most of peak-season ingredients. Grab a glass, toast to sunnier days, and let’s get shaking. 1. Spring Bloom Cocktail A floral, refreshing take on a vodka lemonade. Homemade honey syrup and lavender sea salt make this feel like a bouquet in a glass. 2. Lemon Meringue Martini This frothy, lemony cocktail from Julianna McIntosh is a showstopper. Don’t skip the brûléed lemon garnish and egg white foam. 3. Garden Mule Cocktail A Moscow Mule, but with blueberries, cucumber, and mint for a refreshingly fruity twist. 4. Bees Knees One of my personal favorites because it’s only a few ingredients that you probably already have. This Prohibition-era cocktail shines with fresh lemon juice and honey syrup. Add lavender syrup for extra floral notes. 5. Suze Tonic A bright and slightly bitter tonic featuring the French aperitif Suze. The pale yellow hue is perfect for Easter brunch. 6. Blueberry Orange Spritz Cointreau, freshly squeezed lemon juice, and muddled blueberries make this a fruit-forward favorite. 7. Bourbon Strawberry Spritz Strawberry season is here—celebrate with this spritz featuring Aperol, sparkling wine, and strawberry purée. 8. Lavender Lemonade \u0026 Gin A simple yet stunning cocktail that’s easy to batch for a crowd. Lavender, lemon, and gin never miss. 9. Batched Rosé Lemonade Freeze homemade lemonade into ice cubes, then top with rosé for a low-lift, high-reward cocktail. 10. Gin \u0026 Earl Grey Tea Tonic Tea-infused syrups are having a moment. This floral and lightly bitter tonic pairs perfectly with gin, but is also a great addition to any mocktails or tea latte. 11. Negroni Sbagliato An effervescent take on the classic Negroni, swapping gin for Prosecco. Sweet, bitter, and oh-so-springy. 12. Violet Crush Any Aviation fan knows the power and beauty of creme de violette. It’s floral, fragrant, and pairs great with chilled white wine or Prosecco (plus it’s a pretty spring color). 13. Rhubarb Cosmo Rhubarb season is here—ditch the pie and use fresh rhubarb juice in your next Cosmopolitan. 14. Smoky \u0026 Spicy Paloma Grapefruit season is wrapping up, so use it in this smoky-spicy Paloma with tequila, mezcal, and fresh citrus juice. 15. Jungle Bird A tiki favorite with pineapple and lime juice, balanced with bitter Campari. No beach required as we’ve been sipping on this in the Test Kitchen for a bit. 16. French 77 You’ve probably heard of the French 75, but did you know there’s several numbered variations? A French 77 is essentially the same but swaps elderflower liqueur for the usual sugar syrup. Springtime in a glass. 1. Vanilla Thyme Lemonade A subtly herbal, naturally sweet lemonade that’s easy to make and even easier to sip. 2. The Orchard Mocktail Blueberry juice, basil, and apple cider combine for a refreshing, not-too-sweet sipper. 3. Orange Ginger Mint Soda Bright and bubbly with fresh ginger and mint. Add your spirit of choice, or enjoy as is. 4. Thyme Tea Soda This herbal soda can be made boozy with a splash of bourbon—or enjoyed as a refreshing iced tea alternative. 5. Lavender Iced Lattes A floral coffee drink that pairs beautifully with Irish cream (or stands strong on its own). It has a recipe for a homemade lavender syrup that you can use for all your spring beverage needs.",
