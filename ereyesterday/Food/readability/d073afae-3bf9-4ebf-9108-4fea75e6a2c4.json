All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Home offices are a draw for buyers. In fact, according to a 2024 edition of What Home Buyers Really Want from the National Association of Home Builders, about two-thirds of buyers are looking for a home with at least one dedicated work space. Real estate agents had to adjust their searches, as buyers shifted from wanting to incorporate a home office space in the corner of their kitchen to a whole separate and dedicated space.But the tide is shifting. More people are back in the office or on a hybrid schedule where they split their time between the office and their home setup, and their at-home desks are starting to collect dust. And, just as WFH turned the real estate market on its head, so is the return to office. We asked three separate real estate agents across the county for their thoughts on the biggest home layout trend buyers and sellers can anticipate in 2025, and they all agreed — it’s the evolution of the home office into a more flexible space. People aren’t getting rid of the dedicated office entirely (maybe they’re hoping their bosses will change their minds!), but they also realize they don’t need an entire room for a multi-screen setup that gets used once a week.Here’s exactly what they had to say on what they’re seeing with buyers.Buyers will want office spaces with more flexibility.Rachel Swann, a sales associate at Coldwell Banker Realty, has watched home offices change the landscape throughout the pandemic and the past few years. “Many have asked me, isn’t everyone back at work? Well, yes and no. It’s a mixture of both,” says Swann.She explains that some reports indicate just over one in five Americans will still work remotely in 2025, and that will continue to impact the real estate market. But for the others? They’ll want spaces with more flexibility. “I know we will see (and already are seeing) more spaces used in the flexible, multi-use way,” says Swann. “We are seeing many companies go back to requiring two to three days a week in the office. This leaves half the week where people still need office space.”She compares the evolving home office to the question of guest rooms. Many people only use their guest room a few times a year, but there’s often another use that a homeowner might need multiple times a week. Home offices are facing the same question: How much does it need to be used to merit having a dedicated space?Alexandra Gupta, a real estate broker with The Corcoran Group in New York, notes that remote work is continuing to have an influence on home design and home layouts, but she agrees that homeowners are more drawn towards flexible spaces today. “They’re looking for rooms that can serve various purposes throughout the day. The traditional home office is being incorporated into living rooms, bedrooms, or even closets that double as workspaces,” says Gupta.But buyers still want functional office space.While the home office doesn’t need to be a large or fixed space moving forward, people still like privacy — don’t expect buyers to settle for their work computer being in the living room, right next to the TV. While her buyers continue to look for open-concept floor plans, they want to see flexible spaces that will evolve with their lifestyle. “Home office spaces remain in demand, particularly with features that support privacy and productivity,” says Nicole Plaxen, a real estate agent with Walters/Plaxen Estates at the Beverly Hills Estates in West Hollywood, California.“We’re seeing a nuanced shift in home layouts that blend open spaces with intentional, multifunctional rooms,” says Plaxen.If you talk to those designing the houses, not just those selling them, the sentiment remains the same. Alan Berman, founder and principal of Archetype Architecture, explains, “People are definitely still craving home studies, but I also see a shift toward creating more intentional spaces that blend functionality with comfort.“It’s less about having a single, separate room now, and more about creating hybrid spaces that can adapt. People want work areas that flow naturally into their living spaces, whether that means a nook in a larger room or something tucked away but with open sight lines to the rest of the home,” says Berman.This post originally ran on Apartment Therapy. See it there: The 2020s Home Trend That’s Already Starting to Disappear, According to Real Estate Pros",
