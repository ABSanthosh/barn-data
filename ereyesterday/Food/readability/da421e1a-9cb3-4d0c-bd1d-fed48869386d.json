Photography/ShutterstockWhile you may be used to hitting up Dollar Tree for household staples like paper towels, dish soap, or snacks, you’re missing out if you’ve never perused through the store’s kitchen and dining aisle. Recently, the discount retailer filled its shelves with the most stunning mugs as part of its holiday collection. Right now, they have the most darling snowflake mugs (though you may need to meticulously search through the aisles to spot them). The 14-ounce stoneware cups are white and decorated with silver snowflakes, and they sell for $1.25 each. However, if you want to order the mug online, Amazon has a similar item.In 2022, one shopper went out of their way to detail their experience hunting down the find, captioning their video alerting people that “snowflake dishes are back at Dollar Tree.” To which their followers commented, “So cute,” and “Love it! I hope I find it.”This snowflake trend is ideal for people who celebrate Christmas and want to veer off the traditional red and green decor path. Thankfully, with Dollar Tree’s budget-friendly prices, you can achieve this festive look without breaking the bank. If you frequently host holiday gatherings, you may want to consider investing in the entire snowflake dinnerware set to reduce waste from disposable paper plates and cups.",
