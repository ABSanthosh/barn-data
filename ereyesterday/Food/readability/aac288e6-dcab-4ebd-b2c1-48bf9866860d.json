(He lived at the time on East 87th Street.)Was that fair? No neighborhood is a monolith. But this one has long been equated with its most privileged residents — not the flaunt-it rich but the even richer, who have no need to. Like many affluent enclaves, it’s not particularly hospitable to exciting restaurants. Much of the housing stock is too pricey, the clientele too assured of its own tastes (and perhaps reluctant to invite in the hordes).ImageChez Fifi’s darkly romantic dining room is intimate, with only 12 tables.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesImageA roast half-chicken comes brushed in duck fat, with knobs of foie gras.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesImageThe salon upstairs, with its moulded ceiling and collection of paintings, evokes an elegant Upper East Side living room.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesYet somehow Chez Fifi, a low-lit hideaway at the bottom of an Italianate rowhouse in the placid 70s, has managed to distract New Yorkers from downtown haunts and become one of the most lusted-after reservations. It’s part of a new coterie of intimate, Parisian-styled bistros — like Le Chêne and Zimmi’s in the West Village and Le Veau d’Or on the Upper East Side’s southern edge — that seem to have bewitched the city.Months after Chez Fifi opened last December, the calendar of availability was still grayed out, save for the stray 10:45 p.m. slot. When I finally secured a table at a less European hour, I was dubious. I do not like being a victim of mimetic desire, wanting what everyone wants.VideoCreditCredit...Video by Yuvraj Khanna For The New York TimesThe restaurant’s exterior might be read as demure or aloof. Gauzy shades fill the windows so no one can peek in. But once ushered into the dining room — mahogany panels, pleated sconces, little pillows and just 12 tables (thus the dearth of reservations) — I was greeted like a regular. It turns out that Chez Fifi, while a certifiable hot spot, aspires to be something both less and more — that is, a neighborhood restaurant.In keeping with that mission, the best bites are the simplest. To start: a hunk of baguette from the East Village bakery Le Fournil, served warm enough that you can smell it, and crisp radishes and butter — albeit the Birkin of butters, from the French cheesemonger Rodolphe le Meunier, churned, hand-molded and popcorny in flavor, with a kind of inner humidity. To finish: a broodily dark chocolate mousse, or crème brûlée in a dish so shallow, it’s almost more crackle than custard.VideoCreditCredit...Video by Yuvraj KhannaZack Zeidman, the chef, oversaw the kitchen at Altro Paradiso in SoHo, the breezy Italian cousin to Estela. His focus here is excellent ingredients in the right ratios, as with a model salad of endive, blue cheese, walnuts and apples, to which he adds dates, caramelly and verging on fudge. There’s always an omelet of the day, maybe embedded with Royal Red shrimp, tossed in just as the eggs tremble into place, so they stay raw and crunchy at the center.That omelet was perfect the first time I had it, then overgilded the next, with uni from Hokkaido that would have been a joy on its own but leaked into the eggs, leaving them soppy.This proved to be something of a theme — unnecessary luxuries foisted on otherwise agreeable dishes, like caviar over already superlative bluefin tuna, the flesh close to melting and barely dressed with sea salt, citron oil and a few drops of delicate, salty-sweet white soy sauce. Truffles were scattered to little effect across creamy rice studded with morels. A juicy roast half-chicken, brushed in duck fat, came ornamented with perplexingly bland knobs of foie gras, whose presence was the only explanation for the $78 price.ImageThe menu highlights French bistro classics like steak frites.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesImageBluefin tuna is dressed with sea salt, citron oil and white soy sauce, and topped with caviar.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesImageThe omelet of the day might showcase Royal Red shrimp and uni from Hokkaido.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesThe brothers David and Joshua Foulquier also run nearby Sushi Noz (where the omakase is $550). They opened Chez Fifi as a tribute to their mother, Firouzeh Foulquier, known as Fifi, who died in 2018. Her family had fled Iran during the political unrest of the 1970s, and she later forged a life on Park Avenue, three blocks from here. The “Bistrot de Fifi” sign in the dining room hung in her kitchen. The candleholders were hers, too, along with the buoyant soundtrack (Dean Martin, jazz manouche), from CDs she kept under her bed.The Foulquiers told me that the roast chicken tastes like her recipe, although she skipped the foie gras. (Wise woman.) Likewise the pommes Fifi, the potatoes blanched, then bronzed in clarified butter, fluffy under a seal of crisp. Eat them happily, in her honor.For the steak frites, Mr. Zeidman uses filet mignon, which won’t fight you, unlike the slightly mutinous (and thrillingly robust) hanger steak at Le Veau d’Or. The au poivre sauce makes it worthwhile, swoony with flamed Cognac and heavy cream, and just enough sting from Dijon mustard. But be wary of the wild Dover sole, which one night was all salt — disheartening, especially since this “petit” fish cost $105. Another evening, a bigger sole was listed at $148.If Chez Fifi means to be a neighborhood restaurant, who are the neighbors? Sometimes the tables were filled with quiet older guests whose only glint of wealth might be a Patek Philippe half-hidden under a worn cuff. Other nights it was young couples in loosened collars and minidresses, delighting in their status as main characters.ImageChez Fifi is a hot spot that also aspires to be a neighborhood restaurant: a tricky balancing act.Credit...Yuvraj Khanna for The New York TimesThe service is often sweet and personal, with the occasional comic interjection from a busser. Still, the restaurant can’t quite reconcile its competing identities as a place that welcomes or excludes. I was urged to return for dinner in the upstairs lounge, which is set aside for walk-ins. But when I did, there were “reserved” signs on every table, and my friend and I were told we could only drink at the bar.In the end, mercy was extended and seats were offered, on the condition that we order just appetizers and slink off in an hour. Slowly the warmth returned. The servers laughed as they tried to fit plates on our tiny table. I kept checking the time, devouring frites by the handful, until one of them leaned in.“I don’t care about getting the table back,” she said. “Take as long as you want.”Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

They opened Chez Fifi as a tribute to their mother, Firouzeh Foulquier, known as Fifi, who died in 2018. Her family had fled Iran during the political unrest of the 1970s, and she later forged a life on Park Avenue, three blocks from here. The “Bistrot de Fifi” sign in the dining room hung in her kitchen. The candleholders were hers, too, along with the buoyant soundtrack (Dean Martin, \u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/07/fashion/creating-guitars-for-gypsy-jazz.html\" title=\"\"\u003ejazz manouche\u003c/a\u003e), from CDs she kept under her bed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Foulquiers told me that the roast chicken tastes like her recipe, although she skipped the foie gras.

The au poivre sauce makes it worthwhile, swoony with flamed Cognac and heavy cream, and just enough sting from Dijon mustard. But be wary of the wild Dover sole, which one night was all salt — disheartening, especially since this “petit” fish cost $105. Another evening, a bigger sole was listed at $148.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf Chez Fifi means to be a neighborhood restaurant, who are the neighbors?
