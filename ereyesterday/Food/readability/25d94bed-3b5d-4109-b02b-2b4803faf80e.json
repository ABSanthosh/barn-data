All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Kitchens are notoriously expensive to get professionally remodeled. In fact, a recent Houzz study notes that the median cost of a kitchen remodel in 2023 was $55,000. Yikes! That’s why I love getting to see budget makeovers of kitchens among our Before \u0026 Afters. With a little ingenuity, many homeowners can create a kitchen they love for under $1,000. And sometimes, they can even do it for less than $500!One of my favorite budget kitchen transformations we’ve ever featured shows just how much you can change with some strategic DIYs like paint and hardware. In the beginning, this kitchen was a very recognizable 1960s style outfitted with brown cabinets and beige accents. Many people might have been tempted to scrap it all and start fresh, but a $400 DIY makeover gave it a totally new life.The biggest change: the fresh paint job! White on the upper cabinets and the ceiling makes the whole space feel so much bigger, while green paint on the base cabinets brings some personality. I love how the green color makes another appearance on the ceiling fan, too, which helps it feel like part of the room instead of an afterthought. (The new location, farther from the cabinets, helps with that too.)",
