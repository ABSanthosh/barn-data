Credit...Karsten Moran for The New York TimesKim SeversonKim Severson sifted through dozens of trend predictions from food companies, public-relations firms and restaurant groups, and interviewed market researchers, data analysts and chefs.Dec. 31, 2024Updated 10:03 a.m. ETIf you want to understand what’s going to be big in food next year, ignore the fridgescaping and hot-honey espresso martinis. Instead, peer into the nation’s psyche.When Americans were scared and isolated during the Covid shutdown, they ate comfort food with abandon. This year, weary and worried after a stretch of inflation and political uncertainty, they craved edible escapes they could afford. Little luxuries like the crunchy pistachio-cream Dubai chocolate bar and caviar bumps were big.With a president-elect intent on turning institutions inside out, rampant hyper-individualism and an adventurous, skeptical Generation Z wielding outsize influence, 2025 will be all about breaking rules and ignoring tradition. At least, that’s what the market researchers, food sociologists and other prognosticators are saying.“It’s a take-chances time right now,” said Andrew Freeman, president of AF \u0026 Co., the San Francisco consulting firm that for 17 years has published the popular Hospitality Trends Report with the brand marketing firm Carbonate. “Think of what we’ve just gone through. The whole world shifted. And if the whole world is going to break rules, why not do it with what we eat and drink?”Rebellious consumers are pushing limits with unconventional choices, said Melanie Bartelme, a global food analyst and trend spotter for Mintel. They eat snacks when they should be eating meals. They embrace weird combinations like bao stuffed with Nashville hot chicken, and offbeat brand collaborations like Kate Spade teaming up with Heinz ketchup. Healthy food made from scratch is in, but so is a night out at Chili’s.Here are some of the predictions most likely to influence how we’ll eat in the coming year. And if the forecasters are wrong, who cares? In 2025, anything goes.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
