You can find all my picks for the sale here (everything is something we have or I bought during this sale!) and see a few up above. But I wanted to mention my top 10 (well, 12, because I can’t help myself) – the things that I think are stand outs and what I use daily or weekly! Amazon spring sale favorites + the best of the best. Here are my top 12 spring sale picks! Hulken bag! This might be the first time it’s on amazon! I use this more than ANY bag. It’s incredible for using for trips, groceries, school stuff, work. etc. I can’t live without them. Zero gravity chairs. I bought these last summer and we LOVE them. They are incredibly comfortable, super light and easy to move around and we all love them. 63K reviews don’t lie. Tineco vacuum map. How can I profess my love for this? Sometimes I use this EVERY SINGLE DAY – every day of the week! It is the best. It cleans my floors like nothing else. Oura ring. I am IN LOVE with my oura ring. The data it provides for sleep, stress, recovery, etc is incredible. Yes it tracks activity/steps and all that, but it’s all the other data that blows my mind. I wish I would have got it sooner! Cosmetics bag. My favorite makeup bag! I’m on my second one and just love these. They open so nicely. Weighted vest. I only have a 12lb weighted vest but I love it. I actually like wearing it around my kitchen more than just walking with it! Dyson car vacuum. Hello, my entire life revolves around vacuums now. This is 40? I bought this yesterday during the sale!! Very pumped. Air doctor air purifier. I’ve had these in our home since we moved in! I knew it would help in a new build especially when there was still work being done in our basement. I am so happy with these! Lens wipes. I have a box of these at all times and I keep the packets EVERYWHERE!! Not only do I use these constantly for my own glasses and sunglasses, but even my kids use them for their sunglasses. They are excellent. Rotary grater. Anything that requires a lot of cheese? This is what you need to use. Or even for taco night. It is fabulous. Briotech spray. Look up the uses for hypochlorous acid spray and your mind will be blown. I am never without this now. Bioderma shower oil. So guess what I use this for? To remove sunscreen on myself and the kids! The fact that it has a pump is gam changing. And I use that super thick white sunscreen all over them – oil cleansers are the only thing that removes it. I love this one, it lathers up, removes everything and then I go in with regular soap! What are your top picks?! I’ve love to hear below!",
