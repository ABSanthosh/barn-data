It feels inevitable, honestly, given how I’ve been squinting at the corner of my garage, picturing a small bread oven tucked in there like it’s a wood-fired pizza fantasy. Sure, my garage currently houses, you know, a car, some tools, and maybe a rogue spider or two, but let’s focus on the dream: a pop-up weekend bakery.

It feels inevitable, honestly, given how I’ve been squinting at the corner of my garage, picturing a small bread oven tucked in there like it’s a wood-fired pizza fantasy. Sure, my garage currently houses, you know, a car, some tools, and maybe a rogue spider or two, but let’s focus on the dream: a pop-up weekend bakery. I’m not saying I’m starting a bakery tomorrow, but the dream is on simmer. Like a dough proofing in the warm Texas sun—it’s just a matter of time.In the meantime, I’ve embraced the chaos and have started collecting bakery-grade gear to casually outfit my kitchen and the sunny room just off of it. Is it excessive? Sure. Does it make me happy? Absolutely. These five items are my not-so-subtle, but very functional nod to turning my kitchen into a bakery, and I’m officially blaming my pink bakery boxes for the fact that my neighbors now casually ask, “When’s the next bake sale?”1. A 10-Tier Sheet Pan Rack (aka Speed Rack)This one is both a space-saver and an ego boost. Nothing makes you feel more like a pro baker than sliding a tray of warm chocolate cake onto one of ten glorious tiers, all while pretending you’re on the Great British Bake Off. Sure, it’s technically meant for bakeries that pump out hundreds of pastries a day, but it works equally well for holding everything from cookies to cooling cake layers—or, let’s be real, my collection of half-filled water glasses. AND – it keeps everything out of my cat Tron’s reach, amen.2. Bus Tubs (a.k.a. Wash Basins)I know, I know—bus tubs are about as glamorous as the back of a restaurant kitchen, but hear me out. These big plastic bins are essential. One tub is for dirty dishes (it makes cleanup feel like a fun stacking challenge), and the other is for prepping dough or tossing trash and flour-covered utensils in mid-bake. They’re sturdy, they’re unassuming, and they basically let me pretend I’m running a bakery with an actual staff instead of just me, frantically trying not to over proof my bread while also walking the dog.3. Baker’s Math Kitchen ScaleForget measuring cups; this kitchen scale is the boss of all things dough-related. It’s not just about precision; it’s about feeling like a scientist in the middle of a butter-and-sugar experiment. I weigh everything now—flour, water, even chocolate chips—because if I’m going to turn out bakery-level treats, I need to channel bakery-level math and this is the exact scale I used in professional kitchens.4. Restaurant-Quality Butcher Block Work TableThis table is where all the magic happens. It’s enormous, it’s sturdy, and it’s the kind of surface that can handle everything from kneading sticky dough to rolling out sugar cookies for holiday tins. Honestly, I think this table has more work ethic than I do—it just sits there, ready for action, while I’m over here debating whether to eat a cookie or make one.  And the grand plan is to hold baking classes around the giant work table come springtime!5. Pink Bakery Boxes and TwineBecause let’s be real, presentation is half the fun. These boxes are unapologetically cute, and the twine adds that perfect little I totally planned this touch. Whether I’m packing up leftover pie slices for neighbors or sending a stack of cookies to a friend, these boxes scream “bakery chic.”So there you have it—five things that have me well on my way to turning my Bellville kitchen into a full-fledged bakery. It’s a little over the top, sure, but so is life in this big ol’ Victorian house. And if you’re wondering whether I’ll add a sixth item to this list, the answer is yes: a bread oven for my garage. Let’s dream big, friends.",
