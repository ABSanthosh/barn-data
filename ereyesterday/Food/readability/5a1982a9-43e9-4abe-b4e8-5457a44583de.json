  "description": "Brazilian Cheese Bread (PÃ£o de Queijo) is a dream come true for anyone who is gluten-free. I first had them earlier this year at a party and found out they were from Trader Joeâ€™sâ€¦which led me to search out the recipe, buy tapioca flour, and never make them because life got in the way. Tale as old as time! Last Friday night we were going through the freezer, seeing if we could make some franken-meal with whatever was leftover. Into the air fryer went a bunch of random things including three little rolls of Brazilian Cheese Bread. Three little rolls between the two of us werenâ€™t enough so I looked up the ingredients, found out I had them all and 10 minutes later, we had some in the oven. I live for that kind of thrill.Â  How do we describe the texture? They are light and fluffy like a popover but kinda chewy like if grilled cheese and mochi had a baby. These are definitely worth keeping a supply of tapioca flour in your pantry.Â  (I get mine at our local Asian grocery store) Casey proceeded to take these little breads a step further and gave them a garlic knot treatment. Brazilian cheese bread tossed in butter, garlic, and parsley? I dare you to not eat the whole batch They will make you believe in holiday magic again.Â  Ingredients involved! I blended the mixture in our NutribulletÂ  Prepare mini muffin tins with cooking spray.Â  Pour the batter in. Top with extra Parmesan.Â  Set them on a baking sheet and pop them in the oven.Â  TADA.
