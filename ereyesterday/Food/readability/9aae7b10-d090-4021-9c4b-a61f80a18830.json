Just a few years ago, we were lucky to get a few books during the holiday season. But now, there are so many that I never know where to start! I really loved the christmas-y books I read this month and they were perfect for staying in the holiday mood. I even had enough to make an entire holiday reading list! If you read any excellent holiday books, let me know. I do have a book of the month membership – I love it so much. That’s where I got a few books from this month. I get so many of my new releases and debut author books there. You can sign up for one here. Most of these books are linked through bookshop (if available!) and I highly suggest shopping through there because it will support your local indie bookstore. You can choose the local bookstore to support! I support Penguin Books when I buy which is my fave here in Pittsburgh. Okay, keep me posted on what you’re reading below! WHAT I READ IN DECEMBER 2024 The Most Wonderful Crime of the Year – 5 stars Loved this SO much. I felt like I was in a game of Clue. It was funny, mysterious with a bit of a thriller vibe, a little romance and holiday-ish. It had some of everything. We follow two writers who are invited to a famous author’s house for christmas. When they get there, it basically turns into a murder mystery. I loved the characters so much and it was super fun and fast to read. Can easily enjoy during the winter months too! A Home for the Holidays – 5 stars This was in my book of the month box along with the above. I almost didn’t read it because it’s a bit sad and heartbreaking, but I’m so glad I did. It is SO good. This is basically about how a woman who loses her mother right before christmas deals with grief. It is so sad but also heartwarming because she meets her mom’s former best friend and learns so much about her previous life. Definitely a must read! Lovelight Farms – 4.5 stars Suuuuch a cute one! If you love a fake dating trope, this is for you. In this story we follow Stella who wants to save her christmas tree farm so she enters a contest – but lies and says she has boyfriend. She doesn’t have one, so she convinces her best friend to act as her boyfriend and we go from there. This is SO christmasy and fun – I read it in early December and it was the perfect time! The Sleight Before Christmas – 4 stars I was SO excited to see this released before christmas! I read the book prior to this a few years ago and loved it. I think you can read it as a stand alone but I would definitely read the book before it to get the full story. This is about a couple who have kids that are driving them crazy and it’s so funny and cute. I laughed out loud many times and if you have kids it is relatable. Tis the Season For Revenge – 4 stars I reeeeeally enjoyed this one! The premise is so light hearted and funny but the story is good. Abbie’s boyfriend breaks up with her on Halloween and he has pretty much treated her like garbage for their entire relationship. In order to get back at him, she decides to date his boss. But it turns into so much more. This was longer than I thought but cute and funny. Loved Damien too! Done and Dusted – 3 stars I was sucked into this after discovering it on IG. It was steamy, sort of cute, very quick and light. Our main character returns home after years away and starts having feelings for the one person she shouldn’t. The feeling is mutual. It’s definitely spicy and if you like the whole ranch/Yellowstone vibe with some romance thrown in, you will probably enjoy. Lost and Lassoed – 3 stars As soon as I finished the above, I downloaded this one on my kindle. I like when authors take the other characters in the story and write about them. You don’t need to read the above book to get this one though. In this story, we follow the best friend of the main character in Done and Dusted, as well as that character’s brother. It’s another grumpy/sunshine trope and a little bit of that forbidden romance. Cute. A Risk Worth Taking – 5 stars The cutest novella ever! I love this author’s book and I read this in about an hour the other night before bed. It’s an adorable little short story about a meet cute/one night stand that turns into so much more. I loved both main characters so so much. If you have to sit and wait at an appointment or something, this is the perfect fix for boredom!",
