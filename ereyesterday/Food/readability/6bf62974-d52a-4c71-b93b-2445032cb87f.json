And yet if there is any time of year that’s going to bring out my cravings for filling and uncomplicated soup, if there’s any time of year when my nostalgia kicks in for the thick, hearty vegetable porridges I had in Ireland with brown bread and ale, if there’s any time of year when I’d happily act and eat like a slumbering bear in a childhood fairytale, it’s January. January is biting cold and generally irredeemable unless your only commitments are to comfort and coziness. I’ll do my best to keep us covered. And this is how I make potato leek soup that’s just a tiny bit more awake and fun: I’ve found that I prefer the cream element at the end, vs. cooked into the soup, the way you would in a classically creamy soup. I like it when there’s a little swirl and contrast, where some spoonfuls have a clearer flavor and some are more luxurious. I have a strong attachment to chives. Maybe seeing flecks of green helps me dream of spring and convince myself it’s close? Regardless, to me, there’s never enough. I insist that this soup is also finished with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It lights the whole place up. Finally, I really enjoy making use of the potato peelings, vs. tossing or composting them. And “by make use of” I mean that I toss them with some olive oil and salt and bake them until they’re crisp and then scatter them over the soup right before eating it. Could you use potato chips instead? Yes you could. But then you won’t get to say things that make people groan, like “this is a nose-to-tail potato soup.” Los Angeles: I love Los Angeles; we went often when I was a kid and my grandparents lived in San Diego. I’m devastated for the number of friends but also total strangers who have lost everything in the fires. The internet is swimming with lists and GoFundMes for people in urgent need of help and it can be daunting to figure out where to jump in. I’ve found this page to be a great starting point. World Central Kitchen, one of the Smitten Kitchen’s favorite charities, is there too. Few things feel better to me than providing warm meals to people displaced from their kitchens. Video Potato Leek Soup with Crispy Skins, Sour Cream, and a Lot of Chives 2 tablespoons (30 grams) unsalted butter4 medium/large leeks2 cloves garlic, mincedKosher saltFreshly ground black pepper1 1/2 pounds (680 grams) russet potatoes4 cups (950 ml) vegetable or chicken broth1 bay leaf1 to 2 tablespoons olive oilLemon juice1/2 cup (120 grams) sour cream1 small bundle (about 1/2-ounce/15 grams) fresh chives, minced Heat oven: To 375°F. Prepare leeks: Trim off the root ends of the leeks and split each leek lengthwise. Slice white and light green parts 1/4-inch-thick. Place sliced leeks in a bowl of cold water and swish the leeks around, separating layers, and letting any sand/dirt fall to the bottom. Scoop the leeks out (leaving the grit at the bottom) and drop into a colander to shake them off. It’s fine if they’re still damp. Prepare potatoes: Peel potatoes and place potato peels in a bowl of cold water, so they don’t discolor while you make the soup. Slice potatoes 1/4-inch-thick. Make the soup: Heat a medium-sized soup pot over medium-high heat and add butter. Once melted, add drained leeks, garlic, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, and many grinds of black pepper. Cook leeks, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned, about 7 to 10 minutes. Add the broth, sliced potatoes, and bay leaf and bring to a simmer. Cover the pot and simmer over medium-low heat until the potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes. You should easily be able to break the potatoes up with a spoon. Make the crispy skins: While the soup simmers, drain potato peels and pat them dry. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Place peels on parchment and drizzle with olive oil, then sprinkle with salt. Toss to evenly coat then spread them out in a single layer. Bake peels for 10 to 15 minutes, until dry and crisp. Check in at the 10-minute mark and add more time only as needed. Once crisp, remove from the oven and set aside. Finish the soup: Once potatoes are tender, remove and discard bay leaf, and use an immersion blender or transfer the soup to an upright blender and blend to desired consistency. My family doesn’t like fully pureed soups (they’re wrong, but…) so I only half-blend mine. Taste and add more seasoning as needed; I usually need at least another teaspoon of salt and much more pepper. To serve: Ladle soup into bowls. Squeeze lemon juice over each, then dollop generously with sour cream, swirling it in. Shower each soup with chives, and sprinkle the top with some crispy skins, serving the rest on the side. Eat right away. Do ahead: I keep the toppings separate when I store the leftover soup. It keeps in the fridge for up to 5 days. Note: Let’s talk about shopping for leeks: I find that at grocery stores and markets, leeks range tremendously in size and in what percentage is usable. Illogically, I find that the very thick ones often have the smallest amount of pale green/white parts vs. the thinner ones. What does this mean for you when shopping? Don’t worry, I’ve kept this recipe flexible enough that it works with a lower or higher yield of leeks. But, if you’re shopping and all you see are thick ones with smaller usable segments, feel free to grab and use extra. Post navigation",
