All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Alex LepeThe Best Cinnamon Brands at-a-GlanceBest CinnamonRunner-UpMore Brands We LikedHow We TestedWhy You Should Trust UsIt’s considered a warm spice because it actually contains cinnamaldehyde, a chemical compound that triggers the same pathway in our nervous system that perceives physical warmth. The bulk of jarred cinnamon we buy today comes from three varieties, Ceylon (milder and sweeter) Cassia (spicier flavor), and Saigon (a mix of both) and in two forms, cinnamon sticks and ground cinnamon. The thick bark of cinnamon trees are processed to make ground cinnamon — ideal for baking and quick seasoning. Cinnamon sticks are the thinner, smaller branches, and are better suited for steeping over long periods of time (like in mulled wine!).The quality and flavor varies depending on the type of trees used, where they’re grown, and how they’re harvested and processed. We were curious to see just how much one jar really differs from another. So we spent the afternoon testing as many cinnamon brands as we could.For this test, we focused on the most popular and readily available ground cinnamon brands in grocery stores today, sourcing a variety of name- and store-brand options based on availability, popularity, and price. The cinnamons ranged in price from $2 all the way up to $12, though most were around $4 at the time of this tasting. We also requested input from our editorial team to round out the list of eight competitors.To appropriately test the cinnamon — because we aren’t trying to revive the cinnamon challenge from 2012 — we baked eight batches of snickerdoodle cookies following The Kitchn’s recipe, but omitting nutmeg to get as clear of a cinnamon flavor as possible. After a long, but delicious, hour of tasting each cinnamon, one stood out for its distinct flavor and smell. Best Ground Cinnamon: Burlap \u0026 Barrel Royal CinnamonWhen all the cookies were laid out, our first reaction was: How the heck are we going to pick a winner?! But after the tallies were counted, it quickly became clear that the Burlap \u0026 Barrel Royal Cinnamon was different (and better) than all the other ground cinnamon. One tester, who rated this cinnamon brand as his favorite, loved the “faint sweetness and warm spice” it brought to the cookie. After the test was over, he went ahead and ate the remaining pieces because, as he said, “it’s just so good.”This cinnamon is the most expensive on this list, but we think it’s well worth the splurge. “It’s so complex, and I’m getting all sorts of flavor profiles beyond just sweetness and warmth,” one tester said. Another raved, “There’s nuttiness, bitterness. It’s just really well rounded and tasty.” “It’s just so good” Deliciously complex flavor $$$, but worth the splurge Saigon cinnamon Runner-Up: Costco Kirkland Signature Organic CinnamonCostco Kirkland Signature Organic Cinnamon was also a huge hit with our testers. Ali, our associate groceries editor, rated it as her top pick and gushed over its “warm, subtle sweetness” that made the cookies “just divine.”None of our testers had any bad things to say about this cinnamon — Costco Kirkland Signature Organic Cinnamon was just that good. In fact, the tester sheets were full of oohs and ahhs. The well-rounded, warm flavors make it a resounding favorite of the group and an excellent budget buy; it’s less than $1 per ounce, which is the best deal by far, particularly for avid bakers who love measuring cinnamon with their hearts!  “Just divine” Budget buy, especially for bakers Bulk buy Saigon cinnamon Honorable Mention: Simply Organic Ceylon CinnamonIn addition to baking the ground cinnamon into snickerdoodle cookies, we also placed the open jars next to each cookie so testers could smell them directly — and give it a small taste, if they’d like. Out of all of the dried ground cinnamon, Simply Organic Ceylon Cinnamon had the strongest sweet-cinnamony smell and flavor. While others had subtle peppery notes, this cinnamon was just “sweetness through and through,” said one enthusiastic tester. Another tester even asked if it was cinnamon-sugar and not just cinnamon! Funnily enough that praise was the very same reason it didn’t earn a higher spot on this list. Tasters felt the cinnamon flavor was a bit too mild, and some of the others were more well-rounded.  Sweetest of the bunch Strong smell To some, a bit too mild Ceylon cinnamon Honorable Mention: McCormick Ground CinnamonMcCormick Ground Cinnamon may not have just missed the podium, but between its “robust cinnamon flavor,” “delicate sweetness” (both according to Ali), and wallet-friendly price tag ($2.77 for over 2 ounces!), it certainly deserves a shout-out. In fact, one of the other testers picked up on light, “peppery notes” and mentioned that it would “go great in a curry.” Budget buy! “Robust cinnamon flavor” Great for savory cooking To some, a bit too mild Unclear what variety of cinnamon Honorable Mention: Frontier Co-Op Ground Ceylon CinnamonCeylon cinnamon is typically associated with baking and sweeter applications, and we absolutely got sweetness from the Frontier Co-Op Ground Ceylon Cinnamon. One tester appreciated the cookie’s “very sweet, cinnamony taste that stayed with you.” In other words: it’s really great. So how come it didn’t earn a higher spot? Like other honorable mentions, this cinnamon didn’t have enough of that iconic “warm cinnamon flavor” to place higher. It still got a ton of positive buzz (and made for a tasty cookie!) and is one of our favorites from the test. Very sweet Made a great cookie To some, not enough warm notes  Ceylon cinnamon How We Tested Ground Cinnamon BrandsAhead of the taste test, Ali made eight batches of The Kitchn’s snickerdoodle cookies, but omitted nutmeg to get as clear of a cinnamon flavor as possible, with each one with a different brand. Then, each brand was assigned a letter — from A through H — to conceal the brands’ identities. Ground cinnamon was also laid out for testers to smell and taste, if they’d like.Ali gathered four of her friends to sample each cookie in random order (to avoid giving any particular extract an advantage) before independently writing down their thoughts. We also had water on hand for palate cleansing.Tasters rated each cinnamon on a scale of 1 to 5 (1 = No, thanks; 2 = Meh; 3 = Pretty good; 4 = Really like; 5 = Yes, Please!) across four criteria — look, smell, texture, and flavor — and included any specific observations, tasting notes, and general opinions worth mentioning. They were also asked to answer, arguably, the most important question of all: Would you buy this cinnamon?Why You Should Trust UsTo decide which cinnamon brands are worth buying, we recruited five friends to evaluate eight different cinnamon brands on texture, look, smell, desire to repurchase, and of course, flavor. Tasters were unaware of the brands involved and sampled each one randomly. Each taster independently filled out a score sheet, scoring and ranking each creamer without larger discussion or influence from the group throughout the entirety of the test. It was only after all evaluations were completed that we tallied the scores to determine the winners.Did your favorite cinnamon make the list?
