All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Raise your hand if you have a convection setting on your oven. Now, keep your hand up if you have no idea what the setting does and when or how to use it. (That’s a lot of you!). Luckily, the pros are here to help answer your biggest questions: Should you bake with the convection setting on? Are there times when it’s better than the normal setting? Are there times when you shouldn’t use the convection setting? I did a deep dive to find out what a convection oven really is, how it works, when to use it, when not to use it, and more. Here’s everything you need to know.What Is a Convection Oven? A convection oven is an oven with a fan and exhaust system that blows hot air over and around the food, helping it cook evenly and more quickly. What Is a Convection Oven, Anyway?Why You Would Want to Use the Convection SettingWhen to Use the Convection SettingHow to Use the Convection SettingWhen Not to Use the Convection SettingWhat’s the Difference Between Convection Roast and Convection Bake?What Is a Convection Oven, Anyway?Very simply put, a convection oven has a fan and exhaust system that a regular oven does not. The fan and exhaust help blow hot oven air over and around the food, then vent it back out. As a result, this hot air surrounds the food so that it cooks evenly and more quickly. (You may notice the fan going on and off while in the convection setting. This is normal! It’s just your oven trying to maintain that even temp.)Think of it like air conditioning in a car. If you set it to blow directly on the driver, the cold air stays in one place, leaving the driver nice and cool but the passengers in the back seats of the car hot. However, if you set the air conditioning to circulate throughout the entire car, all the passengers will get the same amount of cooling. The same goes for the convection oven! Rather than hot air coming from just one place or spot, the heat is better regulated throughout the entire oven.Why Should You Use the Convection Setting? It cooks faster. Because hot air is blowing directly onto food instead of just surrounding it, food cooks about 25% faster in a convection oven. It cooks more evenly. Regular ovens can have hot spots, depending on where the heating element is, but the fan in a convection oven will circulate the air to help even out the temperature variances. It’s better at browning. Air in a regular oven can become a bit humid, as moisture can’t escape. Convection ovens create a dry atmosphere that caramelizes the sugars faster when roasting, so foods like meats and vegetables get browner, but the interiors stay moist. It saves energy. Because food cooks faster in a convection oven, and generally at a lower temperature, it’s a bit more energy-efficient than a regular oven. When Should You Use the Convection Setting?Because there are so many benefits to convection, you’re probably wondering why most convection ovens still have a regular oven setting. Depending on what you’re making, there are many instances when you’ll want a fan circulating hot air around. Any time you’re roasting: Foods that are roasted, like meats and vegetables, really benefit from convection cooking. They cook faster, more evenly, and the drier environment yields crispy skin and caramelized exteriors. When baking pies and pastries: Convection heat melts fat and creates steam faster, which helps create more lift in pie doughs and pastries like croissants. When making lots of cookies: Convection allows you to bake more than one tray of cookies at a time evenly without the need to rotate them halfway through baking. Any time you’re making something that cooks covered: If you’re covering up the food with a lid, like a braise, or a foil-covered casserole dish, moisture loss is not an issue, so you might as well cook on convection since it’ll cook faster. When you’re toasting or dehydrating: When you toast or dehydrate food, the goal is to remove moisture as quickly as possible, so convection is more efficient than regular. How to Use the Convection Setting If you’ve decided to use the convection setting, here are a few things to keep in mind: Lower the temperature: Lower the recommended oven temperature by 25°F. (Some models lower the temperature by 25°F automatically, so you don’t need to!). Check your food early and often: Because food cooks more quickly on convection, check on it two-thirds or three-quarters of the way through the recommended cooking time and make any necessary adjustments. Make sure air can circulate: Convection is only effective if the air can circulate well over the food. Use trays, roasting pans, and baking pans with lower sides, and don’t cover the oven shelves with foil. When Not to Use the Convection SettingThe fan becomes a liability around delicate foods that start out as batter and set while cooking. Blowing air on these foods can create lopsided results. Don’t use convection when making the following foods: Custards and flans Souffles Cakes Quickbreads Breads (While some argue that convection creates even browning and a great crust, others say that it dries out the interior of the bread. The choice here is really up to you.) What’s the Difference Between Convection Roast and Convection Bake? On newer oven models, you may notice that your oven actually has two different convection settings: roast and bake. So, what’s the difference between the two — and does it really matter? While it may vary based on your oven model, generally the main difference is the heating element and where the heat comes from. For convection bake, similar to a normal oven setting, the heating source is mainly coming from the bottom. The fan will circulate the air around the oven, typically slower or gently, so there aren’t any hot spots and your baked goods come out even. For convection roast, the heating sources come from both the top and bottom of the oven equally, typically at hotter temperatures. The fan circulates the air around, helping to brown your food and get that crispy exterior. The bottom line is that you shouldn’t be afraid of your convection oven — instead, embrace this great feature! Play around with it and you’ll probably be amazed by the results.",
