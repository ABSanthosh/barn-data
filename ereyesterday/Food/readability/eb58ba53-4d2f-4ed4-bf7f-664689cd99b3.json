All prices were accurate at the time of publishing.Credit: Haley LyndesIf you’ve ever visited Boston, you’ve likely heard of Mike’s Pastry. It’s a staple in Boston’s North End, the Italian district filled with delicious plates of pasta and mouth-watering bakeries. This part of Boston is one of the oldest neighborhoods, home to iconic family-owned restaurants that have been around for decades. A few examples include Regina’s Pizzeria, Cafe Paradiso, and, of course, Mike’s Pastry (If you ever visit, you have to try all three — I live a stone’s throw away from them and they’re all delicious!).However, if you can’t make a visit, there is a silver lining: Mike’s Pastry is available on Goldbelly. That’s right — the Italian bakery will ship its famous cannoli straight to your doorstep to enjoy at home, so you don’t have to wait for flight tickets to try it out. Its authentic recipe is highly sought after, which often results in a line down the block! Out of curiosity, I wanted to put Mike’s pastries from Goldbelly to the test — are they as delicious as the ones sold in Boston’s North End? The answer is yes, and I might just have to order them more often to avoid the line.What Is the Mike’s Famous Cannoli Kit by Mike’s Pastry?Mike’s Famous Cannoli Kit by Mike’s Pastry lets you whip up your own cannoli right at home using all of Mike’s ingredients. The kit comes with 10 of Mike’s legendary handmade cannoli shells and ricotta cheese. You can pick between plain ricotta or chocolate ricotta upon ordering, so make sure you choose wisely! In addition to the filling, the kit also includes confectioners’ sugar to sprinkle on top, as well as pistachio nuts and chocolate chips for dipping. Mike’s prepares its shells in-house, so store them in a cool, dry place and the cream in the fridge.Putting everything together was super easy! Just cut the tip of the filling bag and stuff your pastry with Mike’s delicious ricotta. Then, dip the sides in either chocolate chips or pistachios (though I recommend both)! The kit from Goldbelly ships frozen with ice packs and stays good for up to six days after it arrives, so the sooner you dive into these tasty treats, the better. Why I Love Mike’s Famous Cannoli Kit by Mike’s Pastry While there have always been debates about which North End pastry shop is better — Mike’s or Modern Pastry — I’ve always chosen Mike’s. Its homemade shells taste so fresh, and the ingredients stuffed inside enhance the overall flavor. There’s nothing like enjoying a cannoli fresh out of the shop, so I was curious about what a shipped cannoli kit would taste like. Turns out, it’s just as good as the ones from the pastry shop — a pleasant surprise!I made the kit when I had a few friends over for dinner after work, and everyone was impressed with the results. At first, I thought filling each cannoli with ricotta would be difficult and tedious, but to my surprise, it was quite fun and made for a unique experience. It wasn’t hard at all, and there was so much ricotta that we could stuff each cannoli to our liking! I enjoyed mixing and matching mine with chocolate chips and pistachios — and I loved that I could go in for an extra dip of toppings as needed.All in all, I think this kit is great if you’re hosting a dinner or holiday party. If you’re interested in bringing a bit of Mike’s home — no matter where you are — this cannoli kit is a fantastic way to do it.Cook/ShopA weekly newsletter to keep you up to date on all the latest cooking gadgets, must-have kitchen tools, and can’t-miss sales to shop.",
