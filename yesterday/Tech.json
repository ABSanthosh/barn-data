Node.js uses CommonJS, not AMD. ECMAScript also adds formal module support, which es6-module-transpiler lets you use today. To the great surprise of nobody except John, iPhones come with earbuds, and those earbuds come with clickers. To the great surprise of nobody, including John, the Bluetooth-pairing interface in a car was terrible, and both Marco and Casey missed an obscure reference. iOS games that support physical game controllers must also work without them. If the \"iPhone 6\" comes in two sizes, which do you buy? Possibility of resolution scaling modes. Would the cameras be different? (Marco on The Talk Show, starting around 01:26:00). WWDC product-announcement predictions: New MacBook Airs or a 12\" Retina MacBook Air? (Intel's Broadwell delay) Macworld's slow SSD speeds in the new Airs may just be from different SSD manufacturers. New Apple TV hardware or software? The Apple TV 3's CPU was originally a dual-core A5 with one die disabled, but not anymore. The iPod Touch still has an A5 LOL. There may not be any new hardware announced at WWDC, just like previous WWDCs in 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2011. New sensors to be taken advantage of, like Pedometer++ did with the M7 last year. Craig Hockenberry on Apple wearables Wearables, sensors, and watches in fashion and reality. Bringing the new Mac Pro's dark-glossy-aluminum finish to more Pro hardware? Retina Thunderbolt Display? The Magic Mouse. Yes, we really talked about this. Drawing conclusions from the \"To Be Announced\" sessions in the WWDC schedule. WWDC predictions for Mac OS X 10.10: Just a visual refresh, or notable improvements to the core OS as well? Apple shuffling engineers around to work on the new hotness while neglecting its established platforms and applications. Modernization or replacement of AppKit, possibly by bringing the relevant parts of UIKit to Mac? Is there any hope for a new filesystem, possibly by evolving Core Storage? WWDC predictions for iOS 8: Better inter-app communication: A system like Contracts or Intents? Involving remote view controllers? Side-by-side iPad multitasking? Springboard enhancements? Please kill Newsstand. Please. Just make them normal app icons. Could Remote View Controllers and Background Refresh be used for widgets, live tiles, or dynamic icons? Customizable default browser, mail app, etc.? WWDC predictions for new or improved web services: Sponsored by: lynda.com: Learn at your own pace from expert-taught video tutorials. Free 7-day trial.

    "description": "Global semiconductor sales recorded a 20.6% year-on-year increase in August to $53.1 billion, according to the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA). The Register reports: The Americas led the way, with sales up 43.9 percent to $15.4 billion over last year to notch up what may be the highest on record for August, the SIA said. This comes on the back of swelling demand from sectors such as AI, cloud computing, and automotive. Over in Asia-Pacific sales grew year-on-year by 17.1 percent to $10.95 billion, according to the World Semiconductor Trade Statistics organization, which compiles these stats for the SIA. China was up 19.2 percent to $13 billion and Japan grew two percent to $4 billion. Europe was the outlier, recording a nine percent drop to $4.7 billion. No reason was given for this decline. However, on a worldwide basis, all continents returned positive month-on-month numbers in August for the first time since October 2023, indicating that the semiconductor industry is on a path to recovery.

In addition, we may test basic texting (SMS) capabilities for most cell phones on the T-Mobile network in North Carolina.\" SpaceX warned of limits since the service isn't ready for a commercial rollout. \"SpaceX's direct-to-cell constellation has not been fully deployed, so all services will be delivered on a best-effort basis,\" the company said. Starlink is being used to provide wireless emergency alerts to cell phones from all carriers in North Carolina, according to Ben Longmier, senior director of satellite engineering for SpaceX. \"We are also closely monitoring Hurricane Milton and standing by ready to take action in Florida,\" he wrote. The FCC said (PDF) the approval \"enabl[es] SpaceX to operate Supplemental Coverage from Space (SCS) in the 1910-1915 MHz and 1990-1995 MHz frequency bands leased from T-Mobile in areas affected by the Hurricane Helene.\" An FCC spokesperson told Ars that the approval is for all areas affected by Hurricane Helene, although it's only active in North Carolina so far. The FCC also said (PDF) that it is granting \"special temporary authorities to licensees and issuing rule waivers to help communications providers maintain and restore service, support emergency operations, and assist public safety, including search and rescue efforts.\" Separately, the FCC last week waived (PDF) certain Lifeline program eligibility rules to help people in disaster areas (PDF) apply for discounted phone and broadband service.

In particular, Torvalds is hoping that kernel maintainers will do a better job using an active, imperative voice when describing the changes within their pull requests. The Linux creator explained in the 6.12-rc2 announcement: \"Anyway, on a completely different note: I try to make my merge commit messages be somewhat \"cohesive\", and so I often edit the pull request language to match a more standard layout and language. It's not a big deal, and often it's literally just about whitespace so that we don't have fifteen different indentation models and bullet syntaxes. I generally do it as I read through the text anyway, so it's not like it makes extra work for me. But what *does* make extra work is when some maintainers use passive voice, and then I try to actively rewrite the explanation (or, admittedly, sometimes I just decide I don't care quite enough about trying to make the messages sound the same). So I would ask maintainers to please use active voice, and preferably just imperative. [...]\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

    "description": "Along with 343 Industries now becoming Halo Studios, future Halo games will be developed using Unreal Engine 5. The Verge's Tom Warren reports: Halo moving to Unreal Engine 5 is being positioned as the first step of a transformation for Halo Studios to change its technology, structure, processes, and even culture. \"We're not just going to try improve the efficiency of development, but change the recipe of how we make Halo games,\" says Pierre Hintze, studio head at Halo Studios. The team building Halo will move from the studio's Slipspace Engine to Unreal, after the proprietary engine it built for Halo Infinite became difficult to use and strained development. Halo Studios has had to dedicate a lot of staff to developing the Slipspace Engine, and parts of it are almost 25 years old. \"One of the primary things we're interested in is growing and expanding our world so players have more to interact with and more to experience,\" says Chris Matthews, art director at Halo Studios. \"Nanite and Lumen [Unreal's rendering and lighting technologies] offer us an opportunity to do that in a way that the industry hasn't seen before. As artists, it's incredibly exciting to do that work.\" Halo Studios isn't committing to any release dates or new Halo game announcements just yet, but the team has been building some examples of Halo running in Unreal. Dubbed Project Foundry, the work is \"neither a game nor a tech demo,\" but more of a research, development, and training tool. It's also the foundation for how the studio is changing up the way it builds Halo games. Project Foundry has been built as if it was a shipping game so that a bunch of it can appear in Halo games in the future. \"It's fair to say that our intent is that the majority of what we showcased in Foundry is expected to be in projects which we are building, or future projects,\" says Hintze. Project Foundry includes more detailed landscapes for Halo biomes, as well as foliage levels we haven't seen in Halo games in the past. Master Chief's armor has even been remodeled in this footage [...]. Halo Studios is now working on multiple Halo games, while the Slipstream Engine will continue to power Halo Infinite. \"We had a disproportionate focus on trying to create the conditions to be successful in servicing Halo Infinite,\" says Hintze. \"[But switching to Unreal] allows us to put all the focus on making multiple new experiences at the highest quality possible.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

Unprecedented tracking techniques aimed at pleasing advertisers have resulted in connected TVs (CTVs) being a \"privacy nightmare,\" according to Jeffrey Chester, report co-author and CDD executive director, resulting in calls for stronger regulation. The 48-page report, How TV Watches Us: Commercial Surveillance in the Streaming Era [PDF], cites Ars Technica, other news publications, trade publications, blog posts, and statements from big players in streaming -- from Amazon to NBCUniversal and Tubi, to LG, Samsung, and Vizio. It provides a detailed overview of the various ways that streaming services and streaming hardware target viewers in newfound ways that the CDD argues pose severe privacy risks. The nonprofit composed the report as part of efforts to encourage regulation. Today, the CDD sent letters to the FTC [PDF], Federal Communications Commission (FCC), California attorney general [PDF], and California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA) [PDF], regarding its concerns. \"Not only does CTV operate in ways that are unfair to consumers, it is also putting them and their families at risk as it gathers and uses sensitive data about health, children, race, and political interests,√¢ Chester said in a statement.

    "description": "An anonymous reader quotes a report from Reuters: The U.S. Federal Trade Commission's case accusing Amazon of stifling competition in online retail will move forward, though some of the states that sued alongside the agency had their claims dismissed, court documents showed. U.S. District Judge John Chun in Seattle unsealed his ruling from Sept. 30, which dismissed some of the claims brought by attorneys general in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Oklahoma. Last year, the FTC alleged Amazon.com, which has 1 billion items in its online superstore, was using an algorithm that pushed up prices U.S. households paid by more than $1 billion. Amazon has said in court papers it stopped using the program in 2019. The FTC has accused the online retailer of using anti-competitive tactics to maintain dominance among online superstores and marketplaces. Amazon asked Chun to dismiss the case in December, saying the FTC had raised no evidence of harm to consumers. The judge said in his ruling that he cannot consider Amazon's claims that its actions benefited competition at this early stage in the case. Read more of this story at Slashdot.",

Their groundbreaking work in the 1990s revealed a new layer of genetic control, opening fresh avenues for understanding human development and disease. Ambros first identified microRNA in 1993, while Ruvkun later found similar molecules in humans and other species. These RNA fragments, about 100 times smaller than typical messenger RNA, can silence genes and fine-tune protein production. The discovery has spurred research into potential treatments for cancer, heart disease, and neurological disorders.

    "description": "The decline of journalism has been attributed to many factors, from slow adaptation to the internet to the dominance of tech giants in advertising. But a veteran journalist offers a new perspective: the death of the hyperlink could be changing the fundamental nature of the internet, with significant implications for the news industry. Matt Pearce: There is a real bias against hyperlinking that has developed on platforms and apps over the last five years in particular. It's something that's kind of operating hand-in-hand with the rise of algorithmic recommendations. You see this on Elon Musk's version of Twitter, where posts with hyperlinks are degraded. Facebook itself has decided to detach itself from displaying a lot of links. That's why you get so much AI scum on Facebook these days. Instagram itself has always been kind of hostile to linking. TikTok as well... If you degrade hyperlinks, and you degrade this idea of the internet as something that refers you to other things, you instead have this stationary internet where a generative AI agent will hoover up and summarize all the information that's out there, and place it right in front of you so that you never have to leave the portal... That was a real epiphany to me, because the argument against one form of this legislation was, \"My God, you'll destroy this fundamental way of how the internet works.\" I'm like, dude, these companies are already destroying the fundamental way of how the internet works. [...] If you look at what technology has done to journalism over the last 10 years, it was journalists who figured out how to make Twitter work for them. It was journalists who figured out how to be really good on Instagram and Tik Tok. I know there's this argument about content creators and versus journalists, but I'm like, we're all in the same ecosystem. If you're performing the functions of a journalist, you're a journalist. Some people are really good on different platforms. But it's hard to imagine a scenario where Google is going to be the party that creates a more humane, intelligent, responsive form of journalism.

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Affiliate Marketing",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/06/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "description": "There are lots of questions floating around about how affiliate marketing works, what to do and what not to do when it comes to setting up a business. With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing1. What is affiliate marketing?¬†Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!2. What is an affiliate program?¬†An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?¬†¬†Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.¬† Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?¬†Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.¬†5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing? ¬†Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.¬†6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?¬†Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.7. Where do I find qualified publishers?¬†The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?¬†An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.¬†9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?¬†Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.10. What is a super affiliate?¬†A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.¬† Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.11. How do we track publisher sales activity?¬†Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.¬†12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?¬†Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.13. How can affiliate marketing help my business?Affiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:¬†It allows you to save time and money on marketing, which frees you up to focus on other aspects of your business.¬†You get access to friendly marketers who are eager to help you succeed.¬†It also helps you to promote your products by sharing links and banners with a new audience.¬†It offers high ROI(Return on investment) and is cost-effective.¬†14. How do I find quality publishers?¬†One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.15. How Can we Promote Affiliate Links?¬†Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:A website or blogThrough email marketing and newsletterSocial media, like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.¬†Leave a comment on blogs or forums.Write an e-book or other digital product.Youtube¬†16. Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program?¬†To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.17. What is a commission rate?¬†Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.Who manages your affiliate program?¬†Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.18. What is a cookie?¬†Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration19. How long do cookies last?¬†The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its ‚Äúcookie life.‚Äù The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you‚Äôll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.Final SayingMost new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information out there that can lead inexperienced affiliates astray. Hopefully, the answer to your question will provide clarity on how affiliate marketing works and the pitfalls you can avoid. Most importantly, keep in mind that success in affiliate marketing takes some time. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately making sales or earning money. It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.",

    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/04/what-is-blockchain-everything-you-need.html",
    "description": "If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.Imagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don‚Äôt need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That‚Äôs exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.It‚Äôs like your computer‚Äôs hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain.¬†Blockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.A few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called ‚ÄúBit Gold.‚Äù However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.So, What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.Blockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.Blockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.To understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:Blockchain collects information in ‚Äúblocks‚Äù.A block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.Blocks form chains, which are called ‚ÄúBlockchains.‚ÄùMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.Each block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.Let‚Äôs get to know more about the blockchain.How does blockchain work?Blockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.Here‚Äôs how it works:Someone or a computer will transactsThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.A network of computers can confirm the transaction.When it is confirmed a transaction is added to a blockThe blocks are linked together to create a history. if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': '8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); And that‚Äôs the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it‚Äôs done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.A new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.Once a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.How are Blockchains used?Even though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.Blockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.Although some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.Tracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been‚Äîso they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.Blockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.What is Blockchain Decentralization?Blockchain technology is safe, even if it‚Äôs public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.Have you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?Blockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.Instead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called ‚ÄúDecentralization,‚Äù meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.Blockchain guarantees your data's authenticity‚Äînot just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.Pros and Cons of BlockchainBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages.¬†ProsAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.One of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.Safe, private, and easy transactionsProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal informationConsData storage has limits.The regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.It has a risk of being used for illicit activities¬†Frequently Asked Questions About BlockchainI‚Äôll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.Is Blockchain a cryptocurrency?Blockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.Is it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?Yes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.What is the most prominent blockchain company?Coinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.Who owns Blockchain?Blockchain is a decentralized technology. It‚Äôs a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.What is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency¬†What is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?Generally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.Final SayingBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

I'll analyze each tool to see how they differ in interfaces, keyword research resources, rank tracking, and competitor analysis. User Interface Ahrefs and SEMrush both offer comprehensive information and quick metrics regarding your website's SEO performance. However, Ahrefs takes a bit more of a hands-on approach to getting your account fully set up, whereas SEMrush's simpler dashboard can give you access to the data you need quickly. In this section, we provide a brief overview of the elements found on each dashboard and highlight the ease with which you can complete tasks. AHREFS The Ahrefs dashboard is less cluttered than that of SEMrush, and its primary menu is at the very top of the page, with a search bar designed only for entering URLs. Additional features of the Ahrefs platform include: You can see analytics from the dashboard, including search engine rankings to domain ratings, referring domains, and backlinkJumping from one tool to another is easy. You can use the Keyword Explorer to find a keyword to target and then directly track your ranking with one click.The website offers a tooltip helper tool that allows you to hover your mouse over something that isn't clear and get an in-depth explanation. SEMRUSH When you log into the SEMrush Tool, you will find four main modules. These include information about your domains, organic keyword analysis, ad keyword, and site traffic.

This detail is beneficial for new marketers, who are just starting. WHO WINS? Both Ahrefs and SEMrush have user-friendly dashboards, but Ahrefs is less cluttered and easier to navigate. On the other hand, SEMrush offers dozens of extra tools, including access to customer support resources. When deciding on which dashboard to use, consider what you value in the user interface, and test out both. Rank Tracking If you're looking to track your website's search engine ranking, rank tracking features can help. You can also use them to monitor your competitors. Let's take a look at Ahrefs vs. SEMrush to see which tool does a better job. Ahrefs The Ahrefs Rank Tracker is simpler to use. Just type in the domain name and keywords you want to analyze, and it spits out a report showing you the search engine results page (SERP) ranking for each keyword you enter. Rank Tracker looks at the ranking performance of keywords and compares them with the top rankings for those keywords. Ahrefs also offers: You'll see metrics that help you understand your visibility, traffic, average position, and keyword difficulty. It gives you an idea of whether a keyword would be profitable to target or not. SEMRUSH SEMRush offers a tool called Position Tracking. This tool is a project tool‚Äîyou must set it up as a new project. Below are a few of the most popular features of the SEMrush Position Tracking tool: All subscribers are given regular data updates and mobile search rankings upon subscribing The platform provides opportunities to track several SERP features, including Local tracking. Intuitive reports allow you to track statistics for the pages on your website, as well as the keywords used in those pages. Identify pages that may be competing with each other using the Cannibalization report. WHO WINS? Ahrefs is a more user-friendly option. It takes seconds to enter a domain name and keywords. From there, you can quickly decide whether to proceed with that keyword or figure out how to rank better for other keywords. SEMrush allows you to check your mobile rankings and ranking updates daily, which is something Ahrefs does not offer. SEMrush also offers social media rankings, a tool you won't find within the Ahrefs platform. Both are good which one do you like let me know in the comment. Keyword Research Keyword research is closely related to rank tracking, but it's used for deciding which keywords you plan on using for future content rather than those you use now. When it comes to SEO, keyword research is the most important thing to consider when comparing the two platforms. AHREFS The Ahrefs Keyword Explorer provides you with thousands of keyword ideas and filters search results based on the chosen search engine. Ahrefs supports several features, including: It can search multiple keywords in a single search and analyze them together. At SEMrush, you also have this feature in Keyword Overview.Ahrefs has a variety of keywords for different search engines, including Google, YouTube, Amazon, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, and other search engines.When you click on a keyword, you can see its search volume and keyword difficulty, but also other keywords related to it, which you didn't use.

The Keyword Magic Tool also lets you to: Show performance metrics by keywordSearch results are based on both broad and exact keyword matches.Show data like search volume, trends, keyword difficulty, and CPC.Show the first 100 Google search results for any keyword.Identify SERP Features and Questions related to each keywordSEMrush has released a new Keyword Gap Tool that uncovers potentially useful keyword opportunities for you, including both paid and organic keywords. WHO WINS? Both of these tools offer keyword research features and allow users to break down complicated tasks into something that can be understood by beginners and advanced users alike. If you're interested in keyword suggestions, SEMrush appears to have more keyword suggestions than Ahrefs does. It also continues to add new features, like the Keyword Gap tool and SERP Questions recommendations. Competitor Analysis Both platforms offer competitor analysis tools, eliminating the need to come up with keywords off the top of your head. Each tool is useful for finding keywords that will be useful for your competition so you know they will be valuable to you. AHREFS Ahrefs' domain comparison tool lets you compare up to five websites (your website and four competitors) side-by-side.it also shows you¬†how your site is ranked against others with metrics such as backlinks, domain ratings, and more. Use the Competing Domains section to see a list of your most direct competitors, and explore how many keywords matches your competitors have. To find more information about your competitor, you can look at the Site Explorer and Content Explorer tools and type in their URL instead of yours. SEMRUSH SEMrush provides a variety of insights into your competitors' marketing tactics. The platform enables you to research your competitors effectively. It also offers several resources for competitor analysis including: Traffic Analytics helps you identify where your audience comes from, how they engage with your site, what devices visitors use to view your site, and how your audiences overlap with other websites.

The Market Explorer search field allows you to type in a domain and lists websites or articles similar to what you entered. Market Explorer also allows users to perform in-depth data analytics on These companies and markets. WHO WINS? SEMrush wins here because it has more tools dedicated to competitor analysis than Ahrefs. However, Ahrefs offers a lot of functionality in this area, too. It takes a combination of both tools to gain an advantage over your competition. Pricing Ahrefs Lite Monthly: $99/monthStandard Monthly: $179/month Annually Lite: $990/yearAnnually Standard: $1790/year SEMRUSH Pro Plan: $119.95/monthGuru Plan:$229.95/monthBusiness Plan: $449.95/month Which SEO tool should you choose for digital marketing?

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens)",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/02/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "description": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.1) What is an NFT?NFT stands for non-fungible¬† token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.2) What is Blockchain?A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information‚Äîsuch as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts‚Äîin one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can‚Äôt be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.3) What makes an NFT valuable? The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn‚Äôt necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.4) How do NFTs work?One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.¬†As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can‚Äôt be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.¬†NFTs also contain smart contracts‚Äîsmall computer programs that run on the blockchain‚Äîthat give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.5) What‚Äôs the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you‚Äôll be able to upload and sell your creations6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain‚Äîthe bitcoin ledger of transactions‚Äîand that entry acts as your proof of ownership.7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.10) How do we buy an NFTs?There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.11) Can i mint NFT for free?To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it? if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': 'adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.12) Why are people investing so much in NFT? ¬†Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don‚Äôt own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.Final SayingThat‚Äôs a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening. I just answer some question with my limited knowledge about NFTs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop them in the comment section below.

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About Email Marketing",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/01/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "description": "1. Why is email marketing important?Email is the marketing tool that helps you¬† create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak¬† to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.2. What is benefits of email marketing?Email marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.Benefits of email marketing for bussiness:Better brand recognitionStatistics of what works bestMore salesTargeted audienceMore traffic to your products/services/newsletterBuild credibilityMost¬† bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?Again, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be¬† times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your¬† data to decide.¬†4. Which metrics should I be looking at?The two most important metrics for email marketing are¬† open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.5. How do I write a decent subject line?The best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing¬† the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for¬† A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and¬† simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,¬† then repeated¬† at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free. 6. Is email marketing still effective?Email marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site¬† hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans¬† see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely¬† see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience. 7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?Buying an email list is¬† waste of time \u0026 money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list.¬†Give them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them. if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = []; atAsyncOptions.push({ 'key': '05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a', 'format': 'js', 'async': true, 'container': 'atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a', 'params' : {} }); var script = document.createElement('script'); script.type = \"text/javascript\"; script.async = true; script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a/invoke.js'; document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script); 8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?If the¬† subject line of the email is irrelevant to¬† customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus¬† on sales, offers and discounts.¬†Submit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to¬† connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?Cold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM.¬†Regularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are¬† your emails will soon be diverted to¬† spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.10. Where can I find email template?Almost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.¬†However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design.¬†11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?Is it a trend to listen to¬† and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.Final Saying¬†You can approach email marketing in different ways. We have compiled a list of most frequently asked questions to help you understand how to get started, what constraints you need to keep in mind, and what future development you will need, we don‚Äôt have 100% answers to every situation and there‚Äôs always a chance you will have something new and different to deal with as you market your own business.",

    "title": "The OnePlus 12 smartphone drops to a record low of $650 for Prime Day",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-oneplus-12-smartphone-drops-to-a-record-low-of-650-for-prime-day-220729473.html?src=rss",
    "description": "In our review of the OnePlus 12, we said the smartphone's affordability was one of the best things about it. Now, thank's to Amazon's upcoming Prime Day sale, that's an even more compelling point. A 19 percent discount drops the price to $650 for the model with 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. That's a a new all-time low (it's gone for $700 a few times previously). The model with 16GB/512GB is also $150 off and down to $750.¬† Other than being a great value for a flagship phone, the OnePlus also has solid cameras that take sharp and clear images. Just note that the camera module is strikingly bulky and you'll see a watermark from Hasselblad (the camera company OnePlus partners with) unless you opt to remove it.¬† The battery life is another win. We measured a lifespan of over 26 hours in our video rundown test. And after just 10 minutes of wall charging, the phone got from 10 to 55 percent. It refilled to 37 percent in the same amount of time sitting on a OnePlus wireless charger, which is available separately for $50.¬† The design is pleasingly \"retro\" (if you can apply that term to an aesthetic that harkens back a mere five years) with the rounded corners and tapered edges of something like the Galaxy S10+. The OnePlus 12 also takes notes from the past when it comes to AI ‚Äî in that it mostly forgoes the buzzy new tech in favor of basic (but solid) smartphone functionality. The screen and processor are fully modern, however, with a super bright and crisp 120Hz screen and a Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip that we found to offer fluid performance, despite clocking in a tad low on some benchmarks.¬† Elsewhere, Amazon is also selling the OnePlus Open for $1,300, which is a $400 discount on the phone we named the more affordable pick for a flagship foldable. That's a price the Open has hit previously, as recently as last month.¬† Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice, and stay tuned to Engadget.com for all of the best tech deals coming out of October Prime Day 2024.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-oneplus-12-smartphone-drops-to-a-record-low-of-650-for-prime-day-220729473.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon Prime Big Deal Days is back this year, returning on October 8 and 9. The ‚Äúfall Prime Day‚Äù of sorts has served as the online retailer‚Äôs unofficial kickoff to the holiday shopping season for the past few years. We expect most of the deals to be Prime exclusives, meaning you must be an active Prime subscriber to get the discounts. There are always a couple of deals available for everyone, though, so it‚Äôs worth perusing Amazon‚Äôs site even if you don‚Äôt pay for Prime. It‚Äôs also worth doing so now because we‚Äôve found a number of solid early Prime Day deals already available. These are the best of the bunch; we‚Äôll be updating this post regularly in the lead-up to October Prime Day, so check back for the latest deals. Prime Day deals: Engadget's top picks Apple AirPods 4 for $119 ($10 off) Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $67 ($12 off) Apple MacBook Air M2 (13-inch) for $749 ($250 off) Lego Super Mario Piranha Plant 71426 for $48 (20 percent off) Lego City 2024 Advent Calendar 60436 for $26 (20 percent off) PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) for $400 ($50 off) Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $85 ($35 off) LG 55-inch C4 evo OLED smart TV for $1,297 ($700 off) Amazon Fire HD 8 (2024) tablet for $55 ($45 off) Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off) Prime Day deals on Apple gear Photo by Billy Steele / Engadget While Apple deals are few and far between right now, you can save a bit on the new AirPods 4. AirTags have a slight discount as well, both in single and multi-packs. Apple MacBook Air M2 (13-inch) for $749 ($250 off): Our favorite budget MacBook provides excellent performance, a gorgeous display and a strong quad-speaker setup. Apple AirPods 4 for $119 ($10 off): This is the first discount we've seen on the new AirPods 4 since launch; just know that right now, only the model with ANC is on sale. Apple Pencil (USB-C) for $67 ($12 off): This stylus is a more affordable version of the new \"pro\" Pencil, and it works with most new iPads. Apple AirTag for $25 ($4 off): This is only $2 more than the record-low price we've seen on a single AirTag in the past. A four-pack is also on sale for $79. Apple Silicone MagSafe iPhone 16 case for $42 ($7 off): It's not a huge discount but this is the first real sale we've seen on first-party iPhone 16 cases. If you don't mind getting a third-party iPhone 16 case, you have plenty of other options, too. Prime Day deals on Amazon devices Valentina Palladino / Engadget It's a safe bet that we'll see even more Amazon gear discounted on October Prime Day, but for now, you can snag a Fire tablet on sale, as well as Ring and Blink security cameras for much cheaper than usual. Echo Spot for $45 ($35 off): This recently revived smart display is billed as a smart alarm clock, and it features a customizable screen, big sound for its size and all the perks for Alexa voice commands. You can also grab it bundled with a free TP-Link smart light bulb. Echo Buds for $25 ($25 off): These are one of our top picks for the best budget wireless earbuds you can get right now thanks to their comfortable design, pocket-friendly case, automatic wear detection, multi-device connectivity and, of course, built-in Alexa voice controls. Fire HD 8 tablet for $55 ($45 off): Amazon just released this new version of the HD 8 tablet, which includes more RAM, a better camera and new AI features not found on the previous model. Fire HD 10 tablet for $75 ($65 off): One of the more advanced tablets in Amazon's lineup, the HD 10 has a 1080p screen, an octa-core processor, up to 64GB of storage and a 13-hour battery life. Kindle Paperwhite Kids for $115 ($55 off): This kids bundle includes the standard Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB of RAM, a kid-friendly cover, a two-year warranty and one free year of access to Amazon Kids+. Amazon Echo Show 8 for $85 ($65 off): The company's mid-sized smart speaker has an 8-inch touchscreen, a 13MP camera with auto-framing for better video chats and a built-in Zigbee smart home hub. Echo Show 5 + TP-Link Tapo Smart Light Bulb for $50 ($65 off): This bundle deal knocks 56 percent off a duo that includes one of our favorite compact smart displays and a smart light bulb that can be controlled via Alexa voice commands. Fire TV Stick 4K Max for $35 ($25 off): Amazon's most powerful Fire TV dongle supports 4K, HDR content and Dolby Vision, plus Wi-Fi 6E and Dolby Atmos audio. A number of other Fire TV devices are on sale right now, too, including the Fire TV Stick Lite for only $18. Amazon Music Unlimited three-month trial for free (four-month free trial for Prime members): Anyone who has never tried Amazon Music Unlimited before can get a three-month free trial right now. Amazon ups that to four months if you're a Prime member that's new to the music streaming service. That's a great deal considering Music Unlimited typically costs $11 per month without Prime or $10 per month with Prime. Best Prime Day Lego deals LEGO A number of Lego sets have already been discounted for October Prime Day. Some of our favorites come from the Star Wars, Super Mario and Harry Potter lineups, and you'll find savings up to 41 percent on those. There's also a Lego City 2024 advent calendar that's 20 percent off and down to only $26. Lego City 2024 Advent Calendar 60436 for $26 (20 percent off) Lego Classic Medium Creative Brick Box 10696 for $19 (46 percent off) Lego Star Wars Spider Tank 75361 for $32 (36 percent off) Lego Star Wars: A New Hope Boarding The Tantive IV Fantasy Toy 75387 for $44 (20 percent off) Lego Star Wars Droideka Model 75381 for $52 (20 percent off) Lego Super Mario Piranha Plant 71426 for $48 (20 percent off) Lego Super Mario Dixie Kong‚Äôs Jungle Jam Expansion Set 71421 for $16 (41 percent off) Lego Super Mario Bowser‚Äôs Muscle Car Expansion Set 71431 for $24 (20 percent off) Lego Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle and Grounds 76419 for $136 (20 percent off) Lego Harry Potter Hogwarts Castle Owlery Toy 76430 for $36 (20 percent off) Lego Harry Potter Hedwig at 4 Privet Drive 76425 for $16 (20 percent off) Lego Technic Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit Building Set 42179 for $60 (20 percent off) Prime Day deals on Ring and Blink security systems You may not immediately think of them when you think about Amazon's own tech, but the shopping giant also owns Ring and Blink. Gadgets from these companies make up most of Amazon's home security offerings, and you can usually find steep discounts during Prime Day on security cameras, alarm systems and other bundles. Blink Outdoor 4 + Echo Show 5 bundle for $60 ($130 off): This Prime-exclusive bundle gives you a one-camera Blink system that can be used indoors or outdoors along with an Echo Show 5, which you can use to see camera feeds just by using Alexa voice commands. Blink Outdoor 4 + Blink Mini 2 bundle for $50 ($90 off): It's almost a guarantee that Blink security systems will be on sale for Prime Day(s) and this time is no different. This bundle is 64 percent off, and there are a bunch of other bundles on sale that include cameras, video doorbells and more. Ring pan and tilt security camera for $50 ($30 off): This security camera joined the Ring lineup only a few months ago, and this is the best price we've seen on it. It's part of a larger Ring sale that discounts home security gear by up to 50 percent. Prime Day deals on tech Will Lipman Photography for Engadget Early Prime Day deals on tech include discounts on power banks, webcams, air fryers, smart plugs and more. PS5 Slim (Digital Edition) for $400 ($50 off): Both the all-digital model and the standard PlayStation 5 are $50 off right now, so you can get them for $400 or $450, respectively. If you're not on the market for the PS5 Pro, these are good console discounts. Logitech Brio 500 Full HD Webcam for $93 ($37 off): Our top pick for the best webcam you can buy right now is $37 off, a decent discount even if it's not a record-low sale. If you spend a lot of your day on video calls, this will be a solid upgrade to your computer's built-in cam. It has a wide field of view, auto-light correction and shoots 1080p video. LG 55-inch C4 evo OLED smart TV for $1,297 ($700 off): LG's midrange OLED sets, the C4 family includes upgraded Alpha 9 Gen 7 chip, improved brightness and a 144Hz max refresh rate. Most sizes are discounted at the moment. Marshall Emberton II speaker for $100 ($70 off): One of our favorite Bluetooth speakers, this model has an attractive, retro design, a pleasant, balanced sound profile and up to 30 hours of battery life. Cosori 9-in-1 air fryer for $85 ($35 off): This newer air fry from Cosori has nine preset cooking modes and a six-quart capacity that makes it just the right size to cook a good amount of food without taking up too much space on most countertops. Oura Ring (3rd gen) for $349 ($100 off): In our review, we called the Oura Ring the ‚Äúperfect wearable for people who don't like wearables.‚Äù It's an alternative to a fitness tracker or smartwatch that tracks all day activity and sleep. Anker Nano Power Bank 10K for $32 ($8 off): This is the cheapest price we've seen for this 10K power bank that has a connecting USB-C cable built in. Anker iPhone 16 screen protectors for $19.20+ (40 percent off): Clip the 40-percent coupon on the page to get a big discount on Anker's screen protectors for any of the latest iPhone 16 models. They provide drop protection from up to 5.9 feet and extra scratch resistance thanks to Anker's ShieldX technology. Baseus 30W/10000mAh MagSafe power bank for $28 ($18 off): Clip the 40-percent off coupon to get a record-low price on a power bank that earned a place in our guide to the best power banks you can buy. It quickly refills MagSafe-compatible phones and has a handy built-in cable. Everything you need to know about October Prime Day 2024 When is October Prime Day 2024? October Prime Day will be held on October 8 and 9 this year. What is October Prime Day? October Prime Day is a members-only sale event run by Amazon in which the online retailer has thousands of sales on its site that are exclusively available to those with an active Prime members. How long is October Prime Day? October Prime Day will last two full days. What is on sale for Amazon Prime Big Deal Days? Most October Prime Day deals will not be revealed until the days of the event. However, in years past, we've seen everything from clothing to household essentials to outdoor gear go on sale during this event. Engadget cares most about tech deals, and in past fall Prime Days, we've seen things like phones, tablets, headphones, earbuds, robot vacuums, smart home gear and more receive deep discounts. Do I need an Amazon Prime membership to shop Prime Day deals? Yes, because most deals will be Prime exclusives. However, there are always a few decent deals available to all Amazon shoppers, so it's worth checking out Amazon's site during October Prime Day to see where you can save even if you don't pay for Prime. Expired early Prime Day deals Apple 24-inch iMac (M3) for $1,100 ($200 off): The discount plus clippable coupon bring the final price for this Apple desktop down to the lowest we've seen. Apple Magic Mouse (black) for $85 ($15 off): The white version of Apple's popular accessory is still cheaper at $68, but the black colorway rarely goes on sale. Both mice pair quickly and are relatively light with responsive touch gestures. Apple iPad Air (13-inch) for $720 ($80 off): The large model of our favorite iPad returns to one of its frequent sale prices. It's about $20 more than its record low, but it's still a good deal if you've been eyeing the 13-inch Air. Apple Pencil (1st gen) for $69 ($30 off): If you have a 10th-gen iPad or older, this is the stylus to get. We've seen this discount for a couple of weeks now, but it's still $10 below the average sale price. It's also discounted at Walmart. Samsung Pro Plus microSD card for $100 ($20 off): This newly released, 1TB variant is down to its best price yet. The Pro Plus is the top pick in our guide to the best microSD cards. Beats Fit Pro earbuds for $159 ($41 off): Our overall favorite pair of earbuds for running are on sale for $41 off.

    "title": "Google ordered to open up the Play Store in Epic Games antitrust ruling",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-has-to-open-up-the-play-store-in-epic-games-antitrust-ruling-195239228.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Google has to open up the Play Store. On Monday, US District Judge James Donato issued a permanent injunction forcing the company to open its storefront to competitors for three years and make Android apps available in alternate stores. The ruling stems from Google‚Äôs four-year antitrust battle with Epic Games. Google said on Monday it will appeal the injunction, highlighting its competition with Apple and potential security concerns. As part of the ruling, Google must allow third-party app stores access to the Google Play library. In addition, CNBC reports that the company has to make those alternate app stores available for download in the Play Store. Google also can‚Äôt make deals (using fees or revenue sharing) to launch apps exclusively on Google Play or preinstall its store on new hardware. Billing changes will also emerge from the injunction. Google can‚Äôt require developers to use its own billing system. Nor can it stop devs from notifying users about less expensive payment options. CNBC reports that a three-person committee will monitor Google‚Äôs compliance and technical issues stemming from the ruling. Google and Epic will form the committee. When reached for comment by Engadget, a Google spokesperson pointed to a blog post explaining why it will appeal. Google VP of Regulatory Affairs Lee-Anne Mulholland wrote that the company‚Äôs competition with Apple helps to negate antitrust concerns. ‚ÄúThe decision fails to take into account that Android is an open platform and developers have always had many options in how to distribute their apps,‚Äù Mulholland wrote. ‚ÄúIn fact, most Android devices come preloaded with two or more app stores right out of the box.‚Äù ‚ÄúFor example, Epic Games has made its popular Fortnite app available to Android users through the Samsung Galaxy Store, sideloading, and the Epic Games Store ‚Äî all while Fortnite was not distributed through Google Play,‚Äù Google‚Äôs Regulatory Affairs VP wrote. ‚ÄúThese are options that developers have never been able to offer to their American users on iPhones.‚Äù In December, a jury found Google‚Äôs Play Store to violate US antitrust laws. The unanimous verdict stated that the company held an illegal monopoly on app distribution and in-app billing for Android devices. It also ruled that its deals with other gaming companies and device manufacturers were anti-competitive.¬† In April, Epic listed a proposed permanent injunction that largely matches Donato‚Äôs decision today. For its part, Google said at the time Epic‚Äôs demands went too far and were too self-serving. The ruling went in a very different direction from a similar one Epic filed against Apple, which the Fortnite maker mostly lost. CNBC notes that a jury decided Google‚Äôs trial, while the fate of Apple‚Äôs suit fell into the hands of a judge.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/google-has-to-open-up-the-play-store-in-epic-games-antitrust-ruling-195239228.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Prime Day deals on laptops include the M2 MacBook Air for a record low of $749 on Amazon",

    "description": "October Prime Day is nearly here, but we're seeing more new deals pop up in the final hours before the event kicks off. One of the best laptop deals we're seeing at the moment is on M2-powered Apple MacBook Air, which you can snag right now for $749. That's a $250 discount, and it brings it down to a new record-low price. We consider this machine to be the best budget MacBook in Apple's laptop lineup. In our initial M2 MacBook Air review, we were impressed by the laptop's thinner design, gorgeous 13.6-inch display, great quad-speaker setup and the M2 chip's excellent performance. It had been our top pick for the best MacBook, period, but the new M3 model has taken that top slot. However, the M2 Air doesn't skimp ‚Äî those on a budget (or anyone simply looking to save some cash) will still get a lot of laptop and a lot of power choosing this machine. One could argue, and our Daniel Cooper did, that the best thing about the M3 MacBook Air was the price drop given to the M2 Air after its launch. The M3 chip is pretty similar to the M2, and while there's no doubt that those who want the latest and greatest should get an M3 machine, an M2 laptop will be more than enough for most people using it as a daily driver. And, when you consider the M2 started at $1,200 when it first came out in 2022, it makes this discount even more compelling (it only received a price drop to $1,000 after the M3's debut). There are other discounts on the MacBook lineup at Amazon at the moment, too. The M3 MacBook Air is $200 off and down to $899, which is only $50 more than its record-low price. The 15-inch MacBook with an M3 chip is also $200 off and on sale for $1,099.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/comcast-says-230000-customers-affected-by-debt-collection-data-breach-184554728.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Comcast is warning that hackers stole the personal data of more than 230,000 customers during a ransomware attack on a third-party debt collector, according to a court filing. The bad actors targeted a Pennsylvania-based debt collection agency called Financial Business and Consumer Solutions (FBCS.) The attack occurred back in February, but Comcast claims that FBCS initially said that the incident didn‚Äôt involve any customer data. FBCS changed its tune by July, when it notified Comcast that customer information had been compromised, according to reporting by TechCrunch. All told, 237,703 subscribers were impacted by the breach. The attackers were thorough, scooping up names, addresses, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, Comcast account numbers and ID numbers. Comcast says the stolen data belongs to customers who signed up with the company ‚Äúaround 2021.‚Äù It also says it has stopped using FBCS for the purposes of debt collection. ‚ÄúFrom February 14 and February 26, 2024, an unauthorized party gained access to FBCS‚Äôs computer network and some of its computers,‚Äù the filing states. ‚ÄúDuring this time, the unauthorized party downloaded data from FBCS systems and encrypted some systems as part of a ransomware attack.‚Äù No group has stepped forward to claim credit for the incident. FBCS has only referred to the attacker as an ‚Äúunauthorized actor.‚Äù The debt collection agency was hit hard by this attack, with Comcast customers being just one group of victims. The company says more than four million people were impacted and that the cybercriminals accessed medical claims and health insurance information, in addition to standard identification data.¬† To that end, medical debt-purchasing company CF Medical confirmed that 600,000 of its customers were involved in the breach. Truist Bank also confirmed it was affected by the attack. It‚Äôs notable that this incident primarily impacts debtors, opening them up to potential scams. Chris Hauk, consumer privacy advocate at Pixel Privacy, told Engadget that ‚Äúthe bad actors that get their paws on this information may use it to pose as debt relief agencies, which many turn to as a way out of their situation, meaning many of the involved debtors may be defrauded out of large sums of money, something they can ill-afford.‚Äù In other words, keep an eye out for suspicious phone calls, emails and texts. This is good advice for anyone, and not just debtors who had data stored with FBCS. After all, it was revealed that hackers stole more than 2.7 billion records from American consumers earlier this year, which likely includes data on everyone who lives in the country.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/comcast-says-230000-customers-affected-by-debt-collection-data-breach-184554728.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/social-media/twitch-makes-its-complicated-rulebook-easier-to-follow-183617108.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Twitch is striving for more clarity about why and how it executes its policies. On Monday, the company said it‚Äôs adding Enforcement Notes, which it describes as ‚Äúadditional clarifications and examples within the Community Guidelines designed to make our rules easier to follow.‚Äù The notes come on the heels of (and complement) the company‚Äôs recent promise that it would do a better job of telling rule-breakers why their accounts were suspended. The company says Enforcement Notes will outline how its rules apply to the trends you see on the platform. For example, if a new trending topic violates one of Twitch‚Äôs policies, it will publish a note under that rule, clarifying precisely which behaviors are and aren‚Äôt out of bounds. It will also publish new notes in response to data spikes it observes, widespread community confusion or trending discussions on social media. Twitch has already added some enforcement notes to its community guidelines safety page. For example, one note says selling activities that could cause harm in exchange for money (like taking shots for subscriptions) is forbidden under its ‚ÄúSelf-destructive behavior‚Äù rule. In addition, it states under ‚ÄúSexual content‚Äù that direct links to websites that primarily provide intimate content aren‚Äôt allowed on the platform. Under ‚ÄúImpersonation,‚Äù it states that if someone else is posing as you, you can report the imitating stream to Twitch when it doesn‚Äôt qualify for a DMCA removal. Twitch says its enforcement notes won‚Äôt replace any of its existing methods of communication with users, like blog posts or tweets. Instead, the company describes the notes as ‚Äúa source of truth for all policy and enforcement updates.‚Äù Right now, the easiest way to learn about Enforcement Notes is through a browser page search on the community guidelines page. However, Twitch says it will eventually add a visual symbol to indicate new ones. It‚Äôs also working on a built-in search feature to make the notes easier to spot without using Cmd-F or Ctrl-F.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/twitch-makes-its-complicated-rulebook-easier-to-follow-183617108.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-discounted-switch-bundles-are-now-available-174016292.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Nintendo‚Äôs new Switch bundles are here. As the seven-year-old console takes its victory lap ahead of the Switch 2, the standard Switch and the OLED model are now available in the new bundles announced in September. The systems are each packaged with redemption codes for a 12-month Switch Online membership and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The standard bundle costs $300, and the OLED variant costs $350. The baseline bundle includes the standard Switch with a 6.2-inch LCD and red and blue Joy-Cons. Meanwhile, the OLED console has a 7-inch OLED display and white Joy-Cons. For only $50 extra, the latter gives you extra screen real estate along with the richer colors and deeper blacks of OLED. Although the standard model still looks good, comparing them side-by-side makes the $50 more expensive OLED one hard to turn down. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe has been one of the console‚Äôs flagship titles since its arrival shortly after the console itself in 2017. Initially released for the Wii U, the Switch revamp of the racing classic adapts its controls well to the portable system. The game‚Äôs optional smart steering feature helps make it more fun for those who frequently drive off-course and spend the next 30 seconds trying to get back on as their competitors lap them. (Raises hand.) The game looks terrific on the Switch‚Äôs screen ‚Äî especially the OLED ‚Äî and it runs in an enhanced 1080p mode when docked. Nintendo Meanwhile, Switch Online enables online play on Mario Kart 8 and many other titles, along with cloud-based saves. You also get access to hundreds of old-school games from the NES, SNES, Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, N64 and Sega Genesis (Mega Drive) eras. You‚Äôll find Nintendo‚Äôs own Mario, Zelda and Metroid classics there, along with plenty of third-party fare to keep you entertained.¬† The biggest caveat to this bundle is that the Switch 2 (or whatever Nintendo calls its successor) is on the horizon. Although Nintendo hasn‚Äôt announced the successor yet, the company is rumored to reveal it anytime. The sequel is expected to have a more powerful processor, more RAM and storage and support for NVIDIA‚Äôs DLSS upscaling tech. But even if Nintendo unveils the console soon, it isn‚Äôt expected to arrive until sometime in 2025, so it won‚Äôt be an option for this holiday season either way.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/nintendos-discounted-switch-bundles-are-now-available-174016292.html?src=rss",

    "description": "If you‚Äôre active on Meta‚Äôs Threads app, then you‚Äôve probably encountered some amount of engagement bait in your ‚Äúfor you‚Äù‚Äù feed. Now, Instagram chief Adam Mosseri has acknowledged the issue, saying that the company is ‚Äúworking to get it under control\" after a spike in such posts. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen an increase in engagement-bait on Threads and we‚Äôre working to get it under control,‚Äù Mosseri said in a post on Threads. He didn‚Äôt say what steps the company is taking but said there would be ‚Äúmore to come‚Äù on the issue. Mosseri‚Äôs comments are the first time the Meta executive has acknowledged the problem that‚Äôs become an increasingly prominent topic of discussion on Threads. Because the app defaults to the algorithmic ‚Äúfor you‚Äù feed, engagement bait style posts that attract a lot of replies often go viral on the app even if it‚Äôs the type of content many users say they don‚Äôt want to see. But addressing the issue could be tricky because what people often refer to as ‚Äúengagement bait‚Äù takes many forms in the app. There are downright spammy posts that lift the kind of copypasta content that‚Äôs shared widely on Facebook (here‚Äôs a particularly egregious recent example). There are accounts that post open-ended AskReddit-style questions. And then there‚Äôs the rage-bait posts, as recently documented by Business Insider‚Äôs Katie Notopoulos. Those posts, which often touch on polarizing topics, seem like they‚Äôre only meant to elicit angry responses from other users who have a controversial opinion from someone they don‚Äôt know thrust into their timeline. For example, I‚Äôve seen dozens of posts with hundreds of replies about whether young children should be allowed on airplanes. In her experiment, Notopoulos got more than 1 million views and 5,000 replies on a post ‚Äî heavily inspired from a two-year-old viral tweet and Reddit post ‚Äî about not feeding children who come over for playdates. And while Mosseri and Meta haven‚Äôt explained why it‚Äôs proved so easy to game Threads‚Äô algorithm to go viral with this kind of content, it seems to be related to how the app has prioritized replies in deciding what to surface to users. ‚ÄúNot all comments or replies are good,‚Äù Mosseri said.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-is-working-to-fix-threads-engagement-bait-problem-173135011.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Prime Day is back, meaning there are a ton of deals worth checking out on Amazon. Those who have been looking for a robot vacuum cleaner are in luck, as there are deals on several of iRobot's Roomba devices. The Combo j9+, which also includes a mop function, has dropped to $800 for Prime Day. That's $800 off the regular price of $1,400 and it marks a return to a record low. This is our pick for the best robot vacuum and mop combo. The Roomba Combo j9+ covers all the bases ‚Äî and floor types ‚Äî as it offers just about everything you could want in such a device. It has strong suction, the ability to give your floors a deep scrub and the intelligence to avoid obstacles. The accompanying Clean Base not only allows the Combo j9+ to self-empty, it refills the robot's liquid tank with water or solution. As such, you shouldn't have to empty the debris bin or top up the base's liquid tank for weeks at a time. You can set up vacuuming and mopping routines, and ask Alexa or Google Assistant to start an ad hoc cleaning. The Combo j9+ can map out your home faster than previous models and you can label objects to help direct the Roomba to clean a specific area. The Combo j9+ is certainly a more premium option, but there are other Roombas on sale for Prime Day. Another vacuum and mop combo (Y0140) has dropped from $275 to $219. Meanwhile, you can pick up the even more budget-friendly Roomba Q0120 vacuum for $189. It usually costs $250. Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice, and stay tuned to Engadget.com for all of the best tech deals coming out of October Prime Day 2024.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/irobots-roomba-combo-j9-robot-vacuum-and-mop-is-600-off-for-prime-day-172009289.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The EA/Codemasters racing sim Grid Legends is coming to mobile this December, after first releasing for consoles and PC back in 2022. It‚Äôs actually a port of the deluxe edition of the game, which was originally released in 2023. This version includes all of the available DLC and some other goodies. It‚Äôs coming to iOS and Android and offers ‚Äúfull support for all popular gamepads‚Äù, with touch and tilt controls for those who don‚Äôt have a third-party gamepad. There‚Äôs a trailer, with footage captured on mobile devices, and it looks pretty darn good. The visuals are, dare I say, console-worthy. To that end, the game will only run on the iPhone 12 Pro, the iPhone 13 Pro, and every model released since the iPhone 14. It‚Äôll run on any iPad with an M1 chip or better. As for Android, the game will only run on devices with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 and Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chips. Preorders are available now on both the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. It costs $15. There‚Äôs no actual release date yet. It‚Äôs just sometime in December. For the uninitiated, Grid Legends is a well-regarded racing game that draws from both hardcore sims and arcade racers. There‚Äôs a lengthy career mode, plenty of multiplayer challenges and an extensive list of courses. All told, there are more than 100 vehicles to choose from.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/eas-grid-legends-racing-game-careens-onto-ios-and-android-this-december-165137002.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Many fans of 2014‚Äôs Alien: Isolation video game praised its graphics, story and general gameplay, making it a bit of a standout from many other games adapted from a movie. It even received seven separate DLC packs. Gamers have been enjoying this cult classic on mobile and Switch for a while now, but today, on the game‚Äôs 10th anniversary, the developers announced that they‚Äôre developing a sequel. Yes, you heard us right. Alien: Isolation now has a sequel in early development. If you don‚Äôt believe us, take the official X account‚Äôs word for it. We currently don‚Äôt have any other details on this sequel, but a look back at reviews for Alien: Isolation should give you hope we‚Äôll get another solid game here. If the sequel is anything like the original, then you can expect horror, stealth and second-guessing yourself just as the claws of an alien take your life.

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/ps5-slim-consoles-are-50-off-ahead-of-prime-day-153513934.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Prime Day is almost upon us, but you don't have to wait any time at all to find some good deals. Case in point: both variants of the PS5 Slim have dropped by $50, so if you've been holding off on making the leap to current-gen consoles (and the PS5 Pro is perhaps a little too on the pricey side), this is a solid discount that's worth considering. The Digital Edition (the one without a disc drive) has dropped to $400, while the regular edition can be yours for $450. The PS5 Slim variants have all the power of the original PS5 units but in a more slender form factor. Given how chunky those first models were, that's nothing to sniff at. If you buy the Slim Digital Edition and later decide that you'd like a disc drive so you can use Blu-rays, DVDs or physical editions of games on your PS5, you can pick up an $80 attachment. However, it's worth noting that the add-on has been going in and out of stock in anticipation of the PS5 Pro, which doesn't have a disc drive built in but is compatible with the attachment. The PS5 games library is very robust at this point, thanks to killer first-party titles such as Marvel's Spider-Man 2 and the utterly terrific Astro Bot. Sony is remastering some major games that debuted on PS4 for the console too, including both chapters of The Last of Us and Horizon Zero Dawn. There's a huge selection of great third-party games to jump into as well, like the latest EA Sports FC, Madden NFL and NBA 2K games for sports fans, Elden Ring and Baldur's Gate 3. And let's not forget the small matter of a new Call of Duty game dropping in a few weeks. So, if you do pick up a PS5 Slim, you'll have a ton of games to buy and check out. That said, a PS Plus Extra or Premium subscription might be what you want, as that will give you access to a large library of titles right out of the gate.

    "description": "It‚Äôs officially Amazon Prime Day, so the deals are coming in hot. The fantastic Samsung Galaxy A15 smartphone is available for just $180, which is a discount of ten percent. The typical price is $200 for this budget-friendly handset. The A15 found a place of distinction in our list of the best cheap phones, in addition to appearing in our list of the best budget Android smartphones. It‚Äôs a solid offering with plenty of features typically reserved for more expensive models. It boasts a fairly robust camera system, with a 50MP rear camera and a 13MP front camera. There‚Äôs also 5MP ultrawide and a 2MP macro. It‚Äôs lightweight, at seven ounces, and includes an actual OLED display. That‚Äôs practically unheard of for budget-tier smartphones. The 5G-enabled handset ships with a 5,000 mAh battery, which gets the job done.¬† There are some light caveats. This deal is for the entry-level model with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage.

    "description": "iPhone and Apple Watch users who prefer paying with Apple Cash over other apps like Venmo can now send or receive money in person using Tap to Cash. All transactions using this method are private, which means your phone number and email aren‚Äôt shared with the other party. Let‚Äôs see how you can use Tap to Cash. Requirements To use Tap to Cash, you and the other person must have an iPhone that‚Äôs been updated to iOS 18 or an Apple Watch running watchOS 11. Naturally, you should have a verified Apple Cash account already set up. Using cellular data is fine if you‚Äôre not connected to Wi-Fi. It‚Äôs important to remember that you can only send or receive a maximum of $2,000 per seven-day period. The minimum amount you can send is $1, and the maximum is $2,000. These limits are unique to Tap to Cash, and if you need to pay more, you must swap to Messages. Apple Cash is currently only available in the US. For those outside the US, you'll have to rely on other payment methods. Venmo is also US-only. Tap to Cash on iPhone On your iPhone, open the Wallet app and look for your Apple Cash card. Note that you won‚Äôt be able to do this by double-clicking your iPhone‚Äôs side button to get into Apple Pay ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to unlock your phone and open the Wallet app directly. Select ‚ÄúSend or Request‚Äù and then tap ‚ÄúTap to Cash.‚Äù You can then enter the desired amount to pay the recipient, and there‚Äôs an option to add a note specifying the payment‚Äôs reason or context. Tap ‚ÄúNext‚Äù to proceed. You‚Äôll now have to double-click the side button to confirm your payment, ensuring you‚Äôre paying the recipient. After doing so, hold your iPhone so the top is close to the recipient‚Äôs iPhone or Apple Watch. Confirm the transaction went through, and you‚Äôre free to make another one. To check the transaction, open the Wallet app and tap on your Apple Cash card. The transaction should be under ‚ÄúLatest Transactions‚Äù and have a Tap to Cash icon beside it. Tap to Cash on Apple Watch The process is similar to using Tap to Cash on iPhone. You must first open your Wallet, tap your Apple Cash card and then pick ‚ÄúTap to Cash.‚Äù Enter how much you want to send and proceed by tapping ‚ÄúNext.‚Äù Double-click the side button to initiate the transaction. Hold your Apple Watch next to the recipient‚Äôs Apple Watch or iPhone before making sure the money went through. You can also look at the latest transactions by opening the Wallet, tapping on your card and tapping a transaction to see if it has ‚Äúvia Tap to Cash‚Äù in the information.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-use-the-new-apple-cash-tap-to-cash-feature-in-ios-18-151915913.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Update 11:54am ET: This deal has sold out, but you can find the rest of the best Prime Day deals here. There‚Äôs little better than finding a killer deal on a great product, and here‚Äôs an October Prime Day deal that checks pretty much all the right boxes. Sony's WH-1000XM4 headphones are on sale for $130, which is a new record low. They often sell for $348 and the previous record low price was $198. These aren‚Äôt quite the very best Sony headphones on the market anymore. The XM5s are now at the top of the mountain (they‚Äôre our favorite noise canceling headphones overall). However, the XM4s are still a fantastic set of cans, especially at this bargain price. We gave the XM4s a score of 94 in our review. The powerful, customizable active noise cancellation was a major selling point, as was the immersive audio. The \"pause when you speak\" feature is quite nifty, while multipoint connectivity is always welcome. The price was one of our main drawbacks, but thankfully that's now far less of an issue. Sony says you'll get up to 30 hours of usage from a single charge (which matches up with our testing) and you'll get five hours of playback time after a 10-minute quick charge. We felt that the touch controls worked reliably well, while the five-microphone array should help make your voice clear on calls. In addition, the XM4s support Sony's 360 Reality Audio format for immersive sound. The songs typically sound better than standard tracks and the library of supported music has grown over the years, but not every streaming service supports the format. Amazon Music Unlimited is the best-known option. Tidal, on the other hand, dropped support for the format this summer in favor of Dolby Atmos.

    "description": "Amazon Prime Day begins tomorrow, but you can already save on some of the newest tech of the year. In this case, we're referring to TVs ‚Äî LG's C4 OLED smart TV lineup has dropped in price, bringing the 55-inch model down to a record low of $1,297 ‚Äî that's roughly $700 off. While it's typical to see TV prices fall throughout the year, starting basically soon after the TVs get announced, that doesn't change the fact that these are some of the steepest discounts we've seen since the C4 launched. You can save hundreds of dollars on other sizes, too. This is the company‚Äôs mid-grade line of OLED TVs. Each model includes the updated Alpha 9 Gen 7 chip, which makes menu navigation much snappier. They also boast improved brightness when compared to previous models. These TVs almost hit 1,000 nits of brightness, which is a little dimmer than a Mini LED panel but better than many OLEDs. There‚Äôs a maximum refresh rate of 144Hz, which is perfect for gaming. To that end, these sets are compatible with G-Sync and AMD Freesync. The PC gaming bona-fides are strong with this one.¬† One of the cool features of this smart TV is enhanced compatibility with LG soundbars. Newly-released soundbars will connect wirelessly to the television, clearing away the endless clutter of cables from the living room.¬† The 65-inch model is also on sale for $1,697, which is a discount of over $1,000. For the big spenders, the massive 83-inch version is available for $4,297. This is 20 percent off the typical price.

Amazon uses October Prime Day to kickstart the holiday shopping season ‚Äî even if you haven't even thought about the holidays yet, you should give the latest Prime Day Lego deals a look. A number of Lego sets from the Super Mario, Star Wars and Harry Potter collections are already on sale for up to 41 percent off. There are even steeper savings on general Lego sets as well. On the Star Wars side of things, this Spider Tank set is 36 percent off and down to only $32, which is the lowest it's ever been. It includes 526 pieces that replicate the spider tank from season three of The Mandalorian, plus three minifigures: Din Djarin, Bo-Katan Kryze and Grogu. Once built, the spider tank has grabbing claws, flexible legs and a little cockpit in which one of the figures can sit. Also on sale is this Boarding The Tantive IV set in which you recreate the iconic scene from Star Wars: A New Hope. That will set you back $44, which represents a 20-percent discount.

    "description": "At yesterday's Halo World Championships, developer 343 Industries announced that it was officially changing its name to Halo Studios. The company also revealed that it has multiple new games in the pipeline and is switching all future Halo development from its proprietary Slipspace Engine to Unreal Engine 5.¬† In a YouTube video (below) the new studio showed elements from the \"Project Foundry\" Unreal Engine research effort that has been ongoing for the past several years. While just a tech demo for now, it showed Master Chief and Covenant elite designs, along with three biomes including a Cascades-type location, Flood-impacted Blightlands and snowy Coldlands.¬† \"Respectfully, some components of Slipspace are almost 25 years old,‚Äù Halo Studios art director Chris Matthews told Xbox Wire. ‚ÄúAlthough 343 were developing it continuously, there are aspects of Unreal that Epic has been developing for some time, which are unavailable to us in Slipspace ‚Äî and would have taken huge amounts of time and resources to try and replicate.\" The company plans to hire new employees and have multiple teams working on several games at once using a centralized UE5 pipeline. Halo Studios didn't reveal any specific projects or timelines, with CEO Pierre Hintze simply saying that they'll be \"ready when they're ready.\" The studio has been under the leadership of Hintze, GM Bryan Koski and COO Elizabeth Van Wyck since studio GM Bonnie Ross left in 2022. Some of this information was leaked in early 2023, with reports that 343 was \"starting from scratch\" on Halo development following layoffs. The studio was said to be shifting to Unreal Engine after struggling with its aging Slipspace platform. At the time, 343 Industries affirmed that it was \"here to stay\" following rumors that Microsoft might shift the Halo franchise to other studios.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/halo-developer-343-industries-rebrands-itself-to-halo-studios-120041943.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Phoenix Springs review: A dazzling and disquieting sci-fi mystery",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/phoenix-springs-review-a-dazzling-and-disquieting-sci-fi-mystery-120029156.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Playing Phoenix Springs feels like being trapped in a gorgeous dream that‚Äôs steadily becoming a nightmare. It‚Äôs a point-and-click mystery set in a bleak futuristic world of dramatic shadows and muted primary colors, its scenes connected by streams of anxious static. The game stars Iris Dormer, a technology reporter who‚Äôs searching for her estranged brother, Leo. Her hunt takes her from the abandoned buildings of a rundown city, to a rich suburb, and finally to Phoenix Springs, a desert oasis bathed in golden light and occupied by a handful of odd, disconnected people. Iris is the heart of Phoenix Springs. She narrates the on-screen action in a stoic, unaffected tone that belies the cutting poetry of her observations. Iris has just three options when interacting with people and items: talk to, look at or use. Relevant concepts and objects are collected in her mental inventory, a simple word cloud of black text on a white background. Open the inventory with a right click and select a word to bring it into the scene, where it‚Äôs combinable with other ideas and with Iris herself, prompting her to remember the clue or provide more details about it. Making Iris remember certain things is a key mechanic throughout the mystery, and it‚Äôs a good move to keep in mind if you ever feel stuck in a point-and-click hole while playing. Iris is the game‚Äôs only voice and she talks directly to the player, sharing unfiltered thoughts as she processes each new set piece. Iris is jaded, dogged and insightful, and her cadence is sedate but sharp. It‚Äôs the kind of voice that could make a take-out menu sound both sinister and profound, and it‚Äôs a thrill to listen to throughout Phoenix Springs. Iris‚Äô city is desolate and rife with inequity. The streets are dotted with deserted buildings and barbed wire, and only the richest citizens are allowed to use energy without restriction. Down one alleyway, an intoxicated man is passed out on top of a shipping container, while a mute boy sits nearby, making a plant dance with an electronic box. In an abandoned university, a DJ blasts a thundering playlist for days on end as part of a mass sleep-deprivation experiment, delirious dancers and unconscious bodies piling up on the auditorium floor. The city's shadows are tinged with green, oppressive and sickly. There‚Äôs a mid-century edge to the game‚Äôs technology ‚Äî globe lights, push-button intercoms, bulky computer terminals and long train rides ‚Äî which makes the world feel intensely familiar, at least until the stasis pods appear. Make no mistake, Phoenix Springs is hard cyberpunk.¬† Oddly enough, this only becomes clearer once you make your way to the oasis. The lushness of Phoenix Springs is an immediate relief, its flowing waters, red wooden huts and vibrant natural textures highlighting the sterility of the city‚Äôs metal, glass and wires. It‚Äôs almost relaxing enough to make you ignore the high strangeness of everything and everyone there. Almost. Calligram Studio On top of combining items to generate new leads about Leo‚Äôs disappearance, it‚Äôs critical to speak with people, bring them relevant ideas from your inventory and listen closely to their answers. The game relies on making common-sense connections and following your intuition, and rarely are solutions provided at face value. At times trial-and-error is a valid way to progress, and in other cases it‚Äôs just a matter of taking a breath and thinking about the problem from a fresh angle. My advice is to have patience and try absolutely everything that comes to mind; if you‚Äôre paying attention, chances are, you‚Äôre on the right track. Phoenix Springs occasionally suffers from the most common issue in point-and-click games, where it feels like you‚Äôve tried every combination and nothing is working, so you just randomly click around until something happens ‚Äî but I encountered only two instances like this in about six hours of playtime. Thankfully, Calligram Studio provides a link to a walkthrough guide in the pause screen, so hope is never truly lost. Calligram Studio The game‚Äôs simple control scheme supports a surprisingly complex narrative that unspools in Iris‚Äô measured narration. There‚Äôs nothing rushed about Phoenix Springs. Iris walks leisurely across expansive wide shots, her light blue silhouette cutting through high grasses and across cold concrete at the same unhurried pace. When she speaks, she gives each thought time to permeate the scene, sentences short and powerful. Haunting choir chords and droning bass lines are eventually replaced by pristine silence and birdsong. Where the environments aren‚Äôt blanketed in shadow, their colors constantly shift like there‚Äôs a stop-motion river flowing just beneath the screen. Each second of Phoenix Springs demands your attention. In return, the game provides a million moments of intrigue for your eyes, ears and deductive mind. And at the inevitable conclusion, every small detail slides elegantly into place. I want to print out this game, frame by frame, and plaster its hand-drawn neo-noir vistas over every square inch of my office walls. Phoenix Springs is an interactive art installation that happens to use point-and-click game mechanics, and Calligram Studio‚Äôs emphasis on creating something beautiful ‚Äî and then using this canvas to tell a twisted story about biohacking and familial love ‚Äî is clear. Calligram Studio What‚Äôs exciting about Phoenix Springs is that it excels as both a piece of art and a detective game. It occupies a similar territory as Kentucky Route Zero, another title that offers depressing social commentary in a visually fascinating package, also made by a small artist collective. In the case of Phoenix Springs, stunning art direction, expert writing, incredible sound design, fabulous voice acting and satisfying mechanics combine to create an unforgettable, utterly unique sci-fi experience. Sure, Phoenix Springs is a game ‚Äî but mostly, it‚Äôs gorgeous. Phoenix Springs is now available on PC, Mac and Linux, developed and published by Calligram Studio.

    "title": "The best DACs for Apple Music Lossless in 2024",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss",
    "description": "A lot of people started to care about ‚Äúhigh resolution‚Äù digital audio when Apple launched its upgraded music service to the masses. Call that the ‚ÄúApple effect,‚Äù as infuriating as it may be, but the iPhone maker isn‚Äôt the only one in the hi-res audio game: Qobuz, Tidal and Deezer have been doing it for a while, and Spotify has been toying with releasing its own version for a while. However, as many were quick to point out, some of Apple‚Äôs own products don‚Äôt necessarily support the higher sample rate and bit-depths on offer. No worries, there‚Äôs a dongle for that, and there are options for Android and desktop, too. We‚Äôve tested dozens of these devices and the best DACs listed in this guide will play nice with any of the aforementioned services (aside from Tidal's MQA, which is a little more specific). What is a DAC? James Trew / Engadget A digital-to-analog converter takes the digital (D) music from your phone or computer and converts (C) it into analog (A) sound you can hear. All phones and PCs have them, but since handsets moved to USB-C, Lightning or Bluetooth for music, the task of converting that signal was generally outsourced to either your adapter or your wireless headphones. DACs can be used with phones, laptops and desktops but tend to be much simpler than a regular external audio interface. One basic distinction is that DACs are usually for listening only whereas an audio interface might have ports to plug in microphones and instruments (but an external audio interface is also technically a DAC). Some high-end DACs even include XLR outputs for better connectivity with professional audio equipment. The best DACs tend to be lightweight, making them more suitable for mobile use, although it still gets a little tricky with the iPhone as you still might need to add another dongle to make it play nice with Lightning. Also, not all DACs support all the higher audio resolutions like DSD. Most standalone DACs require external power or an onboard battery, though some can use the power from whatever you plug them into ‚Äî in which case expect a hit to your battery life. Best DACs for 2024 DAC FAQs What does DAC stand for? DAC stands for digital to analogue converter. It‚Äôs a device that takes digital files, stored on a laptop, computer, etc., and converts them into audio that we can listen to with better clarity and depth. Devices that provide sound, like a CD player, Blu-ray player, TV box, and so on, require good DACs so that the digital files can be decoded in order to output audio. Most of the time, a DAC is built-in to these devices, but sometimes they are external and require a power supply. Why do I need new hardware to listen to music? The short answer is, you don‚Äôt. You can play ‚Äúhi-res‚Äù audio files on most phones and PCs, you just might not be getting the full experience. If your device‚Äôs audio interface tops out at 44.1 or 48kHz (which is fairly common and covers the vast majority of music online) then that‚Äôs the experience you‚Äôll get. If you want to enjoy better sounding music at a higher sample rate and bit-depth (aka resolution), you‚Äôll need an interface that supports it and wired headphones, potentially using a headphone amp for an enhanced experience. It‚Äôs worth pointing out that ‚Äúlossless‚Äù and ‚Äúhi-res‚Äù are related terms, but not the same thing and will vary from service to service. Apple uses ALAC encoding which is compressed, but without ‚Äúloss‚Äù to the quality (unlike the ubiquitous .aac or .mp3 file formats). CDs were generally mastered to at least 16-bit / 44.1kHz which is the benchmark that Apple is using for its definition of lossless. In audio circles, a general consensus is that hi-res is anything with a sample rate above 44.1kHz. Increasingly, though, the term is being used for anything 96kHz and above. This, of course, isn‚Äôt only about Apple‚Äôs new streaming formats. External DACs and audio interfaces are a great way to get the best sound and upgrade your listening experience generally. Especially if you want to get into the world of more exotic (read: pricey) headphones, as they often even require a DAC to provide enough clean digital signal to drive them. For audiophile headphones, a phone or laptop‚Äôs internal sound chipset often doesn‚Äôt have the oomph needed to deliver a hi-fi experience, meaning a better DAC could make all the difference in sound quality. Okay, but can‚Äôt I just use the headphone adapter for my phone? No. Well, yes, but see above. A Lightning or USB-C to 3.5mm headphone adapter often is an audio interface and most of the ones you‚Äôre buying for $7 (or that come free in the box) do not support hi-res audio beyond 48kHz / 24-bit. Android is a little more complicated, as some adapters are ‚Äúpassive‚Äù and really just connect you to the phone‚Äôs internal DAC like old school headphones. Others (active ones) have a DAC built-in and good luck finding out what your specific phone and the in-box adapter delivers. (Hint: connect it to a PC and see if it comes up as an audio interface. You might find some details there if it does). What about Bluetooth headphones? Chances are that over the last few years you‚Äôve migrated from wired to wireless headphones (thanks, Apple). The world of Bluetooth headphones changes things a little when it comes to seeking better audio performance. What matters here is twofold, the headphones you‚Äôre using (as those will technically be the ‚ÄúDAC‚Äù) and the codec ‚Äî the method used to send the musical data over to the headphones. It‚Äôs worth checking to see if your headphones support aptX and which version ‚Äî aptX HD, aptX Adaptive are better than standard and becoming more common. Other systems exist, like Sony‚Äôs LDAC, but Qualcomm‚Äôs AptX has wider support thanks to its prevalence in Android devices. Some high-end wireless headphones might even come with a headphone jack for wired connections when higher-quality audio is needed.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-best-dac-for-lossless-high-resolution-music-iphone-android-160056147.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Choosing the best portable speaker can be a daunting task with the amount of options available today. Whether you're gearing up for a camping trip, a beach outing, or a backyard barbecue, finding the right speaker that delivers on sound quality, durability, and portability is crucial. We've tested dozens of Bluetooth speakers across various price points to help you navigate this crowded market. While many of them sound impressive, comparing them head-to-head allowed us to identify the features that make certain portable wireless speakers stand out.If you‚Äôre looking primarily for a speaker that works with a voice assistant like Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri, check out our top picks for the best smart speakers. However, for those seeking a versatile portable Bluetooth speaker, we've put together a selection of top performers that cater to a wide range of use cases and preferences. Whether you're after powerful bass, long battery life or rugged design, our recommendations will help you find the best match for your needs. Table of contents Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher Factors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker Other portable Bluetooth speakers we tested Bluetooth speaker FAQs Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $50 to $200 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $200 to $450 Best portable Bluetooth speakers: $450 and higher Factors to consider in a portable Bluetooth speaker Weather-proofing IP ratings (Ingress Protection) are the alphanumeric indicators you often see in a product‚Äôs spec sheet that define water and dust resistance. It‚Äôs usually a combo of two numbers with the first indicating solid object ingress and the second being water. The former goes from 0 (no protection) to 6 (dustproof). The water-resistance rating goes from 0 (no protection) to 9 (protected against immersion and high pressure jets). When an X is used instead of a number, that means the product wasn‚Äôt tested for resistance. If it‚Äôs waterproof, it may have some innate resistance to solids, but there‚Äôs no guarantee. IP67 is a common rating these days indicating highly resistant and potentially rugged speakers suitable for outdoor adventures. These are safe for quick dunks in the pool or tub and should be more than OK in the rain or in the shower. They‚Äôre also good options for the beach, playground and other rough environs. Additionally, speakers with ports and a high rating will often include a tight-fitting cover over the charging or auxiliary ports. If you plan on using the ports, that may limit the product's rated ability to fend off the elements. When looking for the best portable Bluetooth speaker, consider the IP rating and also how you plan to use your Bluetooth speaker when making your decision. It may be worth splurging on a better sounding model with a lower IP rating if you‚Äôll mostly be using it indoors, for instance. Battery life The focus of this guide is on the best. portable Bluetooth speakers, and while ‚Äúportable‚Äù can be a relative term, these devices are generally for people who are likely to find themselves far from a power outlet. These days, around 12 hours of runtime seems to be the baseline but obviously, the more battery life you can get out of a speaker, the better. That said, be careful when looking at battery specs, as they frequently list a maximum runtime (‚Äúup to‚Äù x amount of hours). This usually means they tested at a low to mid volume. If you like your tunes loud, it can often end up cutting the expected usage time in half or more. Luckily, some manufacturers also list the expected hours of battery life when used at full volume and that transparency is appreciated. Bear in mind, however, that not all of the best portable Bluetooth speakers use the same charging port. Some support USB-C charging while others use micro-USB. Additionally, if your Bluetooth speaker also happens to have WiFi connectivity, they're usually designed for always-on functionality. Unlike normal Bluetooth speakers that go to sleep after a short period without use, these will usually stay awake (to listen for your commands) and slowly run down the battery. If you're out and about, you'll want to remember to turn these speakers off manually when not in use to maximize battery life. Range Bluetooth range is tricky business. Some companies list their product‚Äôs longest possible range, usually outdoors and in an unobstructed line-of-sight test environment. Other companies stick with a 30-foot range on the spec sheet and leave it at that, even though they may be running Bluetooth 4.x or 5.x. That‚Äôs likely underselling the speaker's potential, but unpredictable environments can affect range and there‚Äôs little point in promising the moon only to get complaints. I‚Äôve seen signal drop issues when crouching down, with my phone in the front pocket of my jeans, and barely 30 feet away from a speaker inside my apartment. I ran into this issue across several devices regardless of their listed Bluetooth connectivity range. If you‚Äôre hosting a patio party and duck inside, it‚Äôs wise to keep any wireless Bluetooth speakers relatively close by just in case. It‚Äôs hard to gauge what aspects of any environment may interfere with a Bluetooth signal. In general, take range specs around 100 feet or more as a perfect-world scenario. Latency This is a minor mention for those out there who use a speaker for their computer output, or as a mini soundbar solution for setups like a monitor and streaming box. It‚Äôs annoying to find that your speaker‚Äôs latency isn‚Äôt low enough to avoid lip sync issues. Luckily, it seems that most speakers these days don‚Äôt often have these problems. Only a handful of the few dozen speakers I tried had persistent, noticeable lip-sync issues. Aside from occasional blips, all of our picks worked well in this regard. If you plan to frequently use a speaker for video playback, look for devices with the most recent Bluetooth versions (4.x or 5.x) and lower latency codecs like aptX. Also make sure the speaker is close to the source device as distance can be a factor. To avoid the issue altogether, though, consider getting one with a wired auxiliary input. Other portable Bluetooth speakers we tested Sonos Roam While there's a lot to like about the Sonos Roam, there are plenty of other Bluetooth speakers with more features and better battery life. In our review, we gave the Roam a score of 87, praising it for its good sound quality, durable waterproof design and ability to work well within an existing Sonos speaker ecosystem. But the price is just fine at $180, and we found Bluetooth speakers that offer more at lower price points. Plus, the Roam taps out at 10 hours of battery life, and all of our top picks can run for longer than that on a single charge. Monoprice Soundstage3 The Monoprice Soundstage3 offers relatively big sound at a midrange $250 price, with a variety of inputs rarely found on a portable Bluetooth speaker. The boxy, minimalist design is no nonsense, even if it's more of a less-rugged, bookshelf-styled homebody. While the speaker puts out crisp highs alongside booming lows, we found the bass can overpower the rest of the output, so it's not for everyone. And after using the speaker for many months, we also found the low-slung, poorly labeled button panel along the top can be a bit annoying to use. If you want a speaker for road trips, favor mids and highs, and plan on using physical buttons for volume control and input selections, there are better options out there. JBL Boombox 3 Fans of JBL‚Äôs bluetooth speaker sound profile who want to crank up the volume, but also want a rugged and portable option, may enjoy the JBL Boombox 3. It‚Äôs a decent grab-and-go speaker with a very loud output, although it's not as good as some of the loud-speaker styled options for long-throw sound and big outdoor areas. However, the price for this speaker line remains prohibitively expensive compared to other options with big sound that cover a bit more ground. If the JBL brand is your thing and you like the rugged, portable form factor, we recommend looking for discounts, or shopping around and exploring the available options including the (less portable) JBL PartyBox series. Soundcore Motion X500 Soundcore speakers have generally been good and often reasonably priced. The Motion X500 loosely falls into that category. It has a tall, metallic lunchbox vibe with a fixed handle and pumps out a respectable 40 watts of crisp, clear sound for its size. It can get pretty loud and serves up a good dose of bass, although its primarily a front-facing speaker. There‚Äôs LDAC hi-res audio support for Android users, but the main selling point on this is spatial audio. This is done through an EQ change and the activation of a small, up-firing driver. There‚Äôs a slight benefit from this if you‚Äôre up close and directly in front of it, but it‚Äôs not a total game changer for your listening experience. The original pre-order price of $130 made it a decent option in terms of bang for your buck. But it went up to $170 at launch, making it less appealing even if it‚Äôs still a good middle-of-the-road option if you want small-ish, clear and loud. If you can find one on sale for the lower price, it‚Äôs definitely worth considering. There‚Äôs also the larger and louder X600 ($200) if the overall concept is working for you. Bluetooth speaker FAQs How does a Bluetooth speaker work? Bluetooth technology lets devices connect and exchange data over short distances using ultra high frequency (UHF) radio waves. It‚Äôs the frequency range that‚Äôs carved out for industrial, scientific and medical purposes, called the 2.4GHz ISM spectrum band. This range is available worldwide, making it easy for companies to use with devices for global markets. Bluetooth speakers include this tech, which lets them communicate with source devices like smartphones, tablets or computers in order to exchange data. The two devices pair by sharing a unique code and will work within the proscribed range for the device and Bluetooth version.¬† Ever since Bluetooth 4.0 was released over a decade ago, new iterations usually improve on range, use less power and offer expanded connectivity with features like multipoint (allowing more than one device to be connected at the same time, for instance). Who should buy a Portable Bluetooth speaker? If you want to play music while you‚Äôre out-and-about on something other than headphones, a portable Bluetooth speaker is probably what you want. There‚Äôs a broad range of devices for all types of circumstances. Many adventurous people will want a relatively lightweight portable that‚Äôs rugged enough to handle the elements while also packing enough charge to play for hours on end. Others may simply need a speaker they can move around the house or use in the backyard. In this case, you can choose larger less rugged models that may offer better sound.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/speakers/best-portable-bluetooth-speakers-133004551.html?src=rss",

    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/off-planet-dreams-is-a-delightfully-tricky-playdate-platformer-with-invisible-puzzles-230024431.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Off-Planet Dreams gives you everything you need to succeed, if you really want that. Help is just a few button-presses away at (almost) all times. Because of that, it feels uniquely accessible for what it is ‚Äî an ‚Äúinvisible puzzle platformer‚Äù designed to trip you up over and over again until you‚Äôve learned enough from your mistakes to move forward. Depending on how you approach it, Off-Planet Dreams is either a trial-and-error nightmare loop or a relatively easygoing platform adventure. Or something between the two. I died 274 times in my first playthrough, if that‚Äôs any indication of how challenging it can be. Off-Planet Dreams presents you (playing as a blob) with a grid and some floating doors, and says, essentially, ‚Äòokay, now find your way out.‚Äô There are platforms that form a path to each door, but all the platforms are invisible. This is where the game‚Äôs ‚Äúdifficulty is what you make of it‚Äù ethos comes in. You can commit to jumping into the abyss every time and hoping to land on a platform, memorizing each misstep so you know what not to do the next time around if you die, or you can choose one of the three available tools for some guidance. ‚ÄúPeek‚Äù will give you a quick glimpse of any platforms nearby, ‚ÄúPaint‚Äù will highlight any platform you‚Äôve stepped on, and ‚ÄúShow‚Äù will reveal all of the platforms in that room. Being stubborn, I was determined to get as far as I could without any help. But, I was humbled not too far in when I found myself trapped in Level 2-5 ‚Äî a level with multiple sublevels that‚Äôll repeatedly throw you back to its start if you go through the wrong doors. Here, I eventually caved and enabled ‚ÄúShow‚Äù just to give my brain some space to work out what the puzzle was without having to worry about remembering platforms. (When I finally figured it out, it wasn‚Äôt even that complicated. Sigh). After that point, I bounced between going unaided and using the ‚ÄúPaint‚Äù option as a little treat. The game throws a curveball at you about halfway through when it introduces a new mechanic that requires the crank, which I thought was really clever once I got over the initial frustration of not knowing what the hell was going on. And further on, Off-Planet Dreams undergoes a stylistic shift that transforms it into something else entirely than what it was at the beginning. The developers wrote in the description that Off-Planet Dreams is ‚Äúmore than a grid of dots,‚Äù and they weren‚Äôt kidding. I had a lot of fun with it. You can get it now on the Playdate Catalog for $6.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/off-planet-dreams-is-a-delightfully-tricky-playdate-platformer-with-invisible-puzzles-230024431.html?src=rss",

    "description": "It seems Apple has a slew of hardware announcements in store for us this fall. In the Power On newsletter this week, Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman reports that Apple is gearing up to announce new MacBook Pro models, the redesigned Mac mini, the M4 iMac and a new iPad mini before the end of the month, and is targeting a release date of November 1 for ‚Äúat least some‚Äù of these products. According to Gurman, we‚Äôre likely to see a low- and high-end 14-inch MacBook Pro, both packing the M4 chips. There will also be a 16-inch high-end MacBook Pro. As for the Mac mini, Gurman previously reported that the upcoming M4 Mac mini may be tiny compared to its predecessors, with a build roughly the size of an Apple TV box. The size reduction may also mean it drops the USB-A ports. Following the fall releases, Gurman predicts Apple will have a bunch of other products ready for early 2025, including a 13-inch and 15-inch M4 MacBook Air, along with a refreshed iPhone SE and iPad Air in both sizes.

Apple said last month that it was targeting October for the release of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1 ‚Äî which will bring some of the first Apple Intelligence features to iPhone 16 and other Apple devices ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt set a firm release date at the time. The first wave of Apple Intelligence features will include the text editor and summarization tool, Writing Tools, along with smart audio recording and transcriptions for Mail, Notes, Pages and other apps. We‚Äôll also likely see the new Memories feature in Photos, which is designed to be an easy-to-use editor for making movies with images from the gallery, and Clean Up, which can remove objects from the background of images.

    "description": "It's a safe bet that Bluetooth speakers will be on sale for October Prime Day, but you can already save on one of our favorites before the event arrives in a few days. The Marshall Emberton II has dropped to $100, which is 41 percent off and about $20 cheaper than the price it's been going for over the past few months. In our testing, we found it to be stylish and compact, and it provides balanced output and 360-degree sound. The first thing you‚Äôll notice about the Marshall Emberton II is its style, which draws on the company‚Äôs history and looks like a scaled-down Marshall amp. Front and center is its vintage-looking metal grille, with the company‚Äôs iconic logo prominently displayed. You can order the device in black and cream, both on sale for the same price. More than looks, though, the Emberton II has upgraded specs from the first-generation model that make it an even better value (especially at this sale price). It has a pair of 10-watt full-range drivers and passive radiators that deliver imposing sound for its size. It isn‚Äôt the most room-thumping speaker, with its tuning focusing more on a balanced sound signature than eardrum-blasting power. (But it‚Äôs still plenty loud for most uses.) Like its predecessor, it supports 360-degree sound for a multidirectional experience. If you buy a pair, you can stack them together wirelessly using Marshall‚Äôs companion app for more immersive listening. Even if you already own one, its $100 sale price could be an excellent opportunity to get a second and try linking them. The speaker lasts over 30 hours per charge and can recharge to full in three hours. It has an IP67 dust / water rating, meaning it‚Äôs rated for up to 30 minutes of immersion in a few feet of water. The Emberton II only weighs 118 g (4.2 oz).

    "description": "Three new theft protection features that Google announced earlier this year have reportedly started rolling out on Android. The tools ‚Äî Theft Detection Lock, Offline Device Lock and Remote Lock ‚Äî are aimed at giving users a way to quickly lock down their devices if they‚Äôve been swiped, so thieves can‚Äôt access any sensitive information.

    "description": "Despite the company‚Äôs recent decision to abide by the demands of the Brazilian Supreme Court, X still isn‚Äôt back online in Brazil ‚Äî and according to Reuters, that‚Äôs at least in part because it paid its fines to the wrong bank. After weeks being banned in Brazil, X in late September named a legal representative for the country as ordered, and took down accounts the court accused of spreading misinformation and hate speech. Its final hurdle was to pay off the fines that it had racked up, reportedly amounting to roughly $5 million. Citing Friday court filings, Reuters reports that X says it‚Äôs paid the fines and requested to have services restored. But, Justice Alexandre de Moraes said the funds went to the wrong bank, and the decision will have to wait until they‚Äôve been transferred. X maintains that it paid its fines correctly, according to Reuters. X has been banned in Brazil since the end of August. While the company initially resisted the court‚Äôs orders, it recently changed its tune and said it was working with the Brazilian government to get the platform back online in the country.

    "description": "People who visited Lego's website on the evening of October 4 were welcomed by a banner with illustrated golden coins bearing the company's logo, claiming that the \"Lego coin\" is now officially out. It even promised \"secret rewards\" to those who'd buy some. But Lego wasn't truly launching an official cryptocurrency coin, and according to The Brick Fan, the button to buy led to an external cryptocurrency website selling \"LEGO Tokens\" with Ethereum. The website was, seemingly, hijacked by bad actors who switched its banner and used it for some sort of crypto scam.¬† As users on the Lego subreddit have noted, the incident happened overnight for Lego's headquarters. The company responded relatively quickly, though, and removed the unauthorized banner and links. As of this writing, the Lego Fortnite collaboration banner is back up, and the \"buy now\" link leads to the collection. Lego told Engadget that no user accounts were compromised and that it has identified the cause of the issue. It also said that it was implementing measures to prevent anything similar from happening again in the future. However, the company has declined to share details about that \"cause\" or the measures it's implementing.¬† Here's the company's official statement: \"On 5 October 2024 (October 4 evening in the US), an unauthorised banner briefly appeared on LEGO.com. It was quickly removed, and the issue has been resolved. No user accounts have been compromised, and customers can continue shopping as usual. The cause has been identified and we are implementing measures to prevent this from happening again.\"This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/legos-website-was-hacked-to-promote-a-crypto-scam-140045757.html?src=rss",

    "description": "A few months ago, Google introduced a new way to search Gmail with the help of its Gemini AI. The feature, called Gmail Q\u0026A, lets you find specific emails and information by asking the Gemini chatbot questions. You can ask things like \"What time is our dinner reservation on Saturday?\" to quickly find the information you need. It was only initially available on Android devices, but now Google has started rolling it out to iPhones.¬† In addition to being able to ask questions, you can also use the feature to find unread emails from a specific sender simply by telling Gemini to \"Find unread emails by [the person's name].\" You can ask the chatbot to summarize a topic you know you can find in your inbox, such as work projects that you've been on for months consisting of multiple conversations across several threads. And you can even use Gemini in Gmail to do general search queries without having to leave your inbox. To access Gemini, simply tap on the star icon at the top right corner of your Gmail app.¬† Google says the feature could take up to 15 days to reach your devices. Take note, however, that you do need to have access to Gemini Business, Enterprise, Education, Education Premium or Google One AI Premium to be able to use it.¬†This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/gmails-gemini-powered-qa-feature-comes-to-ios-120015661.html?src=rss",

    "description": "The past week hasn‚Äôt been the kindest to the electric vehicle industry. Now, it‚Äôs capped off with news that the EV startup Fisker is the subject of an investigation from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). TechCrunch reported that SEC officials sent several subpoenas to Fisker. The filing doesn‚Äôt specifically say what the subpoenas are asking for or looking into but it‚Äôs clear that the SEC has launched an investigation into the floundering EV maker that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in June. Fisker has been struggling to keep its head above water ever since last year‚Äôs disastrous rollout of its Ocean SUV that failed to score more than a few thousands sellers even though it produced well over 10,000 units. Following its Q4 earnings report last year that saw a gross margin loss of 35 percent, the car maker announced it would lay off 15 percent of its workforce the following March as it shifted to a direct-to-consumer sales strategy. A Fisker spokesperson declined to comment on the matter to TechCrunch saying they could not ‚Äúcomment on the existence or nonexistence of a possible investigation.‚Äù Fisker isn‚Äôt the only EV maker to suffer a noticeable setback.

    "description": "Why is it so satisfying to toss, drop, throw and fling ragdoll characters down steps, out of windows and into oncoming traffic in games like Human Fall Flat? Ragdoll games just know how to scratch the lizard part of our brain that enjoys being the destructive force of mayhem while also meeting the moral center of our frontal lobe by not causing any real world harm (or felony charges). Now you‚Äôll be able to see the fruits of your destruction in a virtual environment as Human Fall Flat and its hapless, ham-handed hero head to the Meta Quest headsets and Steam VR on Halloween. Curve Games and No Brakes Games are also working on a version for the PSVR2 for a date yet to be announced. Human Fall Flat is a three-dimensional physics platformer that has you control a floppy, ragdoll human named Bob. Just like the other games, you‚Äôll see Bob in a third-person perspective as you use his sinewy limbs to guide him through a series of bizarre obstacles like a train that somehow derailed through the top floor of a Victorian style mansion, a dysfunctional power plant in dire need of a OSHA review and the inevitable ice world level. Owners of a Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3 or Meta Quest 3S headset can pre-order the game now on the Quest App Store for the discounted price of $9.99. The Steam port doesn‚Äôt have a price yet but you can add it to your wishlist.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ar-vr/soon-youll-be-able-to-fling-around-the-klutzy-schlub-in-human-fall-flat-on-vr-212033104.html?src=rss",

    "description": "X has lost a legal fight in Australia in which the company tried to avoid a $400,000 fine by claiming that Twitter no longer exists. The creative legal argument, first spotted by ArsTechnica, came amid a more than year-long dispute with Australia‚Äôs eSafety Commission. The commission had asked the company, then known as Twitter, to provide details about its handling of child sexual exploitation on the platform last February. In its response, X failed to answer a number of questions and left ‚Äúsome sections entirely blank,‚Äù the commission said in a statement last year. As a result, the eSafety Commission slapped the company with a more than $415,000 fine for non-compliance. It was an attempt to fight that fine that led to X‚Äôs claim that it shouldn‚Äôt be responsible since Twitter had ‚Äúceased to exist.‚Äù From the court filing: X Corp submitted that, on and from 15 March 2023, Twitter Inc ceased to be a person, and therefore ceased to be a provider of a social media service. It was submitted that Twitter Inc therefore lacked capacity to comply with the notice, and that X Corp was not obliged to prepare any report in Twitter Inc‚Äôs place, as X Corp was not the same person as the provider to whom the notice was issued. The argument isn‚Äôt exactly new for the Elon Musk-owned entity. CEO Linda Yaccarino has also repeatedly claimed that X is a ‚Äúbrand new company‚Äù in a bid to avoid scrutiny. She repeated the line multiple times earlier this year while testifying at a Senate hearing on child safety issues. Australia federal Judge Michael Wheelahan, however, found the claim unconvincing, saying that X‚Äôs argument required ‚Äúleaps in logic that were not supported by adequate explanation.‚Äù X didn‚Äôt immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, eSafety Commissioner Inman Grant cheered the decision. ‚ÄúHad X Corp‚Äôs argument been accepted by the Court it could have set the concerning precedent that a foreign company‚Äôs merger with another foreign company might enable it to avoid regulatory obligations in Australia,‚Äù Grant said.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/x-lost-a-court-battle-after-trying-to-claim-twitter-ceased-to-exist-203030765.html?src=rss",

Executive Vice President Sally Hyesoon Jeong made the announcement at the company‚Äôs 2024 developer conference (via 9to5Google). The One UI branding was previously exclusive to its Galaxy phones, tablets and wearables. ‚ÄúOne UI now goes beyond mobile as the software experience for all Samsung consumer devices,‚Äù Hyesoon Jeong said onstage at the San Jose keynote. It‚Äôs part of the company‚Äôs aim for more cohesive branding across its consumer ecosystem, especially as its AI approach evolves. Samsung Samsung also teased that its next software user experience, One UI 7, will arrive with the 2025 batch of Galaxy S phones. ‚ÄúOne UI 7 will bring a fresh, new look to the entire interface,‚Äù Hyesoon Jeong said at the conference. She laid out three goals for the upcoming software: simple (with a purpose), impactful (leaving a ‚Äúsignature impression‚Äù), and emotive design that elicits a human reaction from the user. The Samsung VP says the One UI 7 home screen grid represents the more focused design principles. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sleeker and easier to use, giving you a neat home screen no matter which Galaxy device you‚Äôre using,‚Äù said Hyesoon Jeong. Although you‚Äôll have to wait until early next year for One UI 7, the company said a developer beta will be available to test-drive by the end of this year.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/samsungs-one-ui-now-covers-all-of-its-consumer-devices-including-tvs-and-appliances-201850799.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Once again, the European Union has issued a ruling preventing Meta from going too crazy with user information. The top court in the EU ruled that limits must be put in place for how long Meta and other social media networks can use people‚Äôs information for ad targeting strategies. TechCrunch reported that the EU‚Äôs highest court sided with an earlier opinion published in April by a court adviser. The previous ruling also urged for limits on the amount of time companies could retain customers‚Äô personal data for the purpose of targeting advertising. The rulings referred its retention guidelines to the bloc‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) established by the EU in 2018. Recital 65 of the GDPR establishes a person‚Äôs ‚Äúright to be forgotten‚Äù and the right to rectification and erasure of personal data. Failure to comply with the GDPR could result in a 4 percent global annual turnover penalty, a number that could reach into the billions for a social media mega-corporation like Meta. Last year, Meta had to pay a $414 million fine (or approximately ‚Ç¨390 million) for illegally requiring users of its social media outlets like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp to accept personalized ads. The EU and Meta along with other big tech companies like Apple and Google have tangled over the use of personal data in relation to the Digital Markets Act. Meta is currently awaiting a fine ruling for violating the EU‚Äôs Digital Markets Act when it required users to pay to prohibit the company from collecting and sharing their personal data. Last year, the EU‚Äôs Court of Justice ruled that Meta needed to obtain consent before delivering personal ads to users in the region.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/eu-court-rules-social-networks-cant-use-personal-data-forever-193013206.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Amazon Prime Day is right around the corner, so the deals are already coming in hot. For instance, the Oura Ring is up to $100 off. The discount depends on which design you go for. The Stealth Horizon design is $350 in all sizes, while many standard colors are $300. The gold option, however, jumps up to $450. The prices also fluctuate depending on if you choose the rounded Horizon design or the more blocky Heritage design.¬† For the uninitiated, the Oura Ring is a smart wearable that tracks activity, sleep and more. The main benefit of choosing a smart ring over another type of fitness tracker is portability. It‚Äôs a lightweight ring, so after a few days you forget it‚Äôs even on. We called the Oura Ring the ‚Äúperfect wearable for people who don't like wearables‚Äù in our official review. It even made our list of the best sleep apps and gadgets. The device monitors over 20 biometric signals and is particularly precise when reading a pulse. The Oura Ring is also compatible with most of the most popular fitness-tracking apps, like Apple Health, Strava and Google Health Connect. Many of the designs are quite fetching and allow the device to easily pass as a regular non-techy ring. On the downside, a bunch of the ring‚Äôs features are locked behind a subscription paywall. You get a month free with the initial purchase, but after that it‚Äôll cost $6 per month. It‚Äôs also worth noting that this deal is for the third-gen Oura Ring. The fourth-gen device officially releases on October 15 and it‚Äôs smaller, with more tracking capabilities.

    "description": "October Prime Day will be here in a few days, but you can already save on some tech, including a few of Amazon's own devices. Its most powerful streaming stick, the Fire TV Stick 4K Max, has dropped to a record low of $35. That represents a 42-percent discount, and it's a return to the same sale price we saw during July Prime Day. Notably, it's just one of many Fire TV devices that have been discounted ahead of the sale event. But the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is a great streaming device as well, with support for Dolby Vision and HDR10+. As the name suggests, it can stream content in 4K Ultra HD. The stick also supports Dolby Atmos audio, for added immersion. This streaming stick includes the company‚Äôs proprietary Fire TV Ambient Experience, which allows users to display art and photos on the screen. This mimics the functionality of something like Samsung‚Äôs The Frame TV. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max also boasts 16GB of storage, for downloads, apps and games. Speaking of games, this thing doubles as a highly functional cloud gaming box. It can stream Xbox games via Game Pass Ultimate and integrates with Amazon Luna. We singled out this device as a great option for retro gamers, as it can easily run many emulation apps. Finally, it ships with an upgraded remote that offers Alexa integration. While the Fire TV Stick 4K Max is arguably Amazon's best streaming dongle for most people that's on sale right now, the rest of the Fire TV device lineup is on sale, too. Fire TV Stick Lite streamer for $18 ($12 off): This is already the most affordable Fire TV streaming stick, but it‚Äôs a steal at this sale price. It supports 1080p content and comes with a ‚Äúlite‚Äù version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Fire TV Stick streamer for $20 ($20 off): This dongle ups the ante on the TV Stick Lite by adding support for Dolby Atmos audio, plus it comes with the regular version of the Alexa Voice Remote. It also supports Wi-Fi 5 and comes with 8GB of internal storage. Fire TV Stick 4K streamer for $25 ($25 off): This mode is the cheapest Fire TV Stick you can get to stream 4K content, plus it has support for Wi-Fi 6 and Dolby Vision and Atmos. With its live picture-in-picture feature, you can view security camera feeds right on your TV while you‚Äôre watching your favorite show or movie. Fire TV Cube set-top box for $100 ($40 off): This model will provide the best performance of any Fire TV streaming device, and it supports 4K HDR content, Dolby Vision and Atmos and an enhanced version of the Alexa Voice Remote. Along with live picture-in-picture view and the Fire TV ambient experience, you can also hardware other devices to the Fire TV Cube including a cable box or a game console.

    "description": "There‚Äôs a new fix available for certain iPhones and iPads that addresses issues with recording and password security. Apple released two new patches including iOS 18.0.1 for iPhones and iPadOS 18.0.1, according to the support website. The update also finally allows users with an M4-powered iPad to upgrade to iOS 18, after the initial version was pulled for bricking users‚Äô devices. The patch fixes recording issues with all of the iPhone 16 models in the Messages app. The iPhone‚Äôs microphone would accidentally start recording a few seconds before becoming activated with the orange microphone icon. The password patch fixes an issue in which the VoiceOver function may read a saved password aloud. The patch works for iPhone XS and later as well as iPad Pro 13-inch, iPad Pro 12.9-inch (third generation and later), iPad Pro 11-inch (first generation and later), iPad Air (third generation and later), iPad (seventh generation and later) and iPad mini (fifth generation and later). If you own one of these devices, you can download the new patches by going to the Software Updates tab in the General section of your Settings app.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/new-ios-update-fixes-microphone-and-password-problems-173339119.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Samsung has confirmed that an update to its SmartThings app caused major issues for older Samsung Galaxy smartphones. 9to5Google first reported that the update, which rolled out from Samsung over the past few days, bricked devices from the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10 series of phones. The publication also found some users reporting the same issue with Galaxy M51 and A90 models. After downloading the update, the devices reportedly got stuck in a bootloop and never fully turn back on. Impacted devices can perform a factory reset to recover functionality, but that's not a perfect fix. It should make the phone usable, but any data that hasn't already been backed up will be lost.¬† In a statement sent to Engadget Friday, a spokesperson confirmed the issue: \"We are aware that a limited number of Galaxy smartphones running on Android 12 are rebooting continuously during an update to the latest version of the SmartThings app,\" the spokesperson told Engadget. \"Upon discovery, we immediately suspended the update and are working to resolve the issue. Affected customers can contact the Samsung Contact Center to receive support for their devices.‚Äù Software support for older models can become an issue for any hardware manufacturer. The Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ are five years old now, which is an age where companies may stop providing regular updates.

    "description": "At this point, you probably either love the idea of making realistic videos with generative AI, or you think it's a morally bankrupt endeavor that devalues artists and will usher in a disastrous era of deepfakes we'll never escape from. It's hard to find middle ground. Meta isn't going to change minds with Movie Gen, its latest video creation AI model, but no matter what you think of AI media creation, it could end up being a significant milestone for the industry. Movie Gen can produce realistic videos alongside music and sound effects at 16 fps or 24 fps at up to 1080p (upscaled from 768 by 768 pixels). It can also generative personalized videos if you upload a photo, and crucially, it appears to be easy to edit videos using simple text commands. Notably, it can also edit normal, non-AI videos with text. It's easy to imagine how that could be useful for cleaning up something you've shot on your phone for Instagram. Movie Gen is just purely research at the moment ‚ÄîMeta won't be releasing it to the public, so we have a bit of time to think about what it all means. The company describes Movie Gen as its \"third wave\" of generative AI research, following its initial media creation tools like Make-A-Scene, as well as more recent offerings using its Llama AI model. It's powered by a 30 billion parameter transformer model that can make 16 second-long 16 fps videos, or 10-second long 24 fps footage. It also has a 13 billion parameter audio model that can make 45 seconds of 48kHz of content like \"ambient sound, sound effects (Foley), and instrumental background music\" synchronized to video. There's no synchronized voice support yet \"due to our design choices,\" the Movie Gen team wrote in their research paper. Meta Meta says Movie Gen was initially trained on \"a combination of licensed and publicly available datasets,\" including around 100 million videos, a billion images and a million hours of audio. The company's language is a bit fuzzy when it comes to sourcing ‚Äî Meta has already admitted to training its AI models on data from every Australian user's account, it's even less clear what the company is using outside of its own products. As for the actual videos, Movie Gen certainly looks impressive at first glance. Meta says that in its own A/B testing, people have generally preferred its results compared to OpenAI's Sora and Runway's Gen3 model. Movie Gen's AI humans look surprisingly realistic, without many of the gross telltale signs of AI video (disturbing eyes and fingers, in particular).¬† Meta \"While there are many exciting use cases for these foundation models, it‚Äôs important to note that generative AI isn‚Äôt a replacement for the work of artists and animators,\" the Movie Gen team wrote in a blog post. \"We‚Äôre sharing this research because we believe in the power of this technology to help people express themselves in new ways and to provide opportunities to people who might not otherwise have them.\" It's still unclear what mainstream users will do with generative AI video, though. Are we going to fill our feeds with AI video, instead of taking our own photos and videos? Or will Movie Gen be deconstructed into individual tools that can help sharpen our own content? We can already easily remove objects from the backgrounds of photos on smartphones and computers, more sophisticated AI video editing seems like the next logical step.¬† This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/metas-movie-gen-looks-like-a-huge-leap-forward-for-ai-video-but-you-cant-use-it-yet-165717605.html?src=rss",

    "description": "OpenAI has debuted a new workspace interface for ChatGPT called Canvas. The AI giant unveiled its new ChatGPT workspace on its official blog and immediately made it available for ChatGPT Plus and Team users. Enterprise and Edu users will be able to access Canvas sometime next week. Canvas is a virtual interface space for writing and coding projects that allows users to consult with ChatGPT on certain portions of a project. A separate window opens besides the main chat space and users can put writing or code on this new ‚Äúcanvas‚Äù and highlight sections to have the model focus on and edit ‚Äúlike a copy editor or code reviewer,‚Äù according to the blog. Canvas can either be opened manually by typing ‚Äúuse canvas‚Äù in your prompt. Canvas can also automatically open when it ‚Äúdetects a scenario in which it could be helpful,‚Äù according to the blog post. There are also several shortcuts that can be used for writing and coding projects. For writing projects, users can ask ChatGPT for suggested edits or length adjustments, or ask it to change the reading level of a block of text, from graduate school level down to kindergarten. It can also add \"relevant emojis for emphasis and color.\" Coders can have ChatGPT review their code and add inline suggestions for improvements. It can also mark up your work with logs and comments to aid in debugging and make understanding your code easier. It's also capable of fixing bugs and port coding to a different language such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Java, C++ or PHP in Canvas mode. OpenAI‚Äôs Canvas feature brings ChatGPT in line with other AI assistants that have separate workspaces to focus on certain areas of a project like Anthropic's Artifacts and the coding focused AI model Cursor. Update, October 4, 12:55PM ET: This story was edited after publishing to include more context on the code and text functionality of the Canvas feature.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/openai-rolls-out-canvas-its-newest-chatgpt-interface-230335185.html?src=rss",

    "description": "We are just a few days from the official kickoff of Amazon Prime Day, but the deals have already been filling up our inbox. This one‚Äôs a doozy. Amazon‚Äôs well-reviewed Echo Buds earbuds are on sale for $25, which is half off and a record low price. Amazon‚Äôs Echo Buds actually made our list of the best budget wireless earbuds, and that was at the full $50 price. We appreciated the lightweight form factor and the pocket-friendly case, both of which contributed to enhanced portability. There‚Äôs also multi-device connectivity and automatic wear detection. This is an open design, which some people prefer and some hate. Basically, an open earbud design allows for more ambient noise from the world around you. This can be annoying, as it could get in the way of what you‚Äôre listening to, but it could also keep you safe while aimlessly wandering a busy city. You‚Äôll be able to hear if a car is careening toward you. The sound is actually great for budget-friendly earbuds, though it takes a bit of EQ adjusting to get everything perfect. On the downside, the battery life is on the lower side and the water resistance is bare-bones at best. Still, we recommended these earbuds at $50 so we absolutely recommend them at $25.

    "title": "Facebook is pushing 'local' content and events to try to win back young adults",

    "description": "Meta has spent the last few years saying that ‚Äúyoung adults‚Äù are crucial to the future of Facebook. Now, the company is introducing a number of changes to its 20-year-old social network in an effort to get younger users to spend more time in the app. The updates include a new ‚Äúlocal‚Äù section in the Facebook app that aims to surface information relevant to your local community, a renewed focus on events planned on the service and a new ‚ÄúCommunities‚Äù feature for Messenger. The changes, Meta claims, will help young adults ‚Äúexplore their interests and connect with the world beyond their close friends.‚Äù Emphasizing events isn‚Äôt an entirely new strategy for the company. It launched a standalone events app in 2016 and then rebranded it a year later to focus on ‚Äúlocal‚Äù businesses and happenings. It quietly killed the app in 2021. Meta is taking a slightly different approach this time. The new ‚Äúlocal‚Äù section will surface Marketplace listings, Reels and posts from Facebook groups alongside event listings from your community. Local news, which Meta has also previously boosted, is notably absent Meta‚Äôs announcement. In addition to the local tab, the company is also trying to make events more prominent in Facebook. Facebook will now provide personalized event recommendations in the form of a weekly and weekend digest that will be pushed to users via in-app notifications. The company is also changing how invitations to Facebook events work so users can send invites to their connections on Instagram and via SMS and email. Groups on Facebook, which Meta has said is among the most-used features by young adults, is also getting attention in this update. Meta is experimenting with a ‚Äúa customizable Group AI‚Äù that allows admins to create a bot that can chat with members to answer questions based on posts that have been shared in the group. Elsewhere in the app, Meta is starting to test an Instagram-like Explore section and a dedicated space for Reels inside of Facebook. On Messenger, Meta is adding a new ‚ÄúCommunities‚Äù feature, a concept it previously introduced on WhatsApp. Communities allows ‚Äúsmall to medium-sized‚Äù groups to organize their conversations and interact in a way that‚Äôs more like a Facebook group. Members can create topic-based chats and there are built in moderation and admin tools for controlling who can join. The changes are part of a broader effort by Meta to bring younger people back to its app with features tailored around how they use social media. ‚ÄúFacebook is still for everyone, but in order to build for the next generation of social media consumers, we‚Äôve made significant changes with young adults in mind,‚Äù the Facebook app‚Äôs head, Tom Alison, wrote in May. Whether Meta‚Äôs latest efforts will be successful, though, is unclear. The company says there are more than 40 million young adults on Facebook in the US and Canada, a number that‚Äôs ‚Äúthe highest it‚Äôs been in more than 3 years.‚Äù But that‚Äôs still a relatively small percentage of its total users in the region and an even tinier slice of its users overall.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-is-pushing-local-content-and-events-to-try-to-win-back-young-adults-161742961.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Finding myself far from an outlet when my phone hits five percent makes me feel shaky. Luckily, part of my job is testing portable batteries so I usually have at least a few on hand. (The only hard part is remembering to bring one along.) I‚Äôve spent the past year and a half testing more than two dozen units to figure out which are the best power banks for different scenarios ‚Äî from a partial recharge for an iPhone to a massive laptop battery for working out in the field. People who travel or are simply forgetful will appreciate the benefit of having a little extra juice on hand, but as I‚Äôve learned from my tests, they aren‚Äôt all winners. Here are the best power banks for just about every scenario.¬† Table of contents Best power banks for 2024 How we test best power banks What to look for in a portable battery pack Other power banks we tested Best power banks for 2024 What to look for in a portable battery pack Battery type Nearly every rechargeable power bank you can buy (and most portable devices) contain a lithium-ion battery. These beat other current battery types in terms of size-to-charge capacity, and have even increased in energy density by eight fold in the past 14 years. They also don‚Äôt suffer from a memory effect (where a battery's lifespan deteriorates due to partial charges). One drawback you may have heard is the possibility of lithium ion batteries catching fire. To limit the danger, battery packs require internal mechanisms to limit things like voltage and pressure. While you should still make sure a battery isn‚Äôt exposed to unnecessary stress like excessive heat, damage from drops or operating in freezing weather, battery packs are considered safe enough to bring on an airplane. According to the TSA, external batteries rated at 100Wh or less (which all of our recommendations are) can fly with you ‚Äì just make sure you stash them in your carryon as they aren‚Äôt allowed in checked baggage. Capacity Power bank manufacturers almost always list a battery‚Äôs capacity in milliamp hours, or mAh. Smaller batteries, say those that can charge a smartphone to between 50 and 75 percent, tend to have a 5,000mAh capacity. Larger batteries that can recharge laptops and tablets, or give phones multiple charges, can exceed 25,000mAh and we have a separate guide that covers that entire category.¬† Unsurprisingly, the prices on most batteries goes up as mAh capacity increases, and since batteries are physical storage units, size and weight go up with capacity as well. If you want more power, be prepared to spend more and carry around a heavier brick. You might think that a 10,000mAh power bank could charge a 5,000mAh phone to 100 percent twice, but that‚Äôs not the case. In addition to simple energy loss through heat dissipation, factors like voltage conversion also bring down the amount of juice that makes it into your phone. Most manufacturers list how many charges a battery can give a certain smartphone. In our tests, 10,000mAh of battery pack capacity translated to roughly 5,800mAh of device charge. 20,000mAh chargers delivered around 11,250mAh to a device, and 25,000mAh banks translated to about 16,200mAh of charge. That‚Äôs an average efficiency rate of around 60 percent. Wireless More manufacturers are making power banks with wireless charging. Not hassling with cables is nice, but it‚Äôs important to note that wireless charging is less efficient than plugging in your phone. Outside of MagSafe options, wireless portable chargers historically didn‚Äôt make the cut for our top picks for this guide for that reason. The Qi2 wireless charging standard arrived last year and improves performance for wireless charging, including for portable banks. Currently, iPhones are the only handsets that support the new tech, but as it‚Äôs an open standard, expect Google, Samsung and others to adopt it for future phones. In my testing, I‚Äôve noticed an uptick in the performance of non-Qi2-enabled batteries as well, so you'll now see wireless options on this list. Ports Since Apple ditched the Lightning cable and adopted USB-C, we‚Äôre getting closer to a standard for charging connections ‚Äî and all of our picks have at least one such port. But plenty of other devices use older interfaces, like USB-A and microUSB ports, plus Lightning for older iPhones. You can find cables with just about any combination of those connections, so when you‚Äôre picking out a battery, just check that one end of your preferred cord will fit. Most battery packs have more than one port, which gives you different charging options. You‚Äôll typically see at least one port labeled ‚Äúin/out,‚Äù which means you can use it to both charge the bank and charge your device. While USB-A output ports can power up smartphones and other small devices, they can‚Äôt charge larger devices. Plus, they aren‚Äôt as fast as USB-C ports overall. That‚Äôs something to keep in mind when you‚Äôre deciding which ports and charging cables to use to connect your phone to the pack. There‚Äôs even more variation among USB-C ports themselves, with different ports on the same device supporting different power transfer rates. What that means in practical terms is an iPhone will charge just fine plugged into a power bank‚Äôs 18W port. But to properly charge, say, a MacBook or similar laptop, it‚Äôll need the extra juice supplied by a 100W port (which larger power banks can offer). Power banks with more than one port can also charge multiple devices at the same time, but speeds and the overall charge delivered will be lower. You‚Äôll also want to consider your charging cable. For anything larger than a smartphone (and to access fast-charging capabilities) you‚Äôll want to use USB-C ports and cables. But not all cables are created equal, even when they have the same USB-C plugs on the end. If you want power delivery from a 100W USB-C power bank port, you‚Äôll need a 100W-rated USB-C cable. Luckily, power banks capable of delivering 100W tend to include a compatible cable. For any devices that don‚Äôt, we‚Äôve tried and liked Anker‚Äôs 100W USB-C cable. For smaller devices, we used this 60W cable from Nimble and we don‚Äôt recommend bothering with cables under 60W. For around $20, higher-capacity charging cables will make sure you‚Äôre not wasting time with connections that limit your potential power transfer. Design For the most part, these rechargeable batteries have a squared-off, brick-like design, though many nod towards aesthetics with attractive finishes and detailing. While that doesn‚Äôt affect how they perform, it‚Äôs a consideration for something you‚Äôll interact with regularly. Some portable power stations include extra features like MagSafe compatibility, a built-in wall plug or even a kickstand. Nearly all have some sort of indicator to let you know how much available charge your power bank has left, usually expressed with lighted pips near the power button. Some of the newer banks take that a step further with an LED display indicating remaining battery percentage. How we test best power banks Before we even put our hands on a battery pack, we did extensive research. We considered brands Engadget reviewers and staff have tried over the years and we checked out customer ratings on retail sites like Amazon and Best Buy. Then we get our hanHere‚Äôs the full list of power banks we've tested, which range from small wireless banks to large, multi-device batteries. Amy Skorheim for Engadget MagSafe-compatible Apple MagSafe Battery Pack (5,000 mAh) Spigen ArcHybrid Mag (5,000mAh) Anker 521 Magnetic Battery (5,000 mAh) Mophie snap+ PowerstationMmini (5,000mAh) Baseus Magnetic (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (6.6K) (6,600 mAh) Anker 633 Magnetic Battery (10,000mAh) Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K) (10,000 mAh) UGREEN 10,000mAh Magnetic (10,000mAh) Low capacity (‚â§10,000mAh) Mophie Juice Pack (2,400mAh) Anker 511 Power Bank (5,000 mAh) Anker 313 Power Bank (10,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Biolite Charge 40 PD (10,000mAh) Anker Nano (5,000mAh) Nimble Champ (10,000mAh) Satechi Quatro Wireless bank (10,000mAh) Anker 10K Fusion power bank (10,000mAh) Mid capacity (10,001 - 20,000mAh) Baseus Blade 2 (12,000 mAh) Otterbox Fast Charge (15,000mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro (20,000mAh) Anker Prime (20,000mAh) Nestout Portable Charger (15,000mAh) Nimble Champ Pro (20,000mAh) High capacity (20,001mAh+) Mophie Powerstation Pro XL (25,000mAh) UGREEN Power Bank 25,000mAh 145W (25,000mAh) Anker 737 Power Bank (25,600 mAh) Zendure Supertank Pro (26,800mAh) Mophie Powerstation Pro AC (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Eclipse Mag (27,000mAh) Lion Energy Trek (27,000mAh) HyperJuice 245W (27 Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (27,650mAh) We're continuously updating this guide as companies release new products and we test them. We remove some products as we find picks that are more worthy of the best portable charger designation. We also add updated specs and prices where necessary.¬† For testing, I used each battery with some combination of an iPhone 15, an iPhone 14 Plus, an iPhone 11, a Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra, a Galaxy S23 Ultra, a 5th-gen iPad Air and an M1 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro. I charged one phone battery at a time, even though some packs are capable of multiple-device charging. I charged the phones and tablets from between zero and five percent until they were 100 percent full (or until the power bank was dead), and didn‚Äôt use the phones or tablets while they charged other than to power them on and enter the unlock code. In the case of the MacBook, I used it while it was charging (it‚Äôs my work computer). I used the charging cable included with each power bank to charge the Galaxy S22 Ultra, MacBook Pro and the iPad Air. For the iPhones, I used the USB-C to Lighting cable that Apple provides. In the case of the lower-capacity power banks that didn‚Äôt include a cord or included one with USB-C to USB-A connectors, I used this 60W-rated USB-C to USB-C cable. For reference, here are the battery capacities of each device we used for testing: iPhone 11: 3,110 mAh iPhone 14 Plus: 4,325 mAh iPhone 15: 3,349 mAh Galaxy S22 Ultra: 4,855mAh iPad Air: 7,729mAh 16-inch M1 Pro MacBook Pro: 27,027mAh I noted the times for each charge and the number of charges each bank provided. I also paid attention to things like ease of use and overall design. Other power banks we tested Baseus Blade 2 The Blade 2 from Baseus has a unique, flat shape that‚Äôs just a little wider than an ereader ‚Äî which may make it easier to slip into a low profile laptop bag. It charged a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra considerably faster than any other battery bank we tried, getting it from four percent to full in just over an hour. It then filled the phone back to 62 percent from dead on a second charge in about a half an hour. But $100 is a lot for a standard power bank that holds fewer than two full charges. But if you can find the Blade 2 on sale, snap it up. Anker MagGo (6.6K) Anker‚Äôs 6.6k MagGo is pretty similar to our top pick for a MagSafe-compatible battery pack. It supports the Qi2 charging standard and props up your iPhone so you can use it or enable StandBy mode while powering up. This one even lets you set the viewing angle from 30 to 65 degrees. It was speedy in getting an iPhone 15 up to 50 percent in about 40 minutes. But for the added bulk, it doesn‚Äôt have as much capacity as the 10K MagGo, holding just enough juice for a single full charge plus about 5 percent. But it is $20 cheaper, which may be key for some. Mophie Snap+ Powerstation Mini The Mophie snap+ Powerstation Mini is terribly well-built. It feels premium with a rubberized contact point for the MagSafe charging pad and a stand that runs the entire width of the bank itself, making it extra sturdy. It‚Äôs compact, too, but only carries a 5,000mAh capacity, which gets you a partial charge on most newer or larger phones. Our current MagSafe/iPhone pick has double the capacity, a stand and a digital display ‚Äî for just $20 more than the Powerstation Mini. Portable charger FAQs What's the difference between a portable power bank and a portable charger? A slew of terms are used to describe power banks, including portable batteries, portable chargers, external battery packs and even, somewhat confusingly, USB chargers, which is what wall chargers are often called. They all mean the same thing: a lithium ion battery that stores a charge so you can refill a smartphone, tablet, earbuds, console controller, ereader, laptop, or just about any other device with its own built-in, rechargeable battery.¬† There‚Äôs little difference between the terms, so the specs you‚Äôll want to pay attention to are capacity (expressed in mAh), size and weight so you can find the right balance between recharging what you need and portability. Power stations, on the other hand, are distinct. These are bigger units (often around the size of a car battery) that can be used to charge multiple devices multiple times, but notably, they can‚Äôt be taken on airplanes.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-power-bank-143048526.html?src=rss",

    "title": "Vessel of Hatred is the latest reason to start playing Diablo IV again",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vessel-of-hatred-is-the-latest-reason-to-start-playing-diablo-iv-again-160036459.html?src=rss",
    "description": "Ten years ago, the Reaper of Souls expansion completely reimagined and revived Diablo III. It overhauled huge swaths of the game, strengthening its foundation enough that D3 remained a fun time even as it stretched far past what should have been its expiration date. Diablo IV has moved at a different pace. It managed to get through launch without the technical mishaps that plagued its predecessor, but it was still a game that landed somewhere short of its full potential on arrival. Our review felt that, and I felt it in my own playthrough. Once I finished the campaign and started the grinding loop, I quickly got bored and abandoned my character. But ahead of its first major expansion, Vessel of Hatred, Diablo IV is not the same as it was at launch. I've spent some time with the new content in Vessel of Hatred and while I'll cover what the region of Nahantu brings to the table, I'm also taking this chance to take a broader look at the state of Diablo IV. Vessel of Hatred adds companionship and customization Vessel of Hatred introduces a new region, Nahantu, and a new class, Spiritborn. Nahantu is a jungle biome with lush greenery in some spaces and complete devastation in others. Basically, it‚Äôs your standard Diablo IV location. It also has several points of interest for the lore nerds out there. Blizzard Entertainment Spiritborn is a completely new class in the Diablo universe and it's a great addition. This is a close-range fighter with skills inspired by four Spirit Guardians: The gorilla abilities center defense and heavy hits, the jaguar delivers tempo-driven fire attacks, the eagle deals lightning damage via feathers, and the centipede is all about poison powers. Yes, centipede. It doesn't sound like a fearsome creature, but trust me, those poison attacks are rad. The biggest thrill spawns from the ultimate abilities, where the actual Spirit Guardian appears to fight on your behalf. Having a spectral gorilla smash down and crush enemies is deeply satisfying in a way I didn't know I needed. In my run of D4, I've put the most hours into playing a Necromancer and a Sorcerer. They're both loads of fun, but they feel at their strongest when they're completely focused on one element or damage type. I'm not enamored of needing to completely redo my talent tree and paragon boards every time I encounter a unique item, so I appreciate that a Spiritborn really can pick and choose skills from across the four Guardians. That's something Blizzard devs spoke about in a livestream about the class design, and I'm pleased to report that the class-specific Spirit Hall makes it easy to get benefits from legendary and unique item powers without overhauling your entire rotation. That's not to say optimal builds won't emerge over time, but flexibility is a real win in the Spiritborn kit. My other favorite addition in Vessel of Hatred is the Den, a quartet of mercenaries that can join you on your quests. For solo players, they act like the companions in Diablo III ‚Äî you can pick one to follow you around and join your battles. Each has a miniature skill tree that you can customize to best match your own playstyle. A secondary mechanic, Reinforcement, allows you to access followers‚Äô abilities even if you don‚Äôt or can't have one equipped. Reinforcement allows you to pick a single ability from a single merc and set when you want them to use it. Their skills can map directly to when you use your own powers, or to more battle-specific conditions such as your character being injured or crowd controlled. My favorite combo started with me casting an eagle spell to yoink enemies into a clump, then my archer buddy would show up and fire off an incendiary grenade to scorch them all. But the combinations are pretty endless and easy to switch up on a whim. The Den isn't a deep game system and heavy-duty players probably won't take long to max out all four companions. However, it offers yet another opportunity to customize your playthrough, and that's where I think a Diablo game shines. Even though I used a default Spiritborn model, named her Test and never bothered to transmog gear, it still didn't take long for me to start feeling attached to the character. This was my Spiritborn, my journey to save the world with my set of allies. Sanctuary is a bleak place. Even when I play D4 with other people, the oppressive grimness of the settings and situations creates a feeling of \"us against the world.\" Maybe a few NPCs will be useful from time to time, but most of them are either going to betray us or lie to us or die on us. But for once, even while facing the most unbeatable foes, Vessel of Hatred made me feel connected. It's in the expansion‚Äôs basic premise, that Neyrelle has chosen to shoulder an impossible burden for you and is going to try her damnedest to survive and succeed. It's in the presence of the Den, where someone always has your back in battle. It's in the refrain of your guide, Eru: Help is needed, so help is offered. It's in the new Dark Citadel end-game dungeon, which you literally can't complete without at least one other person. Even if you play Vessel of Hatred solo, you never feel alone. Blizzard Entertainment There are other notable features arriving with Vessel of Hatred, and you'll notice the stat crunch and new difficulty system if you've been keeping up with the game over the past year. Runewords are returning in a throwback to Diablo II, and there is of course more powerful gear to hunt down. But I see those updates as the culmination of a whole year of tweaks and revisions to Sanctuary. A review of Diablo IV's first year For better and for worse, Blizzard is a game studio that responds to the demands of its audience. \"We've heard your feedback\" may be the most-uttered phrase across the company's events. I think there's a balance to be struck in giving the community such a loud voice in a game's direction, but in the case of Diablo IV, it has generally turned out well. When a lot of people fill the forums and say that a system is unfun, odds are good it'll get reworked. And there definitely were some unfun points in Diablo IV. The item system got a thorough and rewarding overhaul in Season 4. Activities like the Helltide and Nightmare dungeons are no longer gated to the highest difficulty levels. Even simple tweaks have done a lot to improve quality of life: At one point, the locations of the vendors changed so that the Blacksmith, Jeweler and Occultist are now all next to each other, meaning you aren't mounting up to go across town just to swap out one item of gear. Nearly every update feels intended to give players more agency and more power. A seasonal model also helps here, introducing fresh gameplay ideas every few months that the devs can learn from and possibly turn into permanent updates. For instance, Vessel of Hatred is launching with the start of a new season that adds Realmwalker monsters to chase across Sanctuary. Not every season revolutionizes the core gameplay ‚Äî sometimes it‚Äôs just a glimpse into a faction with a short story thread to untangle ‚Äî but these themed end-game additions can be reason enough to keep playing. Blizzard Entertainment So, is it worth returning to Sanctuary? For those who just want to experience the story, Vessel of Hatred is a worthwhile and natural continuation of the cliffhanger from the base game. For √ºber-fans, I assume you live on the PTR and already have your own opinions about what's coming (and you'll play for hours no matter what). I'm mostly speaking to the group in the middle, who have dabbled occasionally or never logged back in after the big Lilith battle. For these players, now's a good time to return to Diablo IV. Explore the new story, try the Spiritborn; you'll probably find plenty to enjoy. A live game usually needs some time to find its footing, or to prove it has staying power beyond an initial fifteen minutes of fame. Vessel of Hatred is just the latest example of how Blizzard is committed to changing, improving and making Diablo IV a hell of a good time.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/vessel-of-hatred-is-the-latest-reason-to-start-playing-diablo-iv-again-160036459.html?src=rss",

    "description": "Meta just announced several updates coming to Facebook during the company‚Äôs IRL event in Austin. It's testing an Explore tab and adding a new video tab. Let‚Äôs start with the Explore tab. If you‚Äôve ever perused Instagram, you likely know how exactly this will work. This tab will house ‚Äúa variety of content tailored to your interests.‚Äù¬† Meta says that the algorithm has been designed to serve up ‚Äúcontent that doesn‚Äôt just entertain, but helps you dive deeper into your interests.‚Äù Here‚Äôs hoping I get nothing but content about wild traversal strategies in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom. In any event, the new Explore tab is still in the testing phase so it could be a bit before a wide rollout. The video tab is also getting a major update to accommodate Reels. All of the video content on Facebook will now be housed behind this tab. The content will stream on a full-screen video player that lets users ‚Äúseamlessly watch the best short-form, long-form and live videos in a single experience.‚Äù The updated video tab starts rolling out to users in the ‚Äúcoming weeks.‚Äù This is definitely an attempt by Meta to capture some of those younger eyeballs, as the announcement was accompanied by statistics indicating that young adults on Facebook spend around 60 percent of their time watching videos and Reels. I got news for you, Meta. My dad, who is not a young adult, also spends all of his time on Facebook watching videos and Reels. So we‚Äôll all benefit from this expanded video tab.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/facebook-is-testing-an-instagram-like-explore-tab-and-introducing-a-new-video-tab-for-reels-153033149.html?src=rss",

    "title": "What happens when solar panels die?",
    "link": "https://www.engadget.com/science/what-happens-when-solar-panels-die-140019832.html?src=rss",
    "description": "By the end of 2024, the world will have nearly 2,000 Gigawatts of solar generation capacity in service. Each panel is made of silicon, glass, various polymers, aluminum, copper and an assortment of other metals that capture the sun‚Äôs energy. It‚Äôs a rule of thumb that, barring damage, a panel will last for up to 30 years before it needs to be replaced. But what happens to all of those raw materials when the current crop of solar panels becomes obsolete? Surely, we‚Äôre not just wasting it all, are we? What kills a solar panel? Received wisdom suggests solar panels last for around 30 years, but that‚Äôs not the whole story here. ‚Äú30 years is our best guess,‚Äù explained Garvin Heath of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). NREL found there was a higher rate of failures at the start of a panel‚Äôs life, often due to manufacturing or installation faults. In midlife, only a handful of panels fail. Then the statistics begin to climb northward the closer to the three decade mark you get but, even so, the number of panels that break are ‚Äúless than one percent‚Äù of the total in operation at that time. Matt Burnell is the founder of ReSolar, a British startup looking into reusing, repowering and recycling solar panels. As part of his work, Burnell visited a 40,000 panel array solar farm where 200 of the panels were broken during installation. ‚ÄúI took about 50 from that site, tested them to see their value for reuse [and] generation capacity,‚Äù he said, most of which were within the ‚Äútolerance range of the manufacturer.‚Äù Essentially, for the odd crack in the glass or bump on the frame ‚Äî which may cause problems down the line ‚Äî the panels were otherwise perfectly functional. If a panel has survived its birth and installation, then the biggest thing that kills solar panels is the weather. Heath said a common cause is extreme weather events damaging the panel, or even just regular, aggressive weather causing things to degrade. Sadly, once a panel is broken, it‚Äôs often not worth the effort to repair. So panels deemed ‚Äúbroken‚Äù during manufacture or installation may still be very capable of making power from the sun. But there are also plenty of panels that are being withdrawn from service after 25 or 30 years, even if they aren't broken in any meaningful sense. There's a fairly simple reason solar farms don't allow these panels to soak up rays until they simply cease to function. It‚Äôs the economics, stupid. The key issue is efficiency loss, which is when panels aren‚Äôt able to generate as much power as they did when first installed. Most solar panels are made with laminated adhesive layers that sit between the glass and the solar cells to hold them together and aid rigidity. Sun exposure can cause those laminated layers to discolor, reducing the amount of light that can reach the cells. That diminishes the energy-generation capacity, which is a problem for large commercial farms. ‚ÄúManufacturer's warranty their [solar] modules‚Äô performance for a 30-year period,‚Äù explained Garvin Heath. For instance, a maker will pledge that its panels will be at least 80-percent efficient for the bulk of its expected three-decade service life. These warranties give large utility-scale customers confidence in what they‚Äôre buying, and at the point that term has expired, it‚Äôs often far more cost-effective to simply junk and replace them. Power grids have a limited number of interconnections, essentially the on-ramp that enables them to push power to the grid. Each interconnection has a hard upper limit in terms of the power it can send, so solar farms need to generate the maximum permitted electricity at all times. ‚Äú[Even when] they‚Äôre working within warranty performance, the opportunity cost of having a module producing [more] power on your interconnection is quite valuable,‚Äù said Heath. ReSolar‚Äôs Matt Burnell used an example of a 10 Megawatt solar farm in the UK that had a 15 Megawatt interconnection. ‚Äú10 years ago, they could only fit 10 megawatts into the space that they had [...] but with newer and more efficient modules, it‚Äôs now financially viable for them to strip the asset down and rebuild it.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have these big pension funds looking at this from a spreadsheet,‚Äù looking for ways to better maximize their investment. The end result is that all of these otherwise fine panels are junked. ‚ÄúWhen you think about the embedded carbon of bringing [the panels] over [from China]‚Äù said Burnell ‚Äúand then they go into the waste stream [...] seems mad.‚Äù Even if panels could be repaired to full efficiency,it‚Äôs not likely solar panel repair shops will be opening in droves. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a serious question around the labor costs of testing and repairing versus just buying a new panel,‚Äù said Burnell. He added in another example of panels that had to be taken down to address fire safety legislation, which were similarly at risk of being discarded because the effort to repurpose them was too great. To reduce waste, ReSolar actually wound up collecting and sending on a consignment of those panels to Ukraine for use in a hospital. In the trash Matt Burnell / ReSolar Another rule of thumb is that only one in 10 solar panels is recycled, with the remaining nine sent to landfills. There is no standard method for tracking a panel‚Äôs eventual destination, and it‚Äôs not clear how such a system would be implemented. But there‚Äôs a risk landfills are about to be overwhelmed with the volume of panels that‚Äôll be coming down from roofs. The Los Angeles Times, for instance, reported on the coming glut of panels in California after the state‚Äôs push to get more solar installed from 2006 onwards. The legal situation is barely patchwork, with Grist describing things in 2020 as the ‚Äúwild west,‚Äù since only Washington has any sort of mandatory legislation. Decommissioned solar panels are covered by federal solid and hazardous waste rules, dependent on the materials used in their construction. If a panel includes heavy metals like lead and cadmium, then they can‚Äôt be sent to a general landfill, lest their poisons leech into the soil. But that often just means those panels are redirected to landfills that are designed to handle specialist waste. The EPA is, at present, looking at developing rules that would standardize the recycling process for solar panels and lithium batteries. But while there are no federal mandates for recycling, or even tough legislation at the state level, the situation is far from ideal. A small fraction of the panels are actually sent to recycling centers, the rest left to an uncertain fate. As Heath points out, the risk is that while recycling is uneconomical and unavailable, we‚Äôll see huge boneyards of working solar panels, left piled up while the situation changes. In the UK and Europe, solar panels are covered by the Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive, or WEEE. The rules oblige supplying companies to collect and recycle discarded panels, or to shoulder the cost for another entity to do so. It means that, hopefully, we won‚Äôt see tons more panels being dumped to landfills, but also means it‚Äôs often going to be more economical to send working panels to recycling rather than repurposing them. Recycling Matt Burnell / ReSolar If you want to free up the raw materials lurking inside a solar panel, then there are two approaches. There‚Äôs the mechanical way, in which you can shred the components, which is both simpler and more wasteful: it can recover glass and metal, but little else. Or there are thermal and chemical approaches that seek to separate the components, enabling more of the rarer metals to be recovered. ‚ÄúExisting recyclers have traditional markets that their economics are built around, so glass recyclers look at a module and say ‚Äòwow, a module is 80 percent glass by weight, I know what to do with that,‚Äù said Heath. ‚ÄúWith the materials inside, there are more precious metals with higher value,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut they‚Äôre mixed in with the plastic polymer layers [...] which are hard to separate economically.‚Äù Consequently, the silicon, silver and copper embedded in the cells are often ground down into bulk and abandoned. The IEA‚Äôs 2024 report on panel recycling looked into how these mechanical methods aren‚Äôt great for material qualities. ‚ÄúThe outputs of mechanical processing are usually not very pure and better yields of high-quality materials [...] especially silicon and silver, should be targeted,‚Äù it said. It added that often these recycling processes aren‚Äôt optimized to run solar panels, and so ‚Äúthere is frequently some downgrading of recovered material quality,‚Äù hardly a great step on the road to circularity. It‚Äôs also hard to know what goes into a solar panel. ‚ÄúThe variation in materials [found in solar panels] is wild,‚Äù said ReSolar‚Äôs Matt Burnell. The litany of manufacturers don‚Äôt yet have any obligation to share their raw material data, although new regulations will change that soon. Until then, it‚Äôs difficult for recyclers to know what they‚Äôll be pulling out of the panels they‚Äôre looking to process. As well as recyclers not knowing the composition of the panels, there‚Äôs the risk of noxious chemicals being added to expedite some processes. Antoine Chalaux is the general manager of ROSI Solar, a specialist solar panel recycler in France. He talked about the inclusion of chemicals like Teflon and antimony, both of which are toxic and cannot be released into the atmosphere. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve developed our recycling processes to capture [them],‚Äù he explained, ‚Äúbut we‚Äôre pushing [manufacturers] to use it less [in future].‚Äù Burnell believes that the industry is really at the ‚Äúvery dawn‚Äù of solar recycling but is confident that with investment today, solutions will be quickly found in the very near future. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got this massive lead-in time,‚Äù he said ‚Äúso we know what‚Äôs coming onto the market today, and we know what‚Äôs coming into the system in 25 to 30 years.‚Äù The real ticking clock is for the glut of panels that were installed in the early 2010s that will start entering the waste stream in the next decade. Right now, ROSI‚Äôs processes aren‚Äôt as cheap as other recyclers, and Chalaux knows that it can be a problem. ‚ÄúRight now, there‚Äôs no economic reason for companies to [recycle with us], but there‚Äôs the question of image,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll of the manufacturers and owners of PV projects want a good story for the end of life for their panels.‚Äù The other benefit of this process, however, is to produce high-purity recycled materials that can be used by local manufacturers. The future Graphic by Al Hicks / NREL One step toward a more recyclable solar panel might be to eliminate the use of those adhesive polymers in its construction. If a panel could just use sheets of glass with the solar cells sandwiched inside, it would be a lot easier to deconstruct. Not to mention you‚Äôd likely get a longer and better performance out of them, since there would be no polymer layers to discolor. Thankfully, a team from the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) has demonstrated that such a product can exist. Rather than gluing the layers together, femtosecond lasers weld the front and back panels of glass to each other. The solar cells are sandwiched inside, held by the bonding of the glass to its sibling, and nothing else. And when the panel eventually reaches its end of life, which may be a lot longer than 30 years, it can just be recycled by shattering the glass. The project, led by Dr. David Young, says that if the proposals are accepted, we could see a commercial version of the panel within two to three years. He added that the rigidity offered by welding will be just as sturdy and waterproof as panels using polymer layers. Unfortunately, by that point, we‚Äôll have decades upon decades of panels made using the old system that we‚Äôll still need to deal with. And until we get a cost-effective, scalable way to recycle them, the answer to the question ‚ÄòWhat happens to solar panels when they die?‚Äô will be ‚Äònothing good.‚ÄôThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/what-happens-when-solar-panels-die-140019832.html?src=rss",
