    "link": "https://omny.fm/shows/cricket-unfiltered/dennetts-deepdive-3-the-rise-and-rise-of-bill-orei",
    "description": "Bill O’Reilly was one of the greatest bowlers of all time. Upon O’Reilly’s death at age 86 in 1992 Don Bradman declared him the best bowler he had ever faced or seen and, in his obituary in Wisden Gideon Haigh said O’Reilly “was probably the greatest spin bowler the game has ever produced”. The splendour of O’Reilly’s Test career is well documented and well worth reading. But that is not what these episodes of Dennett’s Deepdives will be about. Instead they’re about Bill O’Reilly’s extraordinary and improbable rise to Test cricket. Because just before he turned 21, although he loved the sport, Bill had never played a game of grade cricket or even contemplated doing so. When he finally decided to give grade cricket a try, after being persuaded to by friends, O’Reilly’s rise to the top was stunning. But just after playing his first Sheffield Shield game Bill was banished to the bushcby his employer, the NSW Department of Education. His promising cricket career seemed over. When he was finally allowed to return to Sydney three years had passed and he was a nobody once more. But Bill rose once more, this time all the way to the Australian Test side and to becoming the best bowler in the world. This series of podcasts is also unavoidably a story of the intertwining of the early careers of O’Reilly and Don Bradman. Off the field the two champions had little in common and not much affection for each other. On the field they had nothing but respect and mutual admiration.

    "description": "We are now on Patreon! Sign up to support us and get EXTRA shows: https://linktr.ee/cricketunfiltered Our special guest is Anthony 'Harry' Moffitt - an Australian SAS solider who has released a book called 11 bats a story of combat, cricket and the SAS – detailing the surprising role that cricket had in his 11 overseas deployments as part of Australia’s SAS. Cricket was a source of comfort and fun for the Australian soldiers in the midst of the horrors of war, helped build bridges with locals in Afghanistan, Iraq and East Timor and even helped when it came to tactics and diplomacy. Harry was extremely candid in his interview and, as you will soon realise, he’s a top bloke and a highly intelligent deep thinker who is now a psychologist. No topic was off limits for Harry, including the current very serious allegations of war crimes involving the SAS. In this first section of our interview, Harry talks about playing cricket under enemy fire, the role cricket had in relations with local people in a warzone, how he feels about comparisons between war and sport, the incredible effort it took to qualify for the SAS and much more.

His wife, Lynn, has secondary breast cancer and has been fighting the disease for 12 years.Stewart will take up the new position from January – for a fixed number of days a year – with the responsibility of carrying on Surrey’s success after leading them to a historic third successive County Championship. Speaking of his wife’s illness, the 61-year-old told the Telegraph: “There are bits and pieces that have crept up recently. It’s never going away. It’s managing it. Continue reading...",

If so, you’ll have some sympathy with England’s predicament before the Women’s T20 World Cup which starts on Thursday: not in Bangladesh, as originally intended, but in the UAE.Twelve months ago, the England and Wales Cricket Board hired a head of cricket intelligence, Liam Sanders, and tasked him with helping to achieve something England have not managed since 2009: winning a Women’s T20 World Cup. Sanders and his team gamed every possible scenario, including having the captain, Heather Knight, miss a match against New Zealand in July with just an hour’s notice, mimicking what might happen if illness struck.

After months of talks with the ground’s owners, Middlesex are close to agreeing a 12-month contract that will ensure most of their matches are played at the home of cricket next summer, but the club’s long-term future is uncertain.The county’s two previous leases with the MCC were for five years, with a 12-month deal raising eyebrows among staff at both clubs given the 13-time county champions have been tenants at Lord’s since 1864. A short-term agreement has been reached as an emergency measure, but there is concern on both sides that the arrangements may not suit either party, as has been reflected in the lengthy negotiations.

It was the longest Championship season on record – stretching from 5 April to 29 September – finishing with the favourites, Surrey, easing to victory with one round to go and Sussex winning Division Two on the final day, a thousand supporters hanging around in gloves to watch Clare Connor present the trophy.But how quickly things move on. Rod Bransgrove announced the sale of Hampshire to the Delhi Capitals co-owners before the Spin had time to pull the season’s trophies out of the Guardian cabinet where they have been gathering dust since last year.

    "description": "The touring side acquired useful knowledge over the course of the T20 and ODI series but failed to find out more about some newer playersIn the end, it was a strange way to end a strange white-ball tour. Steve Smith captaining a one-day match in Bristol in place of Mitchell Marsh, who was captaining in place of Pat Cummins, but whose previous absence in a T20 had been filled by Travis Head. Matt Short replacing Marsh as opener, having been replaced by Marsh a match earlier, after replacing Marsh for two games after Marsh had replaced Short from the T20s. Cooper Connolly getting his second game in Australian colours but still not getting a bat.It was a strange game watching Australia race the clock and the autumn clouds, trying to face 20 overs of the chase before imminent rain ended the day, needing to stay ahead of the required tally to be awarded a score-projection win and take the series 3-2 should the clouds burst. Rain came four balls after the required overs were reached. A flurry of striking from Short, Smith and Josh Inglis had lifted them to 165-2, enough for the mathematicians to deduce that 144 from 30 overs was sufficiently within Australia’s grasp to deserve the assumption of reaching England’s 309. That omits the possibility of a change in trajectory like the one that England’s own innings suffered, but it’s the cost of doing statistical business. Continue reading...",

Sethi says that if an agreement cannot be reached there is “a very distinct possibility” that Pakistan’s government will prevent the national team from travelling to India for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup in October.Sethi, who is currently chairman on an interim basis, says he expects to continue in the role for a three-year term and one of his plans is to launch a women’s league. He says he’s already in the process of sanctioning almost one billion rupees for the development of women’s cricket in Pakistan.Also on Stumped, Jim Maxwell and Sunil Gupta pay tribute to the careers of England’s Katherine Sciver-Brunt and South Africa’s Shabnim Ismail, as the fast bowlers both announced their retirement from international cricket.Plus, we’re re-joined by former cricket journalist Jenny Thompson, who is travelling around the world to experience women’s cricket in as many different countries as she can.

Wasim also addressed allegations of match-fixing during his career again denying any involvement in corruption. In 2000, Pakistan players Saleem Malik and Ata-ur-Rehman were banned for match-fixing. A report into the scandal by Justice Malik Qayyum found Wasim not guilty of match-fixing but did recommend that he be fined and not allowed to captain Pakistan because he refused to cooperate and \"cannot be said to be above suspicion\".Plus the team debate why this Men's T20 World Cup is the most open competition we have seen for a while and who their stand out performers have been.

For Australian international Dan Christian that was a dilemma he had to consider. He joins us to discuss his book ‘The All-Rounder’, in which he documents a chaotic year of dodging Covid-19 and travelling the world playing cricket.Plus we’ll catch up with the chief executive of the Ukraine Cricket Federation, Kobus Olivier. Kobus spoke to Stumped in February on the day Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine. He has since fled his home in Kyiv and started a new life teaching refugees how to play cricket in Croatia. We’ll also look ahead to South Africa women’s first Test match in over seven years.Image: Dan Christian of the Sixers celebrates the Big Bash League match between the Sydney Sixers and the Brisbane Heat at Metricon Stadium, on January 10, 2021, in Gold Coast, Australia.

He joined Alison Mitchell, Sunil Gupta and Jim Maxwell to discuss his development as a player, what it’s like to be coached by Ricky Pointing and his hopes of lifting the Indian Premier League trophy with Delhi Capitals, after losing last year’s Final.Also on Stumped, we discuss another week of speculation around the future of the Ashes, what will happen next and we hear from West Indies legend Michael Holding who claims England showed \"Western arrogance\" by cancelling their tour of Pakistan.Photo credit: Kagiso Rabada of South Africa walks off for lunch after he took the wicket of Jonny Bairstow of England during day three of the 4th Test at Supersport Park on January 24, 2016 in Centurion, South Africa.

Little did Gower, or anyone, know that 1985 was to be the last time England won a home Ashes series for 20 years, a desolate run that began when he was put back in charge for what turned out to be a calamitous 1989 contest involving a famous press conference, News at 10, a rebel tour and a large wine bill.",

He might have only played seven Ashes Tests but was involved in three series wins, one of them away from home. He went on two other tours of Australia, one that lasted just nine days and another that ended in the “public humiliation” – his words – of being sent home because he was “not selectable”.As ever, you can read much more on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Jonathan Agnew presents from the Ageas Bowl where Zak Crawley's brilliant maiden century has put England in command of the 3rd and final Test against Pakistan. His 171 not out, and unbroken partnership of 205 with Jos Buttler, guided England from 127-4 to 332-4 at the close. Aggers is joined by Michael Vaughan and Azhar Mahmood to review the day, while Crawley tells Daniel Norcross how it feels to get his first century and why his dad will be the first person he calls. The outgoing ECB chairman Colin Graves explains how vital it's been for English cricket to have these series against Pakistan and West Indies and how he would improve the structure of county cricket, and Simon Hughes and the Rajasthan Royals owner Manoj Badale discuss their new book in which they outline how cricket can change post-COVID.",

Jonathan Agnew gets reaction from Root and Pakistan skipper Azhar Ali about the match and how the sport can get round the bad light issues that affected this Test, while Andy Zaltzman provides some statistical analysis including how England's declaration score compares with other low totals seen in previous matches.",

Bad light, rain and a wet outfield prevented Pakistan resuming on their overnight 223-9.
