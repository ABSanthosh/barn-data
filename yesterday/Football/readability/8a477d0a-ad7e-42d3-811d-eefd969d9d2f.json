  "text": "Competition: Greek Cup Market: Panathinaikos win Odds: 4/11 @ Pribet Looking to extend on their remarkable flurry, Panathinaikos will welcome Atromitos to the Athens Olympic Stadium on Wednesday evening. Starting with the hosts, while Panathinaikos might have been left frustrated last season as they eventually had to settle for a fourth-place finish among Greece’s elite, the Shamrocks are enjoying a stellar run of form this time around. Last seen putting in another dominant display as they opened the New Year with a 2-1 win against PAOK, Rui Vitoria’s men find themselves at the heart of a title scrap. Getting Wednesday’s showdown underway sat just two points adrift of climbing to the top of the Super League standings, the Greens find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Signing off 2024 with a 1-0 win against Athens Kallithea, the former Egypt boss has seen his squad gain a string of plaudits from across the continent. Last seen in Europa Conference League action with a 4-0 romp against Dinamo Minsk, Panathinaikos have now won each of their last seven consecutive appearances across all competitions. In fact, Vitoria’s side are unbeaten in all of their last 11 outings – a run that stems all the way back to November 7th. As for the visitors, while Panathinaikos might be enjoying a real flurry, the same can’t be said for a struggling Atromitos. Last seen opening the New Year with a 1-0 loss at home against Asteras, Pablo Garcia finds his squad at the heart of a real struggle. Signing off 2023 with a routine 3-0 drumming against PAOK, the Peristeri-based outfit should be bracing themselves for another monumental challenge in midweek. Still scrapping it out in the relegation spots, the Fearless are without a win from any of their previous six appearances across all competitions. Pencilled in as a real underdog when they travel to their local rivals in midweek, Atromitos should also be worried by their recent records against the Shamrocks. Crashing out of the Greek Cup back on December 4th as they fell to a 2-1 loss, the Blues will have another real tussle on their hands here. Given what has been a huge recent gulf in class, we are backing a home victory here. Bet: Panathinaikos 4/11 to beat Atromitos in Wednesday’s Greek Cup tie @ Pribet",
