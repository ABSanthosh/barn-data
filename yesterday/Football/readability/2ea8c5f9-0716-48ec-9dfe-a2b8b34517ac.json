  "text": "Competition: Irish Premier Division Market: Shamrock Rovers win Odds: 3/11 @ 1xBet Simply looking to widen their buffer at the top of the Premier Division table on Friday night, Shamrock will welcome Cork City to the Tallaght Stadium. Starting with the hosts, while Shamrock might have been left hugely frustrated last season as they relinquished their Premier Division crown, the Irish giants have come roaring back in a sensational fashion. Getting Friday’s showdown underway holding a commanding nine-point buffer over the chasing pack, Stephen Bradley’s men are enjoying what has become a stellar purple patch. Last seen clinching a 2-1 victory away at Drogheda, the Rovers are unsurprisingly pencilled in as a landslide title contender in 2025. In fact, getting June underway with another 2-1 win against defending champions Shelbourne, the former Ireland boss has seen his high-flying squad muster 22 points from their last eight Premier Division appearances. Likewise, Bradley’s side are unbeaten in all of their previous 10 consecutive top-flight appearances – a run that stems all the way back to April 21st. Simply looking to lay down another title marker this weekend, Shamrock should be smelling a golden opportunity when they return to the Tallaght Stadium. As for the visitors, while Shamrock might be enjoying what has been a sensational Premier Division flurry, the same can’t be said for Cork City. In the midst of what has been a public struggle, Ger Nash’s men sit rock-bottom of the table and are pencilled in as a landslide contender to be hit with an immediate second-tier return in 2025. Last seen putting in another worrying display as they slumped to a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Bohemians, the Rebel Army couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge this weekend. Signing off May with a 2-1 loss away at Galway, Friday’s guests have registered just a single point from any of their previous five straight Premier Division appearances. It should also be noted, Cork City have put just a sole win on the board from any of their last 16 consecutive attempts – a rut that stems all the way back to February 28th. Bet: Shamrock Rovers 3/11 to beat Cork City in Friday’s Irish Premier Division matchup @ 1xBet",
