The Brazil international, who joined Barca in 2022, was due to be out of contract in 2027 but has agreed new terms following a stellar season. Having previously been linked with a move away from the Blaugrana, Raphinha has been outstanding under Hansi Flick. The 28-year-old has scored 18 goals and provided nine assists in LaLiga as Barca beat Real Madrid to the title, but he has reserved some of his best performances for the Champions League. Raphinha’s 13 goals and eight assists in Europe’s elite club competition have lifted him into Ballon d’Or contention, although Barca lost in the semi-finals to Inter. More years of magic from Raphinha pic.twitter.com/YcfGUBiYFH — FC Barcelona (@FCBarcelona) May 22, 2025 Both Raphinha and Barca should now get plenty more opportunities to advance in Europe in years to come after agreeing the new deal. Indeed, the former Leeds United man now hopes he can see out the rest of his career in Barca colours. “This is very rewarding for me and is something very special,” he told Barca One. “It makes me very happy and a personal objective since I arrived is to give the fans a lot of joy. “I have spoken to my family and my dream is to be here until the end of my career. And I hope to do it at my best.”",
