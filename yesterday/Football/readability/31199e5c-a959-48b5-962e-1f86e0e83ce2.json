Aston Villa Starting with the hosts, suffering a remarkable last-gasp collapse away at Nottingham Forest last week as they eventually fell to a 2-1 loss at the City Ground, Aston Villa have the feel of a squad seeking some much-welcomed stability. Despite enjoying a three-match winning run across all competitions when opening December, Unai Emery’s men open this weekend’s fixtures sat outside the European spots. However, enjoying what has been a sensational Champions League adventure this season and securing a famous 3-2 win away at German giants RB Leipzig earlier in the month, Villa will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Opening December with a 3-1 victory against Brentford, the former Arsenal boss has seen his squad suffer just a single defeat in the Midlands since the end of August. Aston Villa Team News Both still dealing with respective muscle injuries, Aston Villa will once again be without the duo of Leon Bailey and Jacob Ramsey this weekend. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench away at Nottingham Forest last week, England international Ollie Watkins will be hoping for a full recall here. However, bagging what turned out to be a consolation strike at the City Ground last weekend and now notching three goals in as many appearances, John Duran should keep his spot leading the line. In what could prove to be a real boost on Saturday lunchtime, former Everton midfielder Amadou Onana could make a first start since returning from November’s international break. Manchester City As for the visitors, suffering their own sensational last-gasp collapse at the Etihad, Manchester City find themselves at the heart of what has quickly become a public crisis. Eventually falling to a 2-1 loss at home against bitter local rivals Manchester United, Pep Guardiola has a tremendous amount of pressure on his shoulders. Although the Sky Blues might have made real history last season as they became the first club in Premier League history to claim fourth consecutive domestic titles, the former Barcelona boss has seen his superstar squad come crashing back down to earth. Continuing to break a string of unwanted records and remarkably sat outside the Champions League places, Man City have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous 11 straight appearances across all competitions – a rut that stems all the way back to October 26th. Manchester City Team News Undergoing knee surgery back in September, newly-crowned Ballon d’Or winner Rodri is not expected to feature over the remainder of the season. After serving a one-match suspension against Manchester United last weekend, England international Rico Lewis will return to Guardiola’s squad on Saturday lunchtime. Making a cameo appearance off the bench last weekend, former Chelsea midfielder Mateo Kovacic could make a first Premier League start since the start of November. Despite notching just a single Premier League strike since returning from November’s international break, Erling Haaland will play a leading role in the final third. Aston Villa vs Manchester City Key Factors to Consider When Aston Villa and Manchester City last met back in April, the Sky Blues collected a 4-1 victory on home soil. In fact, the defending champions have lost just one of their previous 17 meetings against Saturday’s hosts across all competitions. Man City have remarkably recorded just a single win from any of their last 11 appearances across all formats. Aston Villa have suffered just a single defeat on home soil since the end of August. Colombian marksman John Duran has found the net in each of his previous three appearances across all competitions. Conclusion While Manchester City might have suffered just a single defeat from any of their last 17 straight showdowns against Aston Villa, Guardiola’s struggling squad should have another real challenge on their hands. Suffering an infamous collapse at the Etihad last weekend as they eventually fell to a 2-1 loss at the hands of their bitter local rivals, Guardiola’s side find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Recording just a single victory from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions, Villa will certainly be smelling the chance to collect a heavyweight scalp here.
