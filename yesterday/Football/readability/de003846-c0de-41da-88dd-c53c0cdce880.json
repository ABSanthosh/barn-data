  "text": "Lazio came back from two goals down to draw 2-2 at home to relegation-threatened Parma on Monday and, in doing so, drew level with city rivals Roma in the Serie A table. While the point leaves Lazio seventh, only their head-to-head record now separates them from a Europa Conference League qualification spot. But that seemed a long way off when Jacob Ondrejka found space to open the scoring in just the third minute. The hosts did have their chances to get back into it and Taty Castellanos had the ball in the back of the net on 38 minutes, but was caught offside. Boulaye Dia then blasted high and wide before the visitors doubled their lead just 48 seconds into the second half through Ondrejka again. Mateo Pellegrino was then denied a third for Parma after he broke the offside trap, but saw his effort saved by Christos Mandas. Lazio did get one back on 79 minutes, with Pedro finishing off from a rebound. Five minutes later, he had equalised with a looping header that went into the far corner. Next up for Lazio is a trip to strugglers Empoli on Sunday, while Parma face Como on Saturday. 7 – #Pedro is the player who has scored the most goals as a substitute in a single #SerieA season for #Lazio, in the era of three points for a win (since 1994/95): seven, overtaking Tommaso Rocchi (six, in 2008/09). Certainty.#LazioParma — OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) April 28, 2025 Elsewhere, Bologna missed the chance to get back into the top four in Serie A following a goalless draw away to Udinese. Having started slowly, the visitors saw Udinese forward Keinan Davis smash an effort against the crossbar inside four minutes. The match after that was one of few clear cut chances, but Riccardo Orsolini went close with a free kick that hit the woodwork on 67 minutes. Orsolini had another big chance in the 88th minute but struggled to keep his diving header down from five yards after a knockdown from Santiago Castro. Next for Bologna is a home game against fourth-placed Juventus, who they trail by one point on Sunday. Udinese, meanwhile, travel to Cagliari on the same day.",
