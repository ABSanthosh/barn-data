  "text": "Competition: A-League Market: Western United win Odds: 4/11 @ Pribet Two sides who find themselves battling it out at opposite ends of the A-League table, Western United will welcome Perth to Ironbark Fields on Saturday morning. Starting with the hosts, while Western United might have spent the entirety of last season scrapping it out at the foot of the table, John Aloisi’s side have come roaring back in a sensational fashion this time around. Heading into March’s international break with a stellar 6-2 romp away at Newcastle, the former Brisbane boss has seen his squad skyrocket their way up the A-League standings. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway sat in the AFC Champions League spots, the Tarneit-based outfit find the mood in their camp at a famous high. In fact, along with a 4-1 victory against Wellington last month, Western United have won all of their previous four outings by an aggregate score of 16-4. Continuing to shine with their dominant displays in the final third, Saturday’s hosts will be smelling a golden opportunity here. It should also be highlighted, Aloisi’s high-flying squad have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous nine appearances – a run that stems all the way back to January 7th. As for the visitors, once again sat rock-bottom of the table, Perth have only further underlined their status as Australia’s ultimate whipping boys. Suffering consecutive 3-1 losses against Central Coast and Brisbane on either side of March’s international break, the Glory have rightfully come under a huge amount of scrutiny. In fact, David Zdrillic’s men have put just 11 points on the board from any of their 22 A-League appearances this season. With their nightmare rut underlined by a 4-1 drumming against Western Sydney last month, Perth have lost their previous three matchups by an aggregate score of 10-3. It should also be highlighted, Saturday’s guests have remarkably conceded 51 goals so far this year and they hold the worst defensive tally. Facing a monumental challenge here, the former Sydney coach should also be concerned by a woeful record against Western United. Including a 3-2 defeat when they two sides met on January 3rd, they have lost all of their last six straight meetings. Bet: Western United 4/11 to beat Perth Glory in Saturday’s A-League contest @ Pribet",
