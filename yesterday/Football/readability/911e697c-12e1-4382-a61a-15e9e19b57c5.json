  "text": "Storming their way to a 20th domestic crown last season, Liverpool embarked on what was a sensational maiden campaign under Arne Slotâ€™s guidance. Watching attacking icon Mohamed Salah finally put pen to paper on a new deal back in April, the mood around Anfield remains at a red-hot high and the reigning Premier League champions have their sights set on mounting a European charge next season. However, while Liverpool might be inching towards another big-money move for Eintracht Frankfurt starlet Hugo Ekitike, it appears that one of their striking superstars is keen on clinching a move away from the red half of Merseyside. Although the Anfield hierarchy might have made their stance abundantly clear, it has been suggested that Colombian international Luis Diaz is hoping to secure a move away before the summer transfer window slams shut. Although the ex-Porto ace might have played a leading role in Liverpoolâ€™s charge to the Premier League title last season, it appears that Slot has already identified his dream replacement for Diaz. Is Rodrygo the next blockbuster arrival at Anfield? While Rodrygo might have travelled over to the United States as part of Xabi Alonsoâ€™s maiden Real Madrid squad this summer, it appears a certainty that the Brazilian superstar will be on his way out of the Bernabeu. Although Los Blancos might have reportedly opened this summerâ€™s transfer window stating that the 24-year-old would be part of Alonsoâ€™s plans for next season, it has been suggested that the Spanish giants have had a change of heart. With the former Santos youngster making it clear that he is seeking regular first-team action, Rodrygo is keen on a move away from Madrid this month and both parties are actively working to find a solution. Gaining a reputation for his relentless work ethic and registering 20 direct goal contributions across all competitions last season, it has been speculated that the 33-cap international favours a move to the Premier League this summer. While Rodrygo might have publicly stated last year that he came close to joining the reigning English champions back in 2017, it was reported over the weekend that Slot is a huge admirer of the Madrid ace. With Darwin Nunez expected to be another big-name attacking star on their way out of Anfield this summer, Rodrygoâ€™s arrival on the red half of Merseyside would be considered as a sensational scalp. Rodrygo is considered a SERIOUS REPLACEMENT for Luis Diaz should Liverpool decide to sell their left-winger ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·ðŸ‘€ pic.twitter.com/LHfUCZwm1z â€” LiveScore (@livescore) July 18, 2025 Diaz makes his stance clear Notching 13 Premier League strikes last season and only finishing behind Salah in Liverpoolâ€™s goalscoring charts, Diaz has certainly made an immediate impact since arriving back in January 2022. Although Liverpool might have stated that they have no intention of parting ways with the Colombian superstar this summer, both parties have endured messy contact extension talks behind the scenes. Now in the final two years of his current deal at Anfield and with discussions drastically failing to materialise over the past 12 months, Diaz certainly isnâ€™t short of heavyweight interest. Alongside continued links over a potential move to Spanish giants Barcelona, it has been heavily reported over the past fortnight that Bayern Munich are sat firmly in the driving seat. With former Manchester City star Leroy Sane completing a move to Galatasaray and Jamal Musiala facing a lengthy stint on the sidelines following his horror broken leg at this summerâ€™s Club World Cup, Vincent Kompanyâ€™s side have identified Diaz as their key target. Although the Bundesliga champions might have seen an initial bid of Â£58.5million immediately rejected last week, Diaz has made it clear that his sole focus is on completing a move to Munich ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.
