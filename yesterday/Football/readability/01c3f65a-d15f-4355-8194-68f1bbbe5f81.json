  "text": "With the Premier League once again stealing centre stage this weekend, runaway leaders Liverpool will be looking to extend their buffer over the chasing pack. Ahead of five Premier League showdowns throughout Saturday, the likes of Arsenal and Aston Villa will feature on a stacked schedule. With plenty of intriguing betting markets available, we have taken a look at some of the most lucrative Premier League tips. Saturday, December 14th  BST 15:00 Arsenal vs Everton  While Arsenal might have watched their Premier League title dreams take a real dent last weekend as they had to settle for a 1-1 stalemate away at Fulham, the Gunners claimed an immediate boost earlier in the week. Putting in a dominant display at the Emirates, Mikel Arteta’s men stormed their way to a 3-0 romp against French outfit Monaco and Saturday’s hosts will be seeking a repeat performance here. Desperate to make up some ground on runaway leaders Liverpool, Arsenal have collected 16 points from their six appearances since returning from November’s international break. Signing off November with an action-packed 5-2 win against local rivals West Ham, Arteta’s men have also gained a reputation for their continued success on home soil. Including a 2-0 victory against Manchester United earlier in the month, Arsenal have not suffered a single competitive defeat in north London since the middle of April. With last weekend’s Merseyside derby scrapped due to the adverse weather conditions across England, Everton should be relishing their return from an extended break. Last seen claiming what was an essential boost as they romped their way to a 4-0 victory against fellow strugglers Wolves, Sean Dyche’s side know the importance of dragging themselves away from yet another relegation scrap. However, opening December with a 4-0 drumming at Old Trafford, the former Burnley boss will have a continued headache over his side’s glaring issues away from Goodison Park. In fact, continuing on from last season, Everton have recorded just a single Premier League victory on their travels over the past 12 months. Betting Tip: Bukayo Saka to score anytime @ 7/5 15:00 Newcastle vs Leicester  While Newcastle might have entered November’s international break in the midst of a flurry, it is fair to say that the Magpies have come crashing back down to earth. Last seen putting in another worrying performance as they eventually fell to a frantic 4-2 loss away at Brentford, the pressure on Eddie Howe’s shoulders is start to intensify. Opening Saturday’s return to St. James’ Park battling it out in the bottom-half of the Premier League table, the former Bournemouth boss is desperately seeking a much-needed boost this weekend. If Howe’s side are to record a first Premier League victory since returning from November’s fortnight break, attacking talisman Alexander Isak will certainly play a leading role here. Bagging a consolation strike in west London last weekend and attracting plenty of heavyweight interest ahead of the January transfer window, the Swedish marksman has recorded four top-flight strikes so far this season. While Leicester might have only appointed new boss Ruud van Nistelrooy earlier in the month, the Foxes have certainly enjoyed an immediate boost under the former Manchester United coach. Mounting a sensational last-gasp comeback at home against Brighton last weekend as they eventually snatched a 2-2 stalemate, Saturday’s guests have dragged themselves away from a bottom-three scrap. However, last seen on their travels falling to a routine 4-1 drumming at the hands of Brentford, Leicester have continued to show some glaring issues away from the King Power. Along with crashing out of the EFL Cup on October 30th following a 5-2 defeat at Old Trafford, the Foxes have recorded just a sole Premier League victory on their travels since making their top-flight return. Tip: Alexander Isak to score anytime @ 19/20 17:30 Nottingham Forest vs Aston Villa While Nottingham Forest might have found themselves at the heart of a Premier League relegation scrap last season, Nuno Espirito Santo’s side have come roaring back in a sensational fashion this time around. Breaking a string of records, Saturday’s hosts are in the midst of a shock relegation scrap and they have already cemented their spot as one of England’s real surprise packages. Last seen putting in a famous performance at Old Trafford as they claimed a 3-2 victory against Manchester United, the former Wolves boss finds the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Despite falling to a 3-1 loss against Newcastle prior to November’s international break, Nottingham Forest will be excited by their recent success at the City Ground. Including a stellar 3-0 romp against West Ham last month, Santo’s men have collected nine points from their previous four showdowns on home soil and they will be looking to make another statement here. Although Aston Villa might have shown some extended issues on either side of November’s fortnight interval, Unai Emery’s camp have once again found their best since opening December. Claiming a remarkable 3-2 win away at Bundesliga outfit RB Leipzig earlier in the week, the one-time Arsenal boss has seen his side take a major leap towards a famous Champions League knockout stage ticket. Landing a 3-1 romp against Brentford on December 4th, Saturday’s guests have their sights firmly set on clinching yet another European finish this season. Appearing to have turned a real corner over the past fortnight and claiming a 4-2 win when they last met Nottingham Forest back on February 24th, Emery’s side will be hoping on a repeat display.
