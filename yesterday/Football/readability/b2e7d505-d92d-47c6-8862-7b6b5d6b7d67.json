  "text": "Verdict: Brazil win Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Luckster Getting their World Cup qualifying campaign back underway in the early hours of Friday, the Selecao will welcome Colombia to Brasilia. Brazil Starting with the hosts, signing off 2024 with a 1-1 stalemate at home against Uruguay, Brazil are desperate to find some much-needed stability this year. Coming under a huge amount of scrutiny last summer as they endured a public Copa America struggle after crashing out at the quarter-final stage, Dorival Junior is more than aware that he has a tremendous amount of pressure on his shoulders. Remarkably mustering just a single victory from any of their four Copa America showdowns over in the United States last year, the South American giants have gained an unwanted reputation for their inconsistencies. With their extended struggles underlined by a 1-0 loss at the hands of Paraguay back in September, Brazil have also recorded consecutive victories across all competitions on just a single occasion since 2023. Brazil Team News Brazil confirmed last week that Neymar has been forced to withdraw from Junior’s squad after sustaining a recent injury. While 18-year-old sensation Endrick might have failed to find any kind of regular action with Real Madrid this season, the former Palmeiras record-breaker has been called up as Neymar’s replacement. Likewise, missing out against Brighton last weekend, Manchester City goalkeeper Ederson will not feature this month. Despite making an immediate impact after completing a loan switch from Manchester United during the January transfer window, Real Betis star Antony has not been rewarded with a spot. Colombia As for the visitors, suffering major Copa America heartbreak last summer as they eventually fell to a 1-0 loss at the hands of Argentina in the final, Colombia have shown some signs of a hangover since that emotional night back in July. Although Nestor Lorenzo’s men might be sat firmly in the driving seat to book a first World Cup ticket since 2018, La Tricolor are desperate to reestablish some kind of dominance. Signing off 2024 with a 1-0 loss at home against Ecuador on November 19th, the former Argentina coach has seen his squad muster just a pair of wins from any of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Likewise, Friday’s guests have managed to muster just a single point from their last three World Cup qualifying showdowns on foreign soil. Colombia Team News While the Premier League duo of Crystal Palace midfielder Jefferson Lerma and Bournemouth’s Luis Sinisterra might have missed November’s international break, both are back in Colombia’s squad. Completing a permanent move to Mexican giants Leon during the January transfer window, ex-Real Madrid superstar James Rodriguez will earn a 113th international cap. Despite suffering EFL Cup heartbreak at Wembley last weekend, Liverpool ace Luis Diaz is expected to feature in Brasilia. Enjoying what has been a breakout campaign with Crystal Palace this season, full-back Daniel Munoz will feature in the early hours of Friday. Brazil vs Colombia Key Factors to Consider When Brazil and Colombia last met in Santa Clara last summer at the Copa America, Friday’s opponents played out a 1-1 stalemate. Brazil have not suffered a single defeat against Colombia on home soil since way back in July 2015. Colombia have lost three of their previous four World Cup qualifying appearances. Likewise, Friday’s guests have recorded just a single point from their previous three World Cup qualifying showdowns on foreign soil. Five of the previous seven meetings between Brazil and Colombia have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Desperate to kickstart their qualifying campaign this weekend, Brazil will once again be firmly under the microscope here. Drastically failing to find any kind of stability over recent times, the South American giants will know the importance of getting 2025 underway with a dominant display in the early hours of Friday. Not suffering a single defeat against Colombia on home soil since way back in the summer of 2015, we are backing the Selecao to get their qualifying campaign back on track here.
