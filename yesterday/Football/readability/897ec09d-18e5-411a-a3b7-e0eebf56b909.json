  "text": "Leeds United returned to the Championship summit after beating Millwall 2-0 in a nervy encounter at Elland Road on Wednesday. Sheffield United had leapfrogged Leeds following their 1-1 draw with Bristol City on Tuesday, but Daniel Farke’s side ensured they moved two points clear at the top with a win. The hosts raced into a third-minute lead when a lightning break saw Manor Solomon’s cross turned into his own net by Millwall captain Jake Cooper. Brenden Aaronson went on to force Lukas Jensen into a save at his near post, and Ao Tanaka sent a long-range effort just wide before the half-hour mark. Joel Piroe thought he had added a second goal soon after, but his fierce finish after linking up with Aaronson was ruled out for an offside in the build-up. Solomon hit the crossbar with a thunderous second-half effort as Millwall defended stoutly. But Leeds made sure of victory five minutes from time when Junior Firpo’s cutback to the edge of the area was brilliantly fired into the top corner by Tanaka. At the other end of the table, Plymouth Argyle held on for their first away victory of the season after battling past Portsmouth to win 2-1 at Fratton Park. Ryan Hardie, the Pilgrims’ FA Cup hero against Liverpool, starred for Miron Muslic’s side, grabbing a goal and an assist to move his team within three points of safety. Plymouth edged ahead on the stroke of half-time when Michael Obafemi’s cross was superbly laid off by Hardie for Mustapha Bundu to stroke into the net. And just four minutes after the restart, Hardie got himself on the scoresheet after racing through on goal. Matthew Sorinola was sent off in the closing stages, though, and Portsmouth quickly made their man advantage count through Adil Aouchiche’s glancing header, but they were unable to find a last-gasp leveller to deny Plymouth a much-needed victory that keeps them bottom but still in touch. There were also big victories at the bottom for Hull City and Stoke City. Hull came from behind to beat Oxford United 2-1, moving above their opponents into 18th place, while Stoke claimed a first win in five, beating play-off hopefuls Blackburn Rovers 1-0. Blackburn’s defeat would have been welcome news for Watford, who moved level on points with Rovers in 10th place by beating Swansea City 1-0 with a Moussa Sissoko goal. Both Blackburn and Watford are four points outside the play-off places.",
