The Hoops moved 13 points clear at the top of the Scottish Premiership with a dominant show of force at Celtic Park. Arne Engels and Adam Idah put Celtic in control before the break, with Daizen Maeda netting a quickfire double early in the second half. Engels then doubled his tally in the 71st minute, before Nicolas Kuhn rounded out the rout 10 minutes later. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland, Rodgers said: “[It was] definitely one of the best [performances] of our season. “From minute one to the 93rd minute we had a real hunger in our game and real quality in our game.
