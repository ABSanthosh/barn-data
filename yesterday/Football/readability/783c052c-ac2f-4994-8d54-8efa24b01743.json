  "text": "Competition: K League Market: Goal to be scored in both halves Odds: 19/20 @ 1xBet Looking to widen their buffer at the top of the K League standings on Saturday morning, Jeonbuk will welcome Seoul to to the Jeonju World Cup Stadium. Starting with the hosts, while Jeonbuk might have come under real scrutiny last season as they shockingly found themselves at the heart of a relegation scrap, Gus Poyet’s men have come roaring back in a remarkable fashion this time around. In the midst of what has become a sensational purple patch, the Greens are regarded as a landslide title contender in 2025 and they open this weekend’s fixtures holding a commanding eight-point buffer at the top of the table. Simply looking to lay down another marker on Saturday morning, the South Korean giants have put 41 points on the board from their 19 K League appearances so far this season. Last seen clinching an action-packed 3-2 victory at home against Suwon, the former Brighton boss has seen his high-flying squad win all of their previous four appearances by an aggregate score of 13-3. Likewise, extending on their Korean Cup charge on May 14th as they landed another 3-2 win against Daejeon, Jeonbuk have not suffered a single defeat across any competition since the middle of March. As for the visitors, while Seoul might have initially struggled to find any real fluidity when opening up the 2025 campaign, the Warriors have turned a recent corner. Despite being left frustrated last weekend as they eventually had to settle for a 1-1 stalemate at home against Gangwon, Kim Di-dong’s men are unbeaten in all of their previous nine appearances across all competitions – a run that stems back to May 3rd. Despite facing what will certainly be a stern examination this weekend, Saturday’s guests have continued to impress with their success on the road. Last seen on there travels clinching an impressive 3-1 victory against Gwangju, Seoul have won all of their previous four straight away fixtures by an aggregate score of 7-2. It should also be highlighted, the former Pohang boss has seen his squad suffer just a sole K League defeat away from the Seoul World Cup Stadium since the middle of February. Bet: Goal to be scored in both halves at Jeonbuk vs Seoul 19/20 for Saturday’s K League showdown @ 1xBet",
