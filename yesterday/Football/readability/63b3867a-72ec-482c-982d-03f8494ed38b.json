Guler has been limited to just six starts for Madrid in all competitions this season, while Endrick has only one start to his name. Brazil international Endrick has recently been linked with a move away to gain experience on loan, but Ancelotti insists he is going nowhere. “Endrick stays here, just like Guler,” he said at Monday’s pre-match news conference ahead of the Champions League clash with Atalanta. “They may need more minutes, but I don’t have any prejudices with anyone. I only try to put the best players out there for each match. “That’s regardless of whether they are 18 or 40 years old. Sometimes, that might mean playing without Endrick or Guler.” #UCL pic.twitter.com/xmTZB0ZkxN — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) December 9, 2024 Guler played 89 minutes and was on the scoresheet in Saturday’s 3-0 win at Girona, a game in which Endrick made a late appearance. Both players have featured in the Champions League this season and could be used against Europa League holders Atalanta on Tuesday. “We need to be patient with young players,” Ancelotti said. “They bring enthusiasm, but because they’re young, they also need to learn some things.”",
