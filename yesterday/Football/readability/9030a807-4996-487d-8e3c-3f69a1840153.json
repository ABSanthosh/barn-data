  "text": "Manchester City have announced Andree Jeglertz as their new head coach. Jeglertz is leading Denmark through Euro 2025 but will join the Women’s Super League club at the conclusion of the tournament. City had parted ways with Gareth Taylor during the 2024-25 season after failing to mount a title challenge, with Nick Cushing brought in as his replacement on an interim basis. Jeglertz has been in charge of Denmark since September 2023 and has won 13 of his 22 games in charge (D1 L8). He boasts a win rate of 59.1% with the national team, with his side scoring 41 goals during his tenure and conceding 30. We are delighted to confirm that Andrée Jeglertz has agreed to become the new Head Coach of Manchester City Women.  The 53-year-old Swedish coach and former professional player will join the Club from the Denmark women’s national football team after this summer’s Euros. — Manchester City Women (@ManCityWomen) July 3, 2025 “I’m honoured to be part of this big and great club,” he told City’s media channels. “Manchester City are one of the biggest in the world, but also the way that Therese [Sjogran, City Women Director of Football] and Charlotte [O’Neill, Managing Director of City Women] are presenting the club, what it stands for, what they want from a coach and everything that’s connected to football, there are a lot of things that make me excited about the job. “I’m extremely excited to meet the players, the staff and, of course, the fans. I will do everything I can to take this to the next level and continue the journey that has been started, making sure we can play attractive and winning football.” Jeglertz also won the UEFA Women’s Cup – which later became the Champions League – with Swedish side Umea in 2004, a club where he was also a two-time winner of the Damallsvenskan Manager of the Year award. City finished fourth in the WSL last season, missing out on Champions League qualification by a single point.",
