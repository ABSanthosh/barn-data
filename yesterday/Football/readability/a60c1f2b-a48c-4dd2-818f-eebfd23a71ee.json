League phase leaders Liverpool have six wins from six matches after defeating Girona 1-0 on Tuesday, although they relied on a second-half Mohamed Salah to take all three points. And with returning goalkeeper Alisson kept busy in the first half, Slot did not hide his disappointment with the Reds’ display. “If you ask me about all the six games, I’m really pleased with all the results,” said the new Liverpool boss. “I’m really pleased with the [first] five games the way we played; I’m far from pleased about the performance tonight.” Asked to identify exactly what he was unhappy with, Slot replied: “A lot.
