Milan are eighth in the standings with 41 points, eight behind Juventus in fourth with 12 games remaining. Bologna had to do it the hard way on Thursday, coming from behind after Rafael Leao’s goal two minutes before half-time in a contest that was rescheduled after it was called off in October due to flooding. Milan were pegged back three minutes into the second half when a free-kick into the box was flicked on by Giovanni Fabbian was headed home by Santiago Castro. The Rossoneri protested, appealing for handball, but the VAR confirmed the goal. Yunus Musah nearly restored Milan’s lead just after the hour mark, but Lukasz Skorupski made a crucial save. Nicolo Casale headed against the post and Nicolo Cambiaghi sent the rebound over the bar, but the latter atoned for his miss eight minutes from time. Cambiaghi sent in a cross from the byline, with Dan Ndoye on hand to turn home at full stretch, sealing Bologna’s first Serie A win over Milan since 2016, and their first at home since 2002. 1 – #Bologna have won a home match against #ACMilan in #SerieA for the first time since 10 March 2002 (2-0, scored by Salvatore Fresi and Julio Cruz). Wait.#BolognaMilan — OptaPaolo (@OptaPaolo) February 27, 2025 Data Debrief: Golden boy Castro strikes again Castro has been a standout performer for Bologna this term, as Vincenzo Italiano’s team hunt European football. The Argentine became only the second non-Italian player to net at least seven Serie A goals for Bologna in a single season before turning 21, after Harald Nielsen in 1962-63 (seven) and 1961-62 (eight). Of players in Europe’s top five leagues to have been involved in at least 10 goals, only Barcelona and Spain star Lamine Yamal is younger than Castro, who has also provided four assists. Leao, meanwhile, took his chance when it came for Milan, scoring with his one shot, as the visitors only created opportunities worth 0.62 expected goals, compared to Bologna’s 1.98 xG. After being criticised by coach Sergio Conceicao recently, Leao netted his sixth league goal of the season, with all of those strikes having come away from home.",
