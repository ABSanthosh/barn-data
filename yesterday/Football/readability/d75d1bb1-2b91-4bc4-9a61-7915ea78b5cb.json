  "text": "Producing what was another sensational late comeback on Tuesday night, England booked their spot in the final of this summer’s European Championships as they snatched a 2-1 victory against Italy in Geneva. In what was a similar story to last weekend’s epic quarter-final showdown against Sweden, the Lionesses drastically failed to find any kind of fluidity. Watching Barbara Bonansea open the scoring for Italy just after the half-hour mark, Sarina Wiegman once again cut a frustrated figure as her defending European champions flattered to deceive. However, watching 19-year-old sensation Michelle Agyemang come off the bench and snatch another dramatic last-gasp equaliser, England were seconds away from more penalty shootout drama. Although England might have failed to find top gear in Geneva, it was Chloe Kelly who fired the Lionesses to Sunday’s showpiece event as the Manchester City ace converted her last-minute penalty at the second attempt. Now just 90 minutes away from retaining their European crown, England will be keeping a close eye on proceedings in 24 hours as Germany and tournament favourites Spain meet in the second semi-final showdown. On what was another thriller from the Stade de Geneve on Tuesday night, we have taken a look at the main talking points as England punch their EURO 25 final ticket. England drag themselves over the finishing line again Only seconds away from officially relinquishing their European crown, many across the continent will be wondering just how England have managed to drag themselves to the final of this summer’s tournament. Getting their EURO 25 adventure underway on July 7th with a 2-1 loss at the hands of France, it is fair to say that the defending European champions have largely flattered to deceive so far this summer. However, with it certainly starting to feel like fate is on their side, England deserve plenty of praise for their never die attitude and the Lionesses travel to Basel on Sunday just 90 minutes away from shattering more records. Producing a pair of iconic knoutout stage comebacks over the past few days, the former Netherlands boss will have quite the selection headache on her hands ahead of Sunday’s date with destiny. Despite failing to find any kind of fluidity over in Switzerland this summer, Tuesday’s latest great escape would have only filled Wiegman’s camp with even more confidence. Agyemang’s rise to superstardom continues Only earning a single England cap ahead of this summer’s tournament, there is no doubt that Agyemang’s inclusion in Wiegman’s squad was considered as a real wildcard selection. Nevertheless, despite only featuring for five minutes during England’s three group stage appearances, the 19-year-old has quickly become the Lionesses poster girl and has suddenly become a key figure in Wiegman’s camp. Coming off the bench and proving to be England’s hero against Sweden last week, Arsenal’s youngster wrote a similar script on Tuesday night as she continued her rise to superstardom. Enjoying what has become a real fairytale over in Switzerland this summer, it is no surprise that Agyemang looks set to earn a first England start in Basel this weekend. Exploding onto the international scene after spending last season on loan at WSL outfit Brighton, the Lionesses latest budding starlet has already written herself into English folklore. Spain or Germany await in Basel While England might have rode their luck for large spells this summer as they dragged themselves to Basel, the Lionesses will be bracing themselves for a monumental challenge. Since clinching a maiden World Cup crown back in 2023, Spain have embarked on a remarkable silverware sweep and have only further cemented their spot as world football’s most feared international squad. Almost universally regarded as the pre-tournament favourites this summer, La Roja have continued to shatter a string of records over the past two years. However, while Germany might open Wednesday’s semi-final pencilled in as a real underdog contender, they will certainly be excited by a dominant record against their bitter European rivals. Including a 1-0 victory when they last met Spain at the Olympic Games last summer, they are unbeaten in all of their seven battles across all competitions (four wins, three draws).
