  "text": "If Arsenal lose to Crystal Palace in the Premier League on Wednesday, Liverpool will be crowned champions, but Mikel Arteta says that is not an added incentive to win. The Gunners are 13 points off the leaders with five games left, meaning that even if they do beat Palace, they will miss out on the title for the third consecutive season if the Reds beat Tottenham on Sunday. Arsenal are unbeaten in their last 11 matches in all competitions (W6 D5) and got back to winning ways in the Premier League with a 4-0 victory over Ipswich Town on Sunday, denying Liverpool a chance to claim the title later that day. Arteta’s side also have a Champions League semi-final coming up against Paris Saint-Germain next week, but the Spaniard is not thinking about rotation, with his full focus on prolonging Liverpool’s title celebrations once more. “Our incentive is to win our game and to do our best to continue with our run that we are in right now, the rest we cannot control,” he said. “[We have to] earn the right to win the game [on Wednesday] against a really good side. “They have a really good record away from home as well, and after that, we have time to prepare [for PSG] really well.” of the London derby charts For the third season in a row we are set to pick up the most points in the capital — Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 22, 2025 Arteta also confirmed Bukayo Saka’s injury was “nothing serious” and that he should be available for Wednesday’s match. This game has been pushed forward due to Palace’s involvement in the FA Cup semi-final against Aston Villa on Saturday, but their form has stalled in recent weeks. Since their quarter-final win over Fulham, the Eagles have won just one of their five Premier League games (L2 D2). They drew 0-0 with Bournemouth last weekend despite Chris Richards’ sending-off, a much-needed clean sheet after conceding five goals against both Manchester City and Newcastle United prior to that. Wednesday will see Eddie Nketiah return to the Emirates again following his transfer last year, and Oliver Glasner admitted he feels “sad” that his effort has not seen more rewards. “It’s not time to sum up Eddie’s season now, but he’s so hard-working,” said Glasner. “Sometimes I feel a little bit sad for him, personally, when I see all his effort. “It looks like, sometimes, things don’t go well for him. I see him every day working. “And there will come a day when he gets paid for all his effort. For me, it feels like they didn’t come until now.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Arsenal – Declan Rice Declan Rice has had a hand in seven goals in his last eight appearances at the Emirates (four goals, three assists). In all competitions, only Bukayo Saka (15) and Kai Havertz (14) have more goals and assists combined than Rice on home soil for the Gunners this season (11 – five goals, six assists). Crystal Palace – Jean-Philippe Mateta Jean-Philippe Mateta has been involved in five goals in his last seven Premier League London derbies (four goals, one assist), scoring in three this season against Tottenham, Chelsea and West Ham. Only three Eagles players have scored in four games in one season – Andrew Johnson in 2004-05 (six), Jordan Ayew in 2019-20 (four), and Christian Benteke in 2020-21 (four).
