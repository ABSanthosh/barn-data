  "text": "While Manchester United might have gone about it the hard way on Thursday night, Ruben Amorim did claim a maiden victory in the Old Trafford dugout as his new squad snatched a 3-2 victory against Bodo/Glimt. Getting off to what was a dream start as Alejandro Garnacho tapped home in the opening seconds following Nikita Khaikin’s howler when trying to play out from the back, it appeared that United were set for a routine night on home soil. However, much like their 1-1 stalemate away at Ipswich last weekend, Amorim’s new squad suffered a real collapse as Hakon Evjen and former Watford star Philip Zinckernagel completed a remarkable turnaround in the space of just four minutes. With the atmosphere in Old Trafford taking a drastic turn in the blink of an eye, United will be thanking Rasmus Hojlund for dragging them past what was a real Europa League banana skin. Watching the Danish international produce a sublime finish just moments before the half-time break, the former Atalanta youngster handed Amorim his maiden victory as he tapped home from close range just five minuets after the restart. On a night when Manchester United handed their dreams of a top-eight finish a real boost, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Old Trafford. Amorim gets his United tenure underway Missing out on the chance to make an immediate statement last weekend as they marked their return from November’s international break with a 1-1 stalemate at Portman Road, Amorim was desperate to get his Old Trafford tenure officially underway here. With the Portuguese tactician making it abundantly clear that his new philosophy and ideas will take time before they are fully implemented, Amorim would have simply been glad to put a maiden victory on the board here. However, although his new squad might have mounted an essential Europa League comeback on Thursday night, the former Sporting Lisbon boss will be more than aware that there are plenty of issues that still need resolving. With Bodo/Glimt asking a string of questions on either side of the half-time break and feeling like they should have left Old Trafford with at least a point to show for their troubles, Amorim will be desperately seeking some defensive stability. Along with throwing away the lead away at relegation scrappers Ipswich last weekend as they opened Amorim’s tenure with a single point in Norfolk, Man United have now registered just a trio of clean sheets from any of their previous 13 appearances across all competitions. Hojlund saves the day at Old Trafford With the January transfer window fast approaching on the horizon, it has been heavily speculated over the past couple of weeks that Amorim is keen on bringing in a new striking option. Watching summer recruit Joshua Zirkzee get left as an unused substitute here and drastically fail to make any kind of impact since arriving at Old Trafford, there are suggestions that Amorim is desperate for a reunion with Sporting Lisbon record-breaker Viktor Gyokeres. However, handed a full recall here, Hojlund certainly took his opportunity with a clinical performance on Thursday night and was undeniably both Manchester United and Amorim’s saviour. Producing a pair of smart finishes on either side of the half-time break and drawing a line under his nine-match draught for club and country, the 21-year-old will be desperate to use his Man of the Match display as a platform to build on. Registering just a single Premier League strike so far this season after enduring a frustrating start to the new campaign, Hojlund should keep his spot leading the line when Everton arrive at Old Trafford on Sunday lunchtime. Bodo/Glimt must take positives from their frustrations While Bodo/Glimt might have arrived at Old Trafford on Thursday night pencilled in as a landslide underdog, the Norwegian giants have consistently proven that they can ask some real questions against any of Europe’s biggest names. Getting their Europa League adventure underway with a famous 3-2 victory against Portuguese heavyweights Porto on September 25th, Kjetil Knutsen’s men were smelling the chance to be Amorim’s ultimate party spoiler here. However, although the Yellows might have left Old Trafford heartbroken following their collapse in Manchester, they should take plenty of positives away from what was an eye-catching performance on foreign soil. Causing United’s leaky defence a string of issues and with many feeling that they deserved to leave with a point to show for their troubles, Bodo/Glimt must dust themselves down quickly as they face what is another blockbuster battle this weekend. Signing off their Eliteserien campaign on Sunday afternoon when they welcome Lillestrom to the Aspmyra Stadion, Knutsen’s side know that a victory this weekend will be enough to successfully defend their domestic crown.
