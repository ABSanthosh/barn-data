  "text": "Bayern Munich boss Vincent Kompany quipped Harry Kane is “just unusual” when it comes to his goalscoring prowess. Kane netted twice as Bayern survived a late scare to see off Holstein Kiel 4-3 on Saturday. He has now scored 55 Bundesliga goals in his first 50 games in the competition, setting a new record in Germany’s top flight for the number of goals scored across a player’s first 50 matches. “His quality is just unusual,” Kompany said of Kane. “But it is also his mentality. How calm he remains, how hard he works if sometimes he does not score for a game. It is impressive.” Kane ended the contest having had more shots on target (three) than any of his team-mates. The England captain has now only scored more goals against Stuttgart and Augsburg (both six) than he has against Kiel during his time in the Bundesliga. 54 – In his 50th Bundesliga appearance, Bayern München’s Harry Kane has scored his 54th goal – no other player has managed to score as many goals in his first 50 BL appearances. Star. #FCBKSV pic.twitter.com/QilQZdUy5r — OptaFranz (@OptaFranz) February 1, 2025 “It was fun, it was a good game for me,” Kane said. “The goals before and immediately after half-time were crucial for us. February will be very important for us, with many games against strong opponents, we have to be ready for that. We’ll need the full squad for it.” Kompany, meanwhile, was far from impressed with how his team finished the match, with Bayern conceding twice late on. “Of course, I think for us for 80 minutes, to be able to lead at home 4-1 it was a pretty complete game until that point. “The way we finished the game in the last 10 minutes is something we need to review with the players. “You can sometimes concede a goal but if you concede momentum you give the other team a chance and that is what happened.”",
