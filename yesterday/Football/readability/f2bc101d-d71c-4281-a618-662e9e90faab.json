The report has claimed that the Premier League club’s manager Arne Slot personally wants the Morocco international winger at Anfield. Diaz joined Madrid from Manchester City in 2019 and was on loan at AC Milan from 2020 until 2023. Since his return to the Santiago Bernabeu, the Morocco international winger has failed to establish himself in the starting lineup, but he has been a valuable member of the squad. The 25-year-old, who can also play as an attacking midfielder, has scored 12 goals and provided nine assists in 45 matches for Madrid this season. Madrid are at the top of the La Liga table at the moment with 50 points from 23 matches, just a point ahead of second-placed and city rivals Atletico Madrid. Los Blancos will face defending Premier League champions Manchester City over two legs in the playoffs to qualify for the Round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League.",
