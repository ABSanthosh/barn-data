  "text": "Son Heung-min says his desire to stay at Tottenham has been driven by an ambition to achieve a feat others could not, as he targets Europa League glory. Ange Postecoglou’s side face Manchester United in the Europa League final on May 21, with the winner securing Champions League qualification for next season. Spurs have not lifted any form of silverware since winning the EFL Cup in 2008, while their last European success came through the UEFA Cup in 1984. South Korea star Son acknowledged ending Spurs’ 17-year trophy drought as one of the primary factors for staying in north London. “We’ve been talking about this for years,” Son said, as quoted by The Guardian. “The biggest reason I stayed at Tottenham was because I wanted to do something others couldn’t achieve. “That’s probably why I’m where I am now. You need all the pieces to complete a puzzle. I think I’ve gathered all the other pieces to make that puzzle complete. “I’ve been missing that one most important, final piece, and I’ve been trying to find it for the past 10 years. I really hope I can finally complete the puzzle this time. “Every game is special and meaningful. But this game [against United] feels like an opportunity that may not come back. It feels different this time. “I really want to win, more than anyone else. So many people are supporting us with the same desperate passion I feel. If we prepare well, I believe we can achieve it.” pic.twitter.com/c7aKzMThfJ — Tottenham Hotspur (@SpursOfficial) May 11, 2025 Son has been close to silverware at Spurs, having also lost the Champions League final to Liverpool in 2019 and suffering defeat against Manchester City in the EFL Cup final two years later. Postecoglou’s side may be struggling in the Premier League, where they sit 17th after Sunday’s drab 2-0 defeat to London rivals Crystal Palace, but they have enjoyed their European outings this term. Tottenham have won nine matches in the Europa League this season (D3 L2), their most ever victories in the same campaign across major European competition. A 2-0 win in the second leg of the semi-finals against Bodo/Glimt also made back-to-back away wins in major European competition for the first time since November 2013. Son sat out that win over Bodo/Glimt, only just returning to the bench for the defeat against Palace after a month-long lay-off with a foot issue. “I have to say I’m OK because I want our fans, as well as those who support me, to feel at ease while watching the game,” he added. “So, I will always say that I’m fine. And I will be fine.”",
