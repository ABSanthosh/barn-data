Hansi Flick’s Blaugrana had recorded their own 1-0 win against Mallorca 24 hours earlier, meaning Carlo Ancelotti’s men needed these three precious points to keep their title hopes alive. Guler’s 20th-minute effort from the edge of the box proved enough after Ancelotti decided to rest several key players ahead of Saturday’s Copa del Rey final against Barca. Madrid still dominated much of the match but failed to capitalise on opportunities to extend their lead, with a goal-line clearance denying Endrick. The narrow lead set up a tense finale, and a 91st-minute scramble saw Peter Federico and Juanmi fail to force the ball over the line. Thibaut Courtois bravely intervened to keep Madrid in the title picture with five matches to play. Data debrief: Late drama almost Madrid’s undoing The full-time expected goals figures weigh heavily in Getafe’s favour, yet that is primarily due to one manic incident in the first minute of stoppage time. More than half of Getafe’s 2.32 xG was accounted for by the chances that fell to Peter and Juanmi, with Courtois scooping the first away and then diving in front of the second. The hosts tallied five Opta-defined ‘big chances’ across the full game, but that was Madrid’s narrowest escape in a contest of fine margins. Ancelotti’s side are really scraping by to stay within reach of Barca, with this their third straight 1-0 success. 3 – Real Madrid have won three consecutive LaLiga games by 1-0 for the second time in the last 33 years, following a three-game winning streak in July 2020.
