  "text": "Verdict: Netherlands to score in both halves Best Odds: 11/10 Bookmaker: Luckster Finally getting their World Cup qualifying adventure underway on Saturday night, the Netherlands will travel to Helsinki when they meet Finland. Finland Starting with the hosts, while Finland might have opened their World Cup qualifying campaign with a hard-fought 1-0 victory away at Malta, it appears that was just a minor boost for Jacob Friis’ camp. Coming under a huge amount of scrutiny last year as they remarkably lost all of their six Nations League appearances by an aggregate score of 13-2, the Eagle Owls have endured a public crisis over recent times. Last seen suffering a major collapse away at Lithuania as they eventually had to settle for a 2-2 stalemate, Finland have mustered just a sole win from any of their previous 10 consecutive outings across all competitions. Hit with a 2-0 loss when they last welcomed Holland to Helsinki back in 2011, Friis’ downbeat squad will be bracing themselves for a heavyweight challenge here. Finland Team News Making an emotional return to his homeland back in January and now playing his domestic football with HJK, former Norwich marksman Teemu Pukki should earn a record-breaking a 130th international cap. Ex-Leeds midfielder Glen Kamara has been included in Friis’ squad and should start in the middle of the park. While Lukas Hradecky might be expected to leave German giants Bayer Leverkusen this summer, the 35-year-old will keep his spot between the sticks. Opening his qualifying account away against Lithuania back on March 24th, Palermo striker Joel Pohjanpalo should play a leading role in the final third. Netherlands As for the visitors, while the Netherlands might have impressed many last summer as they booked a EURO 24 semi-final spot, it is fair to say that Ronald Koeman’s men have failed to find any recent fluidity. Suffering Nations League heartbreak at the hands of reigning European champions Spain on March 23rd, the former Barcelona boss has seen his squad muster just a single win from any of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Despite getting their Nations League adventure underway with an action-packed 5-2 win against Bosnia \u0026 Herzegovina back in September, Koeman will have a real headache over his side’s defensive struggles. In fact, Holland have mustered just a single clean sheet from their last nine consecutive outings. Nevertheless, excited to get their qualifying campaign underway on Saturday night, the Netherlands should be confident of laying down an early marker. Netherlands Team News Officially completing his move to Bayer Leverkusen earlier in the week, former Brentford goalkeeper Mark Flekken should start between the sticks here. Likewise, arriving at newly-crowned Premier League champions Liverpool last week, Jeremie Frimpong will feature in Helsinki and join new teammate Virgil van Dijk at the back. While Memphis Depay might have failed to make any real impact since arriving at Brazilian giants Corinthians last year, the 31-year-old has been included in Koeman’s squad. Helping Barcelona complete a famous silverware sweep this season, Frenkie de Jong will start in the middle of the park. Key Factors to Consider When the Netherlands last travelled to Helsinki back in 2011, Holland collected what was a routine 2-0 victory. The Netherlands are unbeaten in all of their 11 historic showdowns against Finland (10 wins, one draw). Along with losing all of their six Nations League appearances last year, Finland have recorded just a sole win from their previous 10 outings across all fronts. Likewise, Finland have failed to record a single competitive win on home soil since back in November 2023. Holland have recorded just a single clean sheet from their last nine appearances across all competitions. Conclusion Suffering real Nations League heartbreak at the hands of Spain in March, Holland will be desperate to get their World Cup qualifying adventure underway with an early statement. Despite their recent defensive struggles, the European giants should be excited by a trip to Helsinki on Saturday night. Landing a 2-0 win when they last travelled to their Group G rivals back in 2011, they will meet a Finland squad who find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Verdict: Netherlands to score in both halves Best Odds: 11/10 Bookmaker: Luckster",
