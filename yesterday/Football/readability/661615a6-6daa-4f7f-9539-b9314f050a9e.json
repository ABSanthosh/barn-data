Dallas’ slump, which began with a 4-2 home defeat against the ‘Quakes on June 25, has seen them slide to 13th in the Western Conference. With 21 points from 21 matches this season, they are six points off the playoff picture and eight from the automatic postseason spots. Nathan Ordaz and Denis Bouanga struck to condemn Dallas to defeat at BMO Stadium on Saturday, but Quill felt there were positives for his team to take. “I thought we started pretty brightly, then that first goal came off our mistake in the build-up and it changed the game,” Quill said. “We were growing, I thought, before that moment. But that led to the game flipping on its head and the crowd got into it. The momentum changed in their favour, and that’s what you don’t want to do. “It’s unfortunate, what mistakes can do, but I thought there was a good hustle and energy to us. “We’ve got to put this one behind us fast and move on to the next one. We only played them [San Jose] recently, so they’re fresh in our minds.” pic.twitter.com/to43tpz32e — FC Dallas (@FCDallas) July 13, 2025 San Jose are seven points clear of Dallas in eighth, currently occupying one of two play-in spots in the West. Bruce Arena’s team have failed to win since beating Dallas last month, though, recording two straight draws before they were hammered 4-1 at Minnesota United on Saturday. PLAYERS TO WATCH San Jose Earthquakes – Cristian Arango Arango has scored seven goals in six career matches against Dallas. His 1.27 goals per 90 minutes is the highest rate of any player that has played 450 or more minutes against Dallas in regular-season play. FC Dallas – Luciano Acosta Acosta has recorded nine career assists against the Earthquakes in regular-season play, averaging 1.55 assists per 90 minutes against San Jose. That average is the highest for any player that has played 350 or more minutes against a single opponent since Acosta joined MLS in 2016. MATCH PREDICTION – SAN JOSE EARTHQUAKES Dallas have lost four straight matches for the first time since March 2024, while they last dropped five straight matches in all competitions between September and October 2011. After winning just one of the previous 10 meetings between the sides (seven draws, two defeats), San Jose have won back-to-back matches against Dallas, including their 4-2 road victory on June 25. Both teams have scored in each of the last 11 meetings between the sides dating back to June 2019. San Jose have not lost any of their last eight home matches in all competitions (three wins, five draws), though the last four have ended in draws, including a penalty shoot-out defeat to Austin FC in the US Open Cup. Prior to this run, San Jose had not gone more than two straight at home without a loss since the start of the 2024 season. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY San Jose Earthquakes – 46% FC Dallas – 27.3% Draw – 26.7%",
