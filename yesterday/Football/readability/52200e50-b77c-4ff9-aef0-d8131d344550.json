  "text": "Juventus’ new signing Randal Kolo Muani is set to make his debut in Saturday’s Serie A game at Napoli, head coach Thiago Motta revealed on Friday. Juve signed France forward Kolo Muani from Paris Saint-Germain on loan on Thursday, making him their second signing of the January transfer window after the arrival of right-back Alberto Costa. “Randal is available and we’ll see if he starts or not. It’s important to have taken a player of his level because we think he can help the team win games,” Motta told reporters. Juve’s reinforcements have come at the right time, with defenders Bremer and Juan Cabal suffering anterior cruciate ligament injuries and striker Arkadiusz Milik also a long-term absentee. “The integration of the new arrivals is going very well. Tomorrow everyone will be there except Bremer, Cabal and Milik,” Motta said. Meanwhile, Dusan Vlahovic is likely to be on the bench for the third time in a row on Saturday after Motta said the 24-year-old is battling fitness issues. The Serbia international has also been linked with a transfer this month, with Chelsea and Arsenal touted as potential landing spots. “Randal and Nico (Gonzalez) can play on the wing. Dusan played a lot and had a physical problem. We will see for tomorrow who will start and who will enter the match,” Motta added. The Bianconeri are the only unbeaten side remaining in Serie A, but 13 draws in 21 games have left them fifth in the standings and 13 points off leaders Napoli. Motta said Antonio Conte’s Partenopei are “deservedly in first place”, but added his own players are in confident mood after overcoming AC Milan last time out. “I am satisfied with many things and others less so, such as the many draws, but I have already talked about this. Our idea is always to do a great job during the week to get the win,” Motta said. “There have been many changes in the squad, changes are necessary for different reasons. Tomorrow we will play a great match which is Napoli against Juventus.”",
