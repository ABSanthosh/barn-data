  "text": "An unlikely late double from substitute Pascal Struijk earned Leeds United a dramatic 2-1 victory over Sunderland to send Daniel Farke’s side back to the Championship summit. The victory saw Leeds extend their unbeaten run to 15 league matches, and are now seven points clear of third-placed Burnley with 13 games to play. Though Leeds dominated the opening exchanges, Sunderland almost went ahead early on, but Jobe Bellingham’s effort was saved down low by Illan Meslier. Wilson Isidor then fired the visitors ahead in the 32nd minute, collecting Dan Ballard’s long ball before holding off Ethan Ampadu and firing his shot in with the help of the left post. Leeds came close to an equaliser in first-half stoppage time when Daniel James was picked out inside the box, only for the Welshman to see his strike cleared off the line. Farke’s side had not been behind at the break in a league match at Elland Road since their only home defeat this season by Burnley in September, and rallied after the interval. Leeds eventually got the goal their performance merited in the 78th minute when Joe Rothwell’s teasing free-kick into the box was met with a glancing header from Struijk. And in the fourth minute of second-half stoppage time, Rothwell and Struijk combined once again, with the latter heading home from close range to seal a huge three points. WHAT AN ENDING!!! pic.twitter.com/lefeyXm8P1 — Leeds United (@LUFC) February 17, 2025 Data Debrief: The sign of champions Leeds’ unbeaten stretch at Elland Road looked under threat having struggled to break down Sunderland’s stern defensive rearguard, but a sign of champions is finding a way to win by whatever means possible. And that came through an unlikely source in defender Struijk, who ended the contest with a team-high expected goals (xG) total of 1.17, despite only replacing Ao Tanaka in the 71st minute. Leeds had only won one of their previous seven league games against Sunderland (D3 L3) heading into their encounter on Monday, and this victory could prove pivotal in their quest to return to the Premier League.",
