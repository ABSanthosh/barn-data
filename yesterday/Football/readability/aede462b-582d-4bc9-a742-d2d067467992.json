  "text": "Verdict: Raul Jimenez over 0.5 shots on target  Best Odds: 1/2 Bookmaker: Dachbet Turning their attention back to Premier League action on Sunday night, Manchester United will travel to Craven Cottage when they meet Fulham. Fulham Starting with the hosts, making an immediate return to winning ways last weekend, Fulham have continued to receive a string of plaudits this season. Landing a deserved 2-0 victory away at relegation scrappers Leicester, Marco Silva’s men have found a route back into the top-half of the table. With many around west London dreaming of the chance to mount a genuine European charge in 2025, the former Everton boss finds the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Despite falling to an action-packed 3-2 loss against West Ham earlier in the month, that is the only defeat that Fulham have suffered from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions. Extending on their FA Cup adventure on January 9th as they stormed their way to a 4-1 romp against Championship outfit Watford, Sunday’s hosts will certainly be smelling the chance to claim a heavyweight scalp here. Fulham Team News Not making a single appearance since December 5th, Arsenal loanee Reiss Nelson is still dealing with a thigh injury. However, recently returning from a knock, former Southampton midfielder Harrison Reed could make a first Premier League appearance since the start of November. Coming off the bench and recording a second Premier League goal of the season away at Leicester last weekend, Adama Traore could be handed a full recall in west London. Notching four goals in his previous five matchups across all competitions, ex-Wolves strikes Raul Jimenez will lead the line here. Manchester United As for the visitors, eventually snatching a 2-1 victory against Scottish giants Rangers earlier in the week, Manchester United will know that they avoided what would have been another Old Trafford nightmare. Although there might have been plenty of excitement following Ruben Amorim’s arrival back in November, the Reds have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability under the former Sporting Lisbon boss. Coming under a huge amount of scrutiny last weekend as they fell to a 3-1 drumming at home against Brighton, the Portuguese tactician has made his frustrations clear. Battling it out in the bottom-half of the Premier League table and breaking a string of unwanted records this season, Sunday’s guests have recorded just a single top-flight victory away from Old Trafford since the middle of September. Despite claiming an essential European boost in midweek, United could have another tough challenge on their hands here. Manchester United Team News While Marcus Rashford might have returned to first-team training earlier in the week, it remains to be seen if the England international will feature at Craven Cottage. Likewise, all still dealing with respective injury issues, the likes of Luke Shaw and former Chelsea star Mason Mount remain on the sidelines. Settling for a spot on the bench against Rangers on Thursday night, Kobbie Mainoo should make a full return in the middle of the park. Now finding the net in three of his previous four appearances across all competitions, midfield talisman Bruno Fernandes will play a leading role in west London. Fulham vs Manchester United Key Factors to Consider When Fulham and Manchester United met for their reverse Premier League showdown on August 16th, the Red Devils collected a late 1-0 win at Old Trafford. However, Sunday’s guests have recorded just a single Premier League win away from Old Trafford since the middle of September. Fulham have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions. Man United have failed to record a clean sheet from any of their last 13 consecutive appearances. Six of the last eight meetings between Fulham and Manchester United have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion While Manchester United might have avoided a Europa League banana skin on Thursday night, the Reds will have a stern examination on their hands here. Showing some extended defensive issues and recording just a single Premier League victory away from Old Trafford since the middle of September, Amorim’s side will meet a Fulham squad who have their sights set on mounting a European charge. Landing a 2-0 win against Leicester last weekend and suffering just a sole defeat across any competition from their last 11 consecutive outings, the Cottagers will be confident of testing a leaky United defence.
