Salernitana Starting with the hosts, putting in what was a toothless performance last weekend as they slumped to a deserved 2-0 loss in Liguria, Salernitana are facing a major uphill battle on Sunday night. With a real mountain to climb in their bid to book an immediate Serie A return this weekend, the Maroons have collected consecutive victories on just a single occasion since the start of December. However, despite having a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders here, Pasquale Marino’s men will be excited to make a return to home soil. Last seen at the Stadio Arechi landing a 2-0 win against Mantova on May 4th, Salernitana have won their previous three straight showdowns in Campania by an aggregate score of 7-2. Likewise, Sunday’s hosts have suffered just a sole Serie B defeat in front of their own supporters since the middle of January. Salernitana Team News Shown a late red card in Liguria last weekend, Slovenian international Petar Stojanovic will miss out on Sunday night. Not making a single appearance across any competition since way back on January 18th, ex-Manchester City youngster Jayden Braaf remains on the sidelines. Completing a loan switch from Fiorentina during the January transfer window, Lorenzo Amatucci will partner Australian international Ajdin Hrustic in the middle of the park. Despite notching just a single strike so far this calendar year, Franco Tongya should keep his spot alongside ex-Parma striker Simy in the final third. Sampdoria As for the visitors, whole Sampdoria might have found themselves in a real battle to keep hold of their Serie B status last season, Albercio Evani’s side have come roaring back in a sensational fashion this time around. Claiming what was a crucial first-leg advantage last weekend as they clinched that 2-0 victory in Liguria, the Blues will be desperately seeking a repeat performance here. However, although Sunday’s guests might be just 90 minuets from booking a famous top-flight return, they have struggled to find any kind of stability on their travels. Signing off the 2024/25 campaign with a downbeat 0-0 stalemate against Juve Stabia, Sampdoria have failed to win any of their last 15 consecutive appearances away from the Stadio Luigi Ferraris across all competitions – a rut that stems all the way back to October 20th. Sampdoria Team News Shown a last-gasp red card last weekend, Sampdoria will be unable to call upon former Liverpool marksman Fabio Borini on Sunday night. Likewise, not making a single appearance since the end of November, one-time Bologna defender Simone Romagnoli remains on the sidelines. Completing a permanent switch from Juventus last summer, Alessandro Riccio will start at the heart of Salernitana’s defence this weekend. Bagging a first-leg strike last week, former Manchester United youngster Melle Meulensteen will keep his spot in the middle of the park. Salernitana vs Sampdoria Key Factors to Consider When Salernitana and Sampdoria met for their first-leg showdown last weekend, Sunday’s guests collected a 2-0 victory in Liguria. However, Sampdoria have failed to win any of their last 15 consecutive appearances away from the Stadio Luigi Ferraris across all competitions – a rut that stems all the way back to October 20th. Salernitana have won their previous three straight showdowns in Campania by an aggregate score of 7-2. Likewise, Sunday’s hosts have suffered just a sole Serie B defeat in front of their own supporters since the middle of January. Sampdoria have drawn a blank in three of their previous four away fixtures. Conclusion While Sampdoria might open Sunday’s second-leg showdown holding a 2-0 advantage, the Blues will be concerned by their glaring issues on the road. Remarkably failing to win any of their last 15 straight appearances away from the Stadio Luigi Ferraris across all competitions, it is far from job done for Evani’s camp. With Salernitana winning all of their previous three matchups in front of their own supporters by an aggregate score of 7-2, they will be confident of completing an iconic turnaround in Campania. Verdict: Salernitana draw no bet Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
