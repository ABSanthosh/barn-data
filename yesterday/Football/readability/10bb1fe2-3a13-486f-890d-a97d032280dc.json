  "text": "Milan managed a 1-0 win at Monza thanks to a first-half header from Tijjani Reijnders on Saturday. Midfielder Reijnders scored two minutes before half-time in the Serie A contest when he nodded home after Alvaro Morata’s header was blocked. Monza had wasted some decent openings before Milan went ahead, with Mike Maignan making a fine save to deny Pedro Pereira while Dany Mota had a goal disallowed. Reijnders almost made it 2-0 after the break, but his deflected effort was kept out by Stefano Turati. Monza goalkeeper Turati made another stop later on, this time to deny Rafael Leao, who scuffed his finish at the end of a mazy run. Milan, who had 18 shots and accumulated 2.5 expected goals (xG), were not made to pay for that profligacy, though, as they got back on track after their defeat to Napoli, though the Rossoneri sit seventh, eight behind the Serie A leaders.

It was the Dutch international’s first league goal of the season, and capped a fine performance in which he also played two key passes and completed 44 of his 46 passes, with a team-leading 14 of those played in the final third.",
