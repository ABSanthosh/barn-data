  "text": "Real Madrid are not satisfied with reaching the Club World Cup semi-finals, as Aurelien Tchouameni set his sights on silverware. Madrid take on European champions Paris Saint-Germain in a heavyweight clash at MetLife Stadium on Wednesday. The victor will face Chelsea in the final on Sunday. Los Blancos drew with Al-Hilal in their first match, but have clicked through the gears and overcame Borussia Dortmund and Juventus in the knockouts. Madrid have never lost a Club World Cup match (W17 D3 L0) and have won 15 of their last 16 matches in the competition, dating back to 2014, and Tchouameni has no plans for that record to end. Speaking to RM Play, the France international said: “We’re working very well to prepare for the PSG game. We’re delighted to be in the semi-finals, but we want more. “We have to win the game against PSG, and we’re going to give our all, fight to win to stay in the competition.” 4- Gonzalo García is the first Real Madrid player to score four goals in a single edition of the @FIFACWC since Cristiano Ronaldo in 2016 (including previous formats). Future. pic.twitter.com/DQUbIVB2oE — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) July 5, 2025 Even for a team of Madrid’s quality, facing this PSG side is a daunting task. Among teams who compete in Europe’s top five leagues, only Barcelona (174) have scored more goals than PSG (152) in all competitions since the start of the 2024-25 season. In that same time, PSG have recorded the most expected goals (xG) – 145.6 – of any team from Europe’s top five leagues. Indeed, Luis Enrique’s team faced 13 shots in their quarter-final win over Bayern Munich, but allowed a total xG of just 0.6. “PSG are a good team, with a lot of players I know personally,” Tchouameni continued. “They’re a top team in world football, recently winning the Champions League. It’s going to be a difficult game, but we have the quality to win it and we have to show that.” PSG and Madrid have met 12 times before, with Los Blancos holding the slight advantage, with five wins to four. Both teams have scored 16 goals over the encounters. Madrid did not win a major trophy in the 2024-25 season, but success at the Club World Cup would be the ideal start for new boss Xabi Alonso. “Day by day, we understand more and more what the coach and his staff want,” Tchouameni said of Alonso. “We’re improving on and off the pitch in every game. We have to keep working and improving.”",
