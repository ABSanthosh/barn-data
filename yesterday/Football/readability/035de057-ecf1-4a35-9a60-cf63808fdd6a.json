  "text": "Verdict: Metz double chance Best Odds: 1/2 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Two camps who will know the importance of claiming a first-leg advantage on Wednesday night, Metz will welcome Reims to the Stade Saint-Symphorien. Metz Starting with the hosts, eventually forced to settle for a Ligue 2 bronze medal finish, Metz will be forced to go about things the hard way in the race to book a lucrative top-flight return. Extending on their play-off adventure last weekend as they clinched a 1-0 win at home against Dunkerque, Stephane Le Mignan’s side have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous 11 straight appearances against Ligue 2 opposition. Knowing the importance of claiming an essential first-leg advantage in midweek, Wednesday’s hosts should be excited by their rugged success in Lorraine. Including a sensational 5-1 romp against Annecy prior to March’s international break, Metz have suffered just a sole defeat in front of their own supporters so far this season. Metz Team News Not featuring since the end of March, Metz are once again expected to be without former Sunderland youngster Joel Asoro on Wednesday night. However, after serving a one-match suspension against Dunkerque last weekend, Senegal international Abou Lo could be handed a full recall. Make a timely return from a muscle issue, Strasbourg loanee Jessy Deminguet will parter Alpha Toure in the middle of the park. Notching 15 Ligue 2 strikes this season and finishing fourth in the Golden Boot chase, Cheikh Sabaly will lead the line. Reims As for the visitors, suffering late heartbreak away at Lille last weekend as they signed off the 2024/25 campaign with a 2-1 defeat, Reims have endured another public Ligue 1 struggle this season. Coming under a huge amount of scrutiny on May 10th as they slumped to a 2-0 loss at the hands of St. Etienne, Samba Diawara’s side lost each of their final three appearances by an aggregate score of 5-1. Getting May underway with a 1-0 defeat against Nice, Wednesday’s guests have shown some extended issues in the final third. In fact, Reims have notched just a single goal in over 400 minutes of action. It should also be highlighted, Diawara’s camp have recorded just a sole Ligue 1 victory on their travels since the start of November. Reims Team News Both still dealing with respective long-term knee injuries, Reims will once again be without the duo of Mohamed Daramy and Reda Khadra on Wednesday night. However, after serving a one-match suspension against Lille last weekend, Japan international Keito Nakamura could be handed a full recall. Completing a January switch from Portuguese outfit Gil Vicente, Mory Gbane will partner Amadou Kone in the middle of the park. Eintracht Frabkfurt loanee Buta should keep his spot at right-back. Metz vs Reims Key Factors to Consider When Metz and Reims last met back in March 2024, Wednesday’s guests collected a 2-1 victory at the Stade Auguste-Delaune. Reims lost each of their final three Ligue 1 appearances by an aggregate score of 5-1. Les Rouges recorded just a single Ligue 1 victory on their travels since the start of November. Metz have suffered just a single defeat at the Stade Saint-Symphorien across any competition so far this season. Wednesday’s hosts have recorded at least a pair of goals in seven of their last nine showdowns in Lorraine. Conclusion Desperate to book an immediate Ligue 1 return this month, Metz will know the importance of claiming a first-leg boost here. Extending on the play-off adventure last weekend as they snatched a last-gasp 1-0 win against Dunkerque, Wednesday’s hosts have continued to shine with their performances on home soil. Remarkably suffering just a single defeat at the Stade Saint-Symphorien so far this season, Metz will be confident of testing a Reims squad who will have a tremendous amount of pressure on their shoulders. Verdict: Metz double chance Best Odds: 1/2 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
