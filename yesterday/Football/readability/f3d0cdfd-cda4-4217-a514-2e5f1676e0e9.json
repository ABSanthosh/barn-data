  "text": "Bruno Guimaraes was the hero as Newcastle United boosted their Champions League qualifying hopes with a 1-0 win over West Ham. The Magpies skipper scored the only goal to settle a closely fought contest at the London Stadium, ahead of their EFL Cup final against Liverpool on Sunday. Alphonse Areola produced a magnificent save, springing to his right to thwart a spectacular Max Kilman own-goal in the 61st minute. However, the Hammers goalkeeper was left helpless two minutes later, as Guimaraes latched onto Harvey Barnes’ cross to volley home the winning goal. Eddie Howe’s side were never really in danger of surrendering their lead thereon, as they held out for only a second win in five Premier League games. Newcastle move up to sixth place – and within two points of fourth-place Chelsea – while Graham Potter’s side stay 16th. Data Debrief: More capital joy for Magpies Newcastle were seeking a response after their disappointing FA Cup exit at the hands of Brighton last weekend, with their display on Monday the ideal preparation for their trip to Wembley in six days’ time. Newcastle have now won their last two Premier League games in London (also beating Tottenham in January), stringing consecutive metropolitan league victories together for the first time since April 2023 (against West Ham and Brentford). Barnes set up Guimaraes’ winner for his ninth direct goal involvement against the Hammers (six goals, three assists); his joint-highest tally against a single Premier League opponent (also nine against Aston Villa). Meanwhile, West Ham have now failed to win any of the 15 Premier League games this season, in which they have conceded the first goal (drawn four, lost 11).",
