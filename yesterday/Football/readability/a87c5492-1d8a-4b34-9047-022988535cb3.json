Goals from David Lopez, Abel Ruiz and Arnaut Danjuma wrapped up the three points as Girona moved up to eighth place with 25 points. The hosts dominated proceedings from the start and took the lead just past the half-hour mark when Miguel Gutierrez’s free-kick deflected off Lopez and into the top corner. Just eight minutes later, Ruiz doubled their advantage with a close-range header, with Gutierrez earning his second assist in his 100th Girona appearance with a perfectly weighted cross. Mario Martin had Valladolid’s only attempt in the match, forcing Paulo Gazzaniga to punch his long-range curler away from the far post. Danjuma secured the victory in the 81st minute hitting his first-time effort past Karl Hein, netting for the first time since August to leave Valladolid second from bottom and four points from safety.",
