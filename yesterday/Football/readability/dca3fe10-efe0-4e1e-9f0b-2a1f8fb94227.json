That result kept reigning champions Madrid top of the table with 50 points, one clear of Atletico in second, as Los Colchoneros missed a chance to leapfrog them. It was a tale of two halves at the Santiago Bernabeu, with Atletico dominating the first 45 minutes. Diego Simeone’s men took the lead when Alvarez converted a 35th-minute spot-kick, awarded after Aurelien Tchouameni fouled Samuel Lino inside the box. But Madrid roared back after the interval, firing off 16 shots to Atleti’s five in the second period and levelling through Mbappe in the 50th minute. UNTIL THE END! pic.twitter.com/RaJY1k5hwS — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) February 8, 2025 Mbappe was first on the scene when Jude Bellingham’s close-range effort was blocked, and the Englishman went close to completing the turnaround two minutes later. He rose to nod Vinicius Junior’s cross against the bar, then another header from the former Borussia Dortmund man drew a great stop from Jan Oblak as Atleti held out. Data Debrief: Nothing to separate rivals again Both league meetings between the two Madrid clubs in 2024-25 have finished 1-1, with Atleti scoring a 95th-minute equaliser in the reverse fixture in September. The last three games between the sides across all competitions have finished level, the longest run of draws between them since a five-match sequence between 1978 and 1980. After Saturday’s game, the Opta supercomputer gives Madrid a 53.9% chance of winning the title, compared to 22.4% for Atleti and 23.4% for Barcelona.",
