  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Two camps who are seeking their own respective Serie A boosts on Saturday night, Vasco will welcome Gremio to the Maracana. Vasco Starting with the hosts, getting their Copa Sudamericana knockout stage adventure underway with a nightmare performance earlier in the week, Vasco find themselves in the midst of what has become a worrying recent rut. Eventually slumping to a woeful 4-0 drumming at the hands of Ecuadorian outfit Independiente del Valle, Fernando Diniz’s men are desperately seeking an immediate response here. However, marking their return from Brazil’s summer adventure with a 2-0 loss at home against Botafogo, Saturday’s hosts have lost three of their previous four appearances across all competitions. It should also be highlighted, Vasco have put just a single Serie A victory on the board over the past couple of months. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway holding just a one-point buffer over the drop zone, Diniz’s camp have also suffered consecutive defeats on home soil for the first time this calendar year. Vasco Team News Arriving from Qatari-based outfit Al-Raayyan last month, one-time Lyon midfielder Thiago Mendes could make his Vasco debut on Saturday night. Returning from a muscle injury earlier in the month, ex-Sao Paulo striker David could get some more minutes under his belt. Despite missing out in midweek, former Liverpool superstar Philippe Coutinho will make a full return at the Maracana here. Notching eight goals in his 12 Serie A appearances this season, veteran striker Pablo Vegetti will lead the line. Gremio As for the visitors, while Gremio might still be scrapping it out in the race to book another Copa Sudamericana ticket, the Immortal Tricolor are seeking some much-needed recent stability. Getting their respective knockout stage adventure underway with a 2-0 loss away at Peruvian outfit Lima in midweek, Mano Menezes’ side have suffered consecutive defeats for the first time since the middle of April. Marking their return from Brazil’s summer interval with a 4-1 drumming at the hands of Cruzeiro, Saturday’s guests have also shown some extended issues on the road. Despite landing a 2-0 victory against Juventude when opening June, that is the only win that they have registered from any of their last 10 straight matchups outside of Porto Alegre – a run that stems all the way back to April 3rd. Gremio Team News Not featuring since the middle of April, one-time Alaves defender Rodrigo Ely remains on the sidelines with a long-term knee injury. Likewise, once again missing out earlier in the week, attacking talisman and ex-Barcelona star Martin Braithwaite remains a major doubt. Coming off the bench and bagging a consolation strike away at Cruzeiro last week, 23-year-old Andre Henrique could make a first domestic start of the season. Completing a loan switch from Corinthians, Alex Santana will start in the middle of the park. Key Factors to Consider When Vasco and Gremio last met back in July 2024, Saturday’s guests collected a gritty 1-0 victory. Vasco have suffered consecutive defeats at the Maracana for the first time this calendar year Saturday’s hosts have drawn a blank in three of their previous four matchups across all formats. Gremio have registered just a single win from any of their previous 10 consecutive away fixtures across all competitions. Only two of the last eight meetings between Vasco and Gremio have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Two camps who are seeking their own respective boosts on Saturday night, chances could come at a real premium this weekend. With Gremio mustering just a sole victory from any of their previous 10 straight appearances outside of Porto Alegre, both sides have also shown their own respective issues in the final third. Watching Vasco draw consecutive blanks at the Maracana, we are expecting what should be a cagey affair here. Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 8/11 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
