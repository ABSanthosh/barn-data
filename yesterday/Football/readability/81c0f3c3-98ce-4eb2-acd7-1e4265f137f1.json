  "text": "Competition: Serie B Market: Spezia win Odds: 8/15 @ BetUS Two sides who find themselves scrapping it out at opposite ends of the Serie B standings, Spezia will welcome Brescia to the Stadio Alberto Picco on Friday night. Starting with the hosts, while Spezia might have spent the majority of last season looking over their shoulder at a looming relegation scrap, the Little Eagles have made a string of improvements this time around. Although Luca D’Angelo’s men might have eventually been forced to settle for a 0-0 stalemate away at Cesena prior to March’s fortnight break, the Liguria-based outfit should find the mood in their camp at a continued high. Opening Friday’s showdown at the Stadio Alberto Picco sat in bronze medal position, Spezia know that they can move within touching distance of the automatic spots here. Getting March underway with an action-packed 3-2 win against Pisa, Friday’s hosts have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous 10 Serie B appearances – a run that stems all the way back to December 29th. It should also be highlighted, D’Angelo’s side have remarkably suffered just a sole defeat in front of their own supporters since February 2024. As for the visitors, while some in Brescia’s camp might have opened up the 2024/25 campaign with their sights set on mounting a genuine play-off charge, Rolando Maran’s side are enduring a public Serie B struggle. Last seen falling to a 2-1 loss at the hands of Frosinone, the Little Swallows mark their return from March’s international break scrapping it out in the relegation zone. Showing a string of issues this season, the Lombardy-based outfit are without a win from any of their previous six appearances. Likewise, on what has quickly become an infamous rut, Friday’s guests have put just a single victory on the board from all of their last 18 straight Serie B showdowns – a run that stems all the way back to November 3rd. Likewise, losing their previous three consecutive matchups away from the Stadio Mario Rigamonti by an aggregate score of 5-1, Brescia will be bracing themselves for another stern examination this weekend.
