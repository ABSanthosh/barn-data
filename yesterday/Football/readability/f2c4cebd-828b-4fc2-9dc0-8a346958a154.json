  "text": "Thomas Frank believes Brentford “deserved more than they got” as they suffered a narrow 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa in the Premier League on Saturday. Former Brentford player Ollie Watkins scored the deciding goal for Villa, bending a shot inside the near post via a slight deflection just four minutes into the second half. Morgan Rogers then had a potential second disallowed for an offside against Watkins, before Brentford pushed for an equaliser, coming closest when Keane Lewis-Potter struck the foot of the post. Brentford have now failed to win their last seven home league games (D2 L5). It is the Bees’ longest winless streak on home soil in the top four tiers since a run of nine between September and December 2006 in League One. Brentford had 11 shots to Villa’s four in the second half and though Frank was disappointed with the result, he acknowledged the many positives he could take from their performance. “They went 1-0 up, getting the margin you need, via a deflection. From that moment to Ollie Watkins’ [late] chance, we were completely on top,” Frank told Sky Sports. “We created many dangerous situations without really having the margins. I’m really pleased with my team – especially in the second half. “I feel we deserved more than we got. We played with great intensity, played forward and put them under pressure. “Of course, we dream and want to end as high as possible. You could see [Villa] felt the pressure because they had to win. They have signed five great players [in the mid-season transfer window] – that’s what we’re competing against.” Meanwhile, Villa bounced back from a heavy 4-1 defeat to Crystal Palace last time out in the Premier League to move seventh, just two points behind fourth-placed Manchester City. It means the Villans have ended their seven-game winless run in the top-flight after playing in Europe in midweek (D3 L4), with this their first such victory since beating Wolves 3-1 back in September. Axel Disasi both contested (13) and won (eight) more duels than any other player in this match and proved a key player as Villa dug in deep to clinch the three points. “After playing in the Champions League it’s hard to win, but I think today we deserved the three points,” Disasi told Sky Sports. “In the first half, we played very well. At the beginning of the second half, we scored, and then we saw the character of the team. “We need to be more consistent. After the game we lost against Palace, we were hungry and wanted to correct it. “The game today was the perfect answer because everyone was fighting. We’ll take it one game at a time. We know we have to be higher in the league. “We just have to stay focused. We have another game on Wednesday [in the Champions League]. I hope this kind of game will bring confidence to the team.”",
