  "text": "Verdict: Wales win Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Olympusbet In what is a real must-win Nations League showdown on Tuesday night, Wales will welcome Iceland to Cardiff. Wales Starting with the hosts, although some around Cardiff might have been left shocked over the summer as they appointed Craig Bellamy, the Dragons do appear to be enjoying life under the former Burnley coach. Putting in a gritty performance over in Turkey on Saturday evening as they snatched a 0-0 stalemate, they do still have a chance of securing an automatic League A spot on Tuesday night. Unbeaten in all of their five Nations League appearances this year, Bellamy will be excited by his side’s recent success at the back. Signing off October’s international break with a 1-0 win at home against Montenegro, the midweek hosts have recorded back-to-back clean sheets for just a second time over the past 13 months. It should also be highlighted, the Dragons have not lost a single showdown on home soil within 90 minutes since June of last year. Team News Suffering what was a devastating blow to the head away in Turkey over the weekend, Wales will be unable to call upon Oxford United striker Mark Harris. Likewise, Bellamy’s side watched the quartet of Owen Beck, Wes Burns, Nathan Broadhead and Kieffer Moore all withdraw due to respective injury issues. Recording four Premier League goals with Tottenham this season, Brennan Johnson will shoulder plenty of Wales’ goalscoring threat here. Recently switching his international allegiance, Leeds goalkeeper Karl Darlow will start between the sticks on Tuesday night. Iceland As for the visitors, managing to make a crucial return to winning ways over the weekend as they secured a 2-0 victory away at Montenegro, Iceland will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. Knowing that a famous win in Cardiff would see them leapfrog Wales and secure their own play-off spot, Age Hareide’s men are seeking some recent stability. Signing off October with an action-packed 4-2 loss at home against Turkey, Tuesday’s guests back-to-back competitive wins over the past two years. Despite playing out a thrilling 2-2 stalemate when they met the Dragons for their reverse Nations League battle on October 11th, Iceland find themselves penciled in as a real underdog contender when they travel to Cardiff on Tuesday night. Team News Picking up what was a costly booking away at Montenegro on Saturday, full-back Logi Tomasson will be forced to serve a one-match suspension here. Making a big-money move to the Middle East over the summer, former Burnley midfielder Johann Gudmundsson will feature in Cardiff. Despite coming off the bench and notching a maiden Nations League strike over the weekend, Dusseldorf youngster Isak Johannesson will settle for a spot on the bench. Brentford shot-stopper Hakon Rafn Valdimarsson will start between the sticks on Tuesday night. Key Factors to Consider When Wales and Iceland met for their reverse Nations League showdown on October 11th, Tuesday’s opponents played out a thrilling 2-2 stalemate. Wales are unbeaten in each of their five Nations League appearances this year. The Dragons have recorded back-to-back clean sheets for the second time since June of last year. Iceland suffered a 3-1 loss when they last travelled to Cardiff back in March 2014. Four of Wales’ last five showdowns on home soil have finished with under 2.5 goals. Conclusion Putting in a gritty performance over the weekend as they snatched a 0-0 stalemate away at Turkey, Wales will be looking to officially punch their Nations League play-off ticket on Tuesday night. Unbeaten in all of their five League B appearances so far this year and finding some recent defensive steel, it appears that the Dragons are enjoying life since Bellamy’s tenure got underway in July. Landing a 3-1 victory when they last welcomed Iceland to Cardiff back in 2014, we are backing a similar home win in midweek. Verdict: Wales win Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
