  "text": "England Under-21s successfully completed their European Under-21 Championship title defence with a 3-2 extra-time win over Germany Under-21s. Lee Carsley’s side gave up a 2-0 lead, but Jonathan Rowe came off the bench at the start of the extra 30 minutes and needed just 85 seconds to make an impact and seal the win. England made a fast start, with Harvey Elliott pouncing onto the rebound of Omari Hutchinson’s saved shot to guide a low effort into the bottom-right corner after just five minutes. The Young Lions then made the most of their dominance, with James McAtee teeing up Hutchinson on the left of the box, and his low effort rolled through Noah Atubolu’s legs 19 minutes later. McAtee’s first-time effort was pushed away by Atubolu in the 40th minute, with Nelson Weiper then pulling one back for Germany six minutes later, sending a thumping header past James Beadle. Paul Nebel then netted a stunning equaliser on the hour mark, profiting from a half-cleared corner as he bent a wonderful strike into the top-right corner, giving Beadle no chance. Nebel came closest to a normal-time winner, as chaos broke out in England’s box in the 93rd minute. He put his laces through a powerful strike, only to hit the crossbar. Rowe made an instant impact after being introduced at the start of extra time, stooping low to deftly turn Tyler Morton’s cross in at the far post. Germany piled the pressure on after that, but England defended staunchly and survived a late scare as Merlin Rohl rattled the bar, to win the Euros for the second edition running. FULL-TIME IN BRATISLAVA!! OUR #YOUNGLIONS ARE BACK-TO-BACK EUROPEAN CHAMPIONS! pic.twitter.com/nnMwbKy03U — England (@England) June 28, 2025 Data Debrief: Rowe has the golden touch England looked shaken on the hour after giving up what had looked a fairly comfortable 2-0 lead, but they rallied brilliantly. Elliott has been a standout performer, scoring his fifth goal in the tournament to open the scoring, but the plaudits go to Rowe, who scored with his only shot of the game. He contributed 0.37 expected goals (xG) to England’s overall total of 1.57 and scored with what appeared to be his first touch of the match. By winning their second consecutive title, England have now matched the feat of the 1982 and 1984 squads.",
