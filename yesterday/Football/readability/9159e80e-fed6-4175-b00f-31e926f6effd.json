  "text": "Verdict: Away win Best odds: 5/7 Bookmaker: BetUS Latvia will aim to bounce back from their defeat to England and climb above Albania when they welcome the Red and Blacks to Stadions Skonto for Tuesday’s World Cup 2026 qualifying clash in Group K. Currently sitting third with three points, Latvia know a win would lift them above Albania, who are just one point ahead with four from three games. Albania, for their part, will be buoyed by a resilient display in Saturday’s goalless draw against Serbia, a result that kept them firmly in contention for a top-two finish. Latvia Latvia may be defensively improving — with two clean sheets in their last three — but their lack of cutting edge in the final third remains a concern for head coach Paolo Nicolato. They’ve scored just three goals across their last seven matches and have drawn blanks in four of those, including a 0-0 with Azerbaijan in their latest outing. Their 3-0 humbling by England exposed the gulf in quality, as they conceded 27 shots and over 3.5 expected goals, managing just one big chance themselves. Adding to their woes, Latvia have won only one of their last seven games and are winless in three consecutive home matches, though they had won the two before that. Team News Latvia may opt for a 3-4-3 setup, featuring Raivis Jurkovskis, Antonijs Cernomordijs and Daniels Balodis in the backline. Forwards Alvis Jaunzems, Janis Ikaunieks and Vladislavs Gutkovskis could be joined by midfielders Aleksejs Saveljevs and Dmitrijs Zelenkovs. Albania Albania produced just 0.26 expected goals from open play against Serbia but limited their opponents to under 0.5 xG in the same metric. The two nations have met four times before, with each game ending in a draw, including their most recent clash — a 3-3 thriller in September 1999. With England leading Group K on nine points and holding the only automatic World Cup qualifying spot, Albania boss Sylvinho will be aware that his side must aim for second to secure a playoff berth. The Red and Blacks have had mixed form, recording two wins, two draws and two defeats in their last six matches across all competitions. They’ve kept four clean sheets in that stretch but managed to score just five goals. Albania’s away form is also inconsistent, with two wins and two defeats from their past five away matches. Team News Albania are expected to start with a back four of Elseid Hysaj, Arlind Ajeti, Ardian Ismajli and Mario Mitaj. Kristjan Asllani and Juljan Shehu should form a midfield pivot behind attackers Armando Broja, Qazim Laci, Arber Hoxha and Rey Manaj. Conclusion With Albania’s recent defensive solidity in mind, they will back themselves to contain Latvia’s attacking efforts on Tuesday. With the hosts struggling for goals in recent outings, falling behind early could make it difficult for them to recover in this encounter. Albania certainly do not possess the quality of England, but one goal for the visitors would likely prove decisive in this fixture. Verdict: Away win Best odds: 5/7 Bookmaker: BetUS",
