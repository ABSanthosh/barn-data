  "text": "Minnesota United head coach Eric Ramsay did not commit to any bold predictions for his side ahead of their MLS season opener against Los Angeles FC this weekend. Ramsay led the Loons to a sixth-placed finish in the Western Conference last season, helping them reach the playoffs having narrowly missed out the campaign before. Minnesota edged their first-round tie against Real Salt Lake, winning both games on penalties and earning their first playoff series win since 2020 against the Colorado Rapids. But they were thrashed 6-2 in the conference semi-finals by the LA Galaxy, who would go on to lift the MLS Cup after beating the New York Red Bulls in the showpiece match. Ramsay was confident his side could improve this term, identifying the middle part of the season as key, having watched his side go eight games without a win last June and July. “It would be a sensible thing to say that we want to build on what we did last year,” Ramsay said. “I felt like last year, albeit I was really satisfied with the work that everyone did, there were obviously some mitigating circumstances around our finish that we’re keen to avoid this year. “I think if we can avoid that middle period, I accept that there is a tournament coming and there will be some messiness again, but I want to make sure we have enough depth and how we address the summer. “I think if we can do that, every realistic expectation will be that we surpass what we did last year. But I’m not getting ahead of myself, and as a consequence, the group doesn’t either. I want to make sure we take each step at a time sensibly and that we are purposeful in how we prepare for every game.” final preseason training @BlueCrossMN | #MNUFC pic.twitter.com/JQzDUDfbRt — Minnesota United FC (@MNUFC) February 14, 2025 LAFC, meanwhile, will be looking to build on their impressive 2024 campaign, having lifted the U.S. Open Cup as well as finishing as runners-up in the Leagues Cup. But their preparations for the new season started with a defeat to the Colorado Rapids in the opening leg of their CONCACAF Champions Cup first-round series on Tuesday. Djordje Mihailovic’s second-half brace was enough for the Rapids despite Aaron Long’s late goal reducing the deficit in a game that was played in below-freezing temperatures. But with a return to the BMO Stadium, head coach Steve Cherundolo is aiming to build his players back up to speed to ensure they kickstart the new season with a win. “I think the performance was okay, but I think both goals from Colorado were poor mistakes from us,” Cherundolo conceded. “It was us being lazy and making poor decisions defensively. “Overall, all the defensive schemes worked other than those two chances. They didn’t really get through. I was quite happy with that. In the first half, we crossed it far too much rather than playing that extra pass in and around the box. “I’ll ask the boys to improve in those areas. Maybe just a little bit of sharpness that was missing.” PLAYERS TO WATCH: LAFC – Denis Bouanga Last season in the MLS, including the playoffs, only Christian Benteke (23) scored more goals than Bouanga (21), with the forward enjoying recent fixtures with the Loons. He has five goal involvements (four goals, one assist) against Minnesota, only managing more against the LA Galaxy (seven) and the San Jose Earthquakes (six). Minnesota United – Kelvin Yeboah Signed from Genoa midway through last season, Yeboah quickly became a fan favourite with his electric pace and eye for goal, and will be hoping to hit the ground in his first full season with Minnesota. Indeed, from his 12 appearances in 2024, Yeboah registered nine goals and three assists, with only Bongokuhle Hlongwane (11) scoring more than the Ghanaian among his team-mates, while the 24-year-old also completed 16 dribbles and created six chances in those outings. MATCH PREDICTION: LAFC WIN LAFC have won their last three home matches against Minnesota, outscoring the Loons 9-1 over those three matches. They have, however, won just one of their first three home matches against this weekend’s opponents (D1 L1). And Cherundolo’s side will be looking to build on last year’s sensational season. They earned 64 points last term, the third time the club has collected 60 or more points in a campaign, the only team with three such seasons since LAFC joined MLS in 2018. Minnesota, meanwhile, will open their season on the road for the ninth time in their nine MLS campaigns. The Loons have lost only one of their last six season-opening matches (W4 D1) dating back to 2019, but they are outsiders here. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY LAFC – 58.7% Draw – 21.5% Minnesota United – 19.8%",
