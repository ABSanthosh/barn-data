Embarking on what has been a public fairytale since Antonio Conte’s arrival in Naples last summer, the Azzurri open up their season finale holding a one-point buffer over defending champions Inter Milan. Officially extending on their Serie A status last weekend, Cagliari are simply looking to upset the party and pull off what would long be remembered as one of the most memorable night’s in their history. With all eyes falling on the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, we have taken a look at some of the most appealing Napoli vs Cagliari Bet Builder Tips which are available on Friday night. Napoli 90 minutes away from making history While Conte might have only arrived in Naples last summer, Friday’s hosts have embarked on a sensational rise under the former Chelsea boss and open their season finale sat firmly in the driving seat. Despite settling for consecutive stalemates against Parma and Genoa over the past fortnight, the Italian giants still hold a one-point buffer over defending champions Inter Milan. Along with not suffering a single defeat from any of their previous 11 Serie A appearances, Napoli have also tasted just a sole domestic defeat since the start of December. Storming their way to a 4-0 romp when they met Cagliari for their reverse Serie A meeting back on September 15th, Conte’s men have gained a real reputation for their defensive steel. Recording a clean sheet in five of their previous six top-flight appearances, Friday’s hosts have also conceded just 27 Serie A strikes this season and they comfortably hold the best defensive tally among Italy’s elite. Bet Builder Tip: Napoli win to nil @ 4/5 with 1xBet   McTominay to underline his status as a Naples icon While Romelu Lukaku might be leading the chase to claim Napoli’s Golden Boot this month, it is another former Manchester United star who has stollen plenty of the Azzurri’s headlines. Completing a permanent move from Old Trafford last summer, Scott McTominay has enjoyed a sensational maiden campaign at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona and has played a leading role in Napoli’s title charge. Signing off April with a Serie A brace at home against Torino, the Scotland international has notched five goals in his previous six top-flight appearances. At the heart of everything positive that Conte’s camp has produced this season, McTominay has quickly blossomed into one of the leading poster boys in Naples. Bagging 11 Serie A strikes in his maiden campaign among Italy’s elite, the 28-year-old is one of just two players at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona who has reached double digits this season. Bet Builder Tip: Scott McTominay to score or assist @ 1/1 with BetUS   Cagliari simply looking to upset the party Officially extending on their Serie A status last weekend as they secured a thumping 3-0 victory against Venezia, Cagliari will travel to Naples on Friday night simply looking to upset the party. However, failing to record consecutive Serie A victories throughout the 2024/25 campaign, the Islanders couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge here. Last seen on their travels falling to a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Como, Davide Nicola’s men have drastically failed to find any kind of stability away from the Unipol Domus this season. Including another 3-1 defeat against Inter Milan on April 12th, Cagliari have mustered just a pair of wins from any of their last 17 matchups outside of Sardinia across all competitions. Likewise, including that 4-0 drumming when they welcomed Napoli to town for their reverse Serie A meeting back in September, they have failed to win any of their last nine meetings against the champions-elect. Bet Builder Tip: Roberto Piccoli over 1.5 fouls @ 5/4 with Dachbet Napoli vs Cagliari Bet Builder Tips Napoli win to nil  Scott McTominay to score or assist Roberto Piccoli over 1.5 fouls  ODDS – 7/1 with Vegas Land You can also visit our betting promotions section for the latest enhanced odds promos, accumulator bonuses and more.",
