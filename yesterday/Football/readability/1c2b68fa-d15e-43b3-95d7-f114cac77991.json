  "text": "Competition: USL Market: Both teams to score Odds: 8/11 @ BetUS Two camps who will be looking to widen their buffer in the play-off chase, Detroit will welcome Miami FC to the Keyworth Stadium on Saturday night. Starting with the hosts, while Detroit might have opened up the 2025 campaign in the midst of a real flurry, Le Rouge have come crashing back down to earth in a spectacular fashion. Eventually falling to what was an action-packed 3-2 defeat away at Loudoun, Danny Dichio’s men find themselves at the heart of what has been a worrying rut. Watching their USL Cup adventure come to an end on May 31st as they slumped to a 4-2 loss against Portland Hearts of Pine, the former Toronto coach has seen his squad lose all of their previous four consecutive appearances across all competitions. With their nightmare rut underlined by a 3-1 defeat at home against Charleston last month, Detroit have come tumbling down the Eastern Conference standings. Losing those four straight outings by an aggregate score of 12-5, it is no surprise that Dichio will have a major headache over his side’s glaring defensive issues. Likewise, without a win from any of their last eight matchups across all fronts, Saturday’s hosts will have plenty of pressure on their shoulders. As for the visitors, while Miami might travel to the Keyworth Stadium this weekend pencilled in as a landslide underdog, Gaston Maddoni’s men are more than capable of springing an upset in Detroit. Despite spending the whole of last season scrapping it out at the foot of the Eastern Conference standings, the Blues have made a string of improvements this time around. Extending on their respective USL Cup adventure on June 1st as they clinched a thrilling 3-2 win against FC Naples, Saturday’s guests have won three of their previous four appearances across all competitions. Likewise, despite being last seen on their travels falling to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of Tampa Bay, Miami will taken plenty of positives away from their rugged success away from the Pitbull Stadium. Including a 2-1 victory against San Antonio on April 13th, Maddoni’s side have suffered just a sole USL defeat on the road so far this calendar year. Bet: Both teams to score at Detroit City vs Miami FC 8/11 for Saturday’s USL matchup @ BetUS",
