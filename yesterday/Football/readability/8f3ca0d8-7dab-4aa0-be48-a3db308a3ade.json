  "text": "Verdict: England win to nil Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Luckster Looking to officially book their immediate League A return on Sunday evening, England will welcome Ireland to Wembley. England Starting with the hosts, picking up some immediate revenge on Thursday night as they stormed their way to a 3-0 romp in Athens, England are now sat firmly in the driving seat to book an immediate League A return here. In what will be Lee Carsley’s final game in charge, the Three Lions will simply be looking to lay down another statement of intent this weekend. While the European giants might have struggled to find top gear with much stability since opening their Nations League adventure back in September, England have won four of their five League B appearances. Getting proceedings underway with a 2-0 win away in Dublin, Carsley will be looking to sign off his brief tenure at the helm with a repeat performance on Sunday evening. Team News Watching nine senior players controversially withdraw from Carsley’s squad over the past week, England will once again put out a makeshift starting XI here. Forced to settle for a spot on the bench in Athens on Thursday night, skipper and all-time goalscorer Harry Kane will be hoping for a full recall at Wembley. Finding the net on his full international debut over in Greece, Liverpool star Curtis Jones should keep his spot in midfield. Reclaiming his spot between the sticks in midweek, Everton shot-stopper Jordan Pickford should earn a 73rd international cap in north London. Ireland As for the visitors, although Ireland might have dragged themselves to a nervy 1-0 victory at home against Finland earlier in the week, Heimir Hallgrimsson’s men still have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their League B status. Getting their Nations League campaign underway on September 7th with that 2-0 loss at the hands of England, the Greens couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge when they travel to north London here. Signing off their pre-tournament preparations with a 3-0 drumming against Portugal, Ireland have certainly gained a real reputation for their issues outside of Dublin. Last seen on their travels falling to a 2-0 defeat against Greece, the former Jamaica boss has seen his squad lose five of their last seven showdowns on foreign soil. Team News All still dealing with respective injury issues, Ireland will once again be without the trio of Seamus Coleman, Shane Duffy and Adam Idah on Sunday evening. Despite failing to make any kind of impact since arriving at Everton over the summer, former Lyon defender Jake O’Brien has been included in Hallgrimsson’s squad. Bagging the winner against Finland earlier in the week, Brighton’s Evan Ferguson will spearhead Ireland’s charge in north London. Although Matt Doherty might have played just a single minute of Premier League football since the middle of January, the Wolves defender will start at right-back. Key Factors to Consider When England and Ireland met for their reverse Nations League showdown on September 7th, the Three Lions collected a 2-0 win in Dublin. England have collected 12 points from their five League A appearances this year. Ireland have lost five of their previous seven showdowns on foreign soil across all competitions. The Greens have also drawn a blank in three of their last four appearances outside of Dublin. England’s last three Nations League appearances have produced 10 goals at both ends of the pitch. Conclusion Eventually claiming some immediate revenge in Athens on Thursday night as they secured a 3-0 romp against Greece, England will be looking to book their immediate League A return with one final statement. In what will be Carsley’s final contest in charge, the Three Lions are rightfully pencilled in as a landslide contender this weekend. Opening their Nations League campaign with a 2-0 win away in Dublin on September 7th, England will be confident about producing a repeat performance in north London. With Ireland continuing to show some rather glaring issues on foreign soil, the Greens have a heavyweight challenge on their hands here. Verdict: England win to nil Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Luckster",
