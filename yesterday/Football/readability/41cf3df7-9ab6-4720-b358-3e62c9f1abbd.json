  "text": "Verdict: Barcelona to score in both halves Best Odds: 3/5 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Hoping to widen their buffer at the top of the La Liga table, Barcelona will welcome Las Palmas to Catalonia on Saturday lunchtime. Barcelona Starting with the hosts, while Barcelona might have been frustrated by their late collapse away at Celta Vigo last weekend, the Spanish giants came roaring back earlier in the week. Storming their way to a routine 3-0 romp against French outfit Brest, Hansi Flick’s men find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Although Barca might have only appointed the German tactician over the summer, they have embarked on a sensational rise. Getting this weekend’s fixtures underway holding a four-point buffer at the top of the table, Saturday’s hosts will also be excited by their continued success on home soil. Opening November with a 3-1 victory against local rivals Espanyol, Flick’s title contenders have won all of their first eight showdowns at the Nou Camp across all competitions by an aggregate score of 30-4. Team News Once again missing out earlier in the week, Barcelona are once again sweating over the fitness of 17-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal. Undergoing knee surgery back in September, German shot-stopper Marc-Andre ter Stegen will not feature over the remainder of the season. Notching a Champions League brace in midweek and becoming just the third player in European history to record a century, Robert Lewandowski will lead the line here. Continuing to shine since arriving from RB Leipzig over the summer, Dani Olmo will join the ex-Bayer Munich ace in the final third. Las Palmas As for the visitors, while Las Palmas might have entered November’s international break with a much-needed flurry, Los Amarillos came crashing back down to earth last weekend. Suffering last-gasp heartbreak at the Estadio Gran Canaria as they fell to a 3-2 loss at the hands of Mallorca, Diego Martinez’s men find themselves at the heart of a La Liga relegation scrap. Facing a real battle to keep hold of their top-flight status this season, the Yellows travel to Catalonia this weekend holding just a two-point buffer from slipping into the drop zone. Likewise, falling to a 1-0 defeat when they travelled to the Nou Camp back in March, Las Palmas will be concerned by a nightmare record against Barcelona. In fact, Martinez’s side have collected just a single point from any of their previous eight La Liga showdowns against the title contenders. Team News Heading into Saturday’s trip to the Nou Camp, Las Palmas have reported a clean bill of health and have no fresh injury concerns to worry about. Recently shaking off a knock, one-time Manchester United youngster Adnan Januzaj could make a first La Liga appearance since October 21st. Bagging a consolation strike against Mallorca last weekend and finding the net in back-to-back La Liga appearances on either side of November’s international break, Wolves loanee Fabio Silva will lead the line in Catalonia. Former Sheffield United striker Oli McBurnie will have to settle for a spot on the bench. Key Factors to Consider When Barcelona and Las Palmas last met back on March 30th, the Spanish heavyweights collected a 1-0 victory at the Nou Camp. Barca have collected 22 points from their last eight La Liga showdowns against Saturday’s guests. Barcelona have won each of their first eight appearances in Catalonia by an aggregate score of 30-4. Las Palmas have won just a trio of their first 14 La Liga appearances so far this season. Los Amarillos have recorded just a sole La Liga clean sheet. Conclusion Claiming an immediate response in midweek as they stormed their way to a 3-0 romp against Brest, Barcelona will be hoping for a repeat performance here. Desperate to extend their buffer at the top of the La Liga table, Saturday’s hosts will be smelling a golden opportunity this weekend. Gaining a fearsome reputation for their success in Catalonia and winning each of their first eight showdowns at the Nou Camp by an aggregate score of 30-4, Barca are rightfully pencilled in as a landslide contender here. Two sides who find themselves battling it out at opposite ends of the La Liga table, it is hard to see anything other than a routine home victory in Catalonia.
