  "text": "Taylor Harwood-Bellis revealed he was in a state of disbelief when he was told about his first call-up to the England senior team last week. Harwood-Bellis, along with Newcastle’s Lewis Hall, received their maiden Three Lions call-ups in Lee Carsley’s final squad as interim head coach. The Southampton defender has impressed under Russell Martin this season, featuring in all of their Premier League fixtures so far this season. Harwood-Bellis has won more aerial duels (13) for the Saints in the top-flight this term, with only Jan Bednarek (888) completing more passes than the 22-year-old (684). He is also someone well known to the interim boss from his time in charge of England’s Under-21’s side, with his 21 appearances more than any other player during Carsley’s tenure in the current Three Lions squad. “Lee Carsley rang me in the morning and said, ‘you’ll be with us, with the seniors’. I didn’t quite believe it at first,” he told a press conference. “My partner was next to me and I phoned my dad, who was very proud. He loves when I play for England, even the younger age groups. “One of the first people to message me was Aaron Ramsdale. I was happy to see his name as he’s one of my mates at the club.” Welcome to camp, lads! pic.twitter.com/Tr8T99isX8 — England (@England) November 11, 2024 Unfortunately for Harwood-Bellis, Ramsdale has since pulled out of the squad with a finger injury and has been replaced by Burnley’s James Trafford. England travel to Athens to take on Group B2 leaders Greece on Thursday before returning to Wembley three days later as they square off against the Republic of Ireland. With a number of first-team regulars out through injury, Harwood-Bellis has the opportunity to become the first Saints player to represent England since Kyle Walker-Peters did so back in 2022. The defender understood the potential ramifications of performing well for the Three Lions during this international break, with Thomas Tuchel taking over in the new year. “It will be a big motivation for all of the lads, knowing that there’s a new manager coming in and wanting to keep your spot,” he said. “That’s something that especially the younger lads will be pushing towards. “It’s going to be difficult because of the quality and experience in some of the lads that aren’t here is massive. “It’ll be difficult, but it’ll be something that I’ll focus on week in and week out for Southampton and if I get minutes here.”",
