  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 4/5 Bookmaker: Olympusbet With London bragging rights up for grabs on Sunday afternoon, Arsenal will welcome Chelsea to the Emirates for a heavyweight Premier League showdown. Arsenal Starting with the hosts, while Arsenal might have stormed their way to the Champions League quarter-finals earlier in the week as they cruised to a 9-3 aggregate win against PSV, Mikel Arteta’s camp are enduring a public domestic rut. With their Premier League title dreams taking a critical blow over the past month, the Gunners will now have all of their eggs firmly placed in the European basket. Forced to settle for a 1-1 stalemate away at historic rivals Manchester United last weekend, Arsenal have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous five domestic appearances across all competitions. However, storming their way to a sensational 5-0 romp when they welcomed Chelsea to the Emirates last season, Arteta’s men will be desperately seeking a repeat performance on Sunday afternoon. Arsenal Team News All still dealing with respective long-term injury issues, Arsenal will once again be without the likes of Kai Havertz, Gabriel Jesus and England international Bukayo Saka. However, handed a full Champions League rest in midweek, 17-year-old sensation Ethan Nwaneri should be handed a full recall here. Notching three goals in his previous six appearances across all competitions, former Real Sociedad star Mikel Merino will once again be deployed in a false nine role. William Saliba will make a full return at the Emirates and partner Gabriel at the heart of Arteta’s defence. Chelsea As for the visitors, while Chelsea might have shown some major inconsistencies when opening the New Year, Enzo Maresca’s men have certainly claimed a welcomed boost over the past few weeks. Extending on their Europa Conference League campaign on Thursday night as they secured a 3-1 aggregate victory against Copenhagen, the former Leicester boss has seen his squad win each of their previous four appearances across all competitions. However, despite finding a route back into the Champions League spots, Chelsea have gained an unwanted reputation for their glaring issues away from Stamford Bridge. Including a 3-0 drumming at the hands of Brighton February 14th, Sunday’s guests have lost each of their last four domestic battles outside of west London by an aggregate score of 10-3. Chelsea Team News While ex-Leicester defender Wesley Fofana might be inching towards a first-team return, the French defender will not feature here. Likewise, all still dealing with their own respective injury issues, Chelsea will be unable to call upon the likes of Romeo Lavia, Nicolas Jackson and Marc Guiu. Failing to find the net since a 2-2 stalemate against Bournemouth on January 14th, Cole Palmer will be looking to draw a line under his public drought. Appearing to have reclaimed his spot as Maresca’s number one choice, former Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanches should start between the sticks. Arsenal vs Chelsea Key Factors to Consider When Arsenal and Chelsea met for their reverse Premier League showdown on November 10th, Sunday’s opponents played out a 1-1 stalemate at Stamford Bridge. However, the Gunners claimed a dominant 5-0 victory when they last welcomed Chelsea to the Emirates in April 2024. Arsenal have recorded just a sole victory from any of their previous five domestic appearances across all competitions. Chelsea have lost each of their last four domestic appearances away from Stamford Bridge by an aggregate score of 10-3. Arsenal have recorded just a sole clean sheet from any of their previous eight showdowns at the Emirates. Conclusion While Arsenal and Chelsea might have extended on their respective European adventures in midweek, both of the London giants will be desperate to claim local bragging rights here. Although Sunday’s guests might have lost each of their previous four domestic showdowns away from Stamford Bridge by an aggregate score of 10-3, they will meet an Arsenal squad who are enduring a continued Premier League wobble. With the Gunners landing just a sole clean sheet from any of their last eight appearances in north London, Chelsea will be confident of asking some questions.
