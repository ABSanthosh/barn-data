Wolves remain in 17th, one place above the relegation zone, but their win over the Cherries on Saturday moved them five points clear of the drop. Pereira’s side have lost just one of their last three matches, winning the other two, and another victory at Molineux, where they have a good record against Fulham, would be another big boost in their fight to stay in the top-flight. While Pereira was pleased with his side’s display against 10-man Bournemouth, he noted Wolves needed to be at their best with a tough test ahead. “[The win over Bournemouth] was good, but the most important is the next one,” Pereira said. “The next one is against Fulham, and it’s very important for us. I expect our best version on Tuesday. “We can improve a lot of things; scoring goals when we get opportunities and defending well, because this is a very good team with a very good coach. “They have been working together for the past three years; they are consistent and have very good players. But we must look at ourselves and compete to get the three points.” pic.twitter.com/n81h2o3ESD — Wolves (@Wolves) February 24, 2025 Fulham are aiming to bounce back from a disappointing 2-0 defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday, which came after two consecutive top-flight wins. The Cottagers are among the chasing pack for a place in Europe next season, currently sitting 10th on 39 points, just four points behind seventh-place Chelsea. Marco Silva was left disappointed by their showing against Palace but knows his team will face a challenge on Tuesday. “When you have that type of game where you don’t perform at the level that you wanted, and we should, of course, the best way is to play a quick game again,” Silva said. “Tough game away from home, where we have been really, really competitive, achieving good results, being able to have very good performances as well and make life difficult against any side in any stadium of the country. “And we want to do the same thing and, more than that, react from the last performance and the last result.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Wolves – Matheus Cunha Matheus Cunha has scored 13 goals in 25 Premier League games this season, with only Raul Jimenez ever netting more in a single campaign for the club (17 in 2019-20). Fulham – Alex Iwobi Alex Iwobi has scored more Premier League goals against Wolves than versus any other opponent (six), netting in all three of his games for Fulham against them. Straight onto the next. #WOLFUL pic.twitter.com/hY9aYXXEeu — Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) February 24, 2025 MATCH PREDICTION: FULHAM WIN Fulham have won five Premier League away games this season, only winning more in the competition in 2022-23 (seven). They have won their last two on the road, last winning three consecutively in the top-flight in April and May 2008 under Roy Hodgson. Wolves are winless in their last 10 Premier League evening kick-offs (7pm or later) since a 4-1 win at Brentford in December 2023 (D2 L8). They have lost each of their last seven in a row, including all five this season by an aggregate score of 15-2. However, this is expected to be a tight game, given Wolves’ impressive recent run against Fulham. In fact, Pereira’s side are hoping to do the double over the Cottagers for just the second time in the Premier League after a 4-1 win at Craven Cottage in November. Fulham have won just one of their last nine Premier League games against Wolves (D3 L5), beating them 3-2 at Craven Cottage in November 2023. Wolves have lost none of their eight Premier League home games against Fulham (W6 D2), the most they have faced an opponent at Molineux without ever losing in the competition. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Wolves – 33.8% Draw – 25.7% Fulham – 40.5%",
