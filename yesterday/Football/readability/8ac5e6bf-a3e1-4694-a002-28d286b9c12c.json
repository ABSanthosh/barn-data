  "text": "Crystal Palace boss Oliver Glasner is chasing a Premier League points record ahead of their game at home to Nottingham Forest on Monday. The Eagles are currently on 45 points with four games remaining and need five more points to beat their record total, which was equalled for the third time last season. And Glasner, whose team have an FA Cup final against Manchester City to look forward to later this month, has that record in his sights. “Our goal is very clear and we want to have the most points in Palace history,” he said, as quoted by BBC Sport. “That means we need at least five in four games and the best thing to achieve is getting three points against Nottingham and then three points against Tottenham. Then the first goal is achieved, and then we can focus on the final in FA Cup. “We want to win at home. I watched the semi-finals against City, I watched them yesterday evening and it showed what a good team they are even if they lost both the games. They are playing for European places and they will be very motivated and we will need the same motivation.” For Nottingham Forest, meanwhile, Nuno Espirito Santo was insistent that the pressure was not getting to his players following Thursday’s defeat to Brentford. That loss left Forest outside the top five on goal difference, meaning they could miss out on a place in the Champions League. “We don’t see it but we feel it. The explanation for that we have to find in ourselves. But I don’t see [pressure], I see belief, desire and commitment,” said Nuno. But the reality is we are struggling in some aspects of our game – focus and determination to be practical and solve the situations that are simple to solve. [To get back to ourselves] is the basic option we have. We don’t have to change, we have to go back and find our version. “We have been clear and spoken many times about how we play. Our basic is being compact and solid, we don’t give away chances. We are a team that always covers, so our opponents have to do much more to achieve what they achieved today.” Under the lights on Monday night #CPFC // #CRYNFO — Crystal Palace F.C. (@CPFC) May 1, 2025 Crystal Palace – Jean-Philippe Mateta Mateta has scored 10 goals in his last 13 Premier League appearances, all in 2025. It’s the second consecutive season he’s scored 10+ goals from January until the end of the season, scoring 14 in 18 games in 2023-24 in that timeframe, with Andrew Johnson the only Eagles player to achieve this beforehand (11 in 2004-05). Nottingham Forest – Chris Wood Wood has scored 17 goals in his last 24 Premier League appearances on the road for Nottingham Forest and has nine away goals this season, with no Forest player ever scoring 10 away goals in a season. He could be the sixth player to score 10+ home goals and 10+ away goals in a Premier League season over the age of 30, with Mohamed Salah also achieving that in 2024-25. MATCH PREDICTION: CRYSTAL PALACE WIN Palace come into this match having won five and drawn one of their last six matches in all competitions at Selhurst Park. Glasner’s side have lost just two of their last 11 home games in all competitions. Forest, meanwhile, have lost four of their last five matches. The Tricky Trees, however, have won two of their last three away Premier League games in London (L1), as many as they did across their previous 23 trips to the capital combined (W2 D5 L16). Forest are looking to win three away games in London in a season for the second time in the Premier League, also doing so in 1994-95. Indeed, Forest have won nine away Premier League matches this season and have only won 10 top-flight away matches in a season on three occasions – in 1977-78 (finished 1st), 1978-79 (2nd) and 1994-95 (third). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Crystal Palace – 43.5% Draw – 26.4% Nottingham Forest – 30.2%",
