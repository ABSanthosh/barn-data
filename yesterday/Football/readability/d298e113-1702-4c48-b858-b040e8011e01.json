  "text": "Declan Rice was quick to highlight Bukayo Saka’s importance after the winger scored a timely goal on his return from injury in Arsenal’s 2-1 win over Fulham at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday. Saka, who had been sidelined for three months with a hamstring injury, made his first appearance since December last year, coming off the bench midway through the second half to replace Ethan Nwaneri. His return provided an immediate lift, as Mikel Merino had already put Arsenal ahead in the 37th minute with a deflected strike before Saka put them firmly in the driver’s seat, nodding in Gabriel Martinelli’s flick to double the lead. Saka’s 68th goal for Arsenal in all competitions was his first as a substitute, coming six minutes and 36 seconds after coming on. Although Rodrigo Muniz pulled one back for Fulham deep into stoppage time, the result had long been decided. Saka’s introduction was met with a thunderous ovation from the Emirates crowd and his teammates alike. Declan Rice, speaking to Sky Sports, highlighted just how vital the 22-year-old is to Arsenal’s attack. “The reception speaks for itself. That’s why he’s one of the best wingers in the world because he attacks the box and sniffs the goal,” Rice said. “You take them, he’s in the right position at the right time and topped off a great night for him and for us.” Back-to-back wins in N5 pic.twitter.com/oywhMsy8Oo — Arsenal (@Arsenal) April 1, 2025 The midfielder also emphasised Saka’s influence on Arsenal’s fluid attacking setup. “He gives us an outlet,” Rice added. “All of our front players are so different and rotate so well. “[Gabriel] Martinelli was unbelievable tonight, real outlet for us and done well for Bukayo’s goal. With Bukayo back, it’s a real boost.” Yet, for all the positives of Saka’s return, Mikel Arteta was dealt a fresh blow as Gabriel Magalhaes was forced off early with a hamstring injury, adding to Arsenal’s growing defensive crisis. Gabriel’s injury compounds an already dire situation for Arteta, leaving him with just three fit centre-backs ahead of two of Arsenal’s biggest games of the season – a Champions League quarter-final showdown against Real Madrid. With Liverpool holding a comfortable nine-point lead at the top of the league table, Arsenal’s best hope for silverware may now rest in Europe, where they are making their first semi-final appearance since 2009. Rice acknowledged the challenge but insisted Arsenal will keep pushing in the Premier League: “We know we’re behind them in the league. We can only control what we can do, and that’s to win our eight games.” “We’ve slipped up one too many times this season, we will keep hunting them down and keep putting pressure on them – that’s all we can do.” Falling just short against second. — Fulham Football Club (@FulhamFC) April 1, 2025 As for Fulham, they have now lost successive Premier League away games for the first time since January 2024 (a run of five), while they have lost three of their last five games in the competition (W2), one more than their previous 13 outings (W5 D6). It compounded a tough few days for the Cottagers, who were also knocked out of the FA Cup in the quarter-final by Crystal Palace, but Marco Silva insisted that was not an excuse for Tuesday’s result. “Something that was done last Saturday, and we have to move on,” he told BBC MOTD. “It’s not an excuse; what we showed then was that, and we have to show different things. “Arsenal [were] much fresher than us in some moments. We tried fresh legs and to be more aggressive. Second half, better than first, more chances. Our first half – not good. “Premier League doesn’t allow you to switch off or allow you to be sloppy in moments when you are attacking or defending. It’s clear we have to be consistent.”",
