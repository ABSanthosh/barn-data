Goias Starting with the hosts, eventually falling to what was a flat 2-0 defeat away at CRB last time out, Goias will know the importance of claiming an immediate response in the early hours of Tuesday. Despite watching their recent purple patch come to an abrupt end last week, the Verdao are pencilled in as a standout promotion contender this season. Getting June underway with a routine 2-0 victory against Volta Redonda, Vagner Mancini’s men open the midweek fixtures leading the chase at the top of the Serie B standings. Along with mustering nine points from their last four second-tier appearances, Goias have also suffered just a sole Serie B defeat since the end of April. It should also be noted, Mancini’s side have won their previous four consecutive showdowns at the Serrinha by an aggregate score of 7-1. Goias Team News Shown what was a costly second-half booking away at CRB last week, former Vitoria defender Willean Lepo will miss out through suspension here. However, both serving their own respective one-match bans during last week’s 2-0 defeat, the duo of Gonzalo Freitas and Diego Kaito will return to Mancini’s squad. Completing a permeant switch ahead of the 2025 campaign, veteran defender Titi will start at the heart of Goias’ defence. Struggling to find any real fluidity in the final third last week, former Cruzeiro striker Arthur Caike could be handed a full recall. Athletic Club As for the visitors, only making their Serie B return this season, Athletic Club are more than aware that they have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their second-tier status in 2025. While Roger Silva’s camp might have claimed an essential boost last time out as they snatched a 2-1 victory at home against Operario, Tuesday’s guests still sit rock-bottom of the table and are pencilled in as a landslide relegation contender this year. Getting June underway with a routine 2-0 defeat against Cuiaba, Athletic Club have managed to put just nine points on the board from any of their first 12 Serie B appearances. Facing what is a heavyweight challenge here, Silva’s camp have also gained a reputation for their glaring issues on the road. Including consecutive 1-0 defeats against Amazonas and Athletico-PR, they have lost five of their previous six matchups outside of Minas Gerais. Athletic Club Team News Shown a second-half booking against Operario last week, Paraguayan midfielder Fernando Martinez will serve a one-match suspension here. However, serving hiw own respective one-game ban last time out, one-time Juventus youngster Wesley Gasolina will return to Silva’s travelling squad on Tuesday. Coming off the bench and bagging the winner in Minas Gerais last week, Neto Costa could be handed a full recall and the chance to lead the line. Completing a loan switch from Santos ahead of the 2025 campaign, Sandry will start in the middle of the park alongside 20-year-old Amorim. Goias vs Athletic Club Key Factors to Consider Goias’ 2-0 loss against CRB last week was the first defeat they have suffered from their previous eight Serie B appearances. The Verdao have won their previous four straight home fixtures by an aggregate score of 7-1. Athletic Club have lost five of their previous six appearances outside of Minas Gerais. Likewise, Tuesday’s guests have drawn a blank in four of their last five matchups away from the Estadio Joaquim Portugal. Goias have not conceded a single strike in front of their own supporters in over 350 minutes of action. Conclusion Eventually falling to that 2-0 loss away at CRB last week, Goias know the importance of claiming an immediate response here. Excited to make a return to home soil, Mancini’s men will be looking to widen their buffer at the top of the Serie B standings. Winning all of their previous four showdowns at the Serrinha by an aggregate score of 7-1, the Verdao are rightfully installed as a standout contender. With Athletic Club losing five of their previous six showdowns away from the Estadio Joaquim Portugal, we are backing a home victory in the early hours of Tuesday.
