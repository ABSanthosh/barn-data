  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best odds: 6/10 Bookmaker: 888sport Nineteen years after their initial Champions League heartbreak in Paris, Arsenal face the possibility of history repeating itself on Wednesday as they meet Paris Saint-Germain in the second leg of their semifinal. Ballon d’Or contender Ousmane Dembele scored the decisive goal in the first leg at the Emirates, leaving Arsenal needing to accomplish a feat only two teams have previously managed in order to reach the final. Paris Saint-Germain In some ways, the first leg between Arsenal and PSG mirrored the Gunners’ quarter-final return leg against Real Madrid; this time, though, it was Arsenal making all the noise before kick-off but falling short on the pitch. Ignoring the pre-match hype, including motivational videos and a bold tifo in North London, Luis Enrique’s Ligue 1 champions struck just four minutes in through Dembele, who matched Kylian Mbappe’s club record for most Champions League goal contributions in a single campaign. After Mikel Merino saw a goal ruled out, PSG returned home with a narrow but crucial 1-0 advantage, making them strong favourites to book a place in the final in Munich against either Barcelona or Inter Milan. PSG have only once been knocked out of Europe after winning the first leg away – famously against Manchester United in 2018–19—and their recent Ligue 1 defeat to Strasbourg under Enrique added to a mixed run of form, with three losses and just two wins in their last six matches. However, Enrique fielded a heavily rotated side in that domestic defeat, unlike Arsenal, who went full strength. Team News Arguably the only downside for PSG in the first leg was Dembele picking up a hamstring injury. While the club has stated that he is making good progress in his recovery, his involvement in the second leg remains uncertain. As a result, Goncalo Ramos is expected to lead the attack against Arsenal, and although Lee Kang-in also sustained a knock versus Strasbourg, he was never likely to start this match. Vitinha and Fabian Ruiz will surely return to the midfield alongside Joao Neves, the only starter from the Emirates who kept his place last weekend, while Desire Doue and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia will reclaim their roles out wide to provide attacking flair. Arsenal While PSG suffered a 2-1 Ligue 1 loss with a rotated lineup, Arsenal endured a similar fate despite fielding most of their regulars, falling to Bournemouth in a match that highlighted their persistent defensive shortcomings. Declan Rice gave the hosts the lead with a forward’s finish, but for the 10th time this season – an unwanted club record – the Gunners surrendered an advantage in the Premier League, as Dean Huijsen’s header and Evanilson’s scrappy winner completed a comeback for the Cherries. There were questions about a possible handball in Evanilson’s goal, but few Arsenal fans could argue with the result after another disjointed attacking display, which has left them vulnerable in the race for a top-five league finish. Only two teams have ever overturned a home first-leg deficit in the Champions League semifinals: Ajax in 1996 and Spurs in 2019, and the latter won’t be eager to see their north London rivals pull off a similar feat. However, Arsenal remain unbeaten in their last seven away matches in all competitions, winning four straight European games on the road while scoring at least twice in each, giving them some hope. A repeat of their 2-1 win at the Bernabeu could force extra time, though with PSG netting 14 goals across their last three Champions League home wins, Arsenal fans may understandably fear another European disappointment. Team News Thomas Partey, suspended for the first leg due to a needless booking at the Bernabeu, is now available and should return to his usual holding role in midfield. He is expected to line up alongside Declan Rice and captain Martin Odegaard, who picked up a minor knock at the weekend but is not considered a doubt for Wednesday’s clash. However, a decision on Jurrien Timber’s involvement will be made late after he sat out the Bournemouth defeat. Jorginho (lung), Gabriel Jesus (knee), Kai Havertz (hamstring), Gabriel Magalhaes (hamstring), Takehiro Tomiyasu (knee), and Riccardo Calafiori (knee) remain sidelined. Conclusion Liverpool won in Paris, but that result at the Parc des Princes required an extraordinary goalkeeping performance from goalkeeper Alisson Becker – something Arsenal, with all due respect to the considerable quality of David Raya, may not be able to replicate in Paris. Partey’s return and Dembele’s potential absence are significant factors, but as Arsenal push forward, PSG’s dangerous wide attackers could capitalize on the spaces left behind and edge closer to their long-awaited European title.
