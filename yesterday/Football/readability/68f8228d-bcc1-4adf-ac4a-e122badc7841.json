  "text": "Verdict: Athletic Bilbao draw no bet Best Odds: 1/1 Bookmaker: Dachbet Knowing that they can officially secure their Champions League spot on Thursday night, Athletic Bilbao will travel to the Estadio Coliseum when they meet Getafe. Getafe Starting with the hosts, while Getafe might open up the midweek fixtures holding a commanding five-point buffer from slipping into the relegation zone, Jose Bordalas’ side are limping their way over the finishing line. Last seen putting in another worrying performance as they slumped to a routine 3-0 drumming at the hands of Valencia, the Madrid-based outfit have the feel of a squad desperately seeking an essential boost. In fact, the one-time Elche boss has seen his struggling squad lose all of their previous five consecutive La Liga appearances by an aggregate score of 9-1. Likewise, marking their return from March’s international break with a 2-1 defeat at home against Villarreal, Getafe have lost six of their last seven showdowns against top-flight opposition. It should also be noted, Thursday’s hosts have landed just a single victory in front of their own supporters so far this calendar year. Getafe Team News Shown a straight red card against Rayo Vallecano on May 2nd, veteran defender Djene will once again miss out through suspension on Thursday night. However, serving his own respective ban away at Valencia last weekend, Urugyian midfielder Mauro Arambarri will return to Bordalas’ squad. While former Real Madrid striker Borja Mayoral might have failed to find the net since the end of February, the 28-year-old will spearhead Getafe’s charge in the final third. Returning from a knock last month, one-time West Brom defender Allan Nyom could get some more minutes under his belt. Athletic Bilbao As for the visitors, watching their Europa League adventure come to a thumping end last week as they slumped to a 7-1 aggregate defeat against Manchester United, Athletic Bilbao faced what was a major backlash. However, claiming an immediate response last weekend as they clinched a 1-0 victory away at Alaves, Ernesto Valverde’s men know that they can officially clinch a famous Champions League spot here. However, hit with a 4-1 drumming when they travelled to Old Trafford last week, the former Barcelona boss has seen his squad show some glaring issues away from San Mames. In fact, Thursday’s guests have mustered just a sole win from any of their previous 11 matchups outside of the Basque Country – a rut that stems all the way back to January 19th. Athletic Bilbao Team News Both once again missing out away at Alaves over the weekend, Athletic Bilbao are once again sweating over the fitness of both Inaki and Nico Williams. However, after serving their own respective suspensions, Valverde will welcome back both Alex Berenguer and Andoni Gorosabel here. However, making a cameo appearance off the bench on Sunday, playmaker Oihan Sancet should make a first La Liga start since April 23rd. Despite failing to find the net since the end of February, 24-year-old Maroan Sannadi will keep his spot leading Bilbao’s attack. Getafe vs Athletic Bilbao Key Factors to Consider When Getafe and Athletic Bilbao met for their reverse La Liga meeting on August 15th, Thursday’s opponents played out a 1-1 stalemate at San Mames. Getafe have lost their previous five straight La Liga appearances by an aggregate score of 9-1. Likewise, Thursday’s hosts have recorded just a single win at the the Estadio Coliseum so far this calendar year. Victory here would officially confirm Athletic Bilbao’s Champions League spot. The Lions are unbeaten in their previous five trips to Getafe (one win, four draws). Conclusion Claiming what was an essential boost last weekend as they clinched a 1-0 victory against Alaves, Athletic Bilbao will be desperate to officially punch their Champions League spot here. Although the Lions might have continued to show some real issues outside of the Basque Country, they meet a Getafe squad who find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. With Thursday’s hosts losing all of their last five straight La Liga appearances by an aggregate score of 9-1, we are backing an away draw no bet in midweek. Verdict: Athletic Bilbao draw no bet Best Odds: 1/1 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
