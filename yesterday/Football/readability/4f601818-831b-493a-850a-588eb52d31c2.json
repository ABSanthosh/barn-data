  "text": "Eddie Howe paid tribute to the in-form Chris Wood ahead of reuniting with the former Newcastle United forward when they face Nottingham Forest on Sunday. Howe’s Newcastle are currently seventh in the Premier League table, trailing the top four by three points, and can go to within a point of third-placed Forest with victory at St James’ Park. The Magpies sold Wood to Forest two years ago with first-team opportunities having become limited for the New Zealander, having joined the previous year. However, he has flourished at the City Ground, and sits third in the Premier League’s Golden Boot standings with 18 goals this season. “I think he has been outstanding,” Howe said. “Chris, when he came to us, helped us in a really difficult situation fighting relegation. “We felt we needed a focal point in that position, somebody who could take a lot of pressure off of us as a team and give us a physical presence. I thought he did all of those things and was outstanding for the team. “I’m delighted for him on a personal level because he is a great character, and gave everything for us.” Howe also said defender Sven Botman is “not quite ready” to feature in this game. The Swede has made just five first-team appearances this season, with only three coming in the Premier League. His last appearance came at the start of the month, in Newcastle’s 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the EFL Cup semi-final second leg. “I don’t think he will be fit and available for this weekend,” Howe added. “We are going to have to see how things stand over the weekend for next week. “He is making progress, but just not as quickly as we wanted him to. He is very much on track, just not quite ready.” Forest boss Nuno Espirito Santo, meanwhile, is seeking improvements from his team, following a 2-1 defeat away to Fulham last time out. Despite being third in the Premier League, Forest come into this match with just two victories from their last five games in the division, and there have been suggestions their form has started to decline. “We have to compete better. That’s what we will be trying to do,” Nuno said. “We are reaching the moment of the season where everyone will be fighting for their own objectives. “We have competed well and this is what we expect in the final stage of the season. The games will be more difficult, and we have to deal with everything that’s all around – the expectations, our own beliefs and moments of the players. “I don’t change my approach. We have to keep the same routine and approach it day by day – look at all the details which enable us to compete well. This is what we’re focused on.” Back to SJP! #NEWFOR pic.twitter.com/PFmzhTfPga — Newcastle United (@NUFC) February 19, 2025 PLAYERS TO WATCH Newcastle United – Alexander Isak Although he has gone two Premier League games without a goal, Newcastle forward Isak has scored in all three of his appearances against Forest (four goals). Five Newcastle players have scored in four successive matches against a single opponent, most recently Callum Wilson against Tottenham between 2020 and 2023. Isak has scored 19 goals in all competitions, including 17 in the Premier League – the fourth-most in the division. Nottingham Forest – Chris Wood Wood has scored 29 Premier League goals in 41 appearances under Nuno for Forest, including eight in his last seven. Among all players to have 50 or more shots while playing for a manager on record since 2003-04, Wood under Nuno has the best shot conversion rate (35%, 29 goals from 83 shots). MATCH PREDICTION: NEWCASTLE WIN Newcastle have lost just one of their 13 Premier League meetings with Forest (won nine, drawn three), though that defeat did come in this exact fixture last season (3-1). Forest have lost their last two away games in the league and are aiming to avoid losing a third on the bounce for the first time since December 2023. Newcastle come into this match having won 12 of their last 15 games in all competitions, including seven out of 10 in the Premier League. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Newcastle United – 51.4% Draw – 23.3% Nottingham Forest – 25.4%",
