The spoils were shared between the division’s two bottom sides, who could not be separated at Kenilworth Road. Substitute Jacob Brown put Luton ahead 10 minutes into the second-half, but Maksym Talovierov nodded in an equaliser for the visitors 20 minutes from time. The Hatters registered 17 shots to their opponents’ three, but are now without a win in their last 12 matches across all competitions. “We are disappointed not to win the game after creating a number of opportunities and limiting our opponents to very little,” Bloomfield told BBC Three Counties Radio. “Unfortunately, we switched off at a tough moment, and it is 1-1. I’m really proud of the intensity. We spent most of the game in their half. We had loads of shots on goal, but we didn’t score enough.” “We have to concentrate on the performance, you can’t just hope for the result without getting the performance right.” This man.pic.twitter.com/oiBs35ChSJ — Plymouth Argyle FC (@Argyle) February 19, 2025 Although they missed the chance to climb out of the relegation zone, Plymouth moved to within a point of safety following the stalemate. And head coach Miron Muslic, whose side have not won away in the Championship all season, was pleased with the way his players responded to falling behind. He told BBC Radio Devon: “It was a very vertical and direct game, the atmosphere was amazing, it felt like England and the Championship. “Luton were very physical, we had to defend about a thousand long balls. We did it well defensively; we didn’t allow them many chances in open play, it was mainly the set-pieces and deep free-kicks. “We conceded the goal through miscommunication. Bouncing back is super difficult, but it is our new mentality. We did it against Sunderland, West Bromwich Albion and also tonight; that is why I’m OK and happy with the point.”",
