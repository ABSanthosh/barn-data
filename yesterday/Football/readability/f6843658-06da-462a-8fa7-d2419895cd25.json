Jude Bellingham and Rodrygo were among the goalscorers for Carlo Ancelotti’s side at King Abdullah Sports City to keep their hopes of a record-equalling 14th title alive. Both Bellingham and Rodrygo came closest to breaking the deadlock as Madrid controlled large periods of the first half, but without reward for their efforts. However, Los Blancos finally broke through in the 63rd minute, with Bellingham managing to squeeze the ball beyond four Mallorca defenders on the line after Rodrygo’s header struck the post and Kylian Mbappe saw his effort saved by Dominik Greif. Madrid wrapped up victory in the second minute of stoppage time, when the unfortunate Martin Valjent turned Brahim Diaz’s centre into his own net. Rodrygo added further gloss to the scoreline in the dying moments, turning in Lucas Vazquez’s pinpoint cross at the far post. @Camavinga@RodrygoGoes#SuperSupercopa pic.twitter.com/tKfqkdUkRo — Real Madrid C.F.(@realmadriden) January 9, 2025 Data Debrief: Three is the magic number for Madrid Madrid matched the scoreline of their most recent Supercopa de Espana game against Mallorca. Indeed, they also won 3-0 in the second leg of their 2003 tie, with Raul, Ronaldo and David Beckham on the scoresheet. Los Blancos have now won three successive games in the competition for only the third time in their history, and they were worthy of their win in Jeddah. They ended the contest with a mammoth expected goals (xG) total of 3.04 from their 28 shots, restricting their opponents to eight attempts, none of which were on target. Notching up a fifth straight victory across all competitions, Ancelotti’s side have now equalled their longest winning streak this season and will be looking to continue their form against rivals Barca in Sunday’s showpiece.",
