Although Mikel Arteta’s side might have already accepted that their domestic dreams have slipped away for another season, the Gunners now have their full focus on claiming what would be an essential first-leg advantage here. Enduring what has become somewhat of a defensive crisis and watching their own domestic charge take a real dent over the weekend, Los Blancos travel to north London on Tuesday night with plenty of pressure on their shoulders. In what could prove to be another Champions League classic on Tuesday night, we have taken a glance at the most appealing Arsenal vs Real Madrid Bet Builder Tips. An enjoyable showdown from the Emirates Watching their Premier League title dreams go up in smoke for another season, it is no secret that Arsenal have firmly placed all of their eggs in the European basket. With Champions League success now their only path to claiming a piece of silverware this season, the Gunners will know the importance of claiming an essential first-leg advantage when they return to north London on Tuesday night. Despite failing to pick up any real momentum over the weekend as they eventually had to settle for a 1-1 stalemate away at Everton, Arteta’s side will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Signing off their group stage adventure with a routine 3-0 romp against Dinamo Zagreb, Arsenal are unbeaten in all of their last 10 European showdowns at the Emirates – a run that stems all the way back to a 5-1 drumming against Bayern Munich in March 2017. With Los Blancos recording just a single clean sheet from any of their previous eight appearances across all competitions, Arsenal will be confident of asking some real questions in the English capital. Bet Builder Tip: Both teams to score @ 19/20 with 1xBet   Pressure mounts on Ancelotti’s shoulders While Real Madrid might still have their sights set on completing another iconic European and domestic sweep in 2025, it is fair to say that Carlo Ancelotti has found some increasing pressure over his long-term future in the Spanish capital. Watching their La Liga dreams suffer a blow over the weekend as they fell to a last-gasp 2-1 loss at home against Valencia over the weekend, Los Blancos do have the feel of a squad seeking some much-welcomed stability. Coming under real Super Cup scrutiny back in January as they slumped to a 5-2 drumming against arch-rivals Barcelona over in the Middle East, Ancelotti’s side have also shown some extended defensive issues. Along with failing to muster a single clean sheet from their previous eight matchups across all fronts, Tuesday’s guests have also conceded at least a pair of strikes in three of their last four outings. Although Los Blancos might have edged past bitter local foes Atletico Madrid last month following an infamous penalty shootout at the Metropolitano, Ancelotti’s men should face another stern examination here. Bet Builder Tip: Lucas Vazquez to be shown a card @ 33/10 with BetUS   All eyes on Saka Making what was an emotional return against Fulham last week and getting on the scoresheet just minuets after making a first appearance of 2025, Arsenal are certainly welcoming back their attacking talisman at a crucial time. Undergoing hamstring surgery over the festive period and forced to watch on from the sidelines over the past few months, the script is written for Bukayo Saka to play a leading role on Tuesday night. With both Gabriel Jesus and former Chelsea star Kai Havertz set to miss the remainder of the season, Arteta has been publicly short on attacking options in north London. However, watching their academy graduate make a pair of appearances off the bench since returning from March’s international break, Saka is expected to make a first start of the calendar year here. Already reopening his Premier League account against Fulham last week and expected to play a leading role on Tuesday night, the England international will be confident of testing a Los Blancos defence that has shown some real frailties. Bet Builder Tip: Bukayo Saka over 0.5 shots on target @ 7/10 with Dachbet Arsenal vs Real Madrid Bet Builder Tips Both teams to score  Lucas Vazquez to be shown a card  Bukayo Saka over 0.5 shots on target  ODDS – 13/1 with Vegas Land You can also visit our betting promotions section for the latest enhanced odds promos, accumulator bonuses and more.",
