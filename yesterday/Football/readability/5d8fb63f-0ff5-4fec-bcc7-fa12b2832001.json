  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Dachbet Desperate to find a route back into the automatic promotion spots on Tuesday night, Leeds will travel to the Riverside when they meet Middlesbrough. Middlesborough Starting with the hosts, while Middlesbrough might have found themselves at the heart of a public crisis when opening 2025, Michael Carrick’s men have come roaring back in an eye-catching fashion. Last seen over the weekend collecting a 2-0 victory away at Blackburn, the former Manchester United coach has seen his squad skyrocket their way up the Championship standings. Now leading the chase to punch a play-off ticket, Boro will be desperate to lay down what would be a heavyweight marker here. Marking their return from March’s international break with a 2-1 win against Oxford, Tuesday’s hosts have collected 10 points from their previous four Championship appearances. In fact, enjoying what has been their most fruitful spell of the calendar year so far, Carrick’s camp have suffered just a sole defeat from any of their last seven second-tier showdowns. Middlesborough Team News Along with suffering from a long-term ankle issue, Leeds loanee Luke Ayling is ineligible to feature against his parent club on Tuesday night. Likewise, all still dealing with respective injury issues, Middlesborough will once again be without the likes of George Edmundson, Ben Doak, Solomon Brynn and Darrragh Lenihan. Arriving from Sevilla during the January transfer window and opening his Championship account against Oxford last week, ex-Leicester striker Kelechi Iheanacho will lead Carrick’s attack. USA international Aidan Morris will partner Hayden Hackney in the middle of the park. Leeds As for the visitors, while Leeds might have appeared to be cruising their way to this season’s Championship crown, the wheels are starting to come off in Yorkshire. Eventually forced to settle for a 1-1 stalemate away at relegation scrappers Luton over the weekend, Daniel Farke’s men are desperately seeking a much-needed boost. Remarkably slipping out of the automatic promotion spots, the former Norwich boss has made his frustrations abundantly clear. Playing out consecutive 2-2 draws against Swansea and QPR on either side of March’s international break, Leeds have now claimed just a sole win from any of their previous six Championship appearances. However, landing a 3-1 victory when they welcomed Middlesbrough to Elland Road for their reverse showdown on December 10th, the Lilywhites will be searching for a repeat performance on Tuesday night. Leeds Team News Heading into Tuesday’s showdown, Leeds have reported a clean bill of health and have no fresh injury concerns to worry about. Publicly replacing Illan Meslier away at Luton over the weekend, former Newcastle shot-stopper Karl Darlow should keep his spot between the sticks. Making a cameo appearance off the bench on Saturday, Patrick Bamford could get some more minutes under his belt. However, despite failing to find the net in each of his last six Championship appearances, Joel Piroe should lead Farke’s attack. Middlesborough vs Leeds Key Factors to Consider When Middlesbrough and Leeds met for their reverse Championship meeting on December 10th, Farke’s side collected a 3-1 victory at Elland Road. However, Leeds have recorded just a single victory from their previous six Championship appearances. Middlesbrough have registered 10 points from their last four Championship matchups. Leeds have registered just a sole clean sheet from their previous eight consecutive Championship appearances. Middlesbrough have recorded just a pair of clean sheets from their first eight appearances at the Riverside so far this calendar year. Conclusion Eventually forced to settle for a 1-1 stalemate away at relegation scrappers Luton over the weekend, Leeds are desperately seeking a much-welcomed boost here. Mustering just a single victory from their previous six Championship appearances and slipping out of the automatic promotion spots, Farke’s side have a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders here. However, lading a 3-1 victory when they welcomed Middlesbrough to Yorkshire for their reverse meeting on December 10th, we could be treated to another enjoyable affair here.
