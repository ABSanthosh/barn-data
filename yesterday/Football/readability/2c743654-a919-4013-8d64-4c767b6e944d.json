  "text": "Marking their return from March’s international break on Wednesday night, Liverpool claimed Merseyside bragging rights as they secured a 1-0 victory against arch-rival Everton at Anfield. While the Reds might have extended on their Premier League romp here, Everton came close to silencing the home support midway through the first-half as Beto saw his strike ruled out by VAR. In what was another fiery Merseyside derby, James Tarkowski incredibly fortunate to stay on the pitch after he won the ball with a sliding challenge but caught Alexis Mac Allister on the knee with his studs with the follow-through. It was eventually Portuguese international Diogo Jota who proved to be Arne Slot’s saviour as the ex-Wolves star slotted home past Jordan Pickford following a solo run. Reestablishing their 12-point lead at the top of the Premier League table, Liverpool certainly claimed what was a much-welcomed boost following on from their public heartbreak prior to the fortnight interval. On a night when Slot’s side moved within touching distance of this season’s crown, we have taken a look at the main talking points from Wednesday’s showdown. Liverpool take another giant leap While Liverpool might have watched their respective EFL Cup and Champions League dreams go up in smoke prior to March’s international break, the Reds certainly claimed what was an essential boost here. With their chances of securing an iconic silverware sweep slipping through their fingers, Wednesday’s hosts are simply looking to sign off their Premier League romp with a flurry. Edging past their arch-rivals here and claiming Merseyside bragging rights, the former Feyenoord boss would have simply been relived to see his squad avoid what would have been another public banana skin. Watching Arsenal claim a 2-1 victory against Fulham on Tuesday night, the Reds once again reestablished their 12-point buffer at the top of the table and they have enjoyed a sensational top-flight romp this season. In fact, Slot’s men require only 13 points from a possible 24 available to guarantee a deserved and record-equalling 20th domestic title. Everton rue a missed opportunity With Liverpool suffering major EFL Cup final heartbreak at Wembley on March 16th as they fell to a 2-1 loss in the capital, Everton travelled across Stanley Park smelling the chance to cash in on a potential hangover in the red half of Merseyside. However, although the Toffees might have enjoyed a real resurge since David Moyes’ emotional return to Goodison Park back in February, Wednesday’s guests have now picked up just a single win from any of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. Watching their FA Cup adventure come to an end on February 8th following a 2-0 loss at home against Bournemouth, Everton have also extended on their Anfield rut. Along with losing each of their previous four trips to Anfield by an aggregate score of 7-0, they have also recorded just a single Premier League victory at Anfield since way back in 1999. Sadly for Everton, things don’t get any easier for Moyes’ men as they welcome Arsenal to Goodison Park this weekend. Jota saves the day at Anfield With Mohamed Salah still at the heart of what has become a public transfer saga as the Egyptian icon remains in the final few months of his deal at Anfield, it appears a real attacking overhaul could be completed this summer. With continued speculation that Darwin Nunez is not part of Slot’s long-term plans ahead of next season, Jota underlined his value to Liverpool’s squad on Wednesday night. Bagging what was a wonderful solo winner here and notching a first Premier League strike since a 1-1 stalemate against Nottingham forest on January 14th, the former Wolves star remains a firm fan favourite around Anfield. With Slot making it clear that the versatile 28-year-old can play a leading role over the final couple of months, Jota appears to be one attacking star who will be staying put an Anfield ahead of the 2025/26 campaign.
