  "text": "Two goals from Patrik Schick helped Bayer Leverkusen battle past Borussia Dortmund to a 3-2 victory on Friday, claiming a sixth-straight league win. Dortmund suffered their first home loss of the Bundesliga campaign, while Leverkusen moved within one point of leaders Bayern Munich. In a frenetic opening, the visitors struck three times in the first 19 minutes as they enjoyed a perfect start to the year with the league resuming following a three-week winter break. High pressing by Leverkusen saw them win possession from the kick-off and Nathan Tella drilled home for the lead with just 25 seconds on the clock. Dortmund, missing half a dozen key players due to injury and illness, had no time to regroup, with Leverkusen scoring again in the eighth minute. Schick slid in to complete a textbook counter-attack from close range. The hosts briefly recovered and pulled a goal back through Jamie Gittens four minutes later, but Schick swiftly restored Leverkusen’s two-goal cushion with a fine finish at the far post after yet another quick break. Edmond Tapsoba gave Dortmund a lifeline late on after cutting off Julien Duranville’s run into the box, with the referee awarding a penalty following a VAR review. Serhou Guirassy confidently scored the resulting spot-kick but, despite some late pressure, Leverkusen held on to secure the three points ahead of Bayern’s trip to Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday. Starting 2025 with a W! ‍ 90+5′ | 2-3 | #BVBB04 pic.twitter.com/fGfVh4yEMT — Bayer 04 Leverkusen (@bayer04_en) January 10, 2025 Data Debrief: Off to a flyer The Bundesliga certainly returned with a bang after the winter break, and the entertaining affair in Dortmund got off to a lightning-quick start. For the first time since March 2000 (9-1 in Ulm), Leverkusen scored three times in the first 19 minutes of a Bundesliga away match. Four goals in the first 19 minutes of a top-flight game involving Leverkusen, meanwhile, is a novelty. Tella’s goal after just 25 seconds was the fastest scored by Leverkusen in the Bundesliga this season, but it was Schick who stole the headlines. The striker now has 11 goals in his last six Bundesliga appearances. Meanwhile, Dortmund lost their first match of a calendar year for the first time since 2004 (previously W15 D5). They were also on a five-game unbeaten streak in the league. The Black and Yellow are still yet to win back-to-back matches under Nuri Sahin.",
