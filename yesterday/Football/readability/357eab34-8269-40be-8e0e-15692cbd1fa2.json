  "text": "Real Madrid’s Dani Carvajal says his confidence is “sky high” as he prepares to make his return from injury against Juventus in the Club World Cup. Carvajal, who has played 286 LaLiga matches, has been sidelined since October 2024 after he ruptured two ligaments and a tendon in his right knee when playing against Villarreal. Injuries to Carvajal and Lucas Vazquez saw former coach Carlo Ancelotti play midfielder Federico Valverde in the right-back position for much of last season. After almost nine months off the pitch, Carvajal is optimistic ahead of his return to the Real Madrid squad. “On a personal level, I feel great, I’m back in the group dynamics,” said Carvajal. “I don’t know if I’ll be part of the squad tomorrow, perhaps I can be on the bench and available to the coach. “I’m really pleased in that sense. I know myself and I know that if they bring me on, I’ll give 100% out there. All out. No fear, confidence is sky high. “This is all behind me now. I’m lacking match practice, I’ve only been back training with the group for a couple of weeks. “There have been moments where being injured really gets to you, but that’s just the way it is. I was up every day, full of energy and grateful, whether it was in the gym or walking around on crutches, I tackled it quite happily. That’s what the process is all about. “The coach is bringing real versatility to the team with [Aurelien] Tchouameni’s position. And I’ll play anywhere, even between the sticks. I’ve played at centre-back, left-back, on the wing… I’m always ready for anything the coach asks of me. I’m available to help out in any way I can.” @DaniCarvajal92 @DHuijsen Víctor Muñoz Full interviews RM Play — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) June 30, 2025 Madrid finished top of Group H, winning two of their three matches and drawing the other, versus Al-Hilal, in a promising start to Xabi Alonso’s reign. Their opponents, Juventus, come into the match after being thrashed 5-2 by Manchester City in their final group fixture. Madrid’s recent signing Dean Huijsen played for Juventus prior to his move to Bournemouth at the start of last season. Huijsen said: “They’re proper defensive specialists and they really work hard on it. I learned an awful lot there and I’m hugely grateful. “We’re ready and I hope we can win it. The plan is to head into it in good shape physically, and we have faith we can do that. We’re playing for pride and to win the game. That’s the plan. “We’re Real Madrid, we’re obliged to keep winning. Our goal is to lift the trophy. It’s brilliant to have players like Carvajal back, he’s crucial for us and will help us to be stronger.”",
