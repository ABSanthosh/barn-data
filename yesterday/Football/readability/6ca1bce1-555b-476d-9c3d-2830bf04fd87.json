  "text": "Verdict: Manchester City win Best Odds: 4/7 Bookmaker: Dachbet Turning their attention back to Premier League action on Saturday afternoon, Manchester City will travel to the Vitality when they meet Bournemouth. Bournemouth Starting with the hosts, snatching what was a sensational last-gasp equaliser away at Aston Villa last weekend, Bournemouth have continued to receive plenty of plaudits this season. Eventually leaving the Midlands with a 1-1 draw to show for their troubles, Andoni Iraola’s side have their sights firmly set on clinching a top-half finish. Marking their return from October’s international break with a famous performance as they secured a 2-0 victory against title contenders Arsenal, the former Rayo Vallecano boss has seen his squad lose just one of their previous four Premier League appearances. Likewise, signing off September with a 3-1 romp against bitter local rivals Southampton, Bournemouth should also be excited by their extended success on home soil. In fact, the Cherries have suffered just a pair of Premier League defeats in front of their own supporters since the end of February. Team News Undergoing knee surgery last week, Bournemouth will be unable to call upon former Bristol City starlet Alex Scott for the foreseeable future. While summer recruit and Chelsea loanee Kepa Arrizabalanga might have missed out away at Aston Villa last weekend, Bournemouth are hopeful that the Spanish shot-stopper will be able to return here. Coming off the bench and bagging a last-gasp equaliser at Villa Park, former Porto striker Evanilson could be handed a full recall. Arriving from Barcelona over the summer, Mexico international Julian Araujo will start at right-back. Manchester City As for the visitors, watching their EFL Cup adventure come to an end earlier in the week following a 2-1 loss away at Tottenham, Manchester City are seeking an immediate response here. Suffering a first defeat across any competition since opening up the new campaign, Pep Guardiola’s side will know that a famous quadruple charge has officially gone up in smoke. However, despite seeing their five-match winning run come to an abrupt end in north London, the Sky Blues are leading the chase at the top of the Premier League table. Although Man City might have recorded just a sole Premier League clean sheet since the opening weekend, Guardiola’s camp will be excited by a dominant record against Saturday’s hosts. Including a 1-0 victory when they travelled to the Vitality back on February 24th, they have remarkably won all of their previous 15 consecutive meetings against Bournemouth. Team News Having to withdraw from City’s starting XI in north London after picking up an injury in the warm-up, Swiss defender Manuel Akanji faces a late fitness call here. Once again not included in Guardiola’s squad on Wednesday night, midfield talisman Kevin De Bruyne remains a doubt this weekend. While Spanish ace Rodri might have been crowned as the 2024 Ballon d’Or winner earlier in the week, the ex-Atletico Madrid midfielder is not expected to feature over the remainder of the season following a long-term knee injury. Handed a full EFL Cup rest in midweek, Erling Haaland will certainly be handed a full recall. Key Factors to Consider When Bournemouth and Manchester City last met back on February 24th, the Sky Blues collected a 1-0 victory at the Etihad. In fact, the defending champions have won each of their last 15 consecutive meetings against Bournemouth. Man City have won each of their previous seven trips to the Vitality by an aggregate score of 17-3. England international Phil Foden has scored in each of his last five straight meetings against Bournemouth. Six of the last seven meetings between Bournemouth and Manchester City have finished with over 2.5 goals. Conclusion Crashing out of the EFL Cup earlier in the week following a 2-1 loss away at Spurs, Manchester City are desperately seeking a much-needed boost on Saturday afternoon. Clinching a 1-0 victory when they last travelled to the Vitality back on February 24th, the Sky Blues hold a rampant record against Bournemouth. In fact, the defending champions have won each of their previous 15 consecutive showdowns across all competitions. Verdict: Manchester City win  Best Odds: 4/7 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
