  "text": "Verdict: Draw Best Odds: 12/5 Bookmaker: Luckster In what is a heavyweight Serie A showdown on Tuesday night, Atalanta will welcome Juventus to Bergamo. Atalanta Starting with the hosts, while Atalanta might have continued to gain a string of plaudits from across Italy’s elite this season, La Dea are seeking a recent boost. Suffering Super Cup frustration earlier in the month as they got the New Year underway with a 2-0 loss at the hands of Inter Milan, Gian Piero Gasperini’s side are without a win from any of their previous three appearances across all competitions. Eventually forced to settle for a 0-0 stalemate away at Udinese last weekend, the Bergamo-based outfit have sacrificed their spot at the top of the Serie A table. Enduring their longest winless run since the end of September, Atalanta will be excited to make a return to home soil here. Last seen in Bergamo claiming an action-packed 3-2 win against Empoli, La Dea have won six of their previous seven showdowns at the Gewiss Stadium. Atalanta Team News Limping off with a first-half knock against Udinese last weekend, Albanian international Berat Djimsiti is not expected to feature here. Not making a single appearance across any competition so far this season, former West Ham striker Gianluca Scamacca remains on the sidelines. Not featuring since picking up a muscle injury against Empoli last month, attacking talisman Mateo Retegui remains a doubt on Tuesday night. While ex-Fulham star Ademola Lookman might be linked with a heavyweight European switch this month, the Nigerian international will play a leading role. Juventus As for the visitors, although there might have been plenty of excitement around Turin last summer following Thiago Motta’s arrival, the Old Lady have struggled to find any kind of stability. Eventually forced to settle for a fiery 1-1 stalemate away at bitter local rivals Torino last weekend, the former Bologna boss does have some mounting pressure on his shoulders. Watching their respective Super Cup charge come to an end on January 3rd as they opened the New Year with a 2-1 loss against AC Milan, Tuesday’s guests are currently sat outside the Champions League spots. Signing off 2024 with an action-packed 2-2 draw at home against Fiorentina, Motta’s side have won just a trio of their previous 11 appearances across all competitions. It should also be noted, Juventus have settled for a single point in five of their last six showdowns away from the Allianz. Juventus Team News Missing out away at Torino last weekend due to a muscle issue, Juventus are once again sweating over the fitness of Dusan Vlahovic on Tuesday night. Likewise, not making a single appearance since the start of October and dealing with a long-term knee injury, Brazilian defender Bremer remains on the sidelines. Serving a one-match suspension last week, Italian international Manuel Locatelli will return to Motta’s squad. Despite notching just a single Serie A strike this season, Nicolas Gonzalez could once again be deployed in a false nine role. Atalanta vs Juventus Key Factors to Consider When Atalanta and Juventus last met in Serie A action 10 months ago, Tuesday’s opponents played out a 2-2 stalemate in Turin. Four of the last five Serie A meetings between Atalanta and Juventus have finished in a draw. Atalanta have won six of their last seven showdowns in Bergamo across all competitions. Juventus have settled for a single point in five of their previous six showdowns away from the Allianz. Nine of the previous 12 meetings between Tuesday’s opponents have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion With Atalanta and Juventus playing out a 2-2 draw when they last met in Serie A action 10 months ago, the two Italian giants do have a habit of settling for a single point when they meet. In fact, four of the previous five top-flight showdowns between Tuesday’s opponents have finished in a stalemate. Likewise, with the Old Lady remarkably only collecting one-point from six of their last seven away fixtures across all competitions, we are expecting a similar outcome from Bergamo.
