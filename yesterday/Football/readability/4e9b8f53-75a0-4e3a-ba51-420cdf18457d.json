  "text": "Vincent Kompany is sweating over the fitness of Harry Kane, who sustained a muscle injury, ahead of their DFB-Pokal tie with Bayer Leverkusen. The striker went down in the 33rd minute of their 1-1 draw with Borussia Dortmund on Saturday, and limped off while his side were 1-0 down thanks to a Jamie Gitttens solo goal. Bayern squandered several good chances in the second half as they struggled with their finishing before Jamal Musiala rescued a point for the league leaders in the 85th minute to extend their unbeaten run. “Harry’s feeling is that it may not be something too serious,” Kompany told a press conference. “But we will have to wait. He will have to do a scan and then we will know more. “But obviously it will be tight for Tuesday. I don’t know many players who can recover that quickly.” Bayern, who before Saturday had won their previous seven matches across all competitions without conceding a single goal, host Leverkusen in the DFB-Pokal round-of-16 on Tuesday. Kane picks up an injury and has to come off the pitch. Müller replaces him in attack. 33′ #BVBFCB 1-0 pic.twitter.com/w9N8HaSdFA — FC Bayern (@FCBayernEN) November 30, 2024 They could have to face it without Kane though, who has scored 20 goals in all competitions this campaign, including a hat-trick against Augsburg last weekend. “Harry’s goals are very hard to replace, but we have said from the start that we trust our squad,” he added. “You cannot replace players of his quality with another place, but the boys can do it together.” Bayern looked to be heading to their first league loss of the campaign without Kane’s punch up front before Musiala’s late equaliser. They have now scored in each of their last 19 games in the Bundesliga, their longest such run in the competition since a run of 43 between September 2022 and January 2024. “We don’t start a game without wanting the three points, but today we did not get the three points. That is the reality,” Kompany said. “We were a goal down so we showed character. We levelled and then kept on pushing and that showed that we have this belief. No successful team can go through a season without such moments.”",
