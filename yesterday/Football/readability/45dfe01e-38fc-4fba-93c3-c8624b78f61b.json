  "text": "Competition: Premier League Market: Bournemouth win Odds: 17/20 @ BetUS Looking to open 2025 with a statement at the Vitality, Bournemouth will welcome Everton to town on Saturday afternoon. Starting with the hosts, signing off 2024 by snatching a last-gasp point away at Fulham, Bournemouth have continued on a real purple patch this season. Receiving a string of plaudits from across the Premier League, Andoni Iraola’s men find the mood around the Vitality at a red-hot high. Gaining a real reputation for their free-flowing approach under the former Rayo Vallecano boss, the Cherries will be smelling another golden opportunity this weekend. Laying down another famous marker away at Manchester United last month as they secured a 3-0 romp at Old Trafford, Bournemouth are riding a major wave of momentum. Collecting a string of heavyweight scalps this season, Saturday’s hosts are also looking to mount a genuine European charge over the second-half of the campaign. Unbeaten in all of their previous seven consecutive Premier League appearances, Bournemouth are rightfully pencilled in as a standout contender here. It should also be highlighted, Bournemouth have suffered just a single Premier League defeat at the Vitality since the middle of September. As for the visitors, while Everton might have shown some real ruggedness last month, the Toffees find themselves at the heart of another Premier League relegation scrap. Last seen signing off 2024 with a downbeat 2-0 loss at home against Nottingham Forest, Sean Dyche has a tremendous amount of pressure on his shoulders at Goodison Park. Opening Saturday’s trip to the Vitality holding just a two-point buffer from slipping into the relegation zone, the former Burnley boss should be bracing himself for another stern examination this weekend. In fact, the Blues have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous 10 consecutive Premier League appearances – a rut that stems all the way back to October 19th. It should also be noted, Everton have continued to show some glaring issues in the final third. Recording just a single goal in any of their previous four top-flight outings, Dyche’s side should also be worried by a downbeat record against Bournemouth. Losing their two Premier League showdowns last season by an aggregate score of 5-3, we are backing a similar outcome here.
