Real Salt Lake sit 10th in the Western Conference after seven matches this season, having won three and lost four of their matches so far. After suffering back-to-back defeats to FC Dallas and Minnesota United, RSL got back to winning ways with a 2-0 victory against struggling LA Galaxy last time out. And Mastroeni admitted he was looking forward to finding a balance that would keep morale up. “It’s difficult to find an equilibrium in the group when you’re not getting results,” he told KSL Sports Zone. “Obviously, when you do get a result, the murmurings stop, so then it’s about how you continue on and build on that game. You’ve got to double down. “It’s a great challenge, and the most important thing for me is to not get low when we’re not getting results, but to also not get high when we win games. I’ve got to be steady and look at the big picture.” Let’s get to know the Boys in Gold #NSHvRSL | @EnglandLogistic — Real Salt Lake (@realsaltlake) April 11, 2025 They face a Nashville side who sit ninth in the Eastern Conference, on 10 points. After a strong start to the season that saw them lose just one of their first five games (W3 D1), Nashville have now suffered back-to-back defeats against FC Cincinnati and Charlotte FC. Nashville lost Walker Zimmerman to injury in that match after the captain was kicked in the head, and while head coach BJ Callaghan is not yet sure if he will feature on Saturday, he is confident whoever is brought in will step up to the plate. “It’s about getting the next man up, getting the connections and cohesiveness to be the same,” Callaghan said. “Walker brings great leadership to the group. So, people are going to have to bear that and take on that responsibility. “That doesn’t mean one person. We just have to take it and share it amongst the 20 that gets named for the match and continue to push forward.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Nashville SC – Hany Mukhtar Hany Mukhtar is scoreless in three career matches against Real Salt Lake, one of only three MLS teams Mukhtar has faced in regular-season play but never scored against (also FC Cincinnati and Vancouver Whitecaps). Almost matchday pic.twitter.com/p3r3jMpMoT — Nashville SC (@NashvilleSC) April 10, 2025 Real Salt Lake – Diego Luna Diego Luna scored both of Real Salt Lake’s goals in their win on Saturday, taking him to 11 goals and 12 assists since the start of the 2024 season. The only United States international with more goal contributions than Luna’s 23 since the start of last season is Djordje Mihailovic (27). MATCH PREDICTION: NASHVILLE SC WIN Each side has a win in the three all-time meetings between Nashville and Real Salt Lake (one draw). Nashville’s lone win came in their only home match against RSL, a 2-0 victory in May 2022. Nashville have 10 points through seven matches this season (W3 D1 L3). Nashville have collected between seven and 11 points after seven matches in each of the club’s six MLS seasons. Meanwhile, all three of Real Salt Lake’s wins this season have come over teams that made the playoffs in 2024, including a 2-0 victory over LA Galaxy on Saturday. Only one of RSL’s four defeats so far have been against playoff teams from a year ago (including a loss to expansion San Diego FC). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Nashville SC – 43.7% Draw – 26.8% Real Salt Lake – 29.6%",
