  "text": "In a showdown between two Premier League giants on Sunday afternoon, Manchester United and Chelsea played out a 1-1 stalemate at Old Trafford. With interim boss and former United marksman Ruud van Nistelrooy once again taking charge this weekend, the Red Devils looked on court to secure successive victories as skipper Bruno Fernandes converted from the spot in the 70th minute, Chelsea mounted an immediate comeback. Watching Moises Caicedo produce a sublime volley just four minutes after Fernandes’ opener, it is hard to argue that either of the Premier League heavyweights deserved to leave Old Trafford with maximum points here. Although Wesley Fofana and Marcus Rashford might have respectively rattled the woodwork during the first half, Sunday’s showdown was a largely unspectacular encounter. However, picking up a first point at Old Trafford since April 2022, Chelsea have skyrocketed their way into the Champions League spots as they leapfrogged London rivals Arsenal. As for Manchester United, still collecting just a single Premier League victory since the middle of September, they remain scrapping it out in the bottom-half of the table and still desperately seeking some kind of stability. With no Premier League fixture in history producing a stalemate on more occasions, we have taken a look at the key talking points from Old Trafford. Amorim watching on from a far Although van Nistelrooy might have once again been in the Manchester United dugout on Sunday afternoon, it was Ruben Amorim who was on the lips of everyone around Old Trafford this weekend. With United officially confirming in midweek that the Sporting Lisbon boss will be taking charge on November 11th, the Portuguese tactician would have been watching on at his soon-to-be new squad here. With Erik ten Hag’s two-year stay coming to an end last weekend following a 2-1 loss away at West Ham, Amorim has plenty of expectations on his young shoulders and appears to have a real job on his hands in the red half of Manchester. Still putting just a single Premier League victory on the board since a 3-0 victory away at Southampton on September 14th and failing to find a route out the bottom-half of the table, United also find themselves sat six points adrift of the European spots. With Amorim not set to officially take the reigns at Old Trafford until United return from the upcoming international break, the ex-Braga bosses first test will come on November 24th when his new squad travel to Ipswich. Chelsea skyrocket into the Champions League spots While some in Chelsea’s camp might have been disappointed on Sunday afternoon as they eventually had to settle for a single point at Old Trafford, Maresca’s side have skyrocketed their way into the Champions League spots. Although the Blues might have watched their EFL Cup adventure come to an end earlier in the week as they fell to a 2-0 loss away at Newcastle, the former Leicester boss has seen his squad continue on a real Premier League flurry. Despite marking their return from October’s international break with a 2-1 loss at the hands of title contenders Liverpool, that is the only defeat that Chelsea have suffered from any of their previous nine Premier League appearances. Only continuing to shine since Maresca’s arrival in west London over the summer, Sunday’s guests suddenly find themselves pencilled in as a standout top-four candidate and the mood around west London appears to be at a real high. Picking up a first point at Old Trafford since back in April 2022, Chelsea face what will be another heavyweight challenge next weekend when they welcome bitter local rivals Arsenal to SW6. United seeking defensive steel Suffering a quick collapse on Sunday afternoon as they failed to collect a first Premier League victory since October 19th, it is no secret that Manchester United are seeking some much-needed defensive steel. Despite punching their EFL Cup quarter-final ticket earlier in the week as they secured a frantic 5-2 win at home against Leicester, the Reds have continued to gain a reputation for their extended struggles at the back. Watching ten Hag’s reign in the red half of Manchester come to an end last weekend following a 2-1 defeat away at West Ham, United have now collected just a single clean sheet across any competition from any of their previous nine appearances across all competitions. Likewise, including respective 3-0 drumming against Liverpool and Tottenham so far this season, Sunday’s hosts have failed to muster a single clean sheet at Old Trafford since a 1-0 victory against Fulham on the opening weekend.
