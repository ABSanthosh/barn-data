  "text": "Blackburn Rovers boss John Eustace said he wants “to bring in three or four players” after his side edged Lancashire rivals Preston North End 2-1 in a heated contest to return to the Championship top six. Makhtar Gueye and Todd Cantwell were on the scoresheet as Eustace’s side ended a run of three straight defeats and climbed to fifth with 45 points from 30 games – one point ahead of West Brom and Middlesbrough. It was their first win against Preston in the Championship since April 2022, ending a run of five games without a victory. “We’re in a good position. If we can bring in three or four players to help this group who’ve been magnificent all season that would be brilliant,” the Blackburn boss told Sky Sports after the game. “You’ve got to remember we were relegation favourites at the start of the season, and we lost 35 goals with Sammie Szmodics leaving and the way the boys stepped up, I think they’ve been magnificent so if we can get some help for them that would be great.” Rovers signed Sierra Leone forward Augustus Kargbo from Italian second division side Cesena on Friday. Full-time: #Rovers 2-1 #pnefc Friday night delight!!! #ROVvPNE pic.twitter.com/F4S0nokCPF — Blackburn Rovers (@Rovers) January 31, 2025 Gueye headed a Tyrhys Dolan cross past Freddie Woodman after battling with Preston’s substitute defender Jack Whatmough in the 39th minute. Blackburn were then awarded a contentious penalty when Whatmough challenged Dominic Hyam while defending a corner and Cantwell made no mistake from the spot to double the home side’s advantage. “I think it was a blatant penalty. I’ve watched it back and the boy has headed him under the neck and nearly knocked him out. I thought it was a penalty for sure,” Eustace said of the incident. It was a nervy finish to the game as Brad Potts reduced the deficit for the visitors in the third minute of the second-half stoppage time before Preston’s shouts for a penalty were waved away after an incident between Gueye and Potts. “Everyone’s seen it, not just me. It’s horrible when things like that decide the game. [Referee] Josh Smith and [fourth official] Jeremy Simpson know that and that’s why they couldn’t wait to get off the pitch,” Preston boss Paul Heckingbottom said of the disallowed penalty. “It’s one of those moments where they’ve got it wrong and realised. But there’s nothing I can do about the referees.” Blackburn, who posted their second win in 10 matches, will next face QPR on Tuesday, while Preston will welcome Wycombe in the FA Cup fourth round on 8 February.",
