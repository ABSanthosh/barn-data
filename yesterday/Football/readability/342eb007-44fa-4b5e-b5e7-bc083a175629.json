  "text": "Competition: Ykkonen Market: OLS Oulu win Odds: 2/3 @ BetUS Looking to climb to the top of the Ykkonen table on Wednesday afternoon, OLS Oulu will welcome KPV to the Castren. Starting with the hosts, while OLS Oulu might have failed to win any of their previous four appearances across all competitions, Mikko Mannila’s men have still enjoyed a hugely successful start to the 2025 campaign. Making their return to the Castren on Wednesday afternoon knowing that they can climb to the top of the Ykkonen table, the Yellows should be smelling a golden opportunity here. Despite eventually having to settle for consecutive 2-2 stalemates against Tampere and Inter Turku 2, the midweek hosts are unbeaten in all of their last six straight second-tier matchups. Pencilled in as a standout contender, OLS will also be excited by their extended success on home soil. Getting June underway with a 6-1 romp against Atlantis, the former Lahti boss has seen his title contenders register 13 points from their previous five Ykkonen showdowns in front of their own supporters – a run that stems all the way back to another 2-2 draw against JJK on April 20th. As for the visitors, making an immediate return to losing ways last weekend as they slumped to what was a woeful 7-1 drumming at the hands of Inter Turku 2, KPV are enduring what has become a real crisis. Shockingly crashing out of the Suomen Cup on June 11th following a 7-0 defeat away at SJK, Henri Myntti’s men are scrapping it out at the foot of the Ykkonen table. Getting June underway with a 4-1 loss at home against Mikkeli, Wednesday’s guests find themselves pencilled in as a standout relegation candidate. Including a 1-0 defeat against EPS last month, the Kokkola-based outfit have lost four of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Unsurprisingly gaining a reputation for their glaring defensive issues, KPV should be set for another tricky test in midweek. Losing their last three consecutive away fixtures by an aggregate score of 15-1, we are backing a home victory on Wednesday afternoon. Bet: OLS Oulu 2/3 to beat KPV in Wednesday’s Ykkonen showdown @ BetUS",
