  "text": "Competition: Serie B Market: Goal to be scored in both halves Odds: 8/11 @ 1xBet Two sides who are desperately seeking a Serie A boost on Saturday afternoon, Parma will welcome Monza to the Stadio Ennio Tardini. Starting with the hosts, while Parma might have opened December with a sensational 3-1 victory against Italian giants Lazio, it appears that might have just been a minor boost for the Crusaders. Last seen putting in a nightmare performance as they slumped to a 5-0 drumming at the hands of Roma, Fabio Pecchia’s men have now lost each of their previous three Serie A appearances. Suffering major frustration at the Stadio Ennio Tardini earlier in the month as they fell to an action-packed 3-2 defeat against Verona, the former Cremonese boss will have a real headache over his side’s glaring issues at the back. Including a 3-1 loss against defending champions Inter Milan on December 6th, Parma have lost their last three consecutive outings by an aggregate score of 11-3. Marking their return from November’s international break with another 3-1 defeat against Atalanta, Saturday’s hosts have put just a single clean sheet on the board since opening up the new campaign. It should also be noted, continuing on from last season, Pecchia’s side have registered just a sole clean sheet at the Stadio Ennio Tardini since the end of April. As for the visitors, while some in Monza’s camp might have opened up the new campaign with their sights set on mounting a genuine top-half charge, Alessandro Nesta’s men have endured a public Serie A crisis this time around. Breaking a string of unwanted records this year, the Biancorossi sit rock-bottom of the table and pencilled in as a leading relegation contender in 2025. In fact, putting just 10 points on the board from any of their first 17 appearances, the Lombardy-based outfit also opened Christmas Day sat five points adrift of safety. Crashing out of the Coppa Italia on December 3rd as they fell to a 4-0 drumming at the hands of Bologna, Saturday’s guests have lost each of their previous four domestic matchups across all competitions by an aggregate score of 10-3. Last seen getting hit with a 2-1 defeat at home against Juventus, Nesta’s side have also shown their own respective defensive issues. It should be highlighted, Monza have recorded just a sole clean sheet across any competition since the opening weekend. Bet: Goal to be scored in both halves at Parma vs Monza 8/11 for Saturday’s Serie B battle @ 1xBet",
