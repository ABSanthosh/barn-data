  "text": "Competition: League One Market: Reading win Odds: 19/20 @ Pribet Looking to find a route into the play-off places, Reading will welcome Cambridge to the Madejski on Tuesday night. Starting with the hosts, despite scrapping it out at the foot of the League One table last season, Reading have made a string of improvements this time around. Eventually extending on their FA Cup adventure last weekend as they secured a dramatic 5-3 win against non league outfit Harborough, Ruben Selles’ men will be hoping for a more routine outing here. With their sights set on mounting a genuine play-off charge this year and opening the midweek fixtures with just their goal difference keeping them outside the top-six, Reading are unbeaten in each of their last five appearances across all competitions. Appearing to have found a real clinical edge in the final third and notching 13 goals on their five-match unbeaten flurry, Tuesday’s hosts will also be excited by their remarkable success on home soil. Including a routine 3-0 win against Newport while in EFL Trophy action on November 12th, Selles’ men have won all of their previous seven straight showdowns at the Madejski. As for the visitors, suffering FA Cup heartbreak over the weekend as they suffered a 2-1 loss at home against Wigan, Cambridge find themselves at the heart of a real struggle. Scrapping it out in yet another League One relegation scrap, Gary Monk’s men appear to have a real uphill battle on their hands. Crashing back down to earth since their brief October boost, the former Birmingham boss has seen his squad fail to win any of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Hit with a nightmare 6-1 drumming at the hands of Peterborough on November 9th, Cambridge should face another challenge here. Pencilled in as a real underdog on Tuesday night, Cambridge have also continued to show a string of issues away from the Abbey Stadium. In fact, continuing on from last season, Monk’s downbeat squad have recorded just a pair of away wins since the end of March. Likewise, falling to a 1-0 loss when they travelled to Reading back on March 16th, we are expecting a similar outcome here. Bet: Reading 19/20 to beat Cambridge United in Tuesday’s League One battle @ Pribet",
