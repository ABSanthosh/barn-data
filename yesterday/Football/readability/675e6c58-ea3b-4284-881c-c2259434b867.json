Wiegman watched on as the Lionesses came from a goal down to beat Italy 2-1 in extra-time, with the win sealed by substitutes Michelle Agyemang and Chloe Kelly. Barbara Bonansea had given Italy the lead in the 33rd minute before Agyemang levelled the game in the sixth minute of injury time with an instinctive finish past Laura Giuliani. And Kelly confirmed England’s place in Sunday’s showpiece match in the 119th minute, tucking home on the rebound after seeing her penalty saved. The victory was Wiegman’s 100th as a permanent international manager (D21 L20), with 48 of those coming with England in what has been a memorable tenure. Indeed, since she took over in 2021, the Lionesses have now reached three consecutive major tournament finals (Euros/World Cup) under the 55-year-old’s stewardship. England are the third team to achieve such a feat, after Germany (three – 1995-1997 and five, 2001-2009) and Norway (five, 1987-1993). “We’re going to make a movie some day! Well this is a movie. My goodness, it’s unbelievable. Here we are again, it’s really really special,” Wiegman told BBC Radio 5 Live. 3 – England have become the third European team to reach the final of three consecutive major tournaments (World Cup/EURO) after Germany (3, 1995-1997 and 5, 2001-2009) and Norway (5, 1987-1993). Hat-trick. pic.twitter.com/nFlj8YxaVg — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) July 22, 2025 England are the first team to progress from both the quarter-final and semi-final in a single edition of the Women’s Euros, having conceded the first goal in both matches. The Lionesses came from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Sweden before defeating them in a penalty shoot-out in the last eight. But England were made to work for their win, with Italy defending stoutly and attempting to slow the game down in the closing stages as they threatened a stunning upset. Wiegman, however, was quick to applaud her team’s never-say-die attitude, and believes that could be crucial to retaining their crown in Switzerland. “We’ve seen so many different England teams now, and we never give up, that’s one thing,” Wiegman added in an interview with ITV Sport. “We say we can win by any means but, of course, against Sweden with the penalty shoot-out we were a bit lucky because they missed too. “I think now, we are not going for that goal. We take risks, but it gives us something. This team just keeps going. We never give up.” But for Italy and Andrea Soncin, meanwhile, it was a heartbreaking end to a sensational campaign, having reached the final four of the Euros for the first time since 1997. However, they were rocked by Agyemang’s equaliser, which was England’s latest goal on record (since 2013) in a match at the Women’s Euros (excluding extra-time). That was followed by Kelly’s winning strike, which was the latest goal ever scored at any edition of the competition. 119 – In the 119th minute, England’s Chloe Kelly has scored the latest goal in UEFA Women’s EURO history. Heroine. pic.twitter.com/TD9tqaF9FV — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) July 22, 2025 Italy’s players were seen in tears on the pitch following the full-time whistle, but Soncin commended his players for their brilliant performances at the tournament. “This defeat hurts but we are proud. We were one minute away from the final, but you don’t always get what you deserve,” Soncin said. The Italy boss also had his say on the decision to award England’s late spot-kick after Emma Severini had brought down Beth Mead inside the area. “They were holding each other. Was it a penalty? I don’t know,” he added.",
