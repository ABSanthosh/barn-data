The Blades were in control from the start at Bramall Lane and now have a three-point cushion over Leeds United, who face Swansea City on Saturday. Ephron Mason-Clark saw the first real opening for Coventry after a lightning-quick counter-attack, but his first-time shot was tamely hit straight at Michael Cooper. Just three minutes later, the visitors found themselves behind. Gustavo Hamer stepped up to a free-kick just outside the box and whipped a delightful strike into the top corner, giving Oliver Dovin no chance. Tyrese Campbell doubled United’s lead on the half-hour mark; Femi Seriki’s persistence down the right paid off as he rode two challenges before whipping a low cross into the box, which Campbell guided into the net with a first-time finish. Coventry were then dealt another blow as Dovin left on a stretcher shortly after, seemingly jarring his knee in an attempt to keep the ball, and Bradley Collins was quickly put under pressure following his introduction. He parried Campbell’s shot straight to Anel Ahmedhodzic, though his header was ruled out as the former was offside. The goalkeeper then brilliantly denied Sydie Peck, reflexively tipping his header over the bar. Rhian Brewster made sure of the points in the 62nd minute. Having played a one-two with Ben Brereton Diaz, he took aim from just inside the box to pick out the corner. Coventry got a late consolation, with Jack Rudoni steering in Luis Binks’ nod down from close range, but the visitors stay fifth in the table and looking over their shoulders, with West Brom and Bristol City yet to play this weekend. OUTSTANDING. pic.twitter.com/FkT36VnGgz — Sheffield United (@SheffieldUnited) March 28, 2025 Data Debrief: Blades on top It was a fairly comfortable win for United, who extended their unbeaten streak to five matches in the league by following their derby win over Sheffield Wednesday with another victory. Brewster was the hero in that game, and his goal capped off an impressive game for the Blades as he netted his first goal at Bramall Lane since January 2022. He has now contributed to three goals in his last three home matches, having also notched two assists during that run. Coventry could not make the most of the 11 shots they did have though – only four were on target, while they created just 1.12 expected goals (xG), while United outperformed their 1.73 xG.",
