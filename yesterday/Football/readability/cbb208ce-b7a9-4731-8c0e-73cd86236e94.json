The Seagulls had taken an early lead when Simon Adingra curled a lovely effort into the far corner, only for goals from Ollie Watkins and Morgan Rogers to turn the contest around. Starting in place of the suspended Jhon Duran following his red card against Newcastle United, Watkins converted a penalty awarded for Joao Pedro’s challenge on Rogers, then teed up Rogers to make it 2-1 early in the second half. Brighton equalised 10 minutes from time, however, as Joao Pedro teed up Lamptey to drill a low effort past Emiliano Martinez, denting Villa’s Champions League hopes. Unai Emery’s men remain ninth in the Premier League table while Brighton, now without a win in seven matches, stay two points behind them in 10th. A point each at Villa Park. #AVLBHA pic.twitter.com/7bPRjU4jiK — Aston Villa (@AVFCOfficial) December 30, 2024 Data Debrief: Seagulls’ wait for a win goes on Brighton did well to fight back from 2-1 down to earn a point, but it is now seven matches without a win for the Seagulls, their longest winless run since April 2022 under Graham Potter. Joao Pedro, who had to be bandaged up following an aerial duel with Boubacar Kamara just 30 seconds into the match, highlighted his quality with two assists to take him to five overall in the Premier League this season, which is more than any other Brighton player. All of these assists have come since the start of November too, with only Mohamed Salah registering more in the league in that timeframe. For Villa, Watkins led the line well in the absence of Duran and his goal continued his strong record against Brighton. He now has seven in total against the Seagulls – the most he’s scored against any side in the Premier League.",
