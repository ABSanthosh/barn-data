While Forest might have taken an early lead as Callum Hudson-Odoi produced a wonderful effort in the first six minutes, Eddie Howe’s men completed a dominant first-half comeback on home soil. Watching Lewis Miley and Jacob Murphy complete a quick fire turnaround in the space of a few minutes, it was then Alexander Isak’s chance to steal all of the headlines at St. James’ Park. With Newcastle’s striking sensation bagging his own Premier League brace in the matter of seconds, Howe’s side have climbed up to fifth in the table and just their goal difference keeps them outside the top-four. Although the Magpies might have been sat firmly in the driving seat, Nottingham Forest did come close to completing their own remarkable comeback. Serbian defender Nikola Milenkovic took advantage of a defensive lapse to pull a goal back, before substitute Ryan Yates set up a nail-biting finish with a close-range goal following a corner in the 90th minute. However, despite still sitting in the Champions League spots, Forest have lost three of their previous four Premier League appearances. In what was a pulsating contest on Sunday afternoon, we have taken a look at the main talking points from St. James’ Park. Newcastle claim an immediate response Falling to a woeful 4-0 drumming away at Manchester City last weekend, Newcastle were desperately seeking an immediate response when they returned to St. James’ Park on Sunday afternoon. Mounting a sensational comeback here and skyrocketing their way back into the European spots, Howe’s camp also now find just their goal difference keeping them outside the Champions League places. Booking their spot in the final of this season’s EFL Cup final earlier in the month as they claimed a dominant 4-0 aggregate win against Arsenal, the former Bournemouth boss should find the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Extending on their FA Cup adventure on February 8th as they secured an action-packed 3-2 victory away at Birmingham, Newcastle have also found a real clinical edge in the final third. Winning three of their previous four appearances across all competitions, the Magpies will be looking to collect a heavyweight scalp when they travel to runaway leaders Liverpool in midweek. Forest watch their Champions League dreams take a dent While Nottingham Forest might have cemented their spot as one of Europe’s ultimate surprise packages this season, Sunday’s guests have struggled to find much stability over the past month. Although Nuno Espirito Santo’s side might still remarkably find themselves sat in the Champions League spots, their top-four dreams have taken somewhat of a blow. Throwing away the lead here and eventually falling to what was a sensational 4-3 loss at St. James’ Park, the former Tottenham boss has seen his squad lose three of their previous four Premier League appearances. Likewise, although Nottingham Forest might have avoided an infamous FA Cup exit at the hands of League One outfit Exeter City on February 11th, they have shown some extended defensive issues. Including a shock 5-0 drumming at the hands of Bournemouth last month, Santo’s camp have now conceded 13 goals in their last four showdowns away from the City Ground across all competitions. Isak shines against at St. James’ Park With Newcastle now firmly setting their sights on booking a lucrative Champions League return in 2025, Howe’s men will know that a top-four finish will be their best chance to keep hold of their biggest superstars. Although the record-breaking Isak might remain heavily linked with a blockbuster move away from St. James’ Park this summer, the former Real Sociedad ace has only continued to underline his status as Newcastle’s leading poster boy. Notching a first-half brace here, Isak has recorded 19 Premier League goals so far this season and only Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah has registered more top-flight strikes. Likewise, bagging eight domestic goals across all competitions since opening the New Year, the Swedish international certainly finds his stock at a red-hot high. Breaking a string of records since arriving from St. James’ Park back in the summer of 2022, it is no surprise why the 25-year-old is attracting plenty of interest from across Europe’s elite.
