  "text": "Verdict: San Diego FC win Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Looking to widen their buffer at the top of the Western Conference standings, San Diego will welcome Houston to California in the early hours of Sunday. San Diego FC Starting with the hosts, while San Diego might have only made their MLS debut this season, Mickey Varas’ side have embarked on a remarkable start to life among America’s elite. Last seen putting in another action-packed display as they clinched a 3-2 victory away at Dallas, the California-based outfit have rightfully received a string of plaudits. Opening this weekend’s fixtures leading the chase at the top of the Western Conference standings, SDFC find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Including a 5-3 win against Vancouver on June 26th, San Diego have now won all of their previous four consecutive MLS appearances by an aggregate score of 14-7. Likewise, suffering just a sole defeat from any of their last 10 straight outings, Varas’ high-flying squad will be looking to lay down another marker here. San Diego FC Team News Once again missing out away at Dallas last week, San Diego are still sweating over the fitness of one-time Manchester United youngster Paddy McNair. Likewise, former Mainz striker Marcus Ingvartsen remains a major doubt ahead of Sunday’s showdown. Enjoying what has been a remarkable run of form since arriving from Anderlecht ahead of the 2025 campaign, Danish international Anders Dreyer will play a leading role in the final third. Handed a full MLS debut last week, Ghanian starlet Manu Duah will be hoping to keep his spot in the middle of the park. Houston Dynamo As for the visitors, managing to claim what was a much-welcomed boost last week as they snatched a 1-0 victory at home against St. Louis City, Houston will be desperate to use that gritty performance as a platform to build on. However, losing each of their other three MLS appearances over the past month by a 3-1 scoreline, La Naranja are sat outside the play-off places and will be bracing themselves for a monumental challenge here. Collecting consecutive MLS wins on just a single occasion so far this season, Ben Olsen’s men have also shown some real defensive issues. Watching their US Open Cup adventure come to a thumping end on May 22nd as they slumped to another 3-1 loss against Austin, Sunday’s guests are rightfully installed as a landslide underdog this weekend. Houston Dynamo Team News Both still dealing with respective knee injuries, Houston will once again be without the duo of Nelson Quinones and former Columbus goalkeeper Andrew Tarbell this weekend. However, after serving a one-match suspension last week, Griffin Dorsey could be handed a full recall. Completing a permanent switch from St. Mirren ahead of the 2025 campaign, one-time Middlesbrough youngster Toyosi Olusanya will be hoping to get some more minutes under his belt. Bagging the winner against St. Louis last week, Ezequiel Ponce will play a leading role in the final third. San Diego FC vs Houston Dynamo Key Factors to Consider Sunday’s showdown in California will be the first competitive meeting between San Diego and Houston. San Diego have won their previous four consecutive MLS appearances by an aggregate score of 14-7. Former Anderlecht star Anders Dreyer has recorded 21 direct goal contributions in his 20 MLS appearances so far this season. San Diego have recorded 13 points in their previous five MLS appearances in California. Houston have conceded a trio of goals in three of their last four showdowns outside of Texas. Conclusion In the midst of what has been a sensational fairytale since getting their maiden MLS campaign underway this season, San Diego will simply be looking to extend their buffer at the top of the Western Conference table. Rightfully receiving a string of plaudits from across America’s elite, Sunday’s hosts are riding a major wave of momentum. Winning their previous four straight MLS showdowns by an aggregate score of 14-7, Varas’ camp have also registered 13 points from their last five matchups in California. Verdict: San Diego FC win Best Odds: 7/10 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
