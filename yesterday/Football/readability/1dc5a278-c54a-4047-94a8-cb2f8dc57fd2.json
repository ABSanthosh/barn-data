  "text": "Competition: Eredivisie Market: Goal to be scored in both halves Odds: 2/3 @ BetUS In what could prove to be a thrilling Eredivisie showdown on Wednesday night, Utrecht will welcome Sparta Rotterdam to the Stadion Galgenwaard. Starting with the hosts, eventually falling to what could be a costly 2-0 loss away at Twente over the weekend, Utrecht will know the importance of claiming an immediate response here. Nevertheless, continuing to receive a string of plaudits from across Holland’s elite, Ron Jans’ men open Wednesday’s contest sat just three points adrift of finding a route into the Champions League spots. Signing off April with a stellar 4-0 romp away at Waalwijk, the former Cincinnati boss has seen his squad win each of their other three Eredivisie. Springing a famous upset on April 20th as they secured another 4-0 win against Dutch giants Ajax, Utrecht will certainly be excited to make a return to the Stadion Galgenwaard here. In fact, Wednesday’s hosts have won all of their previous three consecutive Eredivisie matchups in front of their own supporters by an aggregate score of 9-1. It should also be highlighted, Jans’ men have registered 12 points from their last five matchups on home soil. As for the visitors, while Sparta Rotterdam might have signed off 2024 in the midst of a relegation scrap, the Castle Lords have come roaring back in a sensational fashion. Last seen making an immediate return to winning ways as they stormed their way to a 3-0 victory away at Almere City, Maurice Steijn’s side have come skyrocketing up the Eredivisie standings. Including a 3-1 win against Heerenveen last month, Wednesday’s guests have suffered just a single defeat from any of their previous nine top-flight appearances – a purple patch that stems all the way back to February 14th. Remarkably not sat just one-point adrift of finding a route into the European spots, Sparta Rotterdam have also gained a reputation for their dominance on the road. Along with registering 10 points from their previous four Eredivisie matchups away from the Sparta Stadion, Steijn’s men have not suffered a single loss on their travels over the past three months.
