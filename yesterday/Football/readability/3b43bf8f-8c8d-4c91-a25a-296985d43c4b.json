  "text": "Competition: Ligue 2 Market: Over 1.5 goals Odds: 2/5 @ BetUS Looking to move within touching distance of the automatic promotion spots on Monday night, Dunkerque will travel to the Stade Paul-Lignon when they meet Rodez. Starting with the hosts, while Rodez might have stormed their way to a sensational 5-0 romp away at Pau on February 14th, it appears that might have just been a minor boost for Didier Santini’s men. Getting Monday’s showdown underway holding just a two-point buffer from slipping into the relegation play-off spot, the Reds have a real battle on their hands in the race to keep hold of their Ligue 2 status. Last seen getting March underway with a 3-1 drumming away at Lorient, Rodez have collected just a single victory from any of their previous seven second-tier appearances. Marking their return from France’s festive break, Monday’s hosts have also drastically failed to find any kind of stability on home soil. Including a 2-1 loss against AC Ajaccio on January 24th, Santini’s side have recorded just a single victory at the Stade Paul-Lignon from their first five appearances of 2025. It should also be noted, Rodez have seen all of their last 10 consecutive Ligue 2 showdowns finish with over 1.5 goals. As for the visitors, while Dunkerque might have only just clung to their Ligue 2 status last season, the Seasiders have enjoyed a real fairytale this time around. Already cementing their spot as one of France’s ultimate surprise packages, Luis Castro’s side remarkably open Monday’s showdown knowing that they can move within touching distance of the automatic promotion spots. Last seen putting in another eye-catching display as they clinched a 2-1 victory away at AC Ajaccio, Monday’s guests have won each of their previous six appearances across all competitions. Booking a famous Coupe de France semi-final ticket last month as they claimed a stunning 3-2 win away at Ligue 1 Brest, Dunkerque have also impressed with their free-scoring performances in the final third. In fact, the former Benfica coach has seen his squad win all of their previous four Ligue 2 outings by an aggregate score of 8-1. Breaking a string of records and riding an iconic wave of momentum, it should also be noted that the promotion contenders have won all of their last six consecutive matchups outside of Dunkirk. Bet: Over 1.5 goals at Rodez vs Dunkerque 2/5 for Monday’s Ligue 2 battle @ BetUS",
