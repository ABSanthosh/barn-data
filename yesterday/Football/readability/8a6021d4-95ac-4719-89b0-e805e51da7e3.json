  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score – No Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Olympusbet With all eyes falling on the San Siro this weekend, Inter Milan and Roma will meet on Sunday afternoon for what is a heavyweight Serie A showdown. Inter Milan Starting with the hosts, while Inter Milan might open this weekend’s fixtures leading the chase at the top of the Serie A table, Simone Inzaghi’s side are desperately seeking a recent boost. With just their goal difference keeping them ahead of title foes Napoli, the former Lazio boss is bracing himself for a must-win showdown here. Watching their Coppa Italia adventure come to a thumping end on Wednesday night following a nightmare 3-0 drumming at the hands of arch-rivals AC Milan, Inter have a tremendous amount of pressure on their shoulders. However, despite suffering consecutive defeats for the first time this season, Sunday’s hosts do hold a dominant record against Roma. In fact, Inzaghi’s side have won all of their previous four meetings by an aggregate score of 8-2. Inter Milan Team News Once again missing out against AC Milan earlier in the week, Inter are once again expected to be without French striker Marcus Thuram on Sunday afternoon. Likewise, not featuring since returning from March’s international break, Denzel Dumfries remains on the sidelines with a thigh issue. Handed a full rest on Wednesday night, former Bayern Munich defender Benjamin Pavard should be handed a full recall. Notching 12 Serie A strikes so far this season, attacking talisman Lautaro Martinez will spearhead Inzaghi’s charge in the final third. Roma As for the visitors, while Roma might have watched their Europa League adventure come to an end last month following a 3-1 defeat against Spanish outfit Athletic Bilbao, the Wolves have continued on a major domestic romp. Gaining a string of plaudits since Claudio Ranieri’s emotional return back in November, Sunday’s guests find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. Last seen claiming a gritty 1-0 victory against Verona, the former Leicester boss has seen his squad come skyrocketing up the Serie A standings. Likewise, claiming consecutive 1-0 wins against Lecce and Roma on either side of March’s international break, Roma are unbeaten in all of their previous 17 consecutive Serie A showdowns – a purple patch that stems all the way back to December 15th. Roma Team News Not making a single appearance since the start of March, Saudi Arabian international Said Abdulhamid remains on the sidelines with a thigh injury. However, returning from a knock earlier in the month, former Juventus ace Paulo Dybala should get some minutes under his belt. Bagging the winner against Verona last week and now notching two goals in his previous three Serie A appearances, Uzbekistan international Eldor Shomurodov will keep his spot leading the line. Ex-Eintracht Frankfurt star Evan Ndicka will partner Gianluca Mancini at the back. Inter Milan vs Roma Key Factors to Consider When Inter Milan and Roma met for their reverse Serie A showdown on October 20th, the Nerazzurri collected a 1-0 victory at the Stadio Olimpico. In fact, the reigning Italian champions have won their previous four meetings against Roma by an aggregate score of 8-2. Roma are unbeaten in all of their previous 17 consecutive Serie A showdowns – a purple patch that stems all the way back to December 15th. Inter Milan have suffered consecutive defeats for the first time this season. Only one of the last four meetings between Inter Milan and Roma have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Watching their Coppa Italia adventure come to a thumping end earlier in the week as they fell to a 3-0 drumming at the hands of arch-rivals AC Milan, Inter have a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders here. Suffering consecutive defeats for the first time this season, the reigning Italian champions will certainly face a rugged challenge on Sunday afternoon. Meeting a Roma squad who has not tasted a single Serie A defeat since the middle of December, we could be set for a nail-biting affair.
