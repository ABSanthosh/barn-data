  "text": "Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/13 Bookmaker: Luckster Seeking an immediate response on Friday night, Bayern Munich will welcome RB Leipzig to the Allianz for what is a heavyweight showdown. Bayern Munich Starting with the hosts, while Bayern Munich might still hold a four-point buffer at the top of the Bundesliga table, the German giants are enduring a recent wobble. Suffering what was an infamous 2-1 loss away at Mainz last weekend and missing out on what was billed as a golden opportunity, Vincent Kompany’s men are seeking some recent stability. Crashing out of the DFP Pokal on December 3rd following a 1-0 defeat at home against defending champions Bayer Leverkusen, the former Burnley boss has seen his squad win just a pair of their previous five appearances across all competitions. However, desperate to reclaim their Bundesliga crown this season, it should be highlighted that Bayern have won all of their previous four Bundesliga showdowns at the Allianz by an aggregate score of 14-2. Bayern Munich Team News While England skipper Harry Kane might have missed each of Bayern’s last four appearances with a back issue, Kompany’s side are hopeful that the former Tottenham ace can make a timely return here. However, all still dealing with respective injury issues, the likes of Manuel Neuer, Kingsley Coman and Serge Gnabry will miss out on Friday night. Israel international Daniel Peretz will keep his spot between the sticks this weekend. Making 10 direct Bundesliga goal contributions since arriving from Crystal Palace over the summer, French ace Michael Olise will play a leading role here. RB Leipzig As for the visitors, while RB Leipzig might have suffered Champions League heartbreak at home against Aston Villa last week as they eventually fell to a 3-2 loss, the Red Bulls claimed an immediate response. Eventually dragging themselves to an eye-catching 2-1 win against a high-flying Eintracht Frankfurt last time out, Marco Rose’s men have won each of their previous three domestic appearances across all competitions. However, hit with a 2-1 loss when they travelled to the Allianz back in February, Leipzig have continued to show some real issues on the road. Marking their return from November’s international break with an action-packed 4-3 defeat against Hoffenheim, Friday’s guests have lost four of their last five showdowns away from the Red Bull Arena. RB Leipzig Team News Not making a single appearance across any competition since returning from November’s international break, Danish striker Yussuf Poulsen remains on the sidelines. Failing to make much of an impact after arriving from Napoli on a permanent basis over the summer, Eljif Elmas is still dealing with a muscle injury. Likewise, still working his way back to full fitness after sustaining an ankle injury back in October, PSG loanee Xavi Simons is not expected to feature this weekend. Both getting on the scoresheet against Frankfurt last week, Benjamin Sesko and Lois Openda will lead the line. Bayern Munich vs RB Leipzig Key Factors to Consider When Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig last met back in February, Friday’s hosts collected a 2-1 win at the Allianz. In fact, Bayern have lost just one of their last 15 straight showdowns against the Red Bulls. Munich have recorded just a pair of wins from any of their previous five appearances across all competitions. RB Leipzig have lost four of their previous five away fixtures across all formats. Seven of the last eight meetings between Bayern Munich and RB Leipzig have finished with both teams finding the net. Conclusion Falling to a shock 2-1 loss when they travelled to Mainz last weekend, Bayern Munich will have plenty of pressure on their shoulders here. Winning just a pair of their previous five appearances across all competitions, the German giants know that they must find some recent stability. Landing a 2-1 victory when they welcomed RB Leipzig to the Allianz back in February, Friday’s opponents do have a habit of producing fireworks when they meet. With seven of their last eight showdowns finishing with both teams finding the net, we are expecting a similar outcome. Verdict: Both teams to score Best Odds: 8/13 Bookmaker: Luckster",
