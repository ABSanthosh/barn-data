  "text": "Barcelona made it 12 LaLiga games unbeaten as they beat Leganes 1-0 to move seven points clear at the summit. The Blaugrana grabbed the decisive goal just after the break at Estadio Municipal de Butarque on Saturday. Leganes defender Jorge Saenz turned into his own net when attempting to block Raphinha’s cross, with Robert Lewandowski lingering with intent. Lewandowski, chasing his 100th goal for Barca, later saw his header from Raphinha’s cross go wide before he was replaced by Ferran Torres after 67 minutes. The hosts looked to have levelled when Dani Raba headed home Adria Altimira’s cross but the goal was disallowed for offside. Second-place Real Madrid must now win at Alaves on Sunday to reduce the gap back to four points, while Leganes remain in the relegation zone. 3 – #Barcelona have benefited from three own goals in @LaLigaEn 2024/25, more than any other team (3 also from Sevilla), while #Leganés are, with three, the team in the competition with the most own goals scored this campaign. Confusion. pic.twitter.com/ZwcATsxQmC — OptaJose (@OptaJose) April 12, 2025 Data Debrief: Rub of the green Barca got the win, though their performance was nothing to write home about, especially on the back of their 4-0 hammering of Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League. The Blaugrana had 12 attempts but got only three on target, registering 1.19 expected goals. However, they failed to have a single shot on target in the first half. It is the second time that has happened this season in all competitions, after they also failed to do so against Real Sociedad in November. But when you are charging clear at the top, you often get a slice of good fortune, and Barca benefited from an own goal for the third time in LaLiga this season. Only Sevilla can match that tally of own goals in their favour, while Leganes have now scored three own goals in 2024-25.",
