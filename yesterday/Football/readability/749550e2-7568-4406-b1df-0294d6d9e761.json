  "text": "West Ham United made it back-to-back Premier League wins by seeing off struggling Leicester City 2-0 at the London Stadium on Thursday. Birthday boy Tomas Soucek provided the breakthrough for the Hammers 21 minutes in, tucking in after Mads Hermansen parried Mohammed Kudus’ strike. Graham Potter’s team did not look back from there as they claimed consecutive top-flight victories for the first time since March last year, following on from their hard-fought win over Arsenal last time out. Jannik Vestergaard’s own goal, which came from Jarrod Bowen’s low shot from a tight angle, made it 2-0 to the Hammers before half-time. And despite the looming spectre of relegation, Leicester offered little in the way of a response, registering only one shot on target and creating chances worth only 0.3 expected goals in the second half. Indeed, Evan Ferguson could have done better when presented with a great chance to make it 3-0, though Harry Winks recovered to make a fantastic block. West Ham’s win takes them into 15th, above Everton, and Potter’s team are now 16 points clear of the bottom three. Ruud van Nistelrooy’s Leicester, meanwhile, are staring down the barrel of relegation with a tough run of fixtures to come. 2 – Tomás Soucek (27th February 2022 \u0026 2025) is one of just two players in Premier League history to score a goal on his birthday in two different years along with Teddy Sheringham (2nd April 1994 \u0026 1995). Returns. pic.twitter.com/KZvfXt8niA — OptaJoe (@OptaJoe) February 27, 2025 Data Debrief: Soucek’s birthday gift Two West Ham players were celebrating birthdays on Thursday. Alphonse Areola turned 32, and had very little to do as Leicester mustered just 0.38 expected goals throughout. Soucek, meanwhile, marked his 30th birthday with the opener. Having also netted on his birthday in 2022, he became just the second player in Premier League history to score a goal on his birthday in two different years, after Teddy Sheringham in 1994 and 1995. West Ham have won a home Premier League game without conceding for the first time since December 2023 against Manchester United (2-0), while they have won consecutive Premier League games for the first time since February/March 2024, courtesy of wins against Brentford and Everton. Leicester have now lost 11 of their last 12 Premier League games, while in his 14 games in charge, Van Nistelrooy has picked up just seven points, three fewer than previous Foxes boss Steve Cooper managed this season (10 in 12 games).",
