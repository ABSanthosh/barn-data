  "text": "Paris Saint-Germain goalkeeper Matvey Safonov saved two spot-kicks to send his side through to the next round of the Coupe de France after beating Lens 4-3 on penalties. Safonov, deputising for the injured Gianluigi Donnarumma, saved efforts from 12 yards from M’Bala Nzola and Andy Diouf to seal their passage into the last 32. The Parisiens thought they had taken the lead in the 26th minute when Achraf Hakimi finished beyond Herve Koffi, but the goal was ruled out for offside. But Lens got themselves in front just after the hour-mark when Nzola inadvertently turned home Abdukodir Khusanov’s goalbound effort beyond Safonov. However, Lens’ joy was short-lived when PSG substitute Goncalo Ramos restored parity four minutes later, firing into the roof of the net after a mistake from Kevin Danso. Neither side could find a winning goal, with penalties deciding who would face fourth-tier Espaly in the next round of the competition. After seeing the first six penalties of the shootout dispatched, Lens were the first to blink when goalscorer Nzola saw his spot-kick saved by Safonov. Barcola then tucked his penalty away, before Safonov kept out Andy Diouf to keep PSG’s hopes of winning a 16th Coupe de France title alive. The year 2024 ends as it began! With @coupedefrance progression! #RCLPSG 1-1 pic.twitter.com/u7CHBUYIiN — Paris Saint-Germain (@PSG_English) December 22, 2024 Data Debrief: Super subs make the difference PSG have made light work of the competition against them in Ligue 1 this season, sitting top of the table by 10 points, but they were made to work for their win over Lens. Luis Enrique’s side ended the contest with an expected goals (xG) total of 1.74 from their 18 attempts compared to Lens’ 1.05 from their 12 efforts. And they had Ramos to thank for drawing them level. He ended the contest with a team-high xG of 0.71, despite entering the action in the 66th minute. The Portugal international also became just the second player in PSG history to score in three successive Coupe de France games when starting as a substitute, with Jacky Remond between October and November 1970 the other player to do so.",
