  "text": "Verdict: Goal to be scored in both halves Best Odds: 19/20 Bookmaker: Olympusbet In a showdown between two European giants who will be looking to punch their respective spots in the final of this summer’s Club World Cup, PSG and Real Madrid will meet on Wednesday night. PSG Starting with PSG, making real history back on May 31st as they claimed a maiden Champions League crown thanks to a 5-0 romp against Inter Milan in Munich, Luis Enrique’s men have only continued to shatter a string of records. Collecting another heavyweight European scalp last week as they secured a 2-0 victory against Bayern Munich, the former Barcelona boss has seen his squad gain a string of plaudits from across the globe. Getting their Club World Cup adventure underway with a 4-0 win against Atletico Madrid on June 15th, PSG are riding an iconic wave of momentum. Winning nine of their previous 10 appearances across all competitions, Enrique’s reigning European champions will be looking to make another statement on Wednesday night. PSG Team News Both shown their own respective red cards against Bayern Munich last week, the defensive duo of Willian Pacho and Lucas Hernandez will serve their own respective suspensions here. However, coming off the bench and bagging a first summer strike in Atlanta, Ballon d’Or contender Ousmane Dembele could make a first Club World Cup start. Brazilian youngster Lucas Beraldo should be handed a full recall at the heart of Enrique’s defence on Wednesday night. Making an immediate impact since arriving back in January, Georgian ace Khvicha Kvaratskhelia will play a leading role in the final third. Real Madrid As for Real Madrid, while Los Blancos might have gat Xavi Alonso’s tenure underway with a 1-1 stalemate against Al-Hilal on June 18th, the Spanish giants have come roaring back in a sensational fashion. Extending on their Club World Cup adventure last week thanks to an action-packed 3-2 win against Borussia Dortmund, the former Bayer Leverkusen boss is desperate to hand Madrid an immediate piece of silverware. Laying down a summer statement earlier in the month as they clinched a 1-0 victory against Juventus, Los Blancos have won their previous four straight appearances by an aggregate score of 10-3. It should also be noted, Real Madrid clinched a 3-1 win when they last met PSG for a Champions League showdown back in March 2022. Real Madrid Team News Shown a last-gasp red card against Borussia Dortmund last week, summer recruit and former Bournemouth defender Dean Huijsen will miss out through suspension here. All still dealing with respective injury issues, the likes of David Alaba, Ferland Mendy and Brazilian youngster Endrick will not feature here. Enjoying what has been a sensational Club World Cup run and already notching four goals in his five appearances, 21-year-old Gonzalo Garcia should keep his spot leading the line. Coming off the bench and finding the net against Borussia Dortmund last week, ex-PSG talisman Kylian Mbappe could be handed a full recall. PSG vs Real Madrid Key Factors to Consider When PSG and Real Madrid last met back in March 2022, Los Blancos collected a 3-1 Champions League victory on home soil. Madrid have won their previous four straight Club World Cup appearances by an aggregate score of 10-3. Including their iconic Champions League success on May 31st, PSG have won nine of their last 10 matchups across all competitions. Along with finding the net in all of his last three consecutive appearances, 21-year-old Gonzalo Garcia has notched four goals in his five summer outings. Real Madrid have notched at least a pair of goals in nine of their last 11 matchups across all fronts. Conclusion In a showdown between two European giants on Wednesday night, we look set for what could be another Club World Cup thriller. While Los Blancos might have clinched an action-packed 3-1 victory when they welcomed PSG to Madrid back in March 2022, the Spanish giants will be bracing themselves for a heavyweight challenge. It should be noted, with five of the previous seven meetings between PSG and Real Madrid finishing with both teams finding the net, we are expecting chances to fall at both ends of the pitch.
