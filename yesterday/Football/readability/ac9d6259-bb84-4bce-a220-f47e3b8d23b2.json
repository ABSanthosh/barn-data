  "text": "Competition: NPL Victoria Market: Both teams to score Odds: 4/7 @ 1xBet Two camps who are looking to make an immediate return to winning ways on Friday morning, the Melbourne Knights will host Oakleigh. Starting with the hosts, while the Knights might have signed off June with a hard-fought 2-1 victory away at Melbourne Victory’s U21s, John Markovski’s men came crashing back down to earth last time out. Eventually falling to an action-packed 4-2 defeat at the hands of St. Albans, the former Altona Magic boss finds his squad sat rock-bottom of he NPL Victoria standings. Putting just 13 points on the board from their 20 appearances so far this season, Melbourne have continued to show a string of glaring issues. Including a 4-1 drumming at home against Green Gully last month, the Knights have recorded just a sole win from any of their previous 12 consecutive NPL Victoria appearances – a rut that stems back to a 3-1 win against St. Albans on March 30th. Likewise, already shipping 49 goals since opening up the 2025, Friday’s hosts hold the second-worst defensive tally in the division. As for the visitors, although Oakleigh might have got April underway in the midst of what was a real purple patch, the Cannons are seeking some much-needed recent stability. Despite mounting a sensational late comeback away at Dandenong Thunder as they eventually snatched a thrilling 3-3 stalemate, Chris Taylor’s men have mustered just a single win from their previous four NPL Victoria appearances. Slumping to a shock 5-2 drumming at home against Melbourne Victory’s U21s on June 13th, the Blues have also shown their own respective defensive struggles. Along with a 3-2 loss against St. Albans last month, Oakleigh have shipped 11 goals in their previous four outings. It should also be highlighted, Taylor’s camp have registered just a sole clean sheet from their last 10 straight appearances – a run that stems all the way back to April 11th. Likewise, with five of their last six matchups finishing with both teams finding the net, we are expecting a similar outcome. Bet: Both teams to score at Melbourne Knights vs Oakleigh Cannons 4/7 for Friday’s NPL Victoria matchup @ 1xBet",
