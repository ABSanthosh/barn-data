  "text": "Putting in a rugged performance on Tuesday night, Inter Milan punched their Coppa Italia semi-final ticket as they collected a 2-0 victory against Lazio at the San Siro. Although chances might have come at a premium in Lombardy, Austrian international Marko Arnautovic opened the scoring after 39 minutes through what was a sensational driven effort. Looking to get their hands on a 10th Coppa Italia crown this season, the Nerazzurri wrapped up their spot in the final four as second-half substitute Hakan Calhanoglu converted from the penalty spot. Overcoming what could have been a potential banana skin on Tuesday night, Inter’s 2-0 win sets up what will be a mouth-watering showdown against arch-rivals AC Milan. While Lazio might have continued to shine on the European stage this season, the Eagles have failed to find any kind of fluidity since opening the New Year and clearly cut a frustrated figure at the full-time whistle here. In what was a heavyweight Coppa Italia showdown on Tuesday night, we have taken a look at the key talking points from the San Siro. Inter extend on their San Siro romp Although Inter Milan might have shown some extended issues on their travels over the past few weeks, the Nerazzurri have certainly gained a fearsome reputation for their dominance at the San Siro. Making an immediate return to winning ways over the weekend as they secured a gritty 1-0 win against Genoa, Simone Inzaghi’s men have now won all of their previous five consecutive appearances in front of their own supporters. Signing off their Champions League group stage campaign with a 3-0 romp against French outfit Monaco on January 19th, the reigning Serie A champions have suffered just a single defeat at the San Siro since the end of September. Now with their sights set on securing back-to-back Serie A victories for just a second time since returning from Italy’s festive break, Inter Milan will be looking to collect another heavyweight scalp this weekend. In what could prove to be a season-defining showdown on Saturday evening, Inzaghi’s side will travel to bitter title rivals Napoli with just a single point separating both camps. Lazio continue to show their inconsistencies While Lazio might have enjoyed a real Europa League group stage romp this season, the Eagles have failed to find any kind of domestic stability on either side of Italy’s festive break. Tumbling down the Serie A standings and currently sat outside the Champions League spots, Marco Baroni’s men have now won just a pair of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Heading into Tuesday’s trip to the San Siro after being forced to settle for a 0-0 stalemate away at relegation scrappers Venezia last weekend, Lazio have now drawn back-to-back blanks for the first time since April 2024. Getting the New Year underway with a 2-0 defeat at the hands of arch-rivals Roma, the former Verona boss will also have a mounting headache over his side’s extended issues on the road. Signing off their Europa League group stage campaign with a 1-0 loss against Portuguese outfit Braga, Lazio have recorded just a pair of victories away from the Stadio Olimpico since getting 2025 underway. The Nerazzurri have Lazio’s number Although Inter might not have been at their tantalising best on Tuesday night, the Nerazzurri did extend on what has become a dominant record against Lazio. Storming their way to what was a famous 6-0 romp when they travelled to the Stadio Olimpico for a Serie A showdown on December 16th, Inter are unbeaten in all of their previous six meetings across all competitions. Likewise, Inzaghi’s camp have won six of their previous seven showdowns against Lazio at the San Siro – a run that stems all the way back to March 2019. Shipping at least a pair of goals in five of their last six to the defending Serie A champions, Lazio face an immediate return to the San Siro this weekend when they meet AC Milan on Sunday night.
