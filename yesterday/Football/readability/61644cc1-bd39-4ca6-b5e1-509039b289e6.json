  "text": "With the EFL Cup quarter-finals getting underway on Wednesday night, we have a trio of all-Premier League showdowns. With both Liverpool and Arsenal stealing centre stage in midweek, we look set for what could prove to be a frantic night of action. For those of you looking to stick on a Wednesday flutter, we have taken a glance at two of the most appealing EFL Cup betting tips. 19:45 Newcastle vs Brentford  Making what was a crucial return to winning ways last weekend, Newcastle will be desperate to use that performance as a platform to build on. Storming their way to a 4-0 romp against Leicester, that result certainly eased some of the pressure on Eddie Howe’s shoulders. Marking their return from November’s international break with a shock 2-0 loss at home against West Ham, the former Bournemouth boss still finds his squad battling it out in the bottom-half of the Premier League table. Opening December with a remarkable 3-3 stalemate against Liverpool, the Magpies are seeking some much-welcomed defensive steel. Despite coming away unscathed against Leicester on Saturday afternoon, that is the first clean sheet that Newcastle have recorded since November 2nd. Likewise, hit with a dramatic 4-2 defeat when they travelled to the Gtech on December 7th, Howe’s side are seeking some immediate revenge when they return to St. James’ Park. Losing west London bragging rights last weekend as they fell to a 2-1 loss away at Chelsea, Brentford have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability on their travels. Despite remarkably collecting 22 points from their first eight Premier League showdowns at the Gtech, Thomas Frank’s men have gained an unwanted reputation for their glaring struggles on the road. Opening December with a 3-1 defeat at the hands of Aston Villa, Wednesday’s guests have claimed just a sole point away from the Gtech so far this season. Desperate to end their sensational away day issues, attacking talisman Bryan Mbeumo should play a leading role here. Previously linked with a move to St. James’ Park, the Cameroon international has really impressed this year. Bagging a consolation strike at Stamford Bridge last weekend, the 25-year-old has already notched 10 Premier League goals and currently sits fourth in the Golden Boot race. Newcastle vs Brentford Betting Tip: Bryan Mbeumo over 0.5 shots on target @ 19/20 with Pribet 20:00 Southampton vs Liverpool  Although Liverpool might have eventually been forced to settle for a 2-2 stalemate at home against Fulham over the weekend, Arne Slot’s are enjoying what has been a sensational run of form. Still leading the chase at the top of the Premier League table, Wednesday’s guests are clearly enjoying life under the former Feyenoord boss. Winning each of their first six Champions League appearances so far this season and the only club from across Europe that can boast a 100% start, Liverpool find the mood in their camp at a red-hot high. With some around Anfield dreaming of the chance to mount a genuine title sweep in 2025, the Reds will be smelling a golden opportunity here. Suffering just a single defeat across any competition so far this season, Slot’s side have also gained a reputation for their success on the road. In fact, Liverpool have not tasted a single defeat on their travels since the end of April. Putting in another nightmare performance over the weekend as they slumped to a 5-0 drumming at the hands of Tottenham, that result was enough to cost Russell Martin his job at St. Mary’s. While the Saints might have made their Premier League return this season, Wednesday’s hosts find themselves at the heart of a public crisis. Opening December with a 5-1 loss at home against Chelsea, Southampton have put just five points on the board. Sat rock-bottom of the Premier League table and pencilled in as a landslide relegation contender, they have also shown some glaring defensive issues. Losing their last three appearances by an aggregate score of 11-1, they have also shipped 10 goals in their back-to-back defeats at St. Mary’s. Likewise, falling to an action-packed 3-2 defeat when they welcomed Liverpool to St. Mary’s on November 24th, Southampton couldn’t have asked for a tougher challenge in midweek. Southampton vs Liverpool Betting Tip: Darwin Nunez over 1.5 shots on target @ 11/8 with Luckster Wednesday’s EFL Cup Double Newcastle vs Brentford – Bryan Mbeumo over 0.5 shots on target @ 19/20 Southampton vs Liverpool – Darwin Nunez over 1.5 shots on target @ 11/8 Place a £10 bet on our Daily Double with Vegas Land and pocket £46.31 if all predictions are correct.
