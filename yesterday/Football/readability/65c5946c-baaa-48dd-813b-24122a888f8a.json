  "text": "Competition: Saudi Pro League Market: Al-Ittihad win Odds: 6/11 @ BetUS Looking to find a route to the top of the Saudi Pro League standings on Monday afternoon, Al-Ittihad will travel to Khamis Mushait when they meet Damac. Starting with the hosts, while Damac might have secured a much-welcomed 2-0 win away at Al-Raed earlier in the month, that appears to have just been a minor boost for Nuno Almeida’s men. Last seen suffering a dramatic late collapse as they fell to a 2-1 loss against Al Fateh, the Reds have now lost back-to-back Pro League appearances and some in their camp are looking over their shoulder at a looming relegation scrap. Hit with a 3-0 drumming when they welcomed Al-Ettifaq to Khamis Mushait on January 15th, Monday’s hosts have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous five appearances. Signing off 2024 with a frantic 2-2 stalemate against Al Feiha, Damac have shown some extended defensive issues. In fact, Almeida’s side have conceded at least a pair of goals in four of their last five showdowns. Likewise, it should also be noted, the Reds have conceded 10 goals in their previous five matchups on home soil. As for the visitors, although Al-Ittihad might have been frustrated last season as they eventually had to settle for a lacklustre fifth-place finish, Laurent Blanc’s side have come roaring back this time around. Battling it out at the top of the table and pencilled in as a leading title contender, the Nation’s Club are enjoying a real flurry. Last seen claiming a 2-1 victory against Al-Shabab, the former France boss has seen his squad gain plenty of praise. Extending on their Kings Cup adventure earlier in the month as they edged past rivals Al-Hilal, Monday’s guests have also won 14 of their 16 Pro League appearances this season. Likewise, suffering just a single top-flight defeat, Blanc’s side will be looking to lay down another marker here. With just their goal difference keeping them off top spot, Al-Ittihad have also found a real clinical edge in the final third. Storming their way to a 4-1 romp when they last met Damac back in May 2024, it is no surprise that the title chasers are a standout pick here. Bet: Al-Ittihad 6/11 to beat Damac in Monday’s Saudi Pro League showdown @ BetUS",
