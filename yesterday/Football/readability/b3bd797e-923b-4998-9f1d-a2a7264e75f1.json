  "text": "Ousmane Dembele’s second-half brace and a first Paris-Saint Germain goal for Khvicha Kvaratskhelia helped the Ligue 1 leaders blow Monaco away with a 4-1 win on Friday. PSG, who announced contract extensions for coach Luis Enrique, Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Vitinha before the match, secured their 16th win in 21 league games to reach 53 points, 13 ahead of second-placed Marseille, who have a game in hand. Vitinha celebrated his new deal with the opener after just six minutes, sending a low free-kick inside the near post, but Denis Zakaria equalised for Monaco by scoring from a tight angle following Soungoutou Magassa’s fine throughball in the 17th minute. While both sides had chances to grab the lead before half-time, it was PSG’s new signing Kvaratskhelia who restored their advantage, brilliantly cutting inside a defender in the box before blasting home nine minutes after half-time. Ligue 1’s leading scorer Dembele extended the advantage just three minutes later after a one-two with Desire Doue, and the 27-year-old winger sealed the rout in stoppage time with his 16th league goal of the season. The French champions next play at fellow Ligue 1 outfit Brest in the first leg of their Champions League knockout-stage play-off tie on Tuesday. Data Debrief: Dembele continues to shine in 2025 Dembele has now scored 13 goals in seven matches in all competitions since the turn of the year, as many as he netted in his previous 42 outings. PSG have also scored at least three goals in five of their last eight home matches against Monaco in all competitions, having only done so twice in their first 44 such games.",
