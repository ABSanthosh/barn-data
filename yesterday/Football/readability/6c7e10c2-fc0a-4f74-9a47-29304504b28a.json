Ipswich Town Starting with the hosts, while Ipswich might have signed off 2024 with a famous 2-0 victory against Chelsea, Kieran McKenna’s men have drastically struggled to find any kind of stability. Falling to a toothless 2-0 loss at the hands of Brighton earlier in the week, the Tractor Boys find themselves at the heart of a relegation scrap. Getting the New Year underway with a last-gasp collapse as they had to settle for a 2-2 stalemate against Fulham, the Norfolk-based outfit have recorded just two wins from any of their previous 10 Premier League appearances. Opening this weekend’s fixtures with just their goal difference keeping them outside of the drop zone, the one-time Manchester United coach will have a major headache over his side’s extended issues on home soil. Including that 2-0 defeat against Brighton on Thursday night, Ipswich have lost four of their previous four top-flight showdowns at Portman Road. Ipswich Town Team News Missing out against Brighton earlier in the week and still dealing with a recent ankle issue, Ireland international Sammie Szmodics is not expected to feature here. Likewise, not playing any part since the end of November, former Manchester United youngster Axel Tuanzebe remains on the sidelines. Officially arriving from Aston Villa in midweek for a reported fee in the region of £60million, Jaden Philogene should make his Ipswich debut at Portman Road. Completing a season-long loan switch from Man City last summer, Calvin Phillips is ineligible to feature in Norfolk. Manchester City As for the visitors, suffering another public collapse earlier in the week, Manchester City find themselves at the heart of an infamous rut. Eventually forced to settle for a 2-2 stalemate away at Brentford, Pep Guardiola’s men have a real battle on their hands in the race to claim a Champions League spot in 2025. Despite getting the New Year underway with a 4-1 victory at home against West Ham, the defending champions have remarkably recorded just a trio of top-flight wins since way back on October 26th. Gaining an unwanted reputation for their glaring defensive issues, Man City have mustered just a single Premier League clean sheet from any of their last seven outings. Opening this weekend’s fixtures sat down in sixth-place, Guardiola’s men will once again have a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders here. Manchester City Team News Still dealing with a long-term knee injury, Manchester City will once again be without midfield talisman Rodri on Sunday afternoon. Likewise, not making a single appearance over the past month, Portuguese defender Ruben Dias remains on the sidelines. Bagging a brace against Brentford earlier in the week and now notching four Premier League goals in his last five appearances, England international Phil Foden will be looking to extend on his recent flurry. Despite drawing a blank in five of his last seven top-flight outings, Erling Haaland will lead the line at Portman Road. Ipswich Town vs Manchester City Key Factors to Consider When Ipswich and Manchester City met for their reverse Premier League showdown on August 24th, the Sky Blues collected a 4-1 victory on home soil. City’s trip to Portman Road will be their first matchup in Norfolk since way back in January 2002. Man City have won just three of their last 12 Premier League appearances. Manchester City have recorded just a single Premier League clean sheet from their previous seven Premier League showdowns. Ipswich have lost four of their last five Premier Leagues appearances at Portman Road. Conclusion Suffering yet another collapse away at Brentford earlier in the week, Manchester City are desperately seeking some kind of boost here. Remarkably winning just a trio of their previous 12 Premier League appearances, the defending champions are simply looking to find a route into the top-four. Meeting an Ipswich squad that have lost four of their last five top-flight showdowns at Portman Road, City will know the importance of avoiding a potential banana skin in Norfolk.
