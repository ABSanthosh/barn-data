  "text": "Pep Guardiola expects both Ederson and Stefan Ortega to remain at Manchester City, while downplaying the club’s interest in Espanyol’s Joan Garcia. Ederson was linked with a move to the Saudi Pro League last year but committed to staying at City through 2024-25 after conversations with Guardiola. He made 37 appearances across all competitions last season, keeping 12 clean sheets, with 10 of those coming in the Premier League. The Brazilian boasted a save percentage of 67.1% (54 saves from 79 shots on target faced) and conceded 26 goals. However, Ederson only has 12 months remaining on his current contract, as does Stefan Ortega. He made just 13 league appearances, keeping three clean sheets, with his save percentage sitting at 64.7%. Despite their contracts coming towards an end, Guardiola appears to be happy with the goalkeeping situation at City. “We have spoken about the situation regarding squad planning, and the two goalkeepers we have will continue,” Guardiola told reporters at a golf event in Catalonia on Monday. City have been linked with a new goalkeeper, including Garcia, as well as Porto’s Diogo Costa. Garcia made the most saves in LaLiga in 2024-25 (146), while only Unai Simon (77.4%) and Jan Oblak (74.1%) had a better save percentage among goalkeepers who played more than 20 games than the 24-year-old (73.7%). Guardiola brushed off any links to Garcia, though he spoke highly of his quality. “Joan Garcia is a really good goalkeeper, but City are linked with 500 players in every transfer window,” Guardiola added. “He’s an Espanyol player and I don’t know what happen, but I’m told by the Espanyol guys [playing in the golf event] he’s an extraordinary goalkeeper. The references we have are very good.”",
