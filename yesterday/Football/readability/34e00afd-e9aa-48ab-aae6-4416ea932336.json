Atletico fell to a surprise 2-0 loss at the Estadio El Sadar and have won only one of their last six away fixtures in LaLiga, failing to score in their last three. While Los Colchoneros have already secured Champions League football for next season, they are yet to guarantee third place, with Athletic Bilbao just three points behind them after they won 2-0 at Getafe on Thursday. “I think we played better today than we did against Alaves and Las Palmas, but it’s clear the coach isn’t finding a way to inspire the players to perform at their best away from home,” Simeone told reporters after Atleti’s defeat. “I’m looking inward. It’s my responsibility that they can’t show off away from home what they do when we play at home.” Atleti looked uninspired against Osasuna, who are only outside the top eight on goal difference following headed goals from Alejandro Catena and Ante Budimir. The visitors matched Osasuna’s nine shots and won the expected goals (xG) battle by 1.28 to 0.58, with Alexander Sorloth alone passing up four chances with a total xG value of 0.9. “It was clear from the start that we had chances to take the lead but we didn’t,” Simeone added, ruing those missed chances. “They had a set-piece that went close, and on the next play, where we could have done more, they took advantage of their height to score. “In the second half, we controlled the game, although we didn’t create any dangerous chances like we had in the first. “Budimir scored a great goal, and we’re stuck with this result.”",
