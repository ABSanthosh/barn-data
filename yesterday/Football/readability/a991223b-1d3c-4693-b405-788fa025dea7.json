The 23-year-old sustained a hamstring injury during Arsenal’s 5-1 win against Crystal Palace in the Premier League on 21 December. “The majority see obstacles, but few see the opportunities,” Saka posted on Instagram with a picture of him on a hospital bed. “Recovery has begun and I’m coming back stronger! Thank you all for your messages,” the England international wrote. After their 1-0 win against Ipswich on Friday, Arsenal manager had confirmed that Saka had undergone the surgery. Our November Player of the Month, Bukayo Saka! pic.twitter.com/hweZPh7oSQ — Arsenal (@Arsenal) December 16, 2024 “He had a procedure. Everything went well, but unfortunately he will be out for many, many weeks,” Arteta said. “I said many weeks so I think it will be more than two months. I don’t know exactly how much longer. It will depend on how the scar tissue starts to heal, the first week or so, the mobility of that. Let’s see, it’s very difficult to say.” Saka’s absence will be a huge blow for the Gunners, who are now second in the Premier League and trail leaders Liverpool by six points. He has bagged nine goals and 13 assists in 24 appearances across all competitions this season, with 15 of his goal involvements coming in the league.",
