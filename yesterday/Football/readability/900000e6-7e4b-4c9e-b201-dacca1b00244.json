  "text": "Kieran McKenna insists Ipswich Town are “still in the fight” to avoid Premier League relegation ahead of Wednesday’s trip to European hopefuls Bournemouth. Ipswich are 18th in the table before the visit to Vitality Stadium, where they visit 12 points adrift of safety after 17th-placed Wolves’ 1-0 win over West Ham on Tuesday. McKenna remains buoyant about his side avoiding an immediate return to the Championship, despite making it four straight league defeats with a 4-2 reverse against Nottingham Forest last time out. “There are 27 points to play for, nearly a quarter of the season left, so we know from that perspective we are still in the fight,” the Ipswich boss said at his pre-match press conference. “We know things can change quickly this week with one or two positive results so there is absolutely that belief that we can compete until the end of the season.” McKenna will not take too much interest in 17th-placed Wolves’ result at West Ham, instead “saving his mental energy” for aspects within struggling Ipswich’s control. Kieran McKenna’s thoughts ahead of Town’s trip to Bournemouth on Wednesday night. #BOUIPS pic.twitter.com/ed0HArDe3i — Ipswich Town (@IpswichTown) March 31, 2025 He did, however, offer special praise towards Andoni Iraola, whose side are 10th but only five points adrift of the top four heading into the midweek action. “He has done very well. It seems like a really good fit,” McKenna said of Bournemouth’s chief Iraola. “They have done very well as a club over the past couple of seasons, and recruitment has been excellent. They have a clear identity and have got players that fit the profile of how they want to play.” Bournemouth will be looking to bounce back on Wednesday, too, having been dumped out of the FA Cup last eight by Manchester City and losing their last league encounter 2-1 to Brentford. PLAYERS TO WATCH Bournemouth – Antoine Semenyo Antoine Semenyo may not have scored in the Premier League since January 25 in the 5-0 thrashing of Forest, but he will be one to watch out for on Wednesday. The Bournemouth attacker has carried the ball 5,373m in the Premier League this season, more than any non-defender. Fifty-four of his carries have ended in either Semenyo shooting (32) or creating a chance (22), with only Cole Palmer (58) and Mohamed Salah (56) doing so more in the competition this term. Ipswich Town – Liam Delap Liam Delap has not found the back of the net in this competition since February 15 against Aston Villa, going four league games without a goal since. McKenna needs his star forward to find form in front of goal, as well as tone down his aggression, given his 60 fouls are the most in the Premier League this season. MATCH PREDICTION – BOURNEMOUTH WIN Many will struggle to look past a home victory here, including the Opta supercomputer’s pre-match predictions, in which Bournemouth are the heavy favourites. Indeed, Ipswich have only won one of their 16 away league games against Bournemouth (D7 L8), beating them 3-2 in September 1953 – but this is their first visit since a 2-2 draw in the Championship in November 2014. Bournemouth, meanwhile, are looking to complete their first league double over Ipswich since 1949-50 in the third division south after winning the reverse fixture 2-1 at Portman Road this campaign. Focussed on tomorrow night pic.twitter.com/UyOohvSZFO — AFC Bournemouth (@afcbournemouth) April 1, 2025 Goals should be on the cards on Wednesday, too, given both teams have scored in each of the last eight league games between these two teams. That free-scoring run stretches back to March 1989, while Bournemouth have scored in each of the last 11 against McKenna’s side. It would be expected for Bournemouth’s strong run to continue against Ipswich, who have lost eight of their last nine Premier League games (D1), including their last four on the bounce. Not since December 2011 have they lost more successive league matches (seven), last doing so in the Premier League in April 1995 (eight), though Bournemouth have also lost three of their last four Premier League games (D1). OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Bournemouth win – 65.4% Draw – 18.5% Ipswich Town win – 16.2%",
