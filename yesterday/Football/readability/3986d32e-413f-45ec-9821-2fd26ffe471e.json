  "text": "Verdict: Draw Best odds: 43/20 Bookmaker: ZetBet Serbia and Denmark face off in Leskovac on Monday evening, competing for a spot in the UEFA Nations League quarterfinals. While Spain has already secured the top spot in League A Group 4, second place remains undecided. Denmark need just a draw to qualify, but a win for the hosts would see Serbia claim the position for themselves. Serbia After a late 1-1 draw with Switzerland on Friday, Serbia remain third in Group 4, with their Nations League fate in their own hands as they chase a first-ever knockout phase berth. Aleksa Terzic’s 88th-minute counterattack goal not only sealed Switzerland’s relegation but also kept Serbia’s hopes alive of overtaking Denmark for second place on the final day. With five points from five games – four against Switzerland, one against Spain, and none from their 2-0 loss in Denmark – Serbia trail Monday’s visitors by two points. However, coach Dragan Stojkovic will be concerned about his side’s meagre tally of three goals in the group stage, despite having prolific scorers like Juventus forward Dusan Vlahovic and all-time top scorer Aleksandar Mitrovic, who now face the pressure of delivering in a must-win finale. A loss, meanwhile, would leave Serbia in a relegation playoff. Team News Serbia typically lines up in a 3-4-1-2 formation, with captain Mitrovic – on the verge of his 60th international goal and in fine form for Saudi Pro League side Al-Hilal – partnered up front with Vlahovic. AC Milan forward Luka Jovic is unavailable due to a hernia injury. Another Saudi-based player, Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, has been omitted from this month’s squad by Dragan Stojkovic, while his brother, goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic, withdrew after initially being called up. Additionally, Torino’s Ivan Ilic is out with a knee injury, making Nemanja Gudelj and Nemanja Maksimovic the likely starters in central midfield. Denmark Denmark’s 2-1 loss to Spain in Copenhagen – their second defeat to La Roja in just over a month – has left them needing to avoid defeat against Serbia to secure a Nations League quarterfinal spot. The Danes may carry a psychological edge, having drawn 0-0 with Serbia at Euro 2024 and beaten them 2-0 in September. However, this third meeting will unfold on Serbian soil, adding an extra challenge. In Brian Riemer’s first match as national manager, Denmark suffered a setback but remained second in Group 4, just 90 minutes away from advancing to the new quarterfinal stage. Notably, Denmark’s superior goal tally – boosted by Gustav Isaksen’s strike against Spain – contrasts with Serbia’s modest three goals in the group. Denmark have dominated this rivalry in recent years, winning three of their last four matches against Serbia without conceding. Riemer will aim to extend that streak at the 8,000-seat Stadion Dubocica, where avoiding a trip to Belgrade may work in Denmark’s favour. Team News Riemer faces key decisions ahead of his first away fixture as Denmark manager on Monday. Rasmus Hojlund, who drew another blank against Spain and has just two goals for Manchester United this season, is under pressure, with Kasper Dolberg and Yussuf Poulsen competing for the central striker role. Options to refresh the wide areas include Andreas Skov Olsen, Gustav Isaksen, and Patrick Dorgu, all of whom came off the bench on Friday and could boost the Danish attack. In midfield, captain Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg is likely to partner Sporting Lisbon’s energetic Morten Hjulmand, while Christian Eriksen could take on a more advanced role to add creativity. Conclusion Denmark can secure their Nations League quarterfinal spot with a draw against Serbia, one of League A’s least prolific sides. Struggling for cohesion in attack, Serbia will also lack the intimidating support usually found in Belgrade’s Stadion Rajko Mitic, the home of Red Star, as the smaller and less daunting Stadion Dubocica in Leskovac hosts this crucial clash.
