Manchester United Starting with the hosts, crashing back down to earth last weekend as they fell to a toothless 2-0 loss at home against Crystal Palace, Manchester United have continued to show some glaring inconstancies since Ruben Amorim’s arrival back in November. Still battling it out in the bottom-half of the Premier League table, the former Sporting Lisbon boss is more than aware that he has a real job on his hands at Old Trafford. Coming under real scrutiny last month as they fell to an infamous 3-1 drumming at the hands of Brighton, the Red Devils have continued to show some glaring defensive issues this season. Signing off the New Year with a 2-0 defeat against Newcastle, Manchester United have recorded just a single clean sheet from any of their previous 13 consecutive showdowns against Premier League opposition. Manchester United Team News Suffering a season-ending knee injury against Crystal Palace last weekend, Manchester United will be without defensive star Lisandro Martinez. Likewise, both Luke Shaw and former Chelsea ace Mason Mount remain on the sidelines with respective injury issues. Eventually staying put at Old Trafford despite heavyweight January interest, Alejandro Garnacho will feature on Friday night. Proving to be Amorim’s hero away at historic rivals Arsenal last month, Turkish goalkeeper Altay Bayindir will replace Andre Onana between the sticks here. Leicester City As for the visitors, while Leicester might have mounted a dramatic second-half comeback away at Tottenham on January 26th as they claimed a 2-1 win in north London, Ruud van Nistelrooy’s men came crashing back down to earth in a worrying fashion last weekend. Putting in a woeful display away at Everton as they slumped to a 4-0 drumming at Goodison Park, the former interim Manchester United boss has some serious pressure on his shoulders. Pencilled in as a leading relegation contender in 2025, Friday’s guests have lost eight of their previous nine Premier League appearances. Mustering just a single top-flight victory over the past couple of months, Leicester have gained a reputation for their glaring defensive issues. Already shipping 53 Premier League goals this season, the Foxes have conceded at least a pair of goals in 11 of their 14 away fixtures so far this season. Leicester City Team News All still dealing with respective long-term injury issues, Leicester will be without the likes of Issahaku Fatawu, Ricardo Pereira and Wilfred Ndidi this weekend. With van Nistelrooy potential looking to tinker with his squad here, the likes former Tottenham defender Oliver Skipp could be handed a full recall. Despite notching just a single Premier League goal this season, Patson Daka could be handed the chance to lead the line here. Despite speculation over a potential return to Wolves, Conor Coady should start at the heart of Leicester’s defence. Manchester United vs Leicester City Key Factors to Consider When Manchester United and Leicester last met back on November 11th, the Red Devils collected a 3-0 victory at Old Trafford. Extending on their EFL Cup adventure thanks to an action-packed 5-2 win on October 30th, Manchester United have won each of their last four meetings against Friday’s guests. Amorim’s side have remarkably lost five of their previous seven home fixtures across all competitions. Leicester have lost eight of their previous nine meetings against Premier League opposition. The Foxes have conceded at least a pair of goals in 11 of their 14 away fixtures across all competitions so far this season. Conclusion Suffering another Old Trafford nightmare last weekend as they fell to a 2-0 loss at the hands of Crystal Palace, Manchester United have a huge amount of pressure on their shoulders here. Continuing to show a string of inconsistencies since Amorim’s arrival back in November, Friday’s hosts are desperate to avoid another potential banana skin. However, winning their two showdowns against Leicester at Old Trafford this season by an aggregate score of 8-2, we are backing United to claim a much-needed response this weekend.
