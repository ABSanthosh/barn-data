Arsenal have been locked in talks over a move for Gyokeres, who has scored 68 goals in the Primeira Liga since swapping Coventry City for Lisbon in 2023. The Sweden international has a €100m release clause in his contract, though Sporting president Frederico Varandas recently suggested they would allow him to leave for less. Gyokeres was due to return for pre-season training with the Portuguese champions on Saturday, but he failed to turn up and conducted an interview with L’Equipe, outlining his desire to move to England and claiming he is one of the world’s top strikers. Sporting will now take action against Gyokeres, with Varandas insisting the 27-year-old will stay if Arsenal fail to meet the club’s asking price. “We’re calm. Everything can be solved with the closure of the market, a hefty fine and an apology to the group,” Varandas said. “If they don’t want to pay Viktor’s fair market value, we’ll be very comfortable with that for the next three years. “If the geniuses who are devising this strategy think that this puts pressure on me to make it easier for him to leave, not only are they completely wrong, but they are also making it more complicated for the player to leave. “No one is above the interests of the club. Whoever they are.” Gyokeres’ 68 league goals in the last two seasons are the most of any player in Europe’s top 10 divisions, with Bayern Munich’s Harry Kane second with 62 goals in that span. Those goals have come from chances worth a total of 53.6 expected goals (xG), giving Gyokeres an overperformance of 14.4. Gyokeres plundered 39 goals in 33 Primeira Liga appearances last campaign as Sporting won their 21st top-flight title, despite losing coach Ruben Amorim to Manchester United last November. Arsenal have already completed the signings of Kepa Arrizabalaga, Martin Zubimendi and Christian Norgaard, while Noni Madueke is reportedly set to join for £55m from Chelsea.",
