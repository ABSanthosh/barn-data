  "text": "Verdict: Chelsea win Best Odds: 2/3 Bookmaker: Dachbet Looking to extend on their remarkable Premier League romp, Chelsea will travel to Goodison Park on Sunday afternoon when they meet Everton. Everton Starting with the hosts, putting in a gritty performance last weekend as they claimed a 0-0 stalemate away at Arsenal, Sean Dacha has certainly eased some of the pressure on his shoulders. Claiming an essential boost earlier in the month as they stormed their way to a 4-0 romp against Wolves, Everton are desperate to widen their buffer over another relegation scrap. However, despite their sensational display at Goodison Park on December 4th, the Toffees have struggled to find much stability in the final third. Signing off November with another 0-0 draw against Brentford, Everton have failed to find the net in five of their previous six Premier League appearances. Despite facing what looks set to be a real challenge this weekend, Dyche’s side have not suffered a single top-flight defeat in the blue half of Merseyside since the end of August. Everton Team News Not making a single appearance since the start of October, Everton will once again be without former Manchester United youngster James Garner. However, despite making his Everton debut against Wolves on December 4th, Chelsea loanee Armando Broja will not be able to feature against his parent club. Although veteran defender Seamus Coleman might have return to Dyche’s squad earlier in the month, the 36-year-old will settle for a spot on the bench. Once again attracting plenty of heavyweight interest, Jarrad Branthwaite will partner James Tarkowski at the back. Chelsea As for the visitors, enjoying what has become a sensational rise since Enzo Maresca’s arrival over the summer, Chelsea are in the midst of a real purple patch. Opening this weekend’s fixtures sat just two points adrift of climbing to the top of the Premier League table, the former Leicester boss finds the mood in his camp at a red-hot high. Continuing to receive a string of plaudits from across the globe, Sunday’s guests will be looking to lay down another marker here. Breezing their way to a 5-1 romp against Irish outfit Shamrock Rovers in midweek as they extended on their 100% Europa Conference League record, Chelsea have now won each of their last eight straight appearances across all competitions. Likewise, claiming a 6-0 win when they welcomed Everton to Stamford Bridge back in April, Maresca will be dreaming of a similar performance on Sunday afternoon. Chelsea Team News With news breaking earlier in the week that Mykhailo Mudryk has tested positive for a banned substance, the Ukrainian international will not feature here. Likewise, suffering yet another injury setback last month, Chelsea will once again be without skipper Reece James. All missing out against Shamrock Rovers on Thursday night, the likes of Nicolas Jackson, Romeo Lavia, Moises Caicedo, Levi Colwill and attacking talisman Cole Palmer will make a full return. Likewise, former Brighton goalkeeper Robert Sanchez will return between the sticks. Everton vs Chelsea Key Factors to Consider When Everton and Chelsea last met back in April, Sunday’s guests stormed their way to a 6-0 romp at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea have won each of their previous eight appearances across all competitions. Maresca’s men have suffered just a single defeat from any of their 16 Premier League appearances so far this season. Everton have failed to find the net in five of their previous six Premier League appearances. The Toffees have not suffered a single Premier League defeat at Goodison Park since the end of August. Conclusion Opening this weekend’s fixtures sat just two points adrift of finding a route to the top of the Premier League table, Chelsea will simply be looking to make another statement here. Winning each of their previous eight appearances across all competitions, Sunday’s guests are certainly firing on all cylinders. Landing a thumping 6-0 victory when they welcomed Everton to Stamford Bridge for their most recent Premier League battle on April 15th, we are backing a similar away win in the blue half of Merseyside. Verdict: Chelsea win Best Odds: 2/3 Bookmaker: Dachbet",
