  "text": "Competition: A-League Market: Joe Lolley to score anytime Odds: 6/5 @ 1xBet Desperate to make up some ground in the play-off chase, Sydney will welcome Perth to the Allianz Stadium on Wednesday morning. Starting with the hosts, while Sydney might have signed off 2024 with a stellar 3-0 victory against Melbourne Victory, the Sky Blues have struggled to find any kind of stability this season. Getting the New Year underway with a 2-2 stalemate away at Newcastle, Ufuk Talay’s men have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous five A-League appearances. However, although the Australian giants might find themselves sat outside the play-off places, they have found a clinical edge in the final third. Despite falling to a remarkable 4-3 defeat at the hands of Western United last month, Sydney have recorded at least a pair of goals in all of their last four domestic showdowns. Likewise, it should also be noted that Wednesday’s hosts have recorded 23 goals in their previous seven outings across all fronts. Despite failing to collect consecutive A-League victories so far this season, Talay’s squad should be smelling a golden opportunity when they return to the Allianz Stadium in midweek. As for the visitors, enduring what has been another public struggle this season, Perth once again find themselves scrapping it out at the foot of the A-League table. Last seen opening the New Year with a frantic 3-2 defeat against Western United, the Glory have come under plenty of scrutiny. Signing off 2024 with a routine 3-0 drumming at the hands of Macarthur, David Zdrilic’s men have lost four of their previous five A-League showdowns. In fact, along with putting just five points on the board, Wednesday’s guests have also claimed just a sole win from any of there first 11 appearances. Including a 4-0 drumming at home against Newcastle on December 14th, Perth have continued to show some glaring issues at the back. It should be noted, the former Sydney coach has seen his downbeat squad ship 30 goals since opening up the new campaign. Likewise, hit with a woeful 7-1 loss when they last travelled to the Allianz Stadium back in April of last year, Perth are rightfully installed as a landslide underdog here. Bet: Joe Lolley to score anytime against Perth Glory 6/5 for Wednesday’s A-League matchup @ 1xBet",
