  "text": "Ruben Amorim warned rival clubs they could be in for a “surprise” if they wait too long to sign Manchester United’s unwanted players for cheap at the end of the transfer window. At the start of pre-season, five wantaway players were exiled from the United squad – Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho, Alejandro Garnacho, Antony and Tyrell Malacia. Rashford has completed a loan move to Barcelona for the 2025-26 season, with the Spanish champions having the option to make the deal permanent next year. However, the other four are still in search of an exit and are currently training in Manchester, while United have travelled to the United States for their pre-season tour. Juventus are reportedly in talks to sign Sancho, while Real Betis are keen to re-sign Antony after an impressive loan spell in the second half of 2024-25. Garnacho has also been linked with a number of clubs, though no transfers are imminent. And Amorim insisted he will take players back into the fold if needed, should clubs try to bide their time in the hopes of getting a cheaper deal closer to deadline day on September 1. “[Technical director] Jason [Wilcox], [chief executive] Omar Berrada and the club have a number for these players,” Amorim told reporters ahead of United’s friendly against West Ham. “If they don’t reach that, they will be Manchester United players, no doubt about that. “Some players have to find a new place, so we have more space in the team, and other players clearly show they want a new challenge and want new teams. “We are just allowing these players to have time to think and to decide. “I understand the clubs are waiting for the last minute, but they can have a surprise. I’m ready to receive the players.” United have already signed Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo and Diego Leon this transfer window, though they have also been linked with a new striker. The Red Devils struggled for goals in the Premier League last season, netting just 44 goals in the top-flight as they finished 15th. No player hit double figures, with Bruno Fernandes and Amad Diallo their joint-top scorers with eight goals apiece. Reports suggest United may struggle to find a number nine, but Amorim says he would be happy for the start of the Premier League campaign with his current squad. “At the moment, our club needs to be really careful when we sign a player,” he added. “So if we have to start the season with this squad, I’m happy because all the players that are here want to be here – and that for me is the most important thing.” United begin their Premier League campaign against Arsenal on August 17.",
