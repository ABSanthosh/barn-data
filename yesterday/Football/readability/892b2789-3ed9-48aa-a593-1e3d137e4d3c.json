  "text": "Inter missed out on the Serie A title by a single point despite earning a 2-0 victory over 10-man Como. The Champions League finalists knew they had to rely on a favour from Cagliari against leaders Napoli on Friday, but Antonio Conte’s side got the job done. Goals in either half from Scott McTominay and Romelu Lukaku sealed a 2-0 win for Napoli, who clinched their fourth Scudetto in the process. With their Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain around the corner, Simone Inzaghi opted to make six changes to his team. However, it mattered little, with Inter able to cruise to victory against Cesc Fabregas’ team, who came into the clash having gone eight league games without defeat. Stefan de Vrij opened the scoring in the 20th minute with a fine header past Pepe Reina, who endured a nightmare final game before ending his professional career. Indeed, on the stroke of half-time, the Spanish goalkeeper was handed a straight red card after bringing down Mehdi Taremi, a decision confirmed after a VAR review. Inter made their man advantage count six minutes into the second half when Joaquin Correa sat down his defender before slotting the ball into the bottom-right corner. The visitors almost increased their lead late on through Kristjan Asllani, who fired over from close range before Patrick Cutrone fired wide at the other end. FT in Como #ForzaInter #ComoInter pic.twitter.com/9nVQWdv0LZ — Inter (@Inter_en) May 23, 2025 Data Debrief: Onwards and upwards for Champions League finalists Despite failing to retain their Serie A crown, Inter have still had a season to be proud of, as well as a Champions League final to look forward to next weekend. Inzaghi’s team have scored 114 goals in all competitions so far in 2024-25, their best tally in a single season since the Serie A single-round (1929-30), overtaking the 113 goals that they managed in 2019-20. They also ended their campaign having kept a clean sheet in three of their last four Serie A games, as many as they did in their previous 16 league matches, which will be a solid foundation to build on ahead of facing PSG. They also continued their dominance in this fixture, extending their winning run to nine matches, their joint-highest streak in Serie A against a single opponent (also nine against Empoli and Genoa).",
