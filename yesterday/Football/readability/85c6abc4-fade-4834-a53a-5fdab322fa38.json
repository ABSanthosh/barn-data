Sebastian Berhalter has been an important figure for the Whitecaps this term, playing all of their matches to help them to a perfect start in the competition. They sit top of the Western Conference with 12 points, becoming just the seventh team in MLS history to make a 100% start. It will be a different experience on Saturday, with Sebastian facing off against the team coached by his father, but he is determined to come out on top. “Obviously, it’s pretty special seeing your dad on the sideline,” the 23-year-old midfielder said. “You treat it as another game. Just go out and do what I do. “He was very hands-off growing up. It kind of led me to have that motivation for myself, and I’m forever grateful for that.” The Berhalter Bowl Family feud, but make it football. Sebastian Berhalter takes on his father, Gregg, as the ‘Caps look to make history with a fifth straight dub. Don’t miss it this Saturday at 730pm! https://t.co/Omj2Q234Xp#VWFC | @saritareports pic.twitter.com/YBlmzwcZYY — Vancouver Whitecaps FC (@WhitecapsFC) March 20, 2025 Chicago, meanwhile, have lost just one of their matches so far, and sit sixth in the Eastern Conference on seven points. They have won their last two matches, against FC Dallas and Toronto FC, both away from home, and are looking to make it three on the bounce to keep the pressure on the teams around them. Gregg Berhalter also noted the special nature of the occasion, but, like his son, is determined to give his all to collect the win. “It’s kind of funny when you’re scouting the opponent, watching games, and you [think] ‘that’s a nice little midfielder’ and it happens to be your son,” he said. “I’m definitely proud of him. To watch closely what type of player he has become is really nice. I know it’s down to hard work and his mindset. “It’s still a moment where we want to win, and I know he wants to win, so something has got to give.” PLAYERS TO WATCH Vancouver Whitecaps – Tristan Blackmon Tristan Blackmon scored the lone goal in Vancouver’s win on Saturday, the eighth different player to score for the Whitecaps this season. Vancouver are the third team in MLS history to have eight different goalscorers in their first four games of a season (excluding own goals), after Toronto FC in 2019 and Sporting Kansas City in 1996. Chicago Fire – Hugo Cuypers Hugo Cuypers has scored four goals in the Fire’s first four games this season. He is the third player in team history to score at least four times in the club’s first four games of a season, after Ante Razov (six in 1999) and Nemanja Nikolic (four in 2018). Ready to head back up north #cf97 pic.twitter.com/YmOXH3B6ls — Chicago Fire FC (@ChicagoFire) March 20, 2025 MATCH PREDICTION: VANCOUVER WHITECAPS WIN The Whitecaps are the seventh team in MLS history to win each of their first four matches of a season (excluding breakaway shoot-out wins). Only LA Galaxy in 1996, Kansas City in 2012 and St. Louis City SC in 2023 won their first five matches of a regular season. The Fire earned their first-ever points in Vancouver the last time they visited the Whitecaps, a 3-1 win in July 2022. In fact, prior to that game, Chicago had not won in 17 away matches against Cascadia clubs in regular-season play. Chicago have won back-to-back away matches with victories at FC Dallas and Toronto FC. The Fire have not won three straight away matches in almost 16 years, since wins at Toronto, New York Red Bulls and Chivas USA in May 2009. OPTA WIN PROBABILITY Vancouver Whitecaps – 61.3% Draw – 20.4% Chicago Fire – 18.3%",
