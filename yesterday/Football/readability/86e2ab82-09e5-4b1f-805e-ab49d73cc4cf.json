  "text": "Verdict: Goal to be scored in both halves Best Odds: 3/4 Bookmaker: Olympusbet Already clinching their Club World Cup knockout stage ticket, Bayern Munich will sign off their Group C adventure when they meet Benfica on Tuesday night. Benfica Starting with Benfica, cruising their way to what was a routine 6-0 victory against Group C whipping boys Auckland City over the weekend, Bruno Lage’s men will be desperate to use that routine performance as a platform to build on. Getting their Club World Cup campaign underway on June 16th with an action-packed 2-2 stalemate against Boca Juniors, the former Wolves boss is calling on his squad to find some recent stability. Suffering Taca de Portugal heartbreak on May 25th as they fell to a 3-1 loss against arch-rivals Sporting Lisbon, Benfica have recorded just a single victory from any of their previous five appearances across all competitions. Although Lage’s camp might be sat firmly in the driving seat to punch their own respective knockout stage ticket on Tuesday night, the Eagles will be bracing themselves for a monumental challenge in North Carolina. Benfica Team News Shown a straight red card against Boca Juniors last week, Italian international Andrea Belotti will once again miss out through suspension on Tuesday night. Likewise, not making a single appearance since the start of February, former Slavia Prague defender Alexander Bah remains on the sidelines with a long-term knee injury. While Angel Di Maria might be set to leave Lisbon this summer and return to his homeland, the ex-Real Madrid superstar will play a leading role here after notching three goals in his opening two Club World Cup appearances. Bayern Munich As for Bayern Munich, while many around the Allianz might have been shocked last summer following Vincent Kompany’s arrival, they are certainly enjoying life under the former Burnley boss. Recapturing their Bundesliga crown last season, the German giants have also opened their Club World Cup adventure in the midst of a flurry. Getting proceedings underway on June 15th with a record-breaking 10-0 romp against Auckland City, Bayern have already cruised their way to a knockout stage ticket. Last seen claiming a 2-1 win against Boca Juniors, Kompany’s side have suffered just a sole defeat from any of their previous 14 appearances across all competitions. It should also be noted, the Bavarians hold a dominant record against Tuesday’s opponents. In fact, the reigning German champions have won all of their last five straight meetings against Benfica by an aggregate score of 17-3. Bayern Munich Team News Hit with yet another long-term knee injury during March’s international break, Canadian international Alphonso Davies will not play any part this summer. With the fixtures pilling up fast, Kompany will once again be looking to make a handful of alterations on Tuesday night. However, completing a free switch from Bayer Leverkusen this month, Jonathan Tah will be hoping to keep his spot at the heart of Bayern’s defence. Already wrapping up their knockout stage ticket with time to spare, England skipper Harry Kane could be handed a rest from the start. Benfica vs Bayern Munich Key Factors to Consider Bayern Munich have won their last five straight meetings against Benfica across all competitions by an aggregate score of 17-3. Kompany’s side have suffered just a sole defeat from any of their previous 14 appearances across all competitions. The German giants have notched 12 goals in their opening two Club World Cup appearances this summer. Benfica’s 6-0 romp against Auckland City last weekend was their only win from their previous five appearances across all competitions. Bayern have recorded at least a pair of goals in eight of their last nine matchups across all fronts. Conclusion While Bayern Munich might have already cruised their way to a Club World Cup knockout stage spot, Kompany’s side will be looking to extend on their recent purple patch. With their sights set on mounting a genuine title charge this summer, the German giants will also be excited by a dominant record against Tuesday’s opponents. Winning all of their last five meetings against Benfica by an aggregate score of 17-3, Bayern will be hoping to make another statement. Bagging at least a pair of goals in eight of their previous nine appearances across all competitions, we could be treated to another enjoyable Group C showdowns here. Verdict: Goal to be scored in both halves Best Odds: 3/4 Bookmaker: Olympusbet",
