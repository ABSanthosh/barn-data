  "text": "Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois thinks the absence of a player like Joselu cost them in their 2-1 defeat to Arsenal in the Champions League on Wednesday. Madrid were unable to mount a fightback following their 3-0 first-leg defeat at the Emirates Stadium, going out at the last-eight stage for the first time since 2004 against Monaco. In Wednesday’s second leg, Madrid put 43 crosses into the penalty area compared to Arsenal’s nine, but managed just three shots on target. Last season, Madrid used Joselu as an impact player to great effect, with the target man scoring two late goals to dump Bayern Munich out at the semi-final stage. Joselu moved to Qatar after Madrid won their 15th European crown, but he would have been perfect for Wednesday’s quarter-final second leg, according to the goalkeeper. “They defended well, they pressed high, it was very difficult to find gaps,” Courtois told Movistar. “We put in a lot of crosses, but we don’t have a Joselu to win those aerial duels.” Madrid registered an xG of just 1.5 during the match compared to Arsenal’s 2.05 xG, though that did include Bukayo Saka’s penalty that was saved by Courtois in the first half. @RealMadridEn 1-2 @Arsenal 65′ Saka. 67′ @ViniJr 90′ + 3′ Martinelli. pic.twitter.com/ORFzGi44g3 — Real Madrid C.F. (@realmadriden) April 16, 2025 “When they give a penalty against you, if you save it, you still believe. We felt that the fans were with us and pushing us,” Courtois continued. “It would have been very difficult for them if we scored the first goal, because the tie opened up. “But they were the ones who did it, we were not successful. It wasn’t enough, Arsenal were superior.” Captain Lucas Vazquez agreed with Courtois that Madrid’s attack was stifled during the match, creating just one big chance despite having 66.1% of the ball. “Maybe we lacked clarity with the ball, we lacked patience at times. We needed to take the ball from side to side to penetrate a defence that came to play its role,” he said. “When we win, we all win. When we lose, it’s the same. We always give our all, we always show our faces. We can only thank you for the atmosphere today. We will come back stronger. Madrid will return, always. “There’s a lot of the season to play. The team is united and we are going to work to achieve what lies ahead.”",
