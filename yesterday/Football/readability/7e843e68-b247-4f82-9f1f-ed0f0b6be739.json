  "text": "Napoli could surrender top spot in Serie A this weekend after Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Lazio, but Antonio Conte has praised his players for adapting to injury-forced formation changes. Napoli lead the Scudetto race on 56 points but could be leapfrogged by second-placed Inter, sitting two points behind, when they visit Juventus for the Derby d’Italia on Sunday. The Partenopei came from 1-0 down to lead 2-1 via a Giacomo Raspadori strike and a Adam Marusic own goal, but Boulaye Dia struck late on to earn a point for Lazio. “I can’t help but be satisfied with the performance. We knew the type of team Lazio is,” Conte told a press conference. “There is certainly regret because in the space of 15 days we have dropped four points here at the Olimpico, two with Roma and two today. “This match was slightly different to the one two weeks ago, this draw has a greater specific weight. We have shown that we don’t want to give up regardless of the inconveniences we are encountering.” Napoli were held to a 1-1 draw at Roma on February 2, conceding a stoppage-time equaliser to Angelino, then they played out another 1-1 draw at home to Udinese the following week. “I really like the spirit of these guys who always want to go beyond the obstacle,” Conte said. “We would not have this ranking without this spirit, which is extraordinary for what we are doing. Someone may think differently, but today the match was positive despite our fourth change of formation. “Those who know football and know how difficult it is to work on a formation, understand how much work is behind changing it four times in seven months… “We move forward with our heads held high with the goal of always leaving with a sweaty shirt.” Forward David Neres has become the latest addition to Napoli’s injury list, with the Brazilian set to be out for around a month with a muscular problem. They had earlier lost defenders Mathias Olivera and Leonardo Spinazzola to muscle injuries. “When we learned about Neres’ injury, in addition to Spinazzola and Olivera’s ones, we adapted,” Conte added. “Even with (Alessandro) Buongiorno’s return after over two months, it was difficult to fit him into a four-man defence. “The boys did well, we have concepts that are valid regardless of the system and they interpreted the match at their best. “I didn’t want to change the three-man midfield and exploit the characteristics of the midfielders, we’ll see for how long we use this system.” Napoli are next in action against Como on February 23, before they face Inter in a potential Scudetto decider the following week.",
