  "text": "Verdict: Liverpool to win to nil Best odds: 10/11 Bookmaker: Betfair Liverpool’s relentless march towards Premier League glory continued in thrilling fashion before the festive break, as they dismantled Tottenham Hotspur in a nine-goal spectacle, further cementing their status as title frontrunners. Arne Slot’s side have showcased an intoxicating blend of attacking prowess and resilience, keeping them firmly in control of the title race. Boxing Day sees the Reds return to the fortress of Anfield, where they remain unbeaten this season, to face a Leicester City side struggling to find consistency under Ruud van Nistelrooy. The Foxes were brought back down to earth with a disappointing home defeat to Wolves, leaving them with much to ponder as they face the daunting prospect of containing Liverpool’s firepower. Liverpool Liverpool’s Boxing Day clash with Leicester City follows an exhilarating display in North London, where Mohamed Salah and his rampant Reds made easy work of Tottenham’s high-risk, high-reward approach. Liverpool’s talisman was unplayable, etching his name further into Premier League folklore with a breathtaking performance, ensuring Klopp’s men celebrated Christmas atop the league standings. Despite their offensive brilliance, Liverpool’s defensive frailties in recent matches remain a cause for slight concern. Conceding multiple goals in their last three Premier League games highlights an area for improvement as the title race intensifies. However, their relentless attack, spearheaded by Salah, continues to outshine these flaws, with the Reds finding the net at least twice in their last nine top-flight outings. As 2025 approaches, Liverpool will be keen to overcome the historical hoodoo of Christmas leaders faltering in their title charge. Slot’s well-oiled machine will view Leicester as another opportunity to reinforce their position, but they’ll be wary of the bumps in the road that lie ahead. For now, their remarkable 21-match unbeaten streak across all competitions is a testament to their dominance and determination to end the season as champions. Team News Slot has the luxury of a nearly full-strength squad for Leicester City’s visit to Anfield, with only Ibrahima Konate (knee) and Conor Bradley (hamstring) remaining sidelined until the new year. This healthy roster affords Slot the opportunity to rotate his squad during the busy festive schedule, especially with concerns over player discipline and fitness. In defence, Jarell Quansah and Kostas Tsimikas could feature, potentially offering fresh legs and a solution to Liverpool’s recent defensive vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the midfield and attack could also see changes, with Dominik Szoboszlai, despite his excellent performance against Tottenham, at risk of being rested to avoid a suspension. The Hungarian is joined on the brink of a ban by Cody Gakpo, Ryan Gravenberch, and Darwin Nunez, further complicating Slot’s selection decisions. Leicester City Leicester City’s struggles under Ruud van Nistelrooy continue, as their defensive frailties remain glaringly evident following consecutive defeats to Newcastle United and Wolverhampton Wanderers. The Foxes’ 3-0 capitulation to Wolves at the King Power Stadium highlighted their ongoing inability to plug gaps at the back, leaving their manager searching for solutions as his side hovers precariously above the Premier League relegation zone. Sitting in 17th place, Leicester are a mere two points above Ipswich Town in 18th, with their fellow strugglers facing a daunting trip to Arsenal. However, Van Nistelrooy’s team faces an equally intimidating challenge at Anfield, where Liverpool’s attacking prowess promises little reprieve for a Foxes defense that has conceded three or more goals in their last three away outings. Leicester’s lack of clean sheets – stretching to 11 games – is a damning statistic, and their recent record against Liverpool offers little encouragement. Following a 3-1 Carabao Cup loss earlier this season and four consecutive defeats to the Reds, including their last Premier League meeting, the Foxes must look back to 2000 for their most recent victory at Anfield. With defensive vulnerabilities glaring and their opponents in imperious form, Leicester will need a herculean effort to avoid becoming another name on Liverpool’s list of victims on Boxing Day. Team News Leicester City manager Ruud van Nistelrooy will likely have to navigate the Boxing Day clash with Liverpool without Jamie Vardy, who is nursing a knock and may be rested due to his age and importance to the squad. The Foxes’ injury woes are compounded by the ongoing absence of first-choice goalkeeper Mads Hermansen, sidelined with a groin problem, leaving former Liverpool shot-stopper Danny Ward poised to continue between the sticks. Ward’s recent error-strewn display against Wolverhampton Wanderers saw him draw the ire of Leicester’s fans, but with Jakub Stolarczyk still regaining fitness at the Under-21 level, Ward remains the likeliest option for Thursday’s fixture. The visitors’ squad remains depleted with Ricardo Pereira (thigh), Wilfred Ndidi (thigh), and Abdul Fatawu (knee) still unavailable, further limiting Van Nistelrooy’s choices. Conclusion Leicester City manager Ruud van Nistelrooy could opt for a more conservative setup on Boxing Day, potentially sacrificing an attacker to bolster the defensive ranks in an attempt to weather the storm at Anfield. However, even such a tactical shift may only delay the inevitable against a relentless Liverpool side. Further more, the Merseysiders might react fiercely to their recent defensive frailties and go for a clean sheet this time. Verdict: Liverpool to win to nil Best odds: 10/11 Bookmaker: Betfair",
