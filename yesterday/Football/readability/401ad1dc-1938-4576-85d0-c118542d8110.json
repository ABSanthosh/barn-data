Reclaiming their La Liga crown and enjoying an iconic silverware sweep, the Spanish heavyweights are already starting to put preparations together over defending their crown next season. However, while the mood around Catalonia might be at a red-hot high, Barca were hit with a real summer blow this week. Despite agreeing personal terms with Spanish international Nico Williams over a blockbuster move to the Nou Camp, the 22-year-old announced a screeching U-turn on Friday. With Athletic Bilbao announcing that Williams had put pen to paper on a remarkable new 10-year deal in the Basque Country, Flickâ€™s side were reportedly left furious. Although both Raphinha and 17-year-old sensation Lamine Yamal might have spearheaded Barcelonaâ€™s domestic sweep last season, it is no secret that Barcelona are seeking attacking reinforcements this summer. Turning their attention back to the drawing board following Williamsâ€™ public rejection, it has been suggested that Barca are lining up a pair of Premier League superstars. Luis Diaz â€“ Liverpool While Mohamed Salah might have stolen plenty of the headlines around Anfield last season as the Egyptian talisman fired Liverpool to a history-making 20th domestic crown, Luis Diaz certainly played more than a helping role. Since arriving from Porto back in January 2022, the Colombian international has been a smash hit and was a key part of Arne Slotâ€™s maiden campaign in charge. However, with just two years left on his current deal and still involved in messy negotiations over a potential extension, it has been suggested that Diaz could be open to a move away from Anfield this summer. Alongside interest from Saudi Arabia, it was reported earlier in the week that Bayern Munich had seen an approach rebuffed by the newly-crowned Premier League champions. Although Liverpool might have made it clear that they have no intention of cashing in on Diaz this summer, Barcelona have identified the 28-year-old as their new standout target. Despite being knocked back after an initial approach to Liverpool last month, Flick is a huge admirer of the 64-cap international and is desperate to claim what would be considered a real coup. ðŸš¨ Barcelona are planning new approach for Luis Diaz in the next days/weeks after Nico deal off. Liverpool already closed doors to both BarÃ§a and FC Bayern in the recent weeks; not an easy one. Marcus Rashford also remains still keen on BarÃ§a move. ðŸŽ¥ https://t.co/VIlzdLPEn8 pic.twitter.com/hxJsJiQTYl â€” Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) July 4, 2025 Marcus Rashford â€“ Manchester United Spending the second-half of last season on loan at Aston Villa, it is no secret that Marcus Rashfordâ€™s return to Manchester United will not be a long one. At the heart of what has become a public divorce from his boyhood club, the 27-year-old has been told he will not be part of Ruben Amorimâ€™s plans going forward and the Red Devils are actively looking to push him out of the Old Trafford exit. However, registering four direct goal contributions in his 10 Premier League appearances on loan at Villa Park last season, it appeared that the England international was starting to enjoy his football again. Now at what is a major career crossroads and with Villa confirming that they will not be activating Rashfordâ€™s permanent clause, Unitedâ€™s academy graduate has made it clear that his sole focus is on securing a Spanish switch this summer. Continuing on from the January transfer window, Rashford has made it his priority to join Barcelona and is even willing to take a significant wage cut in order to force through a move to Catalonia. It has been well documented that United have placed a Â£40million price tag on the 62-cap international. ðŸš¨ Marcus Rashford exit, decision also made on club side as Man United and RÃºben Amorim donâ€™t count on him. Barcelona remains Marcusâ€™ fav option for the summer window but nothing advanced yet at this stage + more options available. ðŸŽ¥ https://t.co/GgCykHMhKC pic.twitter.com/6PrkZTCVMM â€” Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) July 4, 2025",
