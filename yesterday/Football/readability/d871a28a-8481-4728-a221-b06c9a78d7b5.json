  "text": "Ten-man Botafogo made history as they won the Copa Libertadores for the first time with a 3-1 victory over Atletico Mineiro in Buenos Aires. The Brazilian Serie A leaders had to do things the hard way after a second-minute red card but stood their ground to hold off Atletico’s attempts at a comeback. There were just 29 seconds on the clock when Gregore caught Fausto Vera on the head with a high boot, with the red card brandished after 65 seconds. Atletico failed to take their chances despite the numerical advantage and soon found themselves on the back foot as Luiz Henrique fired in the rebound of Thiago Almada’s blocked shot. Luiz Henrique then won a penalty nine minutes later when the goalkeeper wiped him out, and Alex Telles confidently dispatched from 12 yards. Eduardo Vargas pulled one back just two minutes into the second half, rising to nod in Hulk’s corner, but despite their dominance, they could not find a second goal. Atletico flooded bodies forward in search of an equaliser late on but were caught out at the other end in the final minute of stoppage time, as Junior Santos slotted in from close range to secure the trophy. #TempoDeBotafogo é agora! A #GloriaEterna é do @Botafogo! Campeão inédito após vencer o @Atletico por 3-1 na Final em Buenos Aires. Tu és o Glorioso! CONMEBOL #Libertadores pic.twitter.com/238xlW1eCI — CONMEBOL Libertadores (@LibertadoresBR) November 30, 2024 Data Debrief: History makers It was the fourth all-Brazilian final in the Copa Libertadores in the last five years, and it did not disappoint, with dramatic twists and turns from the first minute to the last. While it was already guaranteed that a side from Brazil would lift the trophy for a sixth consecutive year – something never done before – Botafogo have etched their name into history with the win. Another name that went into the history books was Gregore, who received the fastest red card in a final in the competition’s history, surpassing Ruben Sune and Roberto Paredes (both two minutes). Junior Santos finished as top scorer in the competition (10 goals), though his last-minute strike on Saturday was his first in the competition since the group stage.",
