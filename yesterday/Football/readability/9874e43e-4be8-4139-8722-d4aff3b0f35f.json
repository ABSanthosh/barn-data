  "text": "While only just celebrating his 18th birthday, Barcelona’s Lamine Yamal is keen to add two more major trophies to his cabinet. Yamal’s rise has been meteoric since his breakthrough year with the LaLiga giants in 2023-24, directly contributing to 53 goals in all competitions in 106 outings for Barcelona. The talented teenager already has an impressive haul of accolades, having won four major honours with the Blaugrana, which includes their domestic treble last year. His performances have seen him tipped to challenge Paris Saint-Germain’s Ousmane Dembele for this year’s Ballon d’Or, though it is team trophies Yamal is focused on. After a stunning start to 2024-25, Hansi Flick’s team were among the favourites for the Champions League title, a trophy they have not lifted since the 2014-15 season. Their hopes were dashed in the semi-finals by Inter, who edged an enthralling final-four encounter 7-6 on aggregate, though they had to withstand Yamal’s sensational showing. Yamal became the youngest-ever scorer in a Champions League semi-final at 17 years and 291 days old, a record previously held by Kylian Mbappe (18 years 140 days). He also became just the second teenager to score in the last 16, quarter-final and semi-final in a single Champions League campaign, after Mbappe for Monaco in 2016-17. The Spain international ended his European campaign with eight goal involvements (five goals, three assists), ranking second for Barcelona in the competition. He also completed 56 dribbles in the Champions League, more than any other player in 2024-25. But it is not just with Barcelona that Yamal has impressed, having also starred on the international stage for Spain during their European Championships success last year. He started six of Spain’s seven matches on their way to victory over England in the final, scoring a fine goal in their semi-final win over France as well as laying on four assists. Yamal created more chances (19) than anyone else at the tournament, while also leading the way for assists and attempting the third-most dribbles (33). The winger is yet to feature at a World Cup, but he looks likely to star at the 2026 edition, which will take place across the United States, Canada and Mexico. And despite his already impressive trophy haul, Yamal has set his sights on winning the Champions League and World Cup to complete his collection. “Turning 18, I wish to achieve everything we had at 16 and 17, with the title we’re missing, the Champions League, and also the World Cup,” Yamal told Barcelona’s website. “Those are the ones I’m missing. My mindset tells me I have to go out and win. “I’m not thinking about how many years I’ve got ahead – I want to win now. I’ll try and give everything to make it happen. “I just want to tell the fans that we’ll be there, fighting, and the Champions League will come home. The World Cup too.”",
