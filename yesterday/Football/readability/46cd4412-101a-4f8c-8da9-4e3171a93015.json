  "text": "Bayern Munich boss Vincent Kompany wanted to see more control from his team in Saturday’s 2-2 draw with Borussia Dortmund. The two rivals served up a thrilling Klassiker at Allianz Arena, where all four goals came in the second half. After falling behind to Maximilian Beier’s header, Bayern hit back with quickfire goals from Raphael Guerreiro and Serge Gnabry. Yet Waldemar Anton was on hand to equaliser for Dortmund soon after, as the points were ultimately shared. Bayer Leverkusen’s failure to beat Union Berlin means Bayern sit six points clear at the top of the Bundesliga with five games remaining. But Kompany was not impressed with how his team relinquished control after Dortmund’s opener. “Until the first goal, we created chances, and the game was more or less positive for us,” Kompany said. “After the first goal it became a cup game. I would buy a ticket to watch a game like this, but as a coach, you want a little bit more control. “But we wanted to be six points ahead of Leverkusen at the end of the weekend, and we have that.” after #FCBBVB. Match Reaction: https://t.co/yAhLa7fIhu pic.twitter.com/cGs0YhKJi2 — FC Bayern (@FCBayernEN) April 12, 2025 Bayern finished with a whopping 28 shots, with 11 of those on target, though their 1.97 expected goals was only marginally better than Dortmund’s 1.5. Dortmund are now unbeaten in three Bundesliga matches, and sit six points back from the Champions League qualification places. BVB have picked up 13 points from their last seven Bundesliga games, while Bayern have collected 14. “We achieved what we wanted: we wanted to be solid and defend well. In the first half, that was okay, but I wasn’t satisfied with the football,” said Niko Kovac, who was going up against his former club. “In the second half, we came out well and scored to make it 1-0. Then we saw a good game from both teams, with chances here and there. We are satisfied and hope to build on that in the upcoming games.” While Bayern head to Inter still in with a chance of progressing to the Champions League semi-finals, Dortmund’s European hopes are bleak following last week’s 4-0 loss to Barcelona. “We have a tough game on Tuesday,” said Kovac. “We know the situation. We want to win that game. “[In the Bundesliga] I hope to continue this run [with two wins and a draw from the last three matches],” he said. “We still have points to earn.”",
