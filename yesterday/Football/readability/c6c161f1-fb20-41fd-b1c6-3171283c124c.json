  "text": "Competition: Belgian Pro League Market: Antwerp draw no bet Odds: 8/11 @ Pribet Looking to make it back-to-back Pro League victories on Friday night, Antwerp will travel to the Stayen when they meet St. Truiden. Starting with the hosts, while St. Truiden might have clinched a much-needed 2-1 victory ants Westerlo earlier in the month, Felice Mazzu’s side came crashing back down to earth last weekend. Suffering a collapse on home soil as they slumped to a 2-1 loss at the hands of St. Liege, the Canaries find themselves scrapping it out at the foot of the Pro League table. At the heart of a relegation scrap and opening Friday’s showdown sat two points adrift of top-flight safety, the former Anderlecht boss has seen his squad muster just a single victory from any of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Crashing out of the Belgium Cup on January 7th as they suffered a 4-0 drumming against Genk, Friday’s hosts have also gained a reputation for their glaring issues at the Stayen. In fact, St. Truiden have failed to muster a single victory in front of their own supporters since returning from November’s international break. As for the visitors, while Antwerp might have watched their own respective Belgium Cup adventure come to an end earlier in the month, it appears that was just a minor blip for Jonas De Roeck’s side. Dragging themselves to what was an action-packed 3-2 victory against Westerlo, the former Anderlecht coach has seen his squad suffer just a single defeat from any of their previous seven appearances across all competitions. Getting the New Year underway with a thumping 5-1 romp against Royale Union, Friday’s guests will also be excited by a dominant record against the Pro League relegation scrappers. Storming their way to a remarkable 6-1 victory when they last met St. Truiden for their reverse showdowns on August 11th, they have collected 13 points from just their last five Pro League battles. Not suffering a single top-flight defeat on their travels since back on December 1st, we are backing an away draw no bet this weekend. Bet: Antwerp draw no bet against St. Truiden 8/11 for Friday’s Belgian Pro League battle @ Pribet",
