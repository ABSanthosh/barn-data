    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now. When it comes to fashion and beauty, the end of May was defined by one thing and one thing only: The Cannes Film Festival. After a so-called “decency” rule that cracked down on nudity and long trains on the famed red carpet, some could assume that the looks would be more reserved and restrained. But thankfully, our favorite stars still brought the heat to the South of France, including Charli XCX wearing a lilac feathered YSL silk slip and Dakota Johnson partying in a sheer crystal-embellished Gucci gown. Even in the rain, Rihanna made the case for aquamarine being the color of the season, attending the Highest 2 Lowest premiere in a blue knotted Alaïa dress — complete with an umbrella. When it came to beauty, Julia Garner turned heads in a dark vampy lip and slick bleached hair, while Gabriette kept it all about the eyes with heavy black liner and a nude lip. But it was Bella Hadid that really got everybody talking — likely making tobacco blonde the salon request of the summer. As we look ahead to June, we’re turning our attention away from the red carpet and towards the store shelves, with a never-ending selection of beauty and fashion launches coming our way this month.To discover all our favorite products and collections dropping this June, click through the slideshow ahead.Levi’s x Sacai collection Levi’s might be an all-American classic, but it’s bringing something fresh to the table this summer thanks to a collaboration with Japanese luxury fashion brand Sacai. Known for its experimental, patchwork takes on formal wear, Sacai is now bringing its love of fusion to Levi’s denim, with a blazer-denim jacket hybrid and belted dark-wash jeans. However, it’s the full-length flared denim jumpsuit that has really caught our eye, modeled by Chase Sui Wonders in the latest campaign. Available to shop now at Levi’sEmbargo: Mango x Supriya LeleThose searching for their new resort wardrobe can stop right now. British Indian designer Supriya Lele has teamed up with Mango to create a hot-weather-ready collection, dubbed \"A Summer Reverie.\" Featuring 34 pieces, the selection includes a glittering gold two-piece, a sheer black maxi dress and an ’80s-inspired metallic blue swimsuit. But our favorite of the collection has to be the crochet-knit mini with feathered trim, based on one of Lele’s existing designs. The collection stands as the first Mango Collective drop, a platformaiming to celebrate niche designers.Available to shop June 5th at MangoConverse x Isabel Marant Converse and Isabel Marant are reuniting to bring back the wedge sneaker. The footwear brand's latest collab with the Parisian label reimagines two beloved Converse styles — the Chuck 70 (in both high- and low-top silhouettes) and Chuck Wedge — with artful bandana-scarf prints borrowed from the latter's spring/summer 2025 collection. “Good design will always be noticeable, and you’ll never get bored of something that is well achieved — much like the Chuck,\" Marant said in a press release. \"This collection speaks to a cool, easy, and playful attitude.\"  Find the new sneakers in brown and red colorways. Shop on June 3 at Isabel Marant and June 5 at Converse.Glossier Lip GlazeLip oils have become all the rage in the last few years. From Dior’s Lip Glow Oil to NYX’s Fat Oil Lip Drip, the glazed look isn’t going anywhere. Just in time for summer, the new Glossier Lip Glaze touts itself as the “next generation” of lip oil, with a melt-on-the-mouth sheer finish and cooling menthol effect. Infused with ingredients like liquid shea butter and jojoba oil, the lip gloss replacement promises to leave lips feeling hydrated and nourished. Available in six different tints (including a frosty lilac and rich russet red), it’s the non-sticky summer formula we’re ready for.Available to shop now at GlossierGlossier Lip Glaze, $, available at GlossierKylie Cosmetics Hybrid BlushCream blush has been on trend, but some find the staying power lacking. That’s why cream-to-powder products are on our radar this summer, including Kylie Cosmetics' latest Hybrid Blush. Combining the easy-to-blend nature of cream makeup and the smoothing effect of a powder, the new product brands itself as “mistake-proof.” Available in eight different shades, our favorite hues include Sienna (a terracotta orange) and Slow Jam (a punchy grape shade).Available to shop now at Kylie Cosmetics Kylie Cosmetics Hybrid Blush, $, available at Kylie CosmeticsPeachy Summer CollectionLondon label Peachy Den has made a major name for itself thanks to It-Girls like Raye, Lila Moss, and Dua Lipa sporting its looks around town. Now for summer, its latest collection is reinventing its bestselling Kylie dress, Deba top, and Cindy co-ord in all new colorways, as well as new pieces including a khaki frill mini dress, a sunset tank top, and white mini shorts. Available to shop now at Peachy Denpeachy den The Souvenir Top, $, available at peachy denpeachy den The Dylan Bustle Shorts, $, available at peachy denAnastasia Beverly Hills Smooth Blur Contour StickStick applicators have redefined contouring, making it easier than ever to accentuate cheekbones and add dimension to the face. Now, Anastasia Beverly Hills is joining the conversation with the launch of its Smooth Blur Contour Stick. The gel-like creamy formula is meant to sculpt while maintaining a dewy look and lightweight coverage. Available in four different cool-tone shades, the sticks promise a non-greasy, non-comedogenic formula, enriched with vitamin E for added moisture.Available to shop on June 23 at Anastasia Beverly HillsEmbargo: JVN Perféct The Essential Dry ShampooWhile many people see dry shampoo as a last resort product, plenty of hairdressers have long proclaimed the benefits of using it to enhance styling as well as an all-over refresh. JVN is launching its first formula, promising a product without residue, buildup or a white cast, while still providing oil reduction, volume and lift. With ingredients like micellar for cleansing, rosemary for scalp circulation and hemisqualane for hair health, the product is formulated to be kind to strands in between wash days. Plus, the fragrance combines warming amber, violet leaf and crisp apple, making it a treat for those around you, too.Available to shop on June 10th at JVN Converse 1908 Collection, Curated by Tyler, The CreatorTeaming up with long-time collaborator Tyler, The Creator, Converse is bringing the nostalgia this summer with a new vintage-inspired collection. Featuring two footwear styles, the 1908 drop reinvents the Naut-1 (a classic sailing style shoe) and the Coach Jogger (a slimline running trainer). For those interested in a ‘70s trackstar look, the forest green Le Fleur Coach Jogger with gum sole is the go-to, while the stone Naut-1’s with floral embroidery are perfect for those wanting something more preppy.Available to shop June 20th at ConverseConverse GOLF Le Fleur* Jogger, $, available at ConverseLike what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-skin-tint-foundation?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Forget tinted moisturizer or serum foundation for a moment. “Skin tints” are taking their place as the must-have makeup product ahead of summer.  For those who aren’t already sold on their myriad benefits, skin tints occupy a cosy space between a light-coverage foundation and your most hydrating skincare product. The feel? Featherlight. The finish? Super natural. Unlike heavier base products such as concealer or foundation, tints allow skin to look like skin while very subtly tucking away any gripes you might have, like redness, scarring, or breakouts. It’s why countless brands, including Saie, Fenty Beauty, and Lisa Eldridge, are on board. But with so much choice out there, weeding out the products that deserve recognition from the ones that fall flat is no mean feat.  Ahead, I tried seven trending skin tints so you don’t have to, and for me, there’s one clear winner. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lisa Eldridge Enhancing Skin Tint, $40.50 It took me a little while to find the right shade in makeup artist Lisa Eldridge’s first-ever skin tint (T4, in case you were wondering; T5 and T6 were far too yellow for my light olive skin). This appeared matte at first and took a few minutes to “settle” into my skin, but once it meshed with my natural oils, it was virtually indiscernible — and looked so natural. Usually by the end of the da,y my T-zone feels like a slip ‘n’ slide, but I noticed that my face was much less oily, so I delved into the ingredients. It’s hardly sexy, but this tint boasts modified corn starch, which reduces the oily feel of products. I can only assume that it also helped mop up additional face grease throughout the day. Though it’s featherlight, this lasted the longest on my skin. At $49, it’s dearer than most of the tints on this list, but one squeeze was enough to cover my entire face and neck. MILK Makeup Hydro Grip Gel Tint in shade 4, $34 This skin tint feels virtually weightless, and just a pea-sized amount is enough to blur redness and dark marks. It blends effortlessly in seconds with a fluffy brush, so I tend to reach for it when I need to look put together quickly! As you can see here, the finish sits nicely between matte and dewy, giving skin a soft, healthy glow. Blush and bronzer layer smoothly on top, and best of all, it doesn’t aggravate my acne. However, the packaging could use some work. The nozzle tends to leak, so be sure the cap is tightly closed to avoid spills in your makeup bag. While the formula blends well across tones, the range is limited to just 15 shades. I’d love to see more options for deeper skin tones. Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 in shade 24, $38 I’ve been reaching for this skin tint non-stop since I discovered it a few weeks ago — it’s that good. The bonus? It comes with SPF 50, making it a no-brainer for summer. One squeeze is enough to cover my face and neck, and while the coverage is sheer and feels more like wearing skincare, it still does a great job of camouflaging breakouts and dark spots. Some days I skip concealer entirely; other days, I just dab a little under my eyes. I’ve even had a few compliments on my skin lately — including at the end of the day, when I’d usually expect my base to have worn off. It lasts better than most tints I’ve tried, which earns it the winning position. That said, I wouldn’t rely on it as my sole SPF and always layer a dedicated sunscreen underneath. Hourglass Veil Hydrating Skin Tint, $49 The most expensive tint on the list suitably boasts the smoothest application. It virtually glides on, blends quickly, minimizes the appearance of pores, tucks away redness, and makes skin glow in all the right places. Even better, it feels like wearing nothing, but it sticks around: I put it through its paces during a 30-minute high-intensity workout, and it didn’t budge an inch. My only gripe is that it becomes ever so slightly darker after a few hours of wear. If you like to look bronzed, this shouldn’t be an issue, but you could always opt for a shade lighter. That said, the color range — 18 in total — isn’t as extensive as others like Fenty, for instance.  MAC Strobe Dewy Skin Tint, $34 This tint was the wettest. That is by no means a bad thing; it blended into my skin quickly, felt cooling and hydrating, and made my face gleam. No, really: MAC isn’t messing around with the word “dewy” here. After an hour or so, I noticed that the intensity had worn off a little and the finish appeared more natural. In fact, it’s this product which Terry Barber, MAC’s director of makeup artistry, used to create a “dim lighting” effect on models’ skin at London Fashion Week last year — essentially providing a warm, muted glow. The coverage is great for a tint — so fluid, and one squeeze is ample.  Clinique Even Better Clinical Vitamin Makeup Foundation SPF 50, $48 I’m including this as a tint because it’s so sheer — and such a joy to use. The first time I applied it, I was in a rush and was genuinely surprised by how quickly and effortlessly it melted into my skin with my trusty fluffy brush. One pump was enough to cover my face and neck, and I didn’t have to work it in at all. It subtly softened the post-acne pigmentation on my cheeks and took the edge off my dark circles. I also love that it’s packed with skin-loving ingredients, and I’m hopeful the added vitamin C will help brighten things up even more, which makes me excited to keep using it. I used the handy QR code on the website to find my perfect match: Light Medium Cool 1. There are another 25 shades to choose from. Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint, $36 This review wouldn’t be complete without an OG tint to compare the much newer launches to. The first time I tried this, I was an unwavering full coverage foundation person, but I’ve come to appreciate it massively since. It’s a little bit more pigmented than the rest of the tints here, so I can happily skip concealer. The finish occupies a space between matte and dewy, providing a soft-focus effect. Then there’s the shade range — 25 to be exact — which is much more extensive than others. It blends into the skin without any effort, and makeup sits beautifully on top of it. Kosas BB Burst Tinted Gel Cream, $38 The compliments I received while wearing this tinted gel cream affords it the winning position. The consistency is slightly thicker than the others, which lends a soft-matte effect. One pump evened out my skin beautifully. I needed a dab of concealer to effectively mask an angry red spot on my cheek, but the way it blurred the skin staining I have left behind by previous breakouts was impressive. It lasted all day, including a trip to the hairdresser (a very wet backwash and a hot blowdry) plus a dinner event that creeped into the early hours. It’s the only tint I’ve found myself reaching for since, particularly because bronzer and blush apply so well over the top. Revolution Pro CC Perfecting Skin Tint, $12 For the price, this is so impressive. At first squeeze it’s bright white — a common feature of most CC (color corrector) creams and tints — but as I blended it into my skin, the tiny encapsulated pigments popped to reveal the tint. I opted for shade Medium, which was a little too dark for my liking, but the product itself was similar to some of the luxury tints on this list: it blended in moments (I used a brush) and masked redness and skin staining left behind by spots. The coverage is substantial (I didn’t use any concealer on my under eyes), and the finish sits comfortably between matte and dewy. It held up so well that it felt a shame to remove my makeup at the end of the day. The obvious downside is the shade range of which there are only four: Light, Medium, Ta,n and Dark. The website suggests that they correspond with four shades of the brand’s foundation, which indicates that they are somewhat flexible, but I’d recommend scoping them out in store.  Saie Slip Tint Tinted Moisturizer, $36 Give this a good shake before you use it! The first few squeezes deposited a puddle of oil onto the back of my hand. Seeing as I have reactive, acne-prone skin, I was reluctant to go any further, but it lent the most skin-like finish out of all of the tints on this list. While the coverage isn’t as substantial as others (you can see a few spots and scars peeking through), my skin appeared quenched and plump. I do have a few gripes, though. Firstly, it has a paint-like smell that takes a good while to dissipate. Secondly, it felt a little sticky, and my curtain bangs kept getting caught on my cheeks throughout the day. That’s nothing a good, lightweight powder, like Saie Airset Radiant Loose Setting Powder — won’t fix. It’ll provide a little extra coverage, too.  Like what you see?

To fully embrace the warm weather, there are some necessary changes in our beauty routines that need to be made. It's time to head to the store to pick up a new bottle of SPF (because it expires) , swap your rich moisturizer for a lightweight formula that won't break you out, and rotate in some berry makeup shades. It may also be time to break out the self tanner, find the perfect bright red nail polish shade to live out your Italian summer dream, grab a freckle pen to fake the cute spots across your notes without the sun damage – you get the idea. Luckily, there are plenty of new beauty products launching this June from your favorite to explore and our editors have been putting them to the test so that you know what's worth hitting that \"add to cart\" button on. We've fallen in love with new formulas across all categories - hair, makeup, skin, body, nails, and fragrance - and all price points, from luxurious moisturizers to splurge on to an $8 mascara that we can't put down. To get the scoop on the best new beauty launches for June, keep reading.",

    "description": "Finding the perfect mascara is like dating. You expect a lot from your pick, and you never want to settle for less than what you need. When it comes to your lashes, you want the best mascara out there. One that does it all: lengthens, volumizes, curls, and thickens, all while avoiding clumps and the dreaded makeup goop in the corner of the eye that Chandler Bing complained about. But the list of qualities you want in a mascara might not stop there. Some people need a waterproof mascara they can wear to a wedding or at the beach without fear of smudging. Others need something that will hold a curl, even on the straightest eyelashes. And some people are on the hunt for a drugstore mascara that fits into a tight budget - or arrives in just two days from Amazon. No matter what your qualifications are, mascara puts the finishing touch on any makeup look, so it's important to get right. Thankfully, PS editors have dated around for you and tried out dozens of wands, formulas, and innovative tubes, picking the very best mascaras. Keep scrolling for the best - among these all-star picks, you're sure to find \"the one.\"",
