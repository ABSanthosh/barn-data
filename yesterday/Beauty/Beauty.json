If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. A funny thing happened recently — I was rewatching Legally Blonde when a scene stood out to me: One of Elle’s sorority sisters was struggling with her lip liner. Lip liner? I thought. It sounded so… dated. And yet, lip pencils (and their softer, creamier cousin, lip crayons) are inescapable in GRWM videos. I had to ask myself — did we all quietly re-brand lip liners into lip pencils without realizing it? Because that’s exactly what it feels like. There’s no doubt that lip pencils are bigger than ever, but did they ever really leave? “Lip liner has always been transformative and is a hallmark of so many iconic makeup looks,” makeup artist and Sephora beauty director Myiesha Sewell tells Refinery29, referencing signature techniques from the ‘90s supermodel era and Chola culture, which popularized dark, contrasting lip liner. “As a Black girl who went to school in East Los Angeles, [lip liner] still heavily influences my signature makeup look,” she says. “It adds polish and style to any makeup look and is one of my favorite parts of my makeup.” Another reason for lip pencils’ meteoric rise in popularity? Its versatility and convenience, says celebrity makeup artist Alexandra French. “Lip liners have become the ‘It girl’ of makeup simply because they’re so easy to use,” says French. “You can shape your lips with it and tap it out for a more natural effect, or you can go bold and make it the star of the show.” For additional proof of just how versatile lip pencils can be, look no further than makeup artist Emily Wood’s viral videos, where she uses them not only on lips but as blush, contour, and even eyeshadow. (Just make sure the ingredients are safe for the eyes before trying this.) View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emily Wood (@emilywoodmakeup) In case you haven’t noticed, lip pencils are really good these days. Recent innovations in formulations have introduced hydrating and plumping effects, featuring ingredients like vitamin E and hyaluronic acid — a welcome departure from the drier, harder pencils of the past. “I love the Maybelline Lifter Liners,” says French. “They’re creamy, easy to blend, and last.” She also sings the praises of Kosas’ Hotliner and Too Faced’s Lip Injection pencils for pout-enhancing results. “Isamaya Lip Liner and Sephora Collection Rouge Gel Lip Liner have ingredients like triglycerides and polyglycerols that can help give moisture and glide to the formula,” adds Sewell. Editor’s Favorite Lip Liners \u0026 Pencils An informal poll among R29’s beauty editors revealed an abundance of standout favorites: A nude lip is my go-to, and Make Up For Ever’s Artist Pencil is among my most-reached-for products; the brand nailed the array of luminous, warm tones that never look flat. I’m partial to shades Wherever Walnut and Anywhere Caffeine (also a favorite of Hailey Bieber’s). Beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita is partial to Laura Mercier’s Caviar Perfecting Lip Liner, which is as pigmented as lipstick and stays put even after eating and drinking. “These liners also tend to be less waxy, so they last longer and don’t feather,” said Sewell of both picks. “Some of my go-to shades are Fenty Beauty Trac’d Out Lip Liner in Extra Thigh and Rare Beauty Kind Words Lip Liner in Wise.” Another modern use of lip pencils is lip contouring, a key feature of Rhode’s newly-launched Peptide Lip Shape, which is a hit among several R29 staffers. French shares a new trend in lip enhancement: “I’ve recently learned [that people] are giving up lip fillers and instead using cool tone lip liners to create an illusion of fuller lips,” she says. “You can create this lived-in, sexy pout, smudge it out with your finger, and add a lip balm on top. It’s natural, effortless, and so easy to do.”  The Rise Of The Lip Combo All of this has led to the rise of the biggest beauty obsession of the moment: the lip combo. On TikTok, the hashtag #LipCombo has racked up an enormous 9.19 billion views and climbing as users mix and match lip liners, lipsticks, and glosses to craft a bespoke lip look. Scroll through the comments, and you’ll find endless requests to “drop the lip combo.” Some pairings have achieved cult status: American gymnast (and R29 2024 Powerhouse) Suni Lee recently revealed her go-to: Make Up For Ever’s Artist Pencil in Anywhere Caffeine and Wherever Walnut (yes, my favorite shades too!) topped with Ole Henriksen’s Pout Preserve Peptide Lip Treatment. But it’s not just about adding more products for the sake of it. The lip combo trend exemplifies the highly personalized magic of makeup — the thrill of discovering the one (or several) that bring your look to life. With the term “lip liner” itself fading from favor, it seems that 2025 is all about coloring outside the lines. Like what you see?

    "title": "The \"Naked\" Nail Trend Is Sexy but Understated",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/naked-nails-49228600",
    "description": "It's safe to say that as a whole, we've no shortage of kitschy nail trends - think the \"junk nails\" and \"vagina\" nails, to name a few - but the latest has to be our favorite yet. \"Naked\" nails are here - and yes, they're as sexy as they sound, but probably not for the reasons you're thinking. In fact, this trend is all about a stripped-down look with minimal polish (or none at all). The hashtag #nakednails has more than five million views and counting on TikTok, with videos from thousands of users confirming that we are officially in our \"naked-nail era.\" Celebrities are starting to adopt the look; even fictional fashionista Carrie Bradshaw is a long-time naked-nail stan. If all of this has you questioning, \"what is a naked manicure?\" Don't worry, we've got you covered. Ahead, we chat with two nail experts who break down everything to know about naked nails, including what they are and how you can achieve the trend at home. Experts Featured in This Article Jan Arnold is the cofounder of nail brand CND. Nadine Abramcyk is the founder of nail brand Tenoverten. Kunal Malik, MD, is a board-certified general and cosmetic dermatologist. What Are Naked Nails? A naked manicure is when your nails look how they would would naturally - but better. \"We saw the early phases of this trend take root with the rise of the 'invisible' manicure,\" Tenoverten founder Nadine Abramcyk says. \"People have grown an appreciation for natural nails, the equivalent to the no-makeup look.\" Rather than loading on excess amounts of polish, gel, or acrylics, people are looking to get as minimal as possible. \"The 'clean girl' aesthetic is still very much top of mind, so people want to show off their healthy, natural-looking nails as part of the look,\" CND co-founder Jan Arnold says. Not only does the trend look good, but it's good for your nails as well. Dermatologists have warned against the potential side effects of wearing gel or acrylics too often and have even suggested \"nail cycling\" as a way to put the pause on nail damage. \"Taking a break every eight to 10 weeks allows the repair of the nail matrix, which is found under the nail cuticle and contains stem cells where new nails are formed,\" Kunal Malik, MD, board-certified general and cosmetic dermatologist, says. \"Aggressive practices when it comes to gel or acrylic manicures, such as increased pressure upon removal of the nail, can irreparably damage the nail matrix.\" How to Get Naked Nails at Home If you're ready to embrace the look, Arnold says that the key to a perfect naked manicure is to first make sure your nails are in great health, so you should aim to moisturize and condition your nail beds and cuticles daily. \"I love using the CND Solar Oil ($10) as part of my night-time routine before bed because it's a blend of jojoba, vitamin E, rice bran, and sweet almond oils, which penetrate the skin quickly and help prevent the nail plate and cuticle from getting dry and brittle,\" she says. If your nails are damaged or need a little TLC, Arnold recommends using the CND RescueRxx ($21), a daily keratin treatment that can help strengthen the nail plate with continued use. Once you've got a healthy blank canvas to work with, you'll want to cut and file the nails to your desired length and shape. Both Arnold and Abramcyk agree that shorter, trimmed nails are a key component of the trend, but in reality, the shape and length are entirely up to you. Abramcyk recommends using The Buff Plus ($12) if you want your nails to glow without polish, but if you're a polish lover through and through, start out with a nail primer like the Tenoverten The Rehab ($18), and then follow up with a shade like the CND Vinylux in Negligee ($7, originally $11), a sheer nude.

    "title": "\"The White Lotus\" Season 3 Makeup Is Giving Wellness Woo-Woo on Purpose",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/white-lotus-season-3-beauty-interview-49431093",
    "description": "What's the secret to keeping makeup intact while shooting in very hot, humid weather? For Rebecca Hickey, makeup designer for HBO's \"The White Lotus,\" there's only one answer: fans. And lots of them. \"I think we had so many fans, and we don't even just have a regular handheld fan; these are blow dryers. They're like $80 blow dryers,\" Hickey says. \"So everybody had one of those, a lot of umbrellas, and cold towels that we would put on the back of people's necks.\" Season three of the hit show debuted on February 16, and fans were transported to the stunning backdrop of Thailand. When it came to creating the makeup looks for each of the characters, Hickey wanted to play into the wellness of it all. \"During the day, I kept everybody really natural because you'll see they're doing a lot of yoga, health tests, and whatnot,\" says Hickey. \"But then at night, it does become really glamorous.\" Mood boards were made, and she bounced ideas off of costume designer Alex Bovaird to get the looks just right. While the men didn't get much makeup (\"They're just naturally sweatier,\" explains Hickey), the rest of the characters each have their own distinct looks that play into their different personalities and journeys on the show. Though we are deep into the drama three episodes in, the vibes behind the scenes were fun and easygoing. \"We just sit in the makeup room and blast some music. It just feels like we're just girls chit-chatting; it's so fun,\" says Hickey. \"We definitely hung out a little bit more [this season]. They threw us a thank you dinner party for the whole crew, and by the end of the night, we all jumped in the pool without clothes on - the cast, the crew, everybody.\" Below, Hickey breaks down each character's look and the products she used to transform them for the screen. Michelle Monaghan as Jaclyn Michelle Monaghan plays Jaclyn, one member of a friend trio visiting Thailand for a girls' trip. Hickey says that she's worked with Monaghan before, so it was easy collaborating with her when trying to figure out the look for her character. But even with the planned mood boards, the final result doesn't come together until closer to filming. \"It really doesn't come to me until they sit in my chair,\" Hickey says. \"That's when I'm there and seeing their face up close.\" To get that natural vacation glow, she kept makeup fairly simple. She used just the Ciele Tint \u0026 Protect Serum Foundation SPF 50+ ($44), Blush \u0026 Protect SPF 50+ ($34), and Filter \u0026 Protect SPF 30+ ($38) powder for Monaghan's complexion, and the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Gel ($22). She made sure to use sun protection with the EltaMD SPF ($44) and kept her skin moisturized with Lalicious The Oil ($38). Monaghan also went through a major hair transformation for the role, ditching her signature dark brunette shade for golden blond. Celebrity colorist and Olaplex artist Tracey Cunningham helped Monaghan make the dramatic change. \"It's such a gorgeous color on her,\" Cunningham says. \"We had so much fun with the transformation.\" To keep hair looking vibrant, she used the Olaplex No. 4C Clarifying Shampoo ($32) in between touch-ups and the No. 6 Bond Smoother Frizz Control Styling Hair Cream ($30) and No. 9 Bond Protector Nourishing Hair Serum ($30) to smooth flyaways in the humid weather. Leslie Bibb as Kate The second member of the friend trio, Kate, is played by Leslie Bibb. This was a character that Hickey says that she put a lot of thought into. \"She has such a beautiful face, so it was easy to play with makeup,\" says Hickey. \"I did a lot of different colors on her eyes, like pinks, purples, greens, and blues. She wears it well.\" She kept Bibb's face makeup as natural as possible, using the Armani Luminous Silk Perfect Natural Glow Foundation ($69), Merit Bronze Balm ($30), and Ogee Sculpted Face Stick ($48). For sun protection and soothing mist, she used an Epicuren SPF ($58) and Soothe Dermal Repair Spray ($51). Carrie Coon as Laurie Laurie, played by Carrie Coon, is another character that Hickey wanted to play up when it came to the eye looks. \"[Laurie] wears this powdery blue, kind of lilac color, which is super unexpected,\" Hickey says. \"[The character] wanted to show she's on vacation and showing that she's doing something fun with the ladies.\" Her go-to products included the Merit Flush Balm Cheek Color ($30), Ilia In Frame Brow Gel ($24), and La Mer The Concentrate ($225). Parker Posey as Victoria Ratliff Playing the quintessential southern belle, Parker Posey wanted to make her portrayal of Victoria Ratliff feel as real as possible. That includes a methodical look into what lip product she was using. \"She always has some kind of lip,\" says Hickey. \"Her makeup is pretty put together, even though she's popping pills and whatnot. We still wanted her to have that nod to that southern [woman who] wouldn't leave the house without lipstick.\" Posey was a great collaborator when creating her character's look, coming up with strong ideas and products that she really liked. Hickey says the pink, coral red lip we see is actually Possey's own Chanel lipstick (which is sadly a discontinued color). Other products that were used to finish her overall look include Merit Flush Balm Cheek Color ($30), with face products from Estee Lauder and Vinter's Daughter. Natasha Rothwell as Belinda Belinda, played by Natasha Rothwell, is back and on a journey of healing. For Hickey, she wanted to stay true to the Belinda we've come to love when we first met her while also showcasing how much she's changed in part of her life. \"I wanted to really elevate her from the first season, but keep it in the same vein,\" says Hickey. \"I just wanted her to look like she's on this new adventure; this is a new journey for her. I wanted her to feel really fresh and just excited about it.\" The theme was warmer and creamy for Belinda's makeup look, with Hickey using products like the NARS Radiant Creamy Color Corrector ($30), Fenty Beauty Match Stix Contour Skinstick ($32), Beauty Pie Supercheek Cream Blush in French Raspberry ($25), and the Anastasia Beverly Hills Dewy Set ($26). Aimee Lou Wood as Chelsea Aimee Lou Wood plays Chelsea, the younger girlfriend of another hotel guest, Rick. Hickey wanted to keep makeup during the day natural but play it up at night. \"I love Aimee. Her nighttime look was a really cool sixties vibe,\" Hickey says. \"She just has these really beautiful eyes for a winged liner, and we did a nude lip. It was really fun to create.\" To get skin looking glowing, Hickey used the Eminence Eight Greens Youth Serum ($55), Vie En Rose Love Potion Beauty Oil ($110), and the Medik8 Total Moisture Daily Facial Cream ($49). For the fun '60s-inspired looks, Hickey used the Tarte Quick Stick Waterproof Shadow and Liner in Bronze ($26), Make Mascara ($26), and the Tower 28 BeachPlease Luminous Tinted Balm in After Hours ($20). And an insider scoop: Hickey says to keep an eye out for a really amazing eye look on Aimee in episode four or five. Lisa as Mook Though Hickey personally didn't work on Lisa, who plays hotel staff member Mook, while on set, Hickey said that the team talked about keeping Lisa's look as authentic as possible. \"She had a Thai makeup artist, and she just made everything feel very authentic to Thailand and Thai culture,\" says Hickey. \"It was fun. She's really sweet, and obviously, it was a big deal that she was there.\" Audrey Noble is a beauty writer who covers breaking news, writes celebrity profiles, and does deep-dive features about the ways race, gender, sexuality, and other forms of identity impact society via the beauty industry.
