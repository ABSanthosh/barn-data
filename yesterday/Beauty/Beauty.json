Classic, minimal, and undeniably timeless, there’s nothing like that combination of white tips and a nude base for an instantly polished nail look. However, if you love a pared-back manicure but find the humble French mani slightly, well, basic, then you might be interested in its latest iteration. Enter: the tinted French manicure. Also known as the “French glow”, this trending manicure features all the trademarks of a classic French (polished tips and a neutral base) but with an extra dose of shine. Celebrity nail technician Harriet Westmoreland has made the look something of a trademark this year with her “pink glow Frenchie” being shared all over social media — and prompting plenty of people to take on the trend themselves. Think soap nails meets French tips; it’s a clean and juicy nail look that’s perfect for spring. Trust me when I say that you’re about to see the tinted French manicure everywhere.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) What is the tinted French manicure? At first glance, the tinted French or “French glow” manicure looks incredibly similar to its classic predecessor. But the focus here is on the shine, which adds an almost jelly-like glow to the nails. “The French glow is designed to enhance your natural nail color, lend a super glossy effect, and create the illusion of perfected nails finished with a French tip,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. While similar to the natural nail tints that have been popular over the last year, Streets points out that the tinted French differs slightly: “It mimics a refined French look, whereas nail tints provide just a delicate hint of color,” says Streets. Another key factor that sets the tinted French apart from the original is the tip. Rather than a stark white tip, many nail artists are opting for more sheer, milky whites that give the tinted French a softer and more contemporary-looking result. As for the base color? “Use a sheer, milky, or pink-toned polish to create a soft, healthy glow and a ‘your nails but better’ finish,” says Streets. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shauna (@nailsdonewright) How do you achieve the tinted French manicure at home? While a visit to the nail salon is always a joy, Streets says the tinted French manicure is easy to DIY at home: “It’s a quick way to get nails looking chic and groomed with few products,” Streets says. She adds that you can recreate this trend by using a nail glow product alone for great results. The Dior Vernis Nail Glow, $32, works by brightening and reviving the natural color of your nails, so both your tips and nail base will look more vibrant and polished after just one coat.  If you have more time, Streets recommends prepping for your manicure. “Ensure the nail surface is clean, shaped, and buffed so that color application will be smooth and even,” she says. Next, apply two thin coats of your chosen nail glow color. We rate Zoya Naked Manicure Perfector, $12, and Londontown Sheer Strength Nail Blush, $20. Then use a fine liner brush to apply the milky tip. Manucurist’s Green Nail Polish in Milky White, $19, is the perfect creamy hue. “Follow the natural shape of your nail tip to create the French tip detail and add a top coat for added resilience,” explains Streets. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chels Lou (@chelslounails) How long does the tinted French manicure last? Besides being such a versatile nail look, one of the best things about a tinted French manicure is that you won’t have to rush to redo your nails. “It’s the ultimate low-maintenance manicure,” says Streets. “Choosing a natural base color or nail tint is much longer-lasting than brighter or darker hues, as the regrowth is almost imperceptible. Adding a long-wear top coat like Essie Stay Longer Top Coat, $11, also reduces the chances of that carefully applied French tip chipping away. It’s a polished look that sticks around.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Do you remember what you were doing on December 6, 2022? I do. I was frantically filling my virtual shopping cart with The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation following the brand’s announcement that it would discontinue the product a few months later. The Serum Foundation may have disappeared, but it left a lasting legacy: Makeup artists, beauty enthusiasts, and TikTok content creators have mourned its discontinuation as recently as last month, and there are even entire Reddit threads dedicated to finding a replacement for it. That’s why I’m pleased — actually, beyond excited — to announce that the Serum Foundation will return today. Why was The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation discontinued? While the Serum Foundation amassed a 25,000-strong waiting list when it launched in 2017, it was shelved just a few years later. In a social media post from 2022, The Ordinary explained that although it had set the price at an accessible level, this approach wasn’t sustainable in the long run, especially because sales weren’t high enough. But you never miss a good thing until it’s gone, and ever since then, fans of Serum Foundation have flooded The Ordinary’s Instagram posts demanding its swift return.  Is The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation returning for good? Like all good things, though, there is a catch. While the brand has been working hard to bring back all 36 shades, this will be a limited release. For now, the brand has no plans to make the foundation a permanent fixture — but that could change. When asked on Instagram whether the foundation would be brown girl friendly, The Ordinary responded by highlighting their 36 original shades and said that if the product was well-received, it would work with its lab to expand the range further. Is The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation any good? Happily for diehard fans, the formula is the same — and it’s just as affordable. At just $7.50, Serum Foundation is a snip of the price of most foundations on the market, and if you ask me, it’s even on par with some high-end offerings thanks to its ability to provide impressive coverage and substantial hydration — all without the heavy, mask-like feel of other foundations. That’s all down to the clever formulation. Unlike The Ordinary’s extensive skincare dynasty, there are no hi-tech ingredients. Rather, Serum Foundation consists of a water and silicone base and makeup pigments. Once applied, both the water and silicones evaporate from the skin, leaving behind a delicate veil of coverage that doesn’t budge until you see fit to remove it.  Shades 2.0N and 2.0P were staples in my makeup routine depending on the season, and until it disappeared from the shelves, it was a foundation that I recommended to friends, family, and R29 readers who were after a light to medium coverage with a featherlight feel. Let’s be honest: Serum Foundation walked so that skin tints could run. Is The Ordinary bringing back its concealer? At this point, The Ordinary isn’t resurrecting its concealer, which was also part of the Colours makeup range. The Serum Foundation will exist alone until it sells out.  Where can I buy The Ordinary’s Serum Foundation? While The Ordinary is stocked by retailers including Sephora and Ulta, the Serum Foundation will only be available through the brand’s official website and four freestanding stores from today: Distillery Lane in Toronto, 5th Avenue in New York City, Commercial Street in London, and Gertrude Street in Melbourne. Like all products The Ordinary launches, I predict a sell-out — and I’ll be first in line to stock up. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/unsexy-beauty-products-49362561",
    "description": "There's a new trend sweeping Beauty TikTok where users reveal the \"unsexy\" beauty products in their routines that work like a charm. From body oils to tongue scrapers and everything in between, people are raiding their bathroom shelves to talk about all of the items they swear by but wouldn't necessarily take a shelfie of. These items are effective and get the job done - they just don't have the cutest packaging or Instagrammable results. As editors, we get to try products that run the gamut from dirt cheap to extremely expensive. Due to the nature of our roles, it's our duty to try everything with a neutral lens and report back on whether they work. While we love aesthetically pleasing bottles and pretty formulas that make us want to snap a picture, sometimes the best products are the ones that just work – sans any other bells and whistles. What's \"unsexy\" about a product can mean different things to different people. For some, it's the packaging that it comes in; for others, it can be what the item is used for. Still, the unifying quality of all of these items is that they deliver incredible results regardless of all that. As such, we've decided to share our favorite unsexy beauty products that we can't live without and would recommend in a heartbeat. Our obsessions range from products like Aquaphor Healing Ointment to First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - there are truly all kinds of options. From deodorant to dandruff shampoo, keep reading for the items we always keep in stock (and hidden within our medicine cabinets).",
