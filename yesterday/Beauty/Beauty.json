    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-nail-file-growth-benefits?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "My nails have been through a lot over the past three decades. I was a compulsive nail biter throughout most of my childhood and teen years, and it wasn’t until college that I kicked the habit for good. From there, I’ve struggled with brittle, weak nails on and off depending on my anemia, stress levels, diet, and other factors. Even though I no longer instinctively chew my nails like I once did, I was still prone to picking if I noticed a scraggly edge or a hangnail. Until one day, I decided that I’d be a lot less likely to pick if I had a better alternative than taking matters into my own hands — literally.  I was first introduced to glass nail files a few years ago through Bare Hands’ Dry Gloss manicure kit, and ever since then, my natural nails have never looked better. Most manicurists have sworn by glass files for years, thanks to their ability to shape nails without snagging, but I had no idea that the right tool could actually prevent me from damaging my nails and help them grow. Recently, I was traveling and broke a nail; instead of picking at it, I ran to the closest beauty store and picked up a glass nail file to reshape and prevent further damage. The one I found? Ulta Beauty Collection’s version, which came in a travel-friendly sleeve perfect for keeping in a makeup bag or purse for on-the-go use. It also turned out to be the best impulsive buy for my natural nails. Read ahead for a deep dive into the benefits of glass files — and exactly why they’re worth the investment. DashDividers_1_500x100 Why are glass nail files better for your natural nails? You might not think twice about the kind of nail file you’re using, but there’s a good chance it could be causing more harm than good to your natural nails. “Traditional emery boards cause microscopic tears at the tip of the nail,” explains Dr. Dana Stern, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of nail care brand Dr. Dana. “Glass files create a perfectly smooth edge that seals keratin [which nails are made of] and prevents splitting, peeling, breakage, and even premature polish chipping,” she adds. How should you use a glass nail file? According to Dr. Stern, glass files are best suited for filing the free edge (aka the “top”) of the nail to shape and shorten. Unlike other types of files, glass versions can be safely used to file the nail in any direction. With other, more abrasive materials, you are usually instructed to only file nails one way to avoid creating a jagged edge. How often do you have to replace glass nail files? Happily, glass files are a sustainable, reusable alternative and can be cleaned between uses. “In salons, any porous item should be considered one-time-use as they can potentially harbor infectious material and cannot be sterilized,” Dr. Stern says. “Another advantage of glass tools is that they don’t dull and are therefore continuously reusable.” Keeping your glass file in a protective case will help shield it from chemicals and getting scratched (or scratching other things).  How do glass nails help natural nails grow? It may seem counterintuitive that a tool designed to shorten your nails can actually help them grow, but think of it as a long game strategy, like how regular hair trims can help avoid split ends. “Switching to a glass file is advantageous because the nail is less likely to peel, split, and break, so over time, you are more likely to achieve length with a glass file than a traditional emery board,” explains Dr. Stern.  For me, having neat, groomed nails — with or without polish or gel — discouraged me from picking at them, which would cause them to peel or break, and set my growth journey back to square one. I’ve been using the Ulta one several times a week since it lives in my bag and therefore accompanies me almost everywhere. I’ve found myself fixing my nails waiting in line at a coffee shop, or when I touch up my lipstick in the bathroom at happy hour. Despite the $9 price tag, it’s just as good as any other brand (including more expensive ones) I’ve tried; it’s lightweight but doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. Plus, the grain is on the finer side, making it quite gentle on my nails. Within a month, my nails looked visibly better and were breaking and splitting less often. In the past, I swore by builder gel to achieve any meaningful growth. It’s been months since my last gel manicure, but with my wedding coming up, I’ll likely get one in the books soon — especially now that I’m set up for success with healthier natural nails. Is there any recommended “aftercare” post-glass nail file use? It’s not required, but then again, pampering your nails is never really a bad thing. “Nothing needs to be done [after using a glass file] for the nail per se, but I always recommend keeping the cuticle well hydrated,” says Dr. Stern, adding that a healthy cuticle is foundational for a healthy nail. Her go-to? The Dr. Dana Nourishing Cuticle Oil, which contains indigo naturalis (an herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for reducing inflammation), plus sunflower and jojoba oils to moisturize (yes — your nails need that too!) and support nail growth. “When used regularly, cuticle oil will keep cuticles properly hydrated and allow nails to grow healthier and stronger,” Dr. Dana explains. I keep one on my nightstand as a reminder to use it at least nightly, but am trying to be better about using one a few times a day. I’m a fan of Olive \u0026 June’s Cuticle Serum pens, which absorb quicker than an oil for easier, grease-free use during the day. Which glass nail file is best for me? Not all glass files are created equal, and Dr. Stern specifically notes that the level of abrasiveness can vary among glass files. What’s more, not all of them are meant for natural nails. (Grittier ones may be used as a first step to remove gel polish, for example.) If you’re simply looking to replace your basic emery board, something like my new Ulta find or the Dr. Dana Glass Nail File will be a major upgrade and gentle enough for regular use.  Glass files also come in a variety of shapes, which can lend themselves to other purposes besides filing. Germanikure’s Moonfile has a slight arched shape (hence the name), which is ergonomically designed for a comfortable hold, but is also great for pushing back cuticles and gently exfoliating dead skin on the sides of the nail.  In addition to using a glass file, I also like to use a glass polisher tool — namely Bare Hands’ polisher — to gently buff the nail surface. It works by removing the superficial layer of keratin (which will look like mini clouds of whitish dust) on your nails, resulting in a naturally shiny appearance. According to the brand, the polisher lasts for around six months if you buff once a week for your nails. With less frequent use, it can last up to a year. Mind you, I’ve had mine for nearly two years and it’s still in pretty good shape. Using a glass buffer comes with a caveat, though: Dr. Stern is quick to note that a glass file is not the same as a buffer, which is safe for the nail plate. “Using a glass file at the surface can dislodge nail cells, creating an uneven surface that is more prone to peeling and breakage,” she says. “Also, filing or even over-buffing the nail surface can result in a nail that is too thin.”  Besides using a glass file on the free edge of my nails, I buff the surface once every other week at a maximum to avoid compromising their integrity, and I think it’s helped my nails not only look better (they have a natural luster, so sometimes I skip polish entirely), but grow in healthier. (Think of it as maintaining a healthy skin barrier — less is more!)  Ready to become a card-carrying member of the glass file club? Shop our favorites below. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/korean-perfume-brands?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I write this story from one of countless cafes in Seongsu, a hip area that’s been referred to as “the Brooklyn of Seoul.” Lined with quaint boutiques and a revolving door of pop-ups for some of Korea’s hottest fashion and beauty brands, it’s become a top shopping destination for locals and tourists alike. As such, it’s also a great spot to see what’s currently trending. After spending many afternoons scanning the sea of shopping bags in people’s hands, it’s clear that one category of K-beauty is especially popular right now: fragrance.  Tamburins, Nonfiction, pesade, Borntostandout: They may not be household names—yet—but they are among the most beloved perfume brands in Korea right now. Below, let’s take a closer look at the world of Korean fragrance houses, including a few under-the-radar brands on the rise. DashDividers_1_500x100 FRA 422 View this post on Instagram A post shared by FRA422 프라포투투 (@fra422.official) As if on cue, on my way over to the cafe, a girl handed me a perfume blotter advertising a pop-up nearby. I had never heard of the brand before, but the sample smelled so good, I had to check it out.  FRA 422 is centered around sustainability and scent. (The “422” in the name is a reference to Earth Day, which is April 22.) As an employee explained to me, the brand only uses extracted essential oils from plants that aren’t endangered or at risk — or they formulate closely matched synthetic substitutes that are indistinguishable from the original scents. To that end, the line is tightly curated with just five core perfumes, including a leather and oud number called Won and a rose and oakmoss scent named Kim. My personal favorite is Hani, a fresh citrus that’s grounded in amber and musk and wears like a second skin. DashDividers_1_500x100 Tamburins View this post on Instagram A post shared by TAMBURINS 탬버린즈 (@tamburinsofficial) Tamburins is perhaps the most well-known K-fragrance brand of the bunch, thanks in part to its affiliation with luxury eyewear brand Gentle Monster, and global celebrity ambassadors like Jennie from BLACKPINK and actor Byeon Woo Seok.   With architecturally stunning retail spaces filled with objets d’art and packaging that elevates the experience of using one of their scented offerings, it’s easy to see why people are instantly drawn to the brand. Since debuting in 2017, Tamburins has expanded its extensive lineup to include perfumes housed in egg-shaped bottles, solid fragrances for on-the-go, scented hand creams, candles, lip balms, and even car diffusers in distinctive scents like Pumpkini, a sweet pumpkin and coconut milk fragrance cut with invigorating shiso leaf and ginger. DashDividers_1_500x100 Nonfiction View this post on Instagram A post shared by NONFICTION 논픽션 (@official.nonfiction) Nonfiction was the first perfume brand I purchased when I moved to Korea last fall. I walked into one of their bright, airy stores one afternoon and immediately fell in love with their Neroli Dream scent (a softer version of Tom Ford’s iconic Neroli Portofino IMO). The brand’s messaging is all about finding calm in your days through sensorial rituals that connect you to your inner self. This ethos is reflected throughout the minimalist packaging and the fragrances themselves, which are formulated using plant-derived ingredients that are never too overpowering.  In addition to the perfumes in its current lineup, Nonfiction also makes body and hair care products, as well as hand creams, lip balms, room sprays, and candles. DashDividers_1_500x100 Borntostandout View this post on Instagram A post shared by BORNTOSTANDOUT® (@borntostandout.official) If quiet minimalism isn’t your thing, give Borntostandout a try — honestly, the name says it all. Launched in 2022 by a former investment banker and lifelong fragrance fanatic Jun Lim, BTSO was created for those who “rebel against the standards” — but still want to smell really good.  The brand’s smooth white flacons nod to traditional Korean porcelain wares and have memorable names like DGAF and Fig Porn emblazoned across them in crimson typeface; the fragrances themselves are equally memorable, thanks to unconventional accords that range from basmati rice to banana bread.  Sure, some of the scents may throw you at first sniff, but they dry down into something softer and more familiar as they wear. This might explain BTSO’s rapidly growing fan base and L’Oréal’s recent funding, as the brand plans its expansion into the U.S. and European markets. DashDividers_1_500x100 pesade View this post on Instagram A post shared by pesade 페사드 (@pesade_official) Just a stone’s throw away from Borntostandout’s Itaewon store is pesade, where the ambiance is decidedly more relaxed. From the sleek interiors to the structural tables that showcase the brand’s timeless scents, everything about pesade feels refined and classic.  The brand’s unlikely source of inspiration comes from dressage, a discipline of equestrianism. A pesade refers to a dressage move where a horse balances on its hind legs at a 45-degree angle from the ground. Per the brand, “This particular movement symbolizes the harmony of power and balance, which is deeply connected to pesade’s philosophy.” The scents come in highly concentrated parfums ($210 for 100ml or roughly 3.4oz) and eau de parfums ($180) that last long after first spritz. With a diverse range of unisex fragrances to choose from, pesade is a place where one could easily find their 인생 향수 or “life perfume,” as the Koreans say.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Kinfolk Notes View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kinfolk Magazine (@kinfolk) Fans of Kinfolk will be delighted to know that the brand is still alive and well in 2025 — and has a physical store in Seongsu that has the same relaxed, yet dignified vibe of the indie lifestyle magazine. The flagship space includes a flower shop, café, and the full range of Kinfolk Notes fragrances exclusive to Korea.⁠ Initially launched in 2022 with hand soaps, lotions, and creams, Kinfolk Notes has since expanded to include eau de parfums, diffusers, and candles.  With dreamy names like Splendor in the Grass, inspired by William Wordsworth’s poem and movie of the same name, and Blue Velvet (a reference to David Lynch’s neo-noir mystery), all of the fragrances in Kinfolk Notes bring the brand’s artsy sensibilities to life.  DashDividers_1_500x100 W.Dressroom View this post on Instagram A post shared by 더블유드레스룸 (@w.dressroom) If you’re looking for more affordable K-fragrance options, I’d suggest W.Dressroom (which counts BTS’ Jungkook and Seventeen’s S.Coups among its wearers).  The brainchild of renowned designer Bum Suk Choi, W.Dressroom’s scents are uncomplicated in the best way. The straightforward names clearly indicate notes of the juice, and the comprehensive lineup includes everything from fruit-forward options to traditional florals and powdery musks. (Think: Bath and Body Works meets Grown Alchemist.) My favorite is 97 April Cotton, a fresh laundry scent that I regularly douse on my clothes after sweaty dance classes. BTW, the brand’s “dress perfumes” have deodorizing and antibacterial ingredients in them to neutralize unwanted odors from clothes and spaces, making them great for a post-workout spritz or a smoky K-BBQ dinner. DashDividers_1_500x100 Granhand View this post on Instagram A post shared by GRANHAND. (@granhand_official) For a scented souvenir to take back from Seoul, make a stop at one of Granhand’s eight stores scattered throughout the city (though their original outpost in Bukchon Hanok Village is still my favorite). Granhand’s perfumes are unique in name and composition. Take Susie Salmon, for example, a juicy blend described as smelling like “a midday nap after eating sweet fruits” or Lumberjack, a clove bud and cedarwood scent that smells like “a sip of whiskey in front of the fireplace.”  The brand also offers complimentary personalization for each purchase, so you can add your name or initials (or that of a loved one) for an extra sentimental touch.

And this month, on April 24, \"Tangled\" fans finally get their fix. \"Tangled,\" which came out in 2010, has long been a Disney fan favorite, and there have even been talks of turning it into a live-action movie, though nothing is officially in the works yet. To hold you over, ColourPop is launching a nine-piece collection that features liquid highlighters, eyeshadow palettes, lip glosses, and more. Plus, it even includes some fun hair accessories since \"Tangled\" is a movie about magic hair, after all. The full collection launches on April 24 on ColourPop.com and will expand into Ulta stores and Ulta.com on April 27. Lucky for you we have an exclusive sneak preview of everything that's dropping - plus swatches of what each one looks like in real life - so you can start planning your purchases now ahead of the launch date.",

    "description": "Every year, it's natural to look for new ways to add some excitement to your life. Instead of jumping out of a plane or traveling to the farthest country you can think of, what easier (and more low-stakes) way to inject some fun into your life than dusting off your \"haircut ideas\" board on Pinterest? Keeping up-to-date on the latest haircut styles allows you to keep tabs on what's new in the space, and over the next few months, it'll be all about having fun with your look. As Jae-Manuel Cardenas, a hairstylist at Sally Hershberger NoMad in New York City, put it: \"This year is all about texture and movement. I love to give hair a refresh by adding fresh, choppy layers. Hair [will] look sexy and undone.\" That's not all. There will be cool shorter cuts and haircut ideas for medium length (plus those in between lengths), but each one follows three common denominators: they are fresh, fun, and anything but boring - and isn't that what everybody wants when they go in for a makeover? From the bold \"jellyfish\" cut to the more subtly layered shag, there are enough hair ideas to fill an entire inspiration board. Don't just take our word for it. We've asked a handful of experts to break down the hottest looks you should know about, including haircuts for curly hair and all other hair types. Get loads of inspiration photos on how to wear them and learn insider techniques to level up your look - that you'll want to bring to your next salon appointment, so you can kick off the new season right.
