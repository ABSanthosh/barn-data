    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/pat-mcgrath-glass-skin-fetish-mask-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When it comes to makeup artistry, few names carry the weight of Pat McGrath. Dubbed ‚ÄúMother‚Äù by the fashion and beauty worlds alike, McGrath has cemented her legacy as one of the most influential and prolific figures in the industry. From creating dazzling, avant-garde looks for runway shows to redefining what luxury beauty means with her eponymous brand, Pat McGrath Labs, her work has always been about breaking boundaries. The viral Glass Skin Mask is no exception. Inspired by her iconic designs for Maison Margiela‚Äôs haute couture shows, where models graced the runway with ethereal, glass-like complexions, the mask promises to deliver McGrath‚Äôs signature high-shine, dewy finish in just one application. But how wearable is it off the runway? To find out, I visited Pat McGrath Labs in NYC to experience the product firsthand and uncover whether this viral sensation is worth the hype ‚Äî or just another fleeting beauty trend. With McGrath‚Äôs brilliance rooted in her ability to marry high fashion and everyday glamour, I had to ask: Can this mask truly make glass skin a reality for everyone, including Black women with specific skincare needs? Here‚Äôs what I learned from trying the mask out myself:¬† First of all, the mask is nothing short of stunning. Formulated with glycerin, rose flower water, and a mix of antioxidants, it‚Äôs designed to support skin renewal while delivering that glass-like glow. What‚Äôs unique about this mask is that it‚Äôs applied on top of your makeup ‚Äî not underneath. Initially, I was skeptical since I‚Äôd never used a mask over a full face, but to my surprise, nothing budged or lifted during the process. How to apply the Pat McGrath Skin Fetish Mask Applying the mask is a multi-step ritual. It involves three layers with drying time in between each. To speed things up we used a blowdryer, but the entire process ‚Äî starting with doing my makeup ‚Äî took about two hours in total. It‚Äôs definitely not a quick fix but more of a special-occasion beauty moment. Lastly, there is a bit of a catch: Once the mask is on, you can‚Äôt talk, eat, or drink. Any movement risks cracking or peeling, making it impractical for everyday wear ‚Äî but it‚Äôs undeniably fun. After an hour of wear, I can confirm the mask is an absolute showstopper. While it‚Äôs not designed for durability, it‚Äôs perfect for making a statement. Walking through the streets of New York City, I turned heads and even received a few compliments from strangers. The next day, my skin looked flawless, as promised. McGrath mentioned the mask‚Äôs nourishing ingredients would leave a lasting glow, and she wasn‚Äôt lying. @refinery29 Stay tuned. üëÄ @Pat McGrath Labs just launched the product to get the viral makeup look from last year‚Äôs @Maison Margiela haute couture runway show. #glassskin #glassskinmask #makeup ‚ô¨ Sunrise ‚Äì Official Sound Studio So, is the mask worth the hype? For beauty enthusiasts and makeup lovers who enjoy trying unique artistry products, it‚Äôs a playful indulgence at $38 a tube. For the average person, it‚Äôs less practical, but for one day, it was thrilling to channel my inner Pat McGrath muse. Next time, I‚Äôd opt to use the mask more sparingly as a highlighter or treatment mask, which McGrath mentioned are some of her favorite alternate uses for the product. If you‚Äôre still curious about the mask, here‚Äôs more details straight from Mother‚Äôs mouth‚Ä¶¬† DashDividers_1_500x100 R29: What inspired you to create the glass skin mask? Pat McGrath: This is my love letter to Margiela and to beauty lovers everywhere. The glass skin look was an unforgettable moment, and I wanted to make that radiance accessible for everyone to recreate effortlessly at home. R29: Can you tell us about the hero ingredients in the mask and their benefits? What gives it the glassy shine? McGrath: The mask is powered by glycerin, rose flower water, allantoin, and black tulip extract, a potent antioxidant that supports skin renewal. These ingredients work together to hydrate, soothe, and smooth the skin. The glassy shine comes from a specially formulated reflective layer that delivers the signature glow. R29: Is this mask suitable for all skin types, including sensitive skin? McGrath: Yes! The formula was designed with all skin types in mind, including sensitive skin. It‚Äôs gentle yet effective, delivering hydration and radiance without irritation. R29: Are there any specific techniques or tools that enhance the product‚Äôs effectiveness? McGrath: Oh it‚Äôs so easy! You just need to use any tapered brush with soft bristles to apply a thin, even layer. Always start with a clean, dry face and work in thin layers for the best results. However many layers you‚Äôd like to use is up to you. R29: Have you always wanted to create a mask like this or was it purely because of the virality of the Margiela show? McGrath: It‚Äôs a bit of both. I‚Äôve always dreamed of creating something that captures the brilliance of glass skin, but the response to the Margiela show was the catalyst to bring it to life. R29: Is there a difference between this version of the mask and the version seen on the models? McGrath: This mask will get you the results from the Maison Margiela show in a third of the time, and with some added skincare benefits. I really was very purposeful in creating something that would give you the glass skin effect while making your skin look and feel glowing once you take it off. R29: How does this product ensure a radiant finish without looking ashy on deeper skin tones? McGrath:I designed the formula to enhance every skin tone, leaving a clear, radiant glow with no white cast or ashy residue. R29: Hydration is key for melanated skin. Does the mask target hydration to enhance the natural dewiness of darker skin tones? McGrath: Yes! Hydration is a core focus of the formula, ensuring the skin feels plump, refreshed, and radiant, enhancing its natural luminosity. R29: Was the mask tested on a diverse range of skin tones to ensure inclusivity? McGrath: Absolutely. Inclusivity is at the heart of everything we do. The mask was tested across a wide spectrum of skin tones ‚Äî including my own face ‚Äî¬†to ensure it performs beautifully for everyone. Like what you see?

    "description": "Amanda Nguyen is an activist. And a bestselling author. She‚Äôs also a Nobel Peace Prize nominee, founder of a nonprofit, and she happens to love makeup. (Oh, and one more thing: She is the first Vietnamese woman to go to space.) A quick scroll on her Instagram feed reveals snippets of her incredible career, which has spanned her groundbreaking aerospace achievements, critically-acclaimed memoir Saving Five, appearances as TIME‚Äôs Woman of the Year, and her work with Rise, a non-governmental organization she created to protect sexual assault survivors. (In 2016, the United States Congress passed the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights after she publicly testified, which guaranteed, for the first time, statutory rights in federal code for survivors of sexual assault and rape.) Point is, she‚Äôs already a veritable force for change ‚Äî but wasn‚Äôt too busy to add one more line to her already-impressive CV: Star of e.l.f. Cosmetics‚Äô Show Your(s)e.l.f. campaign.¬† The editor-beloved makeup brand is known for its accessible, high-quality products, but it is a shared mission of inclusivity and joy of beauty that made this partnership a natural fit for Nguyen. ‚Äúe.l.f. is all about democratizing beauty,‚Äù she tells Refinery29. ‚ÄúAnd for me what that means is seeing myself reflected in the ways people consume beauty, either through content, film, or advertisements¬†‚Äî and I actually do use e.l.f. every day.‚Äù¬† In addition to the campaign film, Nguyen is preparing to literally take flight as she embarks on an upcoming space expedition with Blue Origin, making her the first Vietnamese woman to go to space. In our latest Power Diaries, the trailblazer candidly speaks about how she stays inspired and empowered, and shares more about her new role as an e.l.f. ambassador. DashDividers_1_500x100 I feel most powerful when‚Ä¶ I show up as my authentic self. Power to me means‚Ä¶ The freedom to make my own choices. What do you do when you feel powerless? I remember that no one is powerless when we come together and no one is invisible when we demand to be seen. What‚Äôs your power anthem?¬† Our voice. It‚Äôs the most powerful tool we have, so use it. Who is your power icon? My power icon is Sally Ride. She trailblazed so that I could fly. What do you wear when you want to feel powerful? I wear red lipstick. Keep reading for the rest of our Q\u0026A with Nguyen. Refinery29: How would you describe your relationship with beauty growing up? Amanda Nguyen: I always want to show up as myself authentically. Beauty has always been a part of that. I‚Äôll speak from a very vulnerable place, but growing up in California, I was one of the few Asian Americans in my school. There wasn‚Äôt representation, so I grew up having to learn that my self-worth and beauty were things that were inherent to me. R29: I can totally relate. I‚Äôve noticed that in many of your appearances, you wear a beautiful red lipstick. What‚Äôs the story behind that? AN: In the beginning, when I was in these very intimidating and hallowed spaces ‚Äî say testifying in front of the Senate or at the United Nations ‚Äî I thought, Maybe I should try to assimilate and be ‚Äòless than‚Äô. But I realized that my power is in my story ‚Äî what I represent ‚Äî and I actually did want to stand out fully as me. In wearing lipstick and glam, I chose to intentionally show up as who I was. I chose to not shy away from the fact that I am there representing a story and I can in fact be both a changemaker and love makeup. R29: What are some of your essential products in your daily beauty routine? Anything you plan to bring to space? AN: Yes, for sure! I travel a lot, so one of the things that I bring with me on the plane is the Holy Hydration Jet Set. Then there‚Äôs a concealer that I‚Äôm running out of ‚Äî the Hydrating Camo Concealer. I actually wore an e.l.f. red lipstick in my first astronaut photo shoot, before this partnership. R29: That‚Äôs amazing ‚Äî talk about stars aligning! Do you remember the shade? AN: The red that I wore in my headshot is the shade No Regrets. I deliberately did that because in the STEM world, you‚Äôre either a scientist or engineer ‚Äî or you like makeup. It‚Äôs very separate categories, and I wanted to break those boundaries and show that you can do both and love both. R29: Amanda, is there anything else about working on this e.l.f. partnership or anything about your career that you want to share with us? AN: One of the comments that I get often, which was kind of unexpected, was from survivors who had come up to me and said, ‚ÄúHey, thank you for showing up the way that you do. Thank you for wearing lipstick.‚Äù I hadn‚Äôt thought about that before [until] it kept coming up. Sexual violence is inherently about taking away power from our own body and being able to feel like ourselves again [through makeup] is so empowering. And so it was such a moment of solidarity that these survivors came up to me and expressed that they felt community because of a choice that I made with my makeup.¬† Makeup and beauty are so often trivialized or considered frivolous, when it‚Äôs the furthest thing from that. In these conversations with other survivors, [I‚Äôve learned] it‚Äôs these choices that we make about how to heal ourselves, which are the things of joy. Lipstick brings me joy. That‚Äôs actually a radical act of healing. The most radical act of rebellion is joy. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/snail-mucin-skin-care-49298614",
    "description": "If you've spent any time on SkinTok or K-BeautyTok recently, we're sure you've heard about snail mucin. Yes, you read that right - snail mucin, also known as snail slime, is getting quite a bit of buzz for its multitude of skin-care benefits, from hydration to boosting collagen production. But snail mucin isn't a new skin-care ingredient by any means. According to board-certified dermatologist Ava Shamban, MD, it became a commercial skin-care trend as early as the 1980s, as snail farmers, working day in and day out for years touching the secretion, had unusually hydrated, supple, and more youthful-looking hands compared to their dermal profile. Snail mucin is said to date back to ancient Greece, where they used the mucus for its ability to decrease inflammation and lessen the signs of aging. Ahead, two board-certified dermatologists explain everything you need to know about snail mucin: what it is, how it works, its benefits for the skin, and how to incorporate it into your skin-care routine. Experts Featured in This Article Ava Shamban, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Ava MD Cosmetic Dermatology Clinic in Los Angeles. Jodi LoGerfo, DNP, APRN, FNP-C, is a board-certified dermatologist located in New York. What Is Snail Mucin, and Where Does It Come From? \"Snail mucin is a natural and very potent super secretion or by-product from the mollusks that are composed of proteins, peptides, and proteoglycans,\" Dr. Shamban says. For those who want a visual, it is the clear, shiny, mucus-like trail snails leave behind, which is used to protect themselves. \"Its enzymes can act as a natural exfoliant and brightening agent. It also triggers keratinocytes to help protect the skin from UV damage, maintain adequate skin hydration, and increase our antimicrobial function,\" adds Dr. Shamban. While there are different types of snail mucin, the most common variety used for skin care comes from a specific species, Cryptomphalus aspersa. This type has regenerative properties for wound healing and cell proliferation of fibroblasts for elasticity and antiaging, Dr. Shamban explains. Snail Mucin Benefits For Skin There are a multitude of benefits from snail mucin when applied topically to the skin. \"It can be effective when used on wrinkles, burns, stretch marks, and overall skin moisture,\" says board-certified dermatologist Jodi LoGerfo, DNP, APRN, FNP-C. \"This is due to its ability to promote collagen production, as it's packed with antioxidants.\" Additionally, she explains that snail mucin has been touted to hydrate the skin, strengthening its moisture barrier. Snail mucin may also be effective as an antiaging treatment, lessening the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. And if that's not enough to convince you to add it to your routine, snail mucin has antibacterial, anti-tumor, and wound-healing properties. \"Its anti-tumor properties might protect the skin against skin cancer, particularly melanoma,\" says Dr. LoGerfo, referring to a 2018 study published by Biomedicine \u0026 Pharmacotherapy, which found the substance may have therapeutic potential against the deadline skin cancer. Dr. LoGerfo adds, \"The wound-healing properties are probably due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory attributes.\" However, more research is needed to further support these claims, and its full potential remains to be seen. How to Use Snail Mucin When scanning beauty labels, you may see the ingredient listed as \"snail secretion filtrate,\" or the initials \"SSF\" for short. \"It can be very minimal in some products or in high concentrations in others,\" Dr. Shamban says. It's noncomedogenic, and with its multifunctionality, it can be used in a variety of ways, from a cleanser to an essence or serum, in a liquid or ampoule format. One of the most popular snail mucin products is the CosRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence. It can also be found as an ingredient in a fluid lotion or a heavier lipid cream or mask. Because snail mucin is gentle, it should slot easily into your routine, pairing well with active ingredients like retinoids, salicylic acid, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, AHAs, and BHAs, according to Dr. Shamban. Both derms agree that snail mucin seems to be suited for all skin types and should be generally well-tolerated without issue. However, Dr. LoGerfo says that it would probably benefit dry skin the most. If you are on Accutane, you should discuss it with your dermatology provider before trying it, and similarly, if you are pregnant or nursing, you should check with your primary care physician. \"For all patients, patch testing or seeing your board-certified dermatologist is always recommended when trying a new ingredient, brand, or product,\" says Dr. Shamban.

    "description": "When I was 11, I wanted bigger breasts - at least, I thought I did. From an early age, the truth of what I wanted was muddled by what it seemed like other people wanted: large breasts and a thin body, an ideal defined by men and embraced by many women. I didn't have long to wait: I was a C cup by 13, a D cup by the end of high school, and when I finally got fitted by a professional in college, a 30G. Large breasts were currency in the '90s and 2000s, when I first became aware of myself as a sexual being. Pamela Anderson, Carmen Electra, and Jennifer Love Hewitt were aspirational. Boys in junior high talked about \"big\" girls in a reverential tone. Large breasts meant power, in a world where young girls didn't often get much. Large breasts might mean power, but they made life hard. Large breasts might mean power, but they made life hard. I thought about my breasts a lot; it was unavoidable. When you have a small rib cage and a large cup size, you can't waltz into Target and pick up a bralette - or any bra at all. Throughout my 20s, I became deeply familiar with bras you could only find online or in specialty stores, matronly swimsuits, and expensive visits to a tailor. I massaged the angry red grooves in my shoulders, wiped the underboob sweat that cast a damp shadow over my favorite season, and cried in dressing rooms. By the time I started considering a breast reduction, I was a long way from sixth grade; I didn't want to contribute to a world where women get treated better because they met arbitrary, sexist standards. No one close to me believed in those standards: My husband, friends, and family were in favor of anything that improved my life. But when I thought seriously about undergoing the surgery, I hesitated. Ignoring intense cultural messaging about what's considered attractive takes a will of steel I didn't always have. Instead, I told myself I'd think about a reduction after I had a child. I hesitated because I didn't hate my breasts - sometimes I liked them. I didn't have gender dysphoria. Bra and shirt options were better now (shout out to Wildfang, the best button-down maker in the game). While not wrong, these were red herrings distracting me from the truth of my apprehension: I wanted to feel pretty and powerful, and I'd internalized the misogynist idea that larger breasts meant that. At 35, I had my daughter and weaned her. I was finally starting to trust my feelings about my body; having a child made me more in touch with it than ever. I spent a lot of time researching reductions, reading thread after thread on r/Reduction and trusted medical websites. At a Korean spa, a close friend who'd had a reduction showed me her new breasts; she looked great, and I knew the scars wouldn't bother me. Another close friend gave me a recommendation for a surgeon. So my husband and I met with an eerily unflappable man who did this for a living, our toddler daughter in tow. He listened carefully, answered my questions respectfully, and gave me a recommendation for a new cup size, then added, \"But I'll do whatever you want. You tell me.\" My surgeon's perfectly neutral, mildly uncanny demeanor removed him from the equation - it forced me to confront myself. What did I actually want? I wanted my back to hurt less. I wanted to stop buying $80 sports bras designed by NASA because my breasts needed space-age technology to hold them up. I wanted what most people want - to move through the world with ease. Despite all this, I told myself I didn't hate my breasts enough to get a reduction. The pros vastly outnumbered the nebulous and unconfirmed \"people might find me less attractive.\" Eventually, the truth trumped the sexist ideas I had internalized. It wasn't easy; they run deep, and sometimes you don't know you have them until you do some digging. My journey of acceptance wasn't linear but looked something like this: I stared at myself in the mirror and realized that while I didn't hate what I saw, I wasn't particularly attached to it, either. Big breasts were not key to my identity. I made a list of pros and cons, and the pros vastly outnumbered the nebulous and unconfirmed \"people might find me less attractive.\" I drew on a trick I learned in therapy: Take your insecurities and imagine someone you don't respect saying them. I picked Luke in junior high, who thought St. Paul, MN, was the coolest city in the United States (also the only city he'd ever been to, because he grew up there) and called me homophobic slurs in the hallway. Now, I imagined him questioning my decision to get a breast reduction: \"You'll be less hot with a breast reduction.\" \"You've gained weight so your boobs will stick out farther than your stomach. No one likes that.\" \"Why would you do that to yourself?\" It worked. It worked really, really well. If Luke and his adult counterparts thought I was making myself less attractive, I didn't care. The idea of caring felt absurd; I was my own person, not a reflection of someone else's desires. I went into surgery as calm as you can be going into surgery. On the drive home, my chest felt so light, I cried happy tears. Breast reductions have one of the highest rates of satisfaction, and I am no exception. I love my 32Ds and the improved quality of life they bring: I love how I look and how I feel. Going for my first post-surgery run was a revelation, the first of many: slipping on a dress without worrying about how the top part would fit. Taking my bra off at the end of the day, something I'd heard other women talk about but never understood, because my breasts were so heavy it wasn't actually comfortable. Being able to buy any bra I wanted. Moments like that remind me that patriarchal beauty standards are ever-changing and never real, but my happiness is. It's real, and it's spectacular.
