    "description": "From The Hair Bros to Charlotte Mensah’s Hairlounge, London is home to some truly excellent hair salons — something that becomes especially evident at London Fashion Week when the city’s most stylish descend on the streets. Last season, we spotted street stylers with choppy bobs, mid-length chops, and long layers aplenty. This time around, the cuts are proving just as cool and effortless. Whether you’re keen for a total hair refresh or prefer something subtle, let the best haircut trends from London Fashion Week street style inspire you. All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

This style boasts a textured fringe and edges for an accidentally perfect finish. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The best way to show off curls and ringlets? A towering updo, of course.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Brushed-out natural textures are reigning supreme on and off the catwalk this season. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Introducing the “mixie” — a mullet and pixie hybrid. “It’s essentially an outgrown pixie with soft edges around the hairline,” Anita Rice, hairstylist and cofounder of Buller + Rice told R29 recently. “The length at the back can be kept longer to create a wolf cut variation,” she added.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Speaking of the “wolf” cut, this style features choppy layers, flicked-out ends, and a textured fringe.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hairstylists predicted that the modern curly mullet would dominate 2025 — and it seems they were right. We’re obsessed with the chocolate cherry color here, too. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The micro fringe, sharp blunt ends, and painterly auburn highlights made a statement this weekend.Photographed by Emma Rahmani.These “bottleneck” bangs, essentially a fringe that occupies a cozy space between a curtain fringe and a fuller fringe, complement this guest’s layered, mid-length cut perfectly. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Isabella Charlotta Poppius showcases how face-framing layers and caramel highlights can add dimension and elegance to long hair. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Mid-length styles are back. These curly micro braids spotted on a guest this weekend are beautiful. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Ask your hairstylist for “invisible” layers — a subtle cutting technique that adds volume and movement without compromising length.

The choppy fringe and ‘90s highlights are the cherry on top of this unique style. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The beveled bob is so back. It’s a sharp jaw-length cut tucked under either using a straightener (try ghd Chronos Max, $349) or a heated round brush. It’s the ultimate style to pair with an oversized collar. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.Hip-grazing goddess braids were spotted at New York Fashion Week — and now in London. If you want to head in the complete opposite direction, consider the goddess braid bob. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.The “mod” bob, the “mushroom” bob, the bowl cut… Whatever you call this spherical style, there’s an air of the ‘60s to it — but the slightly parted, straight-across fringe lends this particular chop a modern edge. Photographed by Emma Rahmani.This is picture proof that side fringes are versatile.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. While nail trends come and go, certain manicures never look dated — and the French manicure is one of them. Classic, minimal, and undeniably timeless, there’s nothing like that combination of white tips and a nude base for an instantly polished nail look. However, if you love a pared-back manicure but find the humble French mani slightly, well, basic, then you might be interested in its latest iteration. Enter: the tinted French manicure. Also known as the “French glow”, this trending manicure features all the trademarks of a classic French (polished tips and a neutral base) but with an extra dose of shine. Celebrity nail technician Harriet Westmoreland has made the look something of a trademark this year with her “pink glow Frenchie” being shared all over social media — and prompting plenty of people to take on the trend themselves. Think soap nails meets French tips; it’s a clean and juicy nail look that’s perfect for spring. Trust me when I say that you’re about to see the tinted French manicure everywhere.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) What is the tinted French manicure? At first glance, the tinted French or “French glow” manicure looks incredibly similar to its classic predecessor. But the focus here is on the shine, which adds an almost jelly-like glow to the nails. “The French glow is designed to enhance your natural nail color, lend a super glossy effect, and create the illusion of perfected nails finished with a French tip,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. While similar to the natural nail tints that have been popular over the last year, Streets points out that the tinted French differs slightly: “It mimics a refined French look, whereas nail tints provide just a delicate hint of color,” says Streets. Another key factor that sets the tinted French apart from the original is the tip. Rather than a stark white tip, many nail artists are opting for more sheer, milky whites that give the tinted French a softer and more contemporary-looking result. As for the base color? “Use a sheer, milky, or pink-toned polish to create a soft, healthy glow and a ‘your nails but better’ finish,” says Streets. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shauna (@nailsdonewright) How do you achieve the tinted French manicure at home? While a visit to the nail salon is always a joy, Streets says the tinted French manicure is easy to DIY at home: “It’s a quick way to get nails looking chic and groomed with few products,” Streets says. She adds that you can recreate this trend by using a nail glow product alone for great results. The Dior Vernis Nail Glow, $32, works by brightening and reviving the natural color of your nails, so both your tips and nail base will look more vibrant and polished after just one coat.  If you have more time, Streets recommends prepping for your manicure. “Ensure the nail surface is clean, shaped, and buffed so that color application will be smooth and even,” she says. Next, apply two thin coats of your chosen nail glow color. We rate Zoya Naked Manicure Perfector, $12, and Londontown Sheer Strength Nail Blush, $20. Then use a fine liner brush to apply the milky tip. Manucurist’s Green Nail Polish in Milky White, $19, is the perfect creamy hue. “Follow the natural shape of your nail tip to create the French tip detail and add a top coat for added resilience,” explains Streets. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Chels Lou (@chelslounails) How long does the tinted French manicure last? Besides being such a versatile nail look, one of the best things about a tinted French manicure is that you won’t have to rush to redo your nails. “It’s the ultimate low-maintenance manicure,” says Streets. “Choosing a natural base color or nail tint is much longer-lasting than brighter or darker hues, as the regrowth is almost imperceptible. Adding a long-wear top coat like Essie Stay Longer Top Coat, $11, also reduces the chances of that carefully applied French tip chipping away. It’s a polished look that sticks around.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/unsexy-beauty-products-49362561",
    "description": "There's a new trend sweeping Beauty TikTok where users reveal the \"unsexy\" beauty products in their routines that work like a charm. From body oils to tongue scrapers and everything in between, people are raiding their bathroom shelves to talk about all of the items they swear by but wouldn't necessarily take a shelfie of. These items are effective and get the job done - they just don't have the cutest packaging or Instagrammable results. As editors, we get to try products that run the gamut from dirt cheap to extremely expensive. Due to the nature of our roles, it's our duty to try everything with a neutral lens and report back on whether they work. While we love aesthetically pleasing bottles and pretty formulas that make us want to snap a picture, sometimes the best products are the ones that just work – sans any other bells and whistles. What's \"unsexy\" about a product can mean different things to different people. For some, it's the packaging that it comes in; for others, it can be what the item is used for. Still, the unifying quality of all of these items is that they deliver incredible results regardless of all that. As such, we've decided to share our favorite unsexy beauty products that we can't live without and would recommend in a heartbeat. Our obsessions range from products like Aquaphor Healing Ointment to First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - there are truly all kinds of options. From deodorant to dandruff shampoo, keep reading for the items we always keep in stock (and hidden within our medicine cabinets).",
