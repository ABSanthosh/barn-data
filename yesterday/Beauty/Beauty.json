If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Amazon is a treasure trove of affordable beauty, but until very recently, there was one major brand that you couldn’t find on the pages upon pages of products: The Ordinary. Sure, you may occasionally stumble upon listings of some of the brand’s most viral hits — like the ruby-red AHA peel or glycolic acid toner. At best, these were questionable purchases since Amazon wasn’t yet an authorized retailer of the brand.  But that’s all in the past now, thanks to recent news that The Ordinary has finally opened its official Amazon storefront for business. (In other words, you can finally restock your hyaluronic acid serum and toilet paper in the same order.) From cleansers and toners to serums, the entire lineup is available to shop now, but since that’s a lot of skincare products to comb through, we consulted some of the most discerning skincare customers we know — our staffers — to find out which The Ordinary products they’re most excited to add to their Prime hauls. Shop them all below.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Saccharomyces Ferment 30% Milky Toner, $14 “This milky exfoliating toner has been my go-to ever since I got an early bottle on a trip to The Ordinary’s HQ last January. It’s gentle enough that I use it morning and night (with SPF during the day, of course) as a first step after cleansing, and I swear my skin has never looked brighter and smoother. This innovative formula — a first for the brand — boasts an impressive 30% concentration of saccharomyces ferment, an ingredient derived from mushrooms that brightens and refines texture without irritation. Everything about this product — from the innovative ingredients and the frosted glass bottle to the sophisticated texture — screams luxury, but it only costs $14. And that’s on periodt!” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Retinal 0.2% Emulsion, $14.90 “Retinols have always been hit or miss for me — either they irritate me or do nothing, depending on the formula’s concentration — but this one from The Ordinary left me thoroughly impressed. For starters, it didn’t cause the dreaded “retinol uglies” (aka the dry, flaky patches that can sometimes be experienced in the first days of retinol use), but I still saw results within a few weeks. If you ask me, the secret is that it’s powered by retinal (sometimes referred to as retinaldehyde), a supercharged form of vitamin A that delivers the same results you’d get from a conventional retinol but in a fraction of the time. At $15, it’s a total steal — not that you’d ever know it, based on how glowy your skin will look after using it.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Ascorbyl Glucoside 12% Solution, $14.80 “My skin notoriously hates vitamin C. Most formulas — especially if they contain L-ascorbic acid, aka pure vitamin C — leave it red, irritated, and painfully angry. But ascorbyl glycoside is different. It’s the one vitamin C derivative my skin actually laps up, and The Ordinary’s Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12% has impressed me so much. There’s no stinging or flushing, just a serious glow boost. It evens out my skin tone (often marked by hyperpigmentation, thanks to the odd hormonal breakout) and smooths my texture. I’m always so surprised by how much of a difference one product can make. I’m on my third bottle already, and I owe my dermatologist for the recommendation.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director GF 15% Solution, $15.50 “The Ordinary’s GF 15% Solution has officially replaced my Botox obsession. The star ingredients are growth factors, a type of peptide or protein that stimulates skin cell production over time to smooth fine lines and improve firmness. While the texture is watery, don’t be fooled — this stuff means business. It has plumped up my skin like nothing else, making it look fresher and bouncier. I’m convinced it has filled out the file lines on my forehead and underneath my eyes. I’m already on my second bottle, and I don’t see myself stopping anytime soon.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Glycolipid Cream Cleanser, $12.50 “I go through The Ordinary’s Glycolipid Cream Cleanser like nothing else, it’s that good. Gentle on skin prone to redness and irritation, yet powerful enough to cut through makeup and sunscreen with zero effort, it leaves my skin feeling soft and comfortable, never tight or parched. It’s so effective that just one cleanse in the evening does the job perfectly. My partner, who has oily, acne-prone skin, is just as obsessed. So much so that they keep stealing it. Honestly, we fight over it!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Multi-Peptide + HA, $19.90 “In 2025, we’re well aware that peptides are great for skin, but The Ordinary was ahead of the times with this 2016 launch. In case you need a refresher, peptides are short chains of amino acids that act as building blocks for proteins like collagen and elastin. Including peptides in your skincare routine can help to keep your skin feeling firm, bouncy, and hydrated. Combine them with hydrating hero hyaluronic acid, and you have an instant recipe for deliciously dewy, healthy-looking skin. I use this whenever my skin feels irritated and stressed — it just helps to boost my skin barrier, hydrating, and calming my complexion right down. I also love the slightly tacky texture, which sits perfectly under makeup.” — Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%, $14.80 “I live and die by this vitamin C serum. Not to be dramatic, it has transformed my skin. A few months ago, my skin was suffering despite all the fancy lotions and potions I was throwing at it (think dullness, stubborn dry patches, and strange little pimples along my jawline). Wanting to try something new, I decided to completely strip back my skincare routine — first to just a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF, and then to incorporating vitamin C. Enter: The Ordinary’s Ascorbyl Glucoside Solution 12%. After just a few weeks, my skin was totally transformed, becoming smooth and glowy. The texture evened, and old acne scars faded. This is one of my top desert island beauty products, for sure.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Has the reign of the slick-back bun finally come to an end? After spending multiple years as the It style of cool girls everywhere, it seems the tides have shifted. Celebrities are flocking to the ever-effortless and unfussy messy bun. At the Saint Laurent Womenswear Fall/Winter 2025-2026 show on March 11, 2025, not one, not two, but five A-listers put down their boar bristle brushes and hair gel and opted for a laidback, unpolished bun - including Hailey Bieber and Zoë Kravitz. The looks were complete with face-framing wisps and loose ends for that casually chic vibe. The allure and magic of the messy bun is nothing new; in fact, it's a downright classic and if you need any further convincing to add it to your updo style rotation, consider this it. It works for all hair types (including fine), is perfect for concealing dirty hair, has a place in all seasons (in the summer, it'll keep your hair off your neck; in the winter, it'll keep your hair from getting mangled by your turtleneck or scarf), and doesn't require a cosmetology degree to pull off. And really, if it's good enough for a royal like Meghan Markle and Pamela Anderson's iconic look, it's good enough for us. To get inspired for your own perfectly imperfect messy bun, keep scrolling.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/merit-great-skin-instant-glow-serum-review-49432521",
    "description": "I'm no rookie when it comes to getting ready for a first date. Trust me, I've navigated my fair share of those butterflies-in-stomach moments and pre-date rituals. But flying to another city for a date? And somehow managing to forget my entire makeup bag? That was definitely not in my dating playbook. The whole thing happened in that frantic blur of airport security lines and rushed packing. But here's the thing: even in my most scattered moments, my skin-care routine is sacred. As a beauty editor (and skin-care devotee), I'd sooner forget my phone than my holy grail products. And thank goodness for that because Merit Beauty's Great Skin Instant Glow Serum ($38) became my unexpected hero in this whole adventure. The application process was effortless; I applied two pumps of the golden elixir and gently patted it on my skin. I allowed it to fully absorb into my skin for about a minute before following up with moisturizer, ensuring maximum effectiveness. This simple yet powerful step completed my entire routine, leaving my face feeling pampered and protected. The Merit Beauty serum's positive effects must have been noticeable during my date, as he continuously complimented my skin. He was so impressed that he even asked me to accompany him to Sephora the next day to purchase it for himself. A win is definitely a win. For my full review of the Great Skin Instant Glow Serum, keep reading. About Merit Beauty's Great Skin Instant Glow Serum It's a bi-phase serum with a lightweight texture that plumps and hydrates the skin, addresses uneven skin tone, and adds a noticeable glow to your complexion. It's suitable for normal, dry, and combination skin types. It contains hyaluronic acid for hydration, niacinamide to brighten, and cacao seed extract for antioxidants. It's vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. What I Like About Merit Beauty's Great Skin Instant Glow Serum This serum is a sleek and chic multitasker that truly delivers on its promises. On days when I'm going makeup-free, I apply it underneath sunscreen to give me that coveted lit-from-within glow. It's become essential to my pre-makeup routine, serving as the base that ensures my foundation and other products melt seamlessly into my skin. It prevents that dreaded makeup mask effect. Instead of sitting heavily on the face, makeup melds with your natural complexion, creating that enviable your-skin-but-better finish. The serum's versatility in enhancing both bare-faced and full-glam days makes it a game-changer. The science behind its effectiveness lies in its powerful formulation: four types of hyaluronic acid are designed to deeply hydrate different skin layers, while niacinamide helps achieve an even, plump complexion. This combination of ingredients also gently smooths, hydrates, and brightens skin over time. How to Use Merit Beauty's Great Skin Instant Glow Serum Merit Beauty's approach to using the Great Skin Serum is refreshingly straightforward - a quick \"shake to wake\" activation, followed by two to three pumps that I pat evenly across my face. After testing different applications, I've found it works best as the third step in my routine, right after my core products but before moisturizer. This placement lets the formula absorb properly while complementing the rest of my skin-care lineup. What to Consider Before Trying Merit Beauty's Great Skin Instant Glow Serum The serum's texture is quite thin and watery, which may catch some off guard. After trying this serum for quite some time, I've found that its water-like texture is actually a blessing. Initially, I was worried it might be too thin, but it absorbs beautifully into my skin. I've learned through daily use to build up the layers if I need more coverage, but honestly, two to three pumps are sufficient. $38 might seem like a lot for a serum. But here's the thing: your skin is worth every penny. Trust me, when you use just the correct number of pumps (like recommended), you'll be amazed at how long this bottle lasts.
