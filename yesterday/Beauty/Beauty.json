If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I have a confession to make. While I extol the virtues of wearing SPF on a daily basis (yes, even in the winter), I haven’t always been so diligent about protecting my skin from the sun. These days, “cleanse, moisturize, sunscreen” is my skincare mantra but I’m beginning to notice the effects of all those years I spent (mostly inadvertently) collecting rays.  Besides a few broken capillaries around my nose, most of my sun damage — exacerbated by a nasty case of accidental forehead sunburn in a surprisingly hot Cyprus last October — presents as fine lines. Don’t get me wrong. Skin texture is entirely normal and lines and wrinkles are a usual part of aging. But if some of that texture is at least partly self-inflicted, is there a way to reverse it? You’re probably shouting “Botox!” at your screen, and while the skin-smoothing injectable has its merits (R29 is a totally judgement-free zone), I’m taking a break following a recent bad experience where my brows and eyelids drooped significantly. What’s more, my forehead was almost too smooth. I like to see some skin texture — that’s the key to natural-looking tweakments — and so I broke up with the stuff.  It seems I’m not the only one. Lots of my beauty editor peers are giving up expensive line-smoothing injections, opting instead for deeply hydrating skincare to plump their skin sans needles. Most notably, serums and moisturizers with one key ingredient: growth factors or GF.   What is GF — or growth factors — and what are the skincare benefits? Growth factors are a type of peptide, or protein, known to stimulate skin cell growth over time. They are often used to heal wounds but skincare brands have since found another use for them, namely boosting collagen and elastin — two things that are found naturally in our skin, giving it structure and suppleness. Collagen and elastin deplete as we age but sun exposure and other environmental aggressors like pollution can speed up the process, resulting in fine lines and skin laxity.  Growth factors are a relatively new innovation in the skincare world, so products that enlist them are typically eye-wateringly expensive. But you can always count on The Ordinary to democratize a buzzy ingredient. This week it launched GF 15% Solution, $15.50, a serum boasting three types of plant-based growth factors. The Ordinary GF 15% Solution, $15.50 What are epidermal growth factors? First up, EGF or epidermal growth factors. In a previous Refinery29 article, aesthetics practitioner Dr. Ioannis Liakas told us that epidermal growth factors promote cell growth on the epidermis, or outer layer of the skin, resulting in faster healing and better repair. “They are known to be gentler on the skin than retinols as they do not have the same flaking effects,” said Dr. Liakas. He added, “[Epidermal growth factors] can be used in the morning and evening, but [using them] in the evening will help to achieve optimal effects because this is when cellular turnover is at its highest healing peak.”  Besides epidermal growth factors, The Ordinary’s serum also features IGF or insulin-like growth factors, which research shows regenerate and repair damaged cells. Lastly, the serum boasts TGF or transforming growth factors. Studies suggest these can stimulate collagen production and reduce inflammation or redness.  Is The Ordinary’s GF 15% Solution any good? With science out of the way, this serum is The Ordinary’s first foray into growth factors. Intrigued, I incorporated it into my skincare routine as soon as I received it in November, layering it underneath a simple moisturizer after cleansing in the evening, and the same in the morning — always following with sunscreen.  I have to get one gripe out of the way first: The texture is watery — more akin to a toner than any serum I’m used to — but that means it absorbs quickly and without leaving behind any tackiness. As such, I wouldn’t recommend putting the dropper to your face à la TikTok’s skincare enthusiasts; the serum will just roll off. Instead, I like to squeeze a pipette-full into the palm of my hand and pat it gently into my skin. I used the serum every day for over a month and I noticed a difference in my skin texture almost immediately. It appeared smoother and more taut, as though I’d applied a blurring makeup primer. I spotted the biggest change in the fine lines across my forehead after three weeks, especially when wearing makeup; it was like they’d been ironed out. Impressive. Don’t just take my word for it, though. Refinery29 senior writer Karina Hoshikawa is equally enamored with the product: “Growth factors in skincare have been quietly trending for quite some time now, and I’ll admit that they sounded a bit too good to be true — also, very expensive,” she says. “But because I will happily try anything The Ordinary releases, I eagerly began testing its new GF 15% Solution as soon as I got an early bottle during the brand’s activation at Miami’s Art Basel in early December.” Karina continues: “Thanks to good genes and regular sunscreen use, I still get asked for ID every time I buy wine (I’m 31), but I definitely want to keep my skin looking as healthy as possible for as long as possible. I started getting Botox this year, and have to say that I’m a novice when it comes to growth factors in my routine. That said, I was excited to incorporate GF 15% Solution as irregular tone and texture are my two primary skincare concerns. Right off the bat, I loved the lightweight texture of the serum; my skin readily drank it up. It felt super gentle on my skin and played well with my morning and nighttime routine.” Within two weeks of twice-daily use, Karina felt like her chronically dehydrated skin looked and felt plumper and more even overall. “I don’t really have wrinkles or fine lines but the rough texture I have on my forehead and cheeks was visibly diminished — almost as if they’d been filled in ever so slightly,” she says. “I was honestly blown away by the early results and can’t wait to see what my skin looks like after finishing my first bottle.” The firming and lifting effects reported in the brand’s clinical trials remain to be seen, adds Karina. “But if I continue to see improvement in my overall skin health and appearance, I’ll be extremely satisfied with the results.”  If you’re sold, there are a couple more things you should know. While this didn’t irritate mine or Karina’s skin in any way, The Ordinary advises against using it in the same skincare routine as vitamin C and exfoliating acids like glycolic, lactic and salicylic acids. These potent ingredients are said to break down the growth factors, potentially rendering them ineffective. In other words, it’s money down the drain.  When it comes to things like fine lines, prevention is infinitely better than cure. I really enjoyed using this serum but investing in a high factor, broad spectrum sunscreen that protects against UVA (rays responsible for premature aging and skin cancer) and UVB (which causes sunburn) is also key.  Lastly, Karina points out that growth factors tend to be synonymous with triple-digit prices. “The Ordinary’s innovative formula retails for $15.50, so it’s truly a game-changer in democratizing cutting-edge skincare for all,” she says — and I agree. Having recently tried a $148 skin-smoothing serum which promised similar results, I can firmly say that GF 15% Solution is just as effective (especially when teamed with sunscreen) — and a snip of the price, too.

    "title": "16 Hair Color Trends That’ll Take Over Salons This Year, According To Experts",
    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-color-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "If your New Year’s resolution is to be braver, let top hair colorists lead the way. This January and beyond, you can expect an abundance of both striking and totally wearable hair color trends to infiltrate salons.  From mocha mousse (which takes its cue from Pantone’s Color of the Year for 2025) to amber blonde (a more muted take on the bold copper tones that dominated previous months), there’s something for everyone — whether you’re willing to put in the work to maintain your chosen hue or you’re a shampoo-and-go kind of person. DashDividers_1_500x100 Microlights View this post on Instagram A post shared by Ayesha Marr (@ayeshamarr) This year, blonde hair trends are going to be more natural and lived in, reports Nina Brown, senior colorist at Neil Moodie Studio — and they’ll take inspiration from no-makeup makeup. “This is achieved by a very subtle balayage technique [known as] babylights,” which are highlights on very thin strands of hair. “It’s like no-color color,” says Brown, “and the tones are moving more towards honey and strawberry blonde vibes.” This color on Ayesha Marr by BLEACH London is beautiful.  Airy Lights View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amelia Swaby (@ameliaswaby) Imagined by celebrity colorists Zoë Irwin and Nicola Clarke at John Frieda, airy lights are essentially teeny tiny blonde highlights that are dotted along both sides of the [hair part] and carefully laid over a darker tone for contrast, as seen on model Amelia Swaby. “These micro lights are really super fine,” says Irwin, “and the deepness underneath is important.” This means that it doesn’t look “manufactured”, says Clarke. “Instead, it’s so natural that it’s like [the highlights] are growing out of the scalp [as individual hair strands].” Depending on the shade of blonde, airy lights have many nuances, which leads us nicely onto the next trend… Oat Cendré View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) The French word “cendré” translates into English as “bonfire ashes” — a mix of grey and black tones. Oat cendré, then, is essentially a mix of ash blonde and creamy, oat milky tones. Look to this shade by Ryenne Snow. “This trend is all to do with the rise of the super natural, mid-blonde hue,” says Irwin, “and again, deeper tones lie underneath it.” Both Clarke and Irwin reference Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence.  Taupe Cendré View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sophia Karayiannis (@colourbyfie) The last hair color trend in the airy lights dynasty is taupe cendré — a dark blonde shade better suited to brunettes, like this color on digital creator Issy Sedgwick by Sophia Karayiannis. “There has been a surge in mid or ‘mousy’ blonde,” says Irwin, “but we prefer to call it taupe cendré [thanks to the] beige-y ash tones within this color.” When painting taupe airy lights onto darker hair, Clarke and Irwin never take the color all the way to the root. Stopping just short of the hair part lends a halo effect, says Clarke, as though there’s a ring light above your head.  Monobrown View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✨⛓ 𝔎𝔞𝔱𝔱𝔶𝔞 𝔐𝔞𝔯𝔠𝔢𝔩𝔞 ℌ𝔢𝔯𝔫𝔞𝔫𝔡𝔢𝔷 ⛓✨ (@dreamhairbycelaa) Tom Smith, a hairstylist and trend forecaster, notes that in the latter half of 2024, many of us ditched the lighter tones and went brunette. Take smoky brunette and candlelit brunette, for example. “There were lots of slightly different tones of deep brunette,” says Smith. “Some warmer, some more neutral and cooler, but the characteristic that they all share is that monochromatic finish.”  Enter: monobrown, a one-dimensional brunette color in its “most authentic” form rather than with heaps of highlights or lowlights. “[Monobrown is] very much a focus on healthy, glossy, monochromatic brunette,” says Smith. Look to this shade on a client of colorist and stylist Kattya Marcela Hernandez. Russet Red View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) Zoe Adams, international artist at Taylor Taylor London, says that while copper has long been a staple for autumn and winter, the salon demand has never been so high. “We’re seeing a full embrace of coppers, auburns and reds in the salon this season — and I see no sign of this trend slowing down into 2025.” Besides the diluted strawberry blonde hue as seen on Emma Stone at this year’s Golden Globes, Adams predicts that russet — a matte red erring on brown — will also take hold. “Our colorists are mixing softer, cooler tones into copper; you want to avoid anything veering towards orange.” Take inspiration from this shade on a client of Ryenne Snow.  Amber Blonde View this post on Instagram A post shared by Z (@_zfemi) If the above is a little too bold for your liking, consider a more muted shade like amber blonde, composed of similar auburn undertones. “We’ll continue to see warm blondes triumph over icy tones in 2025,” says Siobhan Haug, cofounder of Haug London Haus. “This premium blonde blends honey, gold and a touch of auburn for a long-lasting, luminous tone,” says Haug. “It’s perfect for anyone who wants to stay lighter for winter but needs a break from bleaching.” Haug suggests asking your colorist for a glossing toner over blonde highlights or an all-over blonde color. We love this shade on makeup artist and model Z.  Sunflower Blonde View this post on Instagram A post shared by Blonding Specialist Albuquerque (@hair_by_michellel) Smith recalls a time when gold and yellow tones were dismissed in salons. “They were characteristic of a badly done blonde,” he says. “But when you intentionally add golden tones into the hair, it has a very healthy, shiny, glowy and vibrant effect.”  Sunflower blonde is as warm and intense as blonde can be before it tips into strawberry blonde or copper territory, says Smith, like this shade by blonde specialist Michelle. Vibro-Reds  View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) “Hyper pigments like these tend to have a bad rap,” says Irwin, not least because they’re difficult to get rid of if you happen to change your mind — especially if you want to go lighter. She continues, “Actually, though, these reds can be super high fashion. Think Chappell Roan.” Clarke agrees: “Vibro-red is almost ‘80s-inspired with a mix of both copper and red.” Check out this shade on another client of hair artist Ryenne Snow.  Not So Boring Beige View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hairstylist ✂️ (@hairbyalyssaa_) Far from bland, beige is shaping up to be a big trend in 2025, says Caroline Spencer, senior color director at House of Sassoon, adding, “It offers a versatile and chic aesthetic that complements a range of skin tones.” Spencer points out that the trend’s popularity has been reflected on multiple runways, most notably Chloé AW24. Even Pantone’s Color of the Year — mocha mousse — takes a cue. “Whether it’s a light champagne beige or a rich chocolate beige, the adaptability of beige tones allows you to customize the look to suit your personal style and base color,” says Spencer. We love this shade posted to Instagram by hairstylist Alyssa. Iced Chocolate View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧✧ 𝕽𝖄𝕰𝕹𝕹𝕰 𝕾𝕹𝕺𝖂 ✧✧ (@ryennesnow.hair) Beige doesn’t always mean blonde. Spencer predicts we’ll spot the tone mixed into rich chocolate shades to create a dusty brunette hue that suits all skin tones, much like this color on Ryenne Snow.  Milk Tea View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jonny salon (@jonny_salon) Following on from beige, searches for “milk tea hair color” are on the rise this month, but your colorist will know it as dark ash blonde. This shade posted to Instagram by Jonny Salon illustrates the trend perfectly. Invest in a nourishing hair oil to enhance shine, like Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Huile Originale Hair Oil, $46. Bleach Dipping View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amira (@amira.locs) Rope twists, locs and twist-outs are the perfect styles for “bleach dipping”, say Irwin and Clarke, essentially dipped blonde ends. When you have bleached pieces like this, you can change the color really easily with a hair gloss or a temporary dye if you want to have fun and switch things up. Take inspo from Amira on Instagram. Heritage Blonde View this post on Instagram A post shared by Live True London Salons (@livetruelondon) “Heritage blonde is not just cool in tone but also in [attitude],” says Smith. “[Compared to sunflower blonde], it’s more understated and relaxed.” It consists of various neutral tones woven into the hair almost like tweed. “When it comes to heritage blonde, you can’t see the story of where the color begins and ends,” says Smith. “It’s much more fluid and blended, and it doesn’t necessarily look like it’s been freshly done — nor does it look like it’s grown out. It’s definitely dirtier and more antique-looking,” hence the word “heritage”. It’s perfect for those who like low-maintenance hair color. Look to this shade by Sofia at Live True London Soho.  Terracopper View this post on Instagram A post shared by Michelle Thompson Hairstylist (@michellethompsonhair) Forget cowgirl copper. This year it’s all about terracopper — terracotta meets copper — which is earthier and deeper than traditional copper shades we’ve seen previously. “[This] winter, it’s getting even more vibrant,” says Smith. Take inspiration from this shade on Z, posted to Instagram by award-winning afro and textured hair specialist Michelle Thompson. “It’s not dark or really dense,” adds Smith. “It’s almost got a rose gold quality [to it] so it’s a really interesting shade, and it’s something that I think more people are going to be playing with.” It requires maintenance, though. Smith recommends investing in color-boosting conditioners or masks that contain red and copper tones to top up your hue. Try Moroccanoil Color Depositing Mask, $40.50, available in various shades. La Belle Bohème View this post on Instagram A post shared by PERTH BLONDE SPECIALIST SALON (@vivalablonde) The iconic photos of Kate Moss at Glastonbury festival serve as the ultimate inspiration behind the boho blonde hair color trend that flooded salons until recently. Fast-forward to 2025 and the shade has had a chic upgrade. “The blonde is more muted and sophisticated; it’s a fine lightness that only comes from the [hair part] section.” The hair is a lot deeper underneath, which makes it look luxe. “This lightness is almost like a veil on top,” says Clarke, much like this shade by Viva La Blonde.

    "description": "If there's one thing to know about me, it's that I love my treatments. I try the newest and most innovative skin care targeting everything from aging to melasma. I'm also never one to turn down a visit to my favorite aesthetician for a relaxing facial. But during the chilly months of the year, I like to treat myself to at-home facials and peels to save myself a trip in the cold. So, when I received the U Beauty Resurfacing Flash Peel ($188), I was extremely excited to try it. I believe in the brand's high-tech formulas and charity component* and heard that this peel delivers near-professional results. A chemical peel in a bottle that transforms your skin in the comfort of your own home? I couldn't pass up the chance to test it out. About U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel It's a first-of-its-kind rapid chemical exfoliator that delivers clinical-grade results after a few minutes of use. It removes dead surface skin quickly and gently without jeopardizing the skin's moisture barrier. There's minimal to no discomfort with usage. It visibly resurfaces the skin and restores moisture to the skin barrier, diminishing the look of pores, fine lines, and wrinkles. You can expect a brighter and smoother-looking complexion after just one use. It contains a form of retinol (retinyl palmitate) to promote cellular turnover. What I Like About U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel This peel's selling point is its pioneering chemical exfoliator that promises clinical-grade results in minutes. Intended to penetrate deep into the epidermis for extensive exfoliation, it aims to surpass a typical at-home peel. With most at-home chemical exfoliants that I have used, I've felt my skin stinging during application and for a few minutes after. I'm accustomed to post-use dry, red, and irritated skin. U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel, on the other hand, tingles for about a second on first contact (which means it's working!) but then quickly tapers off. It feels undetectable on your face and almost - dare I say it - soothing, which is strange considering it is an intense chemical exfoliant. After applying a chemical exfoliant, I usually follow with a barrier-boosting moisturizer, but with U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel, there was no need: My skin felt balanced, glowing, and refreshed. This effect can be attributed to the brand's sophisticated formula, which boasts capsules that deliver key vitamins (stabilized vitamins C and E) and nutrients into the skin, while AHAs, BHAs, and fruit acids gently slough away dead skin cells without compromising the skin's moisture barrier. It also helps to visibly boost the skin's restorative response, which is what gives it that healthy-looking glow. The addition of pro-vitamin B, aloe, and purified oat extract balances out the skin while protecting the skin from environmental stressors and transepidermal water loss (aka dehydration). How to Use U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel The peel is incredibly easy to use: Before use, cleanse your face with a gentle cleanser, avoiding any cleansers or exfoliants with active ingredients. Once your face is completely dry, take a masking brush to apply the peel evenly all over your face and neck. Avoid direct eye contact and placing the peel on any areas of the skin that are overly sensitive, dry, or flaky. The brand recommends wearing the peel for 510 minutes, depending on how much your skin can handle it. With regular once-a-week usage, the peel can be applied for up to 20 minutes. After you wash it off with lukewarm water, follow with your usual skin care - minus any actives - to ensure you won't experience irritation. It's still a chemical peel, after all. What to Consider Before Trying U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel If you have extremely sensitive skin, proceed with caution. Try a patch test of the product on your forearm or neck before you apply the peel. Also, consider the cost of the product and whether or not you will be a dedicated weekly user. Regular usage yields the most benefit for your money and the best possible results. Additionally, because the peel contains a form of retinol, if you are pregnant or nursing, consult your doctor before using. Is U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel Worth the Splurge? U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel is absolutely worth the splurge because of the unmatched at-home results. Though the product is pricey, with my experience of using the product consistently for the past four weeks, I believe it delivers similar results to those from a light, professional-grade chemical peel treatment, which is typically more expensive. With multiple uses, you can feasibly end up saving yourself not only a trip to your aesthetician or provider but money in the long run. Where Is U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel Available? U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel is available at UBEAUTY.com, Dermstore.com, Nordstrom.com, and VioletGrey.com.

    "description": "If there's one thing you take away about skin care, let it be to always wear sunscreen. That doesn't just mean on clear, sunny days, but on overcast days, in airplanes, on long car rides, and at home, too. \"With UV radiation attacking our skin every time we step outdoors - even indoors or near windows - sunscreen is the main line of defense we have to protect ourselves,\" dermatologist Sphoorthi Jinna, MD, who specializes in skin cancer and Mohs surgery, says. \"Our face, in particular, having typically no coverage, is one of the most vulnerable areas of our bodies. Facial sunscreen is extremely important to add to your daily regimen, both from an anti-aging and skin-cancer-prevention standpoint.\" That's not to say it's always easy to find a formula that works for you, especially if you have a sensitive or acne-prone skin type. According to Dr. Jinna, the skin-care industry has put a lot of effort into changing that, formulating face sunscreen that's \"efficient with high SPFs while making more elegant formulations than traditional body sunscreens.\" That means more lightweight textures that easily blend into skin, can be layered under makeup, or are tinted for a more elegant application for dark skin tones. The most important thing is to find a sunscreen you'll want to use every day. First, Dr. Jinna recommends using an SPF of 30 or higher with broad-spectrum protection \"so it covers different types of UV radiation that can cause skin cancers and premature aging,\" she says. Another thing to note is to apply the proper amount: \"Typically, it's recommended about a nickel-size dollop of sunscreen should cover the face, remembering the upper eyelids and neck as well.\" There are plenty of sunscreens on the market, and we've tried and tested hundreds over the years to help you pick the best formula for your specific needs. From chemical formulas to physical ones and even a hybrid option, we rounded up the best face sunscreens on the market. We made sure these passed our tests with elegant formulations ideal for your skin type and zero white cast for those with dark skin tones. Because Dr. Jinna also points out that \"sunscreen typically lasts 90-120 minutes, and therefore, it is important to reapply every two hours, especially when you are outdoors or in a vehicle exposed to sunlight all day,\" we even included a few options perfect for sunscreen reapplication, like a facial mist and makeup SPF. (Just make sure you use that as additional protection over normal sunscreen since Dr. Jinna says those are \"typically not enough coverage on their own.\") Whether you're looking for hydrating sunscreens, mattifying ones, or options for acne-prone or sensitive skin, find your perfect daily face sunscreen ahead.
