    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/black-natural-haircare-products-rituals-hair-oil?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "There’s a smell I lovingly associate with Black hair care: Dax hair pomade and Ultra Sheen’s “green grease”. I can’t explain exactly what the pots of luminous green pomade smell like but they remind me of sitting in between my mother’s legs on a cushion on the floor as she braided cornrows to my skull and smoothed the paste into my scalp. The old rituals of Black hair care can elicit a sense of nostalgia for those of us who grew up with hot combs heated on the stove, our hair being drenched in raw caster oil, and experiencing hair relaxers out of the box. I can’t look at a tub of Eco Styler gel without thinking of my teen years, slicking my fringe over my entire forehead and causing years of forehead acne. My hair care routines have changed considerably since the days of buying cheap imported hair products from high-street beauty supply stores. Upon the advice of modern curl specialists, I am trying to use my beloved raw hair oils far less and have reduced my wash days down to three products: clarifying shampoo, conditioner, and a styling product (currently I am using everything by Cécred). I try not to leave my weaves and protective styles in for too long (but I am still very guilty of this) and I have improved my relationship with heat. While I have been embracing some of the new rules of Black and natural hair care, including solely using products by modern Black hair brands (ditching some of the old faithful brands such as Green Grease in the process), I can’t help but think about the engrained Black hair and beauty techniques we seem to be unlearning. Is it for better or for worse? “Your hair was much better even when you were using Luster’s Pink moisturizer,” my mum told me recently, kissing her teeth with the ‘I told you so’ face mums do.“I’m telling you, the old ways are the best!” she laughed as she braided my hair for my next protective style covering me with caster oil to help regrow my damaged hair. I happily succumbed to the familiarity of glistening oily coils. Many of my friends and colleagues agree with my mum. There’s a fear amongst many young Black people—especially those living and working in Western countries—that we’re losing our hair and beauty methods or rather “recipes” (including our cooking skills, languages, and more) by embracing new modernized techniques, such as the divisive “no oils, no butters” wash day method, which rejects the use of heavy oils such as caster oil and coconut oil that has been used in Black hair care for generations. Popular curly hair specialists such as Acacia Breeze regularly face backlash from promoting their curly-cut techniques that move away from some of the practices that many of us have grown up with (even though the results of her clients and others are incredible). On the other hand, some natural hair creators, such as Youtuber StarPuppy,  have made public admissions claiming they are returning to what they say has always worked for the culture; clays, oils, butters, and more. The goalposts to what effective natural hair care should look like always seem to be moving; natural hair communities online go back and forth between ingredients they stand behind and the ones that they now demonize as “bad”. It’s hard to keep up. Whether cornrows and braids, bantu knots, loc-ing, press and curl and sew-in weaves and more, to have afro hair is to know and understand a very specific language of beauty that is entirely different to the practices of European and Asian hair. “It’s really trivial. Ultimately, you need to do what works for your hair, because trends can dictate what they like but the proof is always in the pudding,” says Jameila Donaldson, founder of wash day delivery service Treasure Tress. “If you’re having success with using oils, use oils.” Donaldson has published reports on the significant impact of Black women on total hair care spend and highlighted the importance of the Black Pound in the beauty market. Most recently, Donaldson partnered with Creme of Nature to examine why Black women have been overlooked in the fitness and lifestyle space. She understands the emotional connection between our hair and the products we choose to adorn it.  “It’s so divided at the moment,” Donaldson continues over a phone call. “There’s a camp that’s hypersensitive to ingredients, and then there’s another camp that’s like listen, if it works, I’m using it —even if the main ingredient is petroleum — and are happy to go with whatever has worked for them historically.” For curl specialist Serayna Eldridge, founder of Mancunian Bounce in the UK, encouraging a new and simplified approach to complicated wash day routines is part of her in-demand curl transformation process. “I tell a lot of my clients who are a bit dubious to try [new techniques] to just give me a year, just give me 12 months. And stick to that and see if your hair is better. And it’s always better because it is just a simplified routine.” “I am not a super fan of the recipes that people are making at home themselves [for their hair],” she adds over Zoom. “There’s not an understanding of the scalp side of hair care and the trichology [that goes into formulating a product]. Normally it’s like 20 different oils that they mix together that in my professional opinion, doesn’t work.” When I wrote the story, ‘Wait, Are We Not Supposed To Use Oils On Natural Hair?” back in 2023, I received a barrage of DMs slating me for abandoning my roots and culture. The debate even polarised Reddit, with one user writing, “ For thousands of years many Black people there seem to have had nothing against the use of clays and heavy, raw oils and butters in hair care (such as the ever popular Raw Shea Butter). Many Africans have been using all sorts of raw oils and butters and clays as part of their hair care for thousands of years with optimal results so what’s really tea?” Black folks across the diaspora have passed down a wealth of traditions and techniques to help us care for and adorn our unique hair texture — from the red clay hair masks of the Himba Tribe of Namibia to Madam CJ Walker’s hot comb. Whether cornrows and braids, bantu knots, loc-ing, press and curl and sew-in weaves, and more, to have afro hair is to know and understand a very specific language of beauty that is entirely different from the practices of European and Asian hair. Ingenuity and entrepreneurship in the Black hair space have helped radically transform how Black women living and working in Western countries understand our beauty, especially given we have long been ignored by European salons and brands. It’s an emotional subject for many of us, and I understand why some Black people resist letting go of our tried and true recipes. But is there a way to embrace the old with the new? “I wouldn’t tell mumsy to not use DAX [hair pomade],” says Eldridge. “Using Dax will probably be more about the nostalgia and it’s part of her identity. [The products you choose to use] is about assessing the situation and where your hair is at. If [a product] is part of you, it’s not breaking your hair,  it’s not damaging your scalp and there’s no side effects, then there’s no harm.” “I do think that texturism and the hair hierarchy that the hair typing system perpetuates has a lot to do with [the debate]” says Donaldson. “I just don’t think that we can make umbrella statements like ‘stop using butters and stop using oils’ when women have been using these for centuries and it’s been working for them. And equally, some people have stopped using [these ingredients] and they’ve figured out that their hair actually thrives without it. But ultimately, hair journeys are exactly that: a journey, and they’re so personal. You have to be wary of just following trends instead of paying attention to what actually works.” It’s clear that there’s a fine line between dissuading Black customers from the myths of Black hair care and completely disregarding the methods that have worked for generations. Both of the women I spoke to shared that their personal hair routines have evolved significantly over time but they still hold a nostalgic fondness for the routines and rituals they were taught in childhood. “As a child, we’d shampoo, blow dry, grease, get my hair conditioned and that was it, no maintenance whatsoever until the next wash. When I started researching hair care, the first thing I realized I had been missing out on was a good deep conditioning treatment,” shared Donaldson. “I remember my mum greasing my head with Vaseline,” laughs Eldridge. “And creaming my body and aiding cuts, and shine up the wheel on a car — it was multi-purposeful! But looking back, it was [because of a lack of] finances. Now me and a lot of my clients that come to me, we’ve got McDonald’s money now! So we’re looking to invest in [better products] now.”  “When I started simplifying my hair routine, my hair grew. Life was better,” adds Eldrige. “Every seven days, I cleanse it, I hydrate it, I use my stylers. And that is it for seven days.” On social media, there’s not just a divide between new and old-school products. There are clear divisions between new-school and old-school hair stylists and salons and the varied services they provide. In 2022, Unbothered wrote about the gradual return to traditional African braiders after multiple horror stories about Instagram hair stylists— from last-minute cancellations to charging extra for women with 4C hair. “My auntie braider has been holding me down — she doesn’t do trends but she will give you some good, small, neat braids,” says Donaldson. “But equally, I just feel like there’s no simple answer because as much as some people have a really hard time with Instagram stylists, there are girls who are extremely well educated. There are Instagram stylists that can do the trends and they also care about [ the health] of your hair.”  Donaldson adds: “Do they moisturize the ends of your hair? Do they know about traction alopecia? [African Braiders] may not be aware of these things and an Instagram stylist may so I just don’t think we can be that simplistic [to determine one is better than the other]. I think both of them have their strengths, but I think that the best stylists are definitely going to be the most well-rounded ones.” It’s clear that there’s a fine line between dissuading Black customers from the myths of Black hair care and completely disregarding the methods that have worked for generations. There isn’t a one-size-fits-all method. It’s also important to note that Black women have a legitimate distrust of major beauty conglomerates. Black hair and beauty products such as hair relaxers have been accused of being endocrine disrupters, increasing Black women’s risk of developing fibroids and uterine cancers. The sad reality is many of the brands and products we relied on were harming rather than helping us. It’s no wonder why many Black women are turning to traditional recipes and ingredients to feel secure. Nonetheless, the Black hair market is always evolving—and it should!—we want and need continued innovation in this space. This means also fighting for the opportunities we weren’t always afforded with mainstream hair products: real investment into safe and effective products, changing discriminative hair laws, and petitioning for afro hair types to be included in scientific research and product innovation. As momentum gathers (albeit slowly), some of the ways we did our hair will inevitably change — hopefully for the better.  This article was originally published to Unbothered UK. Like what you see?

    "title": "I Tried an AI Robot Massage - Here Are My Honest Thoughts",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/aescape-robot-massage-review-49400129",
    "description": "I first heard about Aescape, an AI-powered, fully automated massage, via a TikTok ad. I was immediately intrigued. Can a robot really deliver an effective massage? Where does the AI come in? After the ad appeared on my FYP several more times, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided I had to try the experience for myself. Aescape is currently being offered at select spas, massage studios, and Equinox locations in New York City and Miami. You don't have to be a member of the gym to book. Simply head to the Aescape location finder, select your preferred location, click through to book your preferred date and time, and pay the $60 to $75 fee. I tried it out at a nearby Equinox. Going in, I was cautiously optimistic, figuring it could very well be more novelty than recovery tool. And while I don't think Aescape can replace a traditional massage experience, I came away from my session a believer in the benefits of the robot massage. Here, my honest review. What Is Aescape's AI Robot Massage Like? When I arrived at Equinox to check in, they had me sign some paperwork, then handed me a pair of gray Aescape leggings and a long-sleeve workout top, which you're meant to wear during the massage, and directed me upstairs to the spa, where I got my first look at my robotic masseuse. The Aescape machine looks like a regular, albeit oversized, massage table. But by the head are two large, white robotic arms. Under the headrest, which has a cutout for your face, is an interactive screen that lets you control the massage, choose your pressure preferences, indicate when you love a certain technique, or pausing the massage if you need a break. The AI massage started with a body scan, and then the massage began. I have to admit, when I saw the reflection of those large robot arms descending toward my back in the touchscreen, I felt a moment of trepidation. The feeling intensified during the first few strokes. I kept thinking about HAL 9000, the murderous robot in \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\" What was keeping the Aescape arms from pushing just a little too hard, pinning me to the table, and refusing to let me up? I pushed those thoughts from my mind and tried to focus on the massage. The screen showed a timeline of the 30-minute session, including how much time it would spend on each area of your back, which I loved. As Aescape began to really dig into the knots and pressure points of my upper back, I relaxed for real. This was actually a really good massage. The Aescape arms were heated (to 95 degrees, according to the Aescape site), which helped me get over the images of cold, unfeeling robots that had flitted through my head. It was also able to replicate some aspects of a human massage, especially by altering its touch sensors (Aerpoints), using both flatter and pointed edges to deliver the feel of different hand, finger, or arm positions. At one point, I could have sworn it was an elbow leaning into my shoulder blade. The massage was very thorough, going over my upper, mid, and lower back as well as my glutes and hips. The strokes were deliberate and always felt completely on target - I never got the sense that the body scan had missed the mark and the robot was operating an inch away from its intended points. Per Aescape, the scan \"captures 1.2 million data points, precisely mapping your body's muscle structure to create a unique blueprint for a highly personalized massage experience.\" At one point, I moved my arm to my lower back. I wanted to check to make sure my shirt was still tucked in, and the massage immediately stopped, and the robot arms lifted clear off my body. A message on the screen let me know that the massage would only resume once I was back in safe positioning. Although I'd already forgotten my visions of HAL 9000, that made me feel extremely safe. When my 30 minutes were up, I felt loose and relaxed, the same way I feel after a great nail salon massage or foam rolling session. If I worked out in that Equinox regularly, I'd be hitting up Aescape after my tough workout days without fail. I bet the massage would feel amazing after a lifting or cardio session. What's Worth Noting About the Aescape AI Robot Massage The person who checked me in suggested sizing down in the Aescape workout set so it wouldn't lift up during the massage. I did, but the fabric still caught and pulled a bit during the massage, which was not uncomfortable but was distracting. I might have tried another size down, just to see if that reduced the friction. Aescape also doesn't yet offer a totally full body experience. My massage included the upper back, mid back, lower back, and glutes and hips. After experiencing how great the back massage was, I was dying for a really thorough neck massage, but the robot arms didn't venture into that territory or go south of the butt (although there are options that include the hamstrings). Would I Recommend the Aescape AI Robot Massage? I really would recommend a robot massage, especially as a quick and convenient recovery session after a workout. Do I think the robot massage will replace human massage, though? Not yet - although if they're ever able to deliver a truly full-body massage, they could definitely get close.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nano-brows-before-after-49400175",
    "description": "I've always had glorious eyebrows. Dark, full, glossy - really, my only complaint was that they had a bit of a Frida Kahlo vibe toward the middle. It was nothing some strategic tweezing couldn't handle. I'd also clean up the strays below the browline, but I was never one to overpluck. And yet one day in my 30s I looked at a photo of myself and realized my brows had sort of. . .disappeared. No longer dark nor bushy, they were now just sparse and gappy. I had no idea what happened. I got my thyroid checked. (Healthy, whew.) My derm prescribed Latisse. (It did nothing.) My friends and family reassured me that the brow loss was hardly noticeable. I appreciated their kind words, but my sad, sparse brows were all I saw when I looked in the mirror. So I learned to fill them in with brow products like powders and pencils and fiber gels. Every day, I'd wake up and draw on my brows; it didn't matter if I was going to the gym, the beach, on a hike. It felt very high-maintenance, but I refused to be seen without made-up arches. I considered microblading, but it seemed so permanent. What if I hated the shape? What if the color faded from dark brown to a weird purple color over time (like an old black T-shirt)? Also, I heard it hurts, and I'm allergic to pain. Plus, everyone had an opinion: \"It's like a bad tattoo on your face, why would you do that?\" \"Penciling in your brows is cheaper!\" And then there were my doom searches for \"microblading gone wrong\" - the results didn't exactly inspire confidence. But then I heard about the Nano Brow technique or nanoblading. As I quickly learned, there is no blade involved, and I was immediately intrigued. Keep reading to hear about my experience. Experts Featured in This Article Michelle Wu is a master therapist at Evertrue Salon. Nano Brow vs. Microblading The treatment is similar to microblading, in that pigment is deposited and absorbed into the top layer of your skin (the epidermis) in brush-like strokes. However, where a microblading specialist uses a tool with 14 tiny blades to manually apply the pigment, Nano Brow is done with an electric pen that holds a single needle. Because of this, there's less pain, less bleeding, more accuracy, and shorter downtime. Like microblading, Nano Brows treatments can be done on any skin color and in a shade that blends with any brow color. The single-needle accuracy also makes Nano Brow the treatment of choice for people who are prone to bleeding or have sensitive skin, or specific skin conditions such as oily skin, large pores, or laxity. The results look more \"crisp\" than microbladed brows, explains Michelle Wu, Master Therapist at Evertrue Salon (where I ended up). Crisp was fine, but I was really looking for \"no pain\" and \"accuracy,\" so this all seemed very promising. Results for both treatments are expected to last six to 18 months, but I was told Nano Brows could last as long as 24 months. (Fun tip: Don't use retinoids on treated brows, as topicals that increase cell turnover can make the pigment disappear faster.) How Much Do Nano Brows Cost? It's certainly not cheap. The treatment starts at $1,050, as compared to $650 for microblading. The time commitment aligns with the cost: Nano Brows can take two-and-a-half to three hours, while microblading takes one-and-a-half to two hours. The single blade may be more precise, but that also means the process is slower. There's also a common optional add-on for both treatments called \"microshading\" (roughly $200), which is a stipple-like process that adds definition and looks more like brow powder than individual hairs. For some people, adding on microshading is more of an aesthetic preference. But, for example, if you have dark brow hairs in some places but not others it can help even things out, visually. Ultimately, Nano Brows felt like it could be for me and I decided to try it. My Nanoblading Eyebrow Consultation I booked my consultation at EverTrue Salon in NYC and met with a senior specialist named May. She listened as I shared my tale of brow woes, paying close attention as I showed her photos from a few years back when my brows were still living their best Italian-American life, along with a pic from high school before I ever picked up a tweezer. She took a few \"before\" photos, then had me lie down so she could use a fine brow pencil to sketch out what my Nano Brows would look like. She drew tiny, hair-like strokes over the few brow hairs I had left, explaining what she was doing as she went. We agreed that my new brows should be closer together over my nose than they currently were, and that overall the shape should also be thicker (especially based on my old pictures). She suggested the tapered ends be just a bit higher than they naturally are; when I took a look at her finished results in the mirror, I agreed. Nano Brows Before and After Photos My brows looked great: dark, full, clean. And true to their natural state, they were not fully symmetrical. I've always known my brows were sisters not twins, and May honored that while making sure they still framed my face. She suggested that I also get microshading as an add-on in order to better integrate the bald (ugh) parts of my brows with the hairier areas. I was ready. I booked my three-hour Nano Brow appointment followed by a one-hour microshading chaser, and left happy and hopeful. The Nano Brow Treatment Four hours is a long time to lay on your back while someone messes with your face. I wasn't sure how I would tolerate it. But I dressed comfortably and brought a protein bar and water since May promised we could take breaks. She applied numbing gel to both brows for 20 minutes, then got to work. Since my eyes were closed the whole time, I can only tell you what I felt and heard. The Nano Brow pen sounded like a dentist's drill, which at first was high-pitched and annoying but quickly became neutral background noise. Thanks to the numbing gel, the electric needle pen carving hair-shaped slices over my brow bone felt like nothing more than a fingernail gently (yet repeatedly) dragging across my skin. The biggest sensation I felt during the entire session was the periodic pressure of May's gloved fingers wiping away excess ink. (Confession: at the moment, I totally feared it was blood and got a little panicky. Since I'm a people pleaser, I said nothing. But I emailed the salon after the fact and was told nope, just ink.) I couldn't even tell you when the Nano Brow work ended and the microshading began - that's how painless the whole thing was. When I was finally done, May handed me the mirror…and I had eyebrows. They were a little thicker than we discussed, but she had already told me that they'd shrink as they healed. Likewise, at first, they were darker than they would eventually turn out to be. My Nano Brow Recovery Experience I left with a bunch of easy-to-follow instructions: Don't get brows wet (rain, tears, sweat-nothing) for 24 hours; don't get makeup or sunscreen near them for the next week (the chemicals and minerals could alter the color of the pigment until the skin is fully healed); and avoid facials, retinols, and other intensive skincare products for two weeks. That was a Wednesday. My brows looked amazing. The next few days I rolled out of bed and went straight to the mirror, admiring my full, dark brows. Then I packed and left on a vacation to Ireland, where I woke up shocked on day five: My brows were peeling, but not at all in the way I expected them to. You see when May told me to expect peeling as the traumatized skin shed and new skin grew beneath it (basically like a scab), I expected something like retinoid or sunburn peeling - white, flaky, dry skin. I figured it would be annoying but manageable and not too noticeable, especially with the tiny pot of healing balm she gave me. Instead, I was peeling in dark-pigmented flakes - and the skin left behind was quite obviously lighter. I looked like I was molting. Cute, right? It took everything in me not to take a clean spoolie brush and scrub at my flaking brows. May had warned that rushing the process could result in uneven pigment saturation, and I definitely didn't want that. Instead, I gently splashed water and mild cleanser on my brows when I washed my face and made peace with what I called my zebra arches. Happily, after a few days, the shedding was over, and I was rewarded with beautiful, natural-looking brows. Why I Love My Nano Brows After four weeks, I booked a microshading touch-up since there were a few spots that didn't look perfectly blended. This time I was only at EverTrue for two hours, and when I hopped off the table, I gave May a big hug. I was so happy with my brows. I went home and dramatically threw all my brow makeup in the trash. May told me the salon would automatically follow up in six months for a touch-up appointment but that I probably wouldn't need it for a year or more. Honestly, every single day has been a big, beautiful brow gift. I'll take it as long as it lasts. For me, the result is perfect. My brows look natural, with a subtle lightness at the insides that gets darker toward the tips. Even better, I had to remind my partner and friends that I'd even had the treatment done - they didn't notice anything different about me. All they saw was me, and now when I look in the mirror, that's all I see too. Melanie Mannarino is a writer and editor specializing in lifestyle and wellness content, including beauty and style.
