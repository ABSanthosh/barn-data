    "description": "Spring is in the air, giving us the perfect excuse to expand the nail polish shades in our rotation. With nature bursting into full bloom, we’re more than ready to shed the mocha mousse and jewel tones of winter and dive right into the medley of vibrant colors that have been trending.Never ones to gatekeep nail polish colors, we decided to poll a handful of in-the-know beauty editors on the shades they love for their spring manicures. From soft, cherry blossom-like pinks to nourishing treatments that add just a hint of color, meet the hues that are bound to inject some fun and liveliness into your next set.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

While I had been reaching for more milky tones through the winter months, now that sunnier days are here, I want something a bit brighter. Essie's Sugar Daddy ticks all the boxes. While it's sheer, the tone is a bright pink, which adds a pretty brightness to my nails after a couple of coats. It's like a sheer liquid blush for your hands.” — Eleanor Vousden, beauty editor, Who What Wear UKEssie Nail Polish in Sugar Daddy, $, available at UltaManucurist Active Glow in Raspberry“Please don’t take away my beauty editor card, but something about — gulp — bare nails feels particularly fresh right now. That’s not to say I’ve been going polish-free: I’ve been swiping on Manicurist Active Glow, a pearly shade that imparts the perfect amount of natural-looking sheen. Thanks to its reparative and antioxidant ingredients, I swear my nails are stronger after wearing it.” — Dianna Singh, features director, AllureManicurist Active Glow in Raspberry, $, available at AnthropologieOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Last Glam Standing“My favorite nail polish color for spring is undoubtedly milky lavender. It’s a bit of a contrast to my go-to pillarbox red, but I love how fresh and clean this color looks on nails — especially short ones like mine. Typically, I don’t gravitate towards really minimalist, clean-girl manicures, but this lilac purple means that I still get to enjoy a wash of color. The grow-out is so much less obvious compared to something more bold.” — Mica Ricketts, freelance beauty journalistOPI Infinite Shine Nail Lacquer in Last Glam Standing, $, available at UltaNailberry L’Oxygéné Nail Polish in Love You Very Matcha“I love everything matcha-related, so I was already sold when I spotted the name of this shade from Nailberry. Once on, the creamy khaki green actually reminds me more of a perfectly manicured greenhouse, thriving with plant life in the spring. The low saturation means that it looks lovely with the neutrals and denim in my wardrobe, but I also love how it imparts a jade-green luster to my fingertips under the sun. Nailberry’s nail polish line gets a lot of love from me; so much pigment comes from just one coat, and the moisture-permeable formula is gentle on the nails.” — Venus Wong, Refinery29 senior writerNailberry L’Oxygéné Nail Polish in Love You Very Matcha, $, available at AmazonDior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma“I absolutely love Dior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma. It’s a beautiful russet red that looks just as gorgeous on my fingernails as it does on my toes. What makes it even better is how versatile it is. It pairs perfectly with any outfit, no matter the color. There’s something about the shade that has a retro ‘70s vibe to it, and it’s hands down my most complimented nail color. In fact, Dior nail polish is criminally underrated. It’s exceptionally durable and lasts for weeks on my toes, which means it’s worth the higher price tag. Even better, the brush is flatter than most and ever so slightly rounded, which makes light work of DIY manicures. I never make mistakes when I use this; it’s foolproof.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director, Refinery29Dior Vernis in Rouge Cinéma, $, available at DiorOlive \u0026 June Long Lasting Polish in Corrigan“I love all pastel polishes, but if I had to choose one color to wear for spring, it would be this one. Corrigan is the prettiest pistachio green and is fully opaque in two coats. A lot of pale green polishes tend to skew more minty or blue-toned, but this one is unique with its warmer undertones. I’m a big fan of Olive \u0026 June’s longwear and chip-resistant polishes, and I swear by the mani system’s prep and gel-like top coat for salon-quality nails at home. To me, this pale green is a spring neutral; fresh, unique, and subtly seasonal.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Olive \u0026 June Long Lasting Polish in Corrigan, $, available at Olive \u0026 JuneORLY Nail Lacquer in Bell Bottom Blues“ORLY has released a fleet of ‘70s-inspired nail varnishes to celebrate its 50th anniversary, and Bell Bottom Blues is my absolute favorite from the collection. Thanks to a shimmery, green undertone, the icy blue hue has a crystal-like sparkle that makes it mesmerizing to watch under the sunlight. I’ve been impressed by how well my ORLY nail colors have held up, especially when layered with the Bonder Rubberized Base Coat, which helps the color firmly grip onto my nails. I’ll be reaching for this color time and again to pair with my favorite white and blue linen shirts this spring.” — Venus Wong, senior writer, Refinery29 Orly Nail Lacquer in Bell Bottom Blues, $, available at OrlyOPI Nail Lacquer in It's a Girl!“I’m a nude-toned loyalist. A sheer layer of milky pink is forever my go-to, thanks to its ability to make me feel that bit more put-together. Imagine my horror, then, when I left the nail salon after settling on the wrong shade. Thanks to some very misleading salon lighting, the manicure I thought was a barely-there rose turned out to be a very-much-there shade of pink. And yet, the compliments have come rolling in. The shade responsible? The aptly named OPI It’s A Girl!, which has taught me that change can actually be a good thing. It’s a pretty, sugary pink polish that feels more playful than my usual, sensible nails. Will I be swapping out my beloved neutrals for candy-floss hues from now on? Unlikely. But if there was ever a time to flirt with a new shade (accidentally or not), then spring is the perfect excuse.” — Rachael Martin, beauty editor, Grazia UKOPI Nail Lacquer in It's a Girl!, $, available at UltaEssie To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment“My lineup of spring nail polish shades often changes, but a recent contender that has secured a top spot is Essie’s To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment. The shade has a natural, barely-there pink hue that looks great on all nails. But it’s far more than a pretty color: it can improve visible signs of UV gel damage in just five days, thanks to a formula that contains a strengthening 3-protein complex, methylsulfonylmethane aka MSM [said to promote nail growth], and ceramides. As someone trying to restore my nails to a healthier state while still wanting a hint of color, this polish has been a game-changer. It also dries down quickly without the need for a top coat.” — Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer, Refinery29Essie To The Rescue UV Gel Damage Repair Nail Treatment, $, available at UltaDazzle Dry Nail Lacquer in Checkmate“I have a serious color crush on pastel blue (in fact, I’m known to wear it year round), and Checkmate is among my favorites. I’m a bit picky when it comes to baby blues; too pale, and it reads as a dull, powdery grey, and too vivid gets into sky blue territory. Checkmate is a true pastel blue with cool undertones that feel as fresh as the first spring day. It’s bright without being loud and feels airy and light. Plus, I love the Dazzle Dry system for quick, DIY manicures that dry to the touch in literally five minutes.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer, Refinery29Dazzle Dry Dry Nail Lacquer in Checkmate, $, available at Dazzle DryLe Mini Macaron Nail Polish in Lily Rose“Spring instantly makes me want to lean into pastels, and Lily Rose is the perfect baby pink hue that reminds me of cherry blossoms. While Le Mini Macaron is known for its easy at-home gel manicure kits, I'm equally impressed by the air-dry polishes. This formula is super long-lasting; mine remained chip-free for over a week. It also doubles as a treatment thanks to nail-fortifying biotin.” — Kristina Rodulfo, content creator and beauty editorLe Mini Macaron Nail Polish in Lily Rose, $, available at Le Mini MacaronLike what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I’ll let you in on something I share with top dermatologists, Hailey Bieber, and Drew Barrymore (to name a few fans): We all love EltaMD’s UV Clear sunscreen. The brand specializes in skin-friendly, elegantly formulated sunscreen. Aside from regularly being name-dropped by celebs and beauty editors, EltaMD is a rather unlikely viral beauty hit. For starters, at $44, it faces stiff competition from drugstore juggernauts that clock in at half the price; and it boasts a prescription-quality packaging – and I say this with love — that doesn’t necessarily scream “luxe.” But perhaps that unique cosmeceutical crunchiness is part of its draw — after all, it’s what’s inside that counts. Ahead, I tried the mystical bottle for myself on my acne-prone skin to see if it could be my sunscreen dreams come true. DashDividers_1_500x100 EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, $44 First Impressions I’ve tried a ton of sunscreens in my career as a beauty writer, so I have a pretty good idea of whether or not something will break me out, and EltaMD’s UV Clear sunscreen was love at first pump. The texture was lightweight but silky — my oily skin drank it right up and immediately felt hydrated and bouncy. It dispenses as a white lotion, but blended in completely clear on my olive skin. (I also tried the popular tinted version, which is available in two shades and offers sheer coverage.) Wearing It Out After wearing it on and off for years, it still has yet to break me out ever — which for my finicky complexion, is no small feat. I added some foundation and concealer over the sunscreen to see if it could compare to the makeup grippiness of Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen. It was pretty good, but I did add some loose powder to set and absorb shine. This step is very optional, but when you’re as oily as I am, there’s a fine line between dewy and greasy. Final Thoughts While $44 ($46 for the tinted versions) is not exactly cheap for a single bottle of sunscreen, EltaMD’s UV Clear is a definite upgrade from the drugstore aisle — it just feels expensive. Plus, while the UV Clear is a fan-fave, the brand has a veritable coterie of SPF; there’s the aforementioned tinted one if you crave light coverage, hydrating formulas spiked with hyaluronic acid, and a just-launched green-tinted one to counteract redness, as well.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jenna-ortega-bleached-eyebrows-49436658",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/John Nacion We can no longer deny what is (literally) staring us in the face: the invisible eyebrow trend is here to stay. We saw it years ago with Doja Cat and Kim Kardashian, and in early March, the look practically took over the 2025 Oscars red carpet. The latest celebrity to jump on the no-eyebrow trend? Jenna Ortega. The actor popped up at CinemaCon 2025 on April 1 sporting bleached brows - a move that made her look almost unrecognizable. We're so used to seeing her with dark eyebrows that match her typically jet-black hair. Ortega's makeup artist, Vincent Oquendo, shared a photo of the look on his page, giving us a peek at the inspiration behind the transformation and sharing a hidden reference you likely missed. He noted in the caption that the duo channeled a \"modern Faye Dunaway '70s reference with taupe brows.\" Dunaway famously starred in hits such as \"Bonnie and Clyde,\" \"Mommie Dearest,\" and many more. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vincent Oquendo (@vincentoquendo) If Ortega's new look is enough to convince you to try the trend, we've got some expert tips that'll help you pull it off. First and foremost, the best (and safest) way to achieve the look is by paying a visit to a professional. Any time you use bleach, you run the risk of over-processing your hair, which can cause it to fall out. Before you reach for the chemicals, there are a few things you should do. \"To prep your brows for bleaching, be sure to remove any makeup from them,\" hairstylist Jeremy Tardo says. \"Clean your skin of makeup or products but don't scrub it. If the skin is stimulated by scrubbing, it will create more sensitivity when bleaching your brows. Add Vaseline or a similar skin barrier lotion to the skin around your brows to protect your skin.\" Not ready to commit to something permanent? Don't worry - we have a temporary fix. You can always try TikTok's bleached-brow hack, which only requires concealer, setting powder, and a spoolie. Just grab a light concealer, apply it to your eyebrows using the brush, and then set everything with a translucent setting powder. Voila - bleached brows for a day - without the damage. Whether you're ready to steal Ortega's new vibe or you're just nosy and want a closer look, keep scrolling for some more close-up shots of Ortega's bleached brows.

    "description": "We love a beauty trend, and the one where people share the \"unsexy\" products in their routines that work like a charm might just be one of our favorites. From body oils to tongue scrapers and everything in between, people are raiding their bathroom shelves to talk about all of the items they swear by but wouldn't necessarily take a shelfie of. These items are effective and get the job done - they just don't have the cutest packaging or Instagrammable results. As editors, we get to try products that run the gamut from dirt cheap to extremely expensive. Due to the nature of our roles, it's our duty to try everything with a neutral lens and report back on whether they work. While we love aesthetically pleasing bottles and pretty formulas that make us want to snap a picture, sometimes the best products are the ones that just work – sans any other bells and whistles. What's \"unsexy\" about a product can mean different things to different people. For some, it's the packaging that it comes in; for others, it can be what the item is used for. Still, the unifying quality of all of these items is that they deliver incredible results regardless of all that. As such, we've decided to share our favorite unsexy beauty products that we can't live without and would recommend in a heartbeat. Our obsessions range from products like Aquaphor Healing Ointment to First Aid Beauty Facial Radiance Pads - there are truly all kinds of options. From deodorant to dandruff shampoo, keep reading for the items we always keep in stock (and hidden within our medicine cabinets).",
