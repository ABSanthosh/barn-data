    "description": "From pimple patches to spot treatments to lasers, there’s little I haven’t tried in the name of clear skin. And when it comes to beauty tech specifically, I’m hardly a novice, either — LED masks, sleek hair stylers, high frequency wands, cleansing tools…I use ‘em all! But, if I had to use only one for the rest of my life, it would easily be the ZIIP.  Microcurrent is perhaps most popular for its “snatching” abilities (aka the ability to sculpt and tone facial muscles), but I’ve personally noticed the most dramatic improvements with my acne. Microcurrent is an effective treatment for acne because it draws out acne-causing bacteria and reduces inflammation, sometimes before it even has a chance to come to a head. ZIIP, co-founded by facialist Melanie Simon, is perhaps best known for the Halo — a small, computer-mouse-shaped device that treats myriad skin concerns, from wrinkles to puffiness to yes, acne.  I’m 31, and genetically blessed with few wrinkles and good bone structure, so while I loved the Halo (truly, it was a cornerstone of my wedding skin prep), I almost exclusively used it to ward off breakouts. At $399, the Halo is far from cheap — and if you’re only interested in it for acne treatment, I might not have recommended it. But here’s where the ZIIP Dot comes in. ZIIP Dot, $199.99 As if the beauty gods themselves heard me, an acne-focused ZIIP device finally arrived. Unlike the Halo, the Dot doesn’t require a companion app to select which treatment to load. It arrives preset with a 90-second spot treatment routine (60 seconds of Treat mode, followed by 30 seconds of Calm to reduce inflammation) and a six-minute full-face routine (four minutes of Treat mode and two minutes of Calm). It looks like a mini doughnut and has two thin, slightly curved electrical nodes on the underside of the device. In the box was a bottle of Clear Gel (one of the various conductive gels the brand makes), along with a charging cable and manual. It’s super lightweight and fits comfortably in my hand. After cleansing and patting my skin dry, I applied a few pumps of gel all over my face. Pressing and holding the Dot’s power button activated the full-face routine, and I slowly glided the device over my face. I tend to notice a slight warming sensation when the microcurrent “finds” the active acne — this is totally normal! Depending on how severe the breakout is, things can get a little tingly, but nothing unbearable. (Compared to other devices I’ve tried, I find that ZIIP’s are not only the most effective but also the most gentle.) I tend to break out most on my chin and jawline, but occasionally get acne in congested areas like my nose. The Dot is small enough to get into hard-to-reach spots, and I liked that you can start your treatment right away without having to pull up and sync the device with the app. After use, I wiped the Dot clean with a towel, rinsed off any excess gel, and proceeded with the rest of my nighttime skincare routine.  The following morning, I swear that the early rumblings of a cystic pimple were gone. (Formerly, I’d only seen results that fast with a dermatologist appointment and cortisone injection.) The one-two punch of microcurrent to kill bacteria and nanocurrent to quell inflammation — at its core, that’s what acne is, after all —  is a pimple’s worst nightmare, and my new best friend.  The brand recommends using the Dot two to three times a week, which is perfect for keeping breakouts at bay. The full-face routine has really helped maintain clear skin, but I’ve also used the spot treatment for a quick zippity-zap if I’m in a rush. Depending on the stage my acne is at, that’s been enough to reduce the lifespan and severity of the breakout dramatically. (In my aforementioned example, I was able to “catch” the pimple before it had a chance to wreak havoc; since I tend to scar easily, this was still a great tool to have to reduce hyperpigmentation.)  If acne is your primary skin concern, then at $200 (half the price of the Halo) the Dot is an amazing addition to any acne-haver’s routine. I love that it’s compact enough to easily travel with — great news if your skin tends to flare up after a long flight. With this sleek new skin gadget as part of my acne routine, I feel like I’m truly taking care of my skin — and that’s a very, very good thing. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/guava-nails-manicure-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "From polka-dot manicures and “Italian Summer”-inspired nail art to sorbet shades and beach nails, there has been no shortage of incredible nail inspiration for our summer manicures this year. And our latest collective obsession with fruity nails has given rise to an emerging trend to watch for the season ahead: guava nails. While your first thought might be that guava nails are just a new way to describe bubblegum pink, think again. This manicure is actually a shimmering fusion of green and pink that’s as juicy as the fruit itself. Teamed with a multidimensional finish (think chrome or jelly), the result is a playful manicure that feels fresh and fun. So as our social feeds start to fill with hot takes on this sweet summer nail trend, here’s everything you need to know about it — inspiration included. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 📍PEABODY MA, your nail plug (@polishedbycarrissa) What are guava nails? Some people might refer to a bright pink manicure as “guava”, but this summer’s iteration of guava nails is more complex than just paying homage to the flesh of this tropical fruit. “This year’s trend is inspired by all of the tropical tones of the guava fruit and blends juicy pinks with corals and soft greens to mimic the fruit’s natural appearance,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. Yes, guava nails 2.0 are all about contrast and depth rather than a flat colorblock manicure. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola) The most popular iteration is a cat-eye finish: “The colors are layered using ombré techniques, jelly finishes, or magnetic cat-eye effects to mimic the fruit’s juicy texture and natural glow,” says Streets. Rather than leaning overly neon and bright, this version of guava nails feels undeniably cooler, and there are so many ways to wear it, too. “Rather than having the cat-eye all over the nails, you can scale it down and apply it just to the middle of the nail or go for a guava nail tip or half moon,” suggests London-based nail technician Metta Francis. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ᑎᗩᑎᗩ 💅🏼𝐺𝑒𝑙 𝑋 \u0026 𝐷𝑒𝑠𝑖𝑔𝑛 ( SCV ) (@trendsnailstudio) How do you create guava nails? If you’re heading to the salon for this look, it’s all about layering different colors and finishes for that multidimensional effect. “Layer on a soft green magnetic shimmer gel and use a magnet to manipulate the pigment for a cat-eye effect, then apply a pink or coral, sheer jelly formula to the center of the nail for that juicy, fruit-inspired finish,” explains Streets. Manicurists are also known to add the centre pop of color by softly dabbing a powder pink pigment or eyeshadow into the nail using a sponge or fluffy brush. “This creates a diffused, blurred effect,” says Streets. Finish with an ultra-glossy top coat to seal it all in and create that mirror-glass shine.  @polishedbygabbi Guava nail tutorial for summer!

Streets suggests following the same layering techniques but switching out the gel formulations for sheer jelly polishes and iridescent formulations. Try Zoya Nail Polish in Meg, $10.95, with Essie Jelly Gloss in Blush Jelly, $13. “You could use a sponge to create an ombré technique, then finish with a glossy top coat to smooth the finish,” says Streets. Into it?

    "description": "Image Source: Getty Images / Film Magic / Savion Washington Olympic gymnast Jordan Chiles hit the 2025 ESPYs red carpet with a manicure that was nothing short of intergalactic. The gymnast - part of the gold medal–winning Team USA at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris - wore long, coffin-shaped acrylics with a glossy pink base and soft blue accents. Each nail was embellished with crystal studs and 3D rhinestones, mimicking a star-filled sky. On both ring fingers, she added metallic appliqués shaped like Saturn, complete with delicate orbiting rings. In a summer filled with standout nail trends, celestrial nail art is the latest to land. Image Source: Getty Images / Amy Sussman Chiles is no stranger to making a statement with her nails. She's been wearing long acrylics since she was 15, even during Olympic and NCAA competitions - a choice she says actually improves her technique. \"It makes me think of the right technique because I'm not trying to fall or break a nail,\" she explained on Vogue's \"The Run-Through\" podcast in 2024. \"My nails are too precious and too good looking to be breaking.\" Whether she's on the mat or the red carpet, Chiles's commitment to unique nail art proves that elite performance and elite beauty can coexist, and that great nails truly have gravity.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/passport-photo-makeup-how-to-48965585",
    "description": "The last time I had a passport photo taken, I was 22 and heading to Costa Rica to teach English after graduating from college. I wore a plaid button-down, a fugly red scarf, and absolutely zero makeup. Somehow, I still managed to look cute. It's been almost 10 years since then, and yep, you guessed it - it's time for a new passport photo. I've already accepted the fact that there is no way I'm going to look cute in any photo without at least a little makeup, so when I saw a viral makeup tutorial for the \"perfect passport photo\" on TikTok, I decided to test it out to see if it was worth the hype. The viral video, created by TikTok user Georgia Barratt, included way more steps than my typical everyday makeup, so not only did it take a while to do, but there were some things that I had to practice a few times before I got them right. (I'm looking at you, winged eyeliner.) I followed Barratt's instructions to a T, subbing in products that I had on hand that closely matched everything she used in her video. The steps were a little confusing to follow, and while I was in the midst of applying my makeup, it didn't seem like there was a lot of rhyme or reason to the order of application, but the end result was worth it. Keep scrolling for a step-by-step guide to the perfect passport makeup look, and check out the results for yourself. Step One: Groom Your Eyebrows To start, I brushed up my eyebrows using an eyebrow gel to give them a full, lifted look. Any eyebrow gel is fine, as long is it has a strong hold that will keep the hairs in place. In Barratt's video, she dragged the ends upward and out and kept the hairs square in the front sections, so I tried to copy her look exactly. Step Two: Apply a Hydrating Primer I'm not a huge fan of primers, but the next step Barratt took was to use a hydrating primer. I opted to use the E.l.f. Cosmetics Halo Glow ($14) because it gives me a glowing base without the stickiness I often get from using primers. Step Three: Apply a Foundation and Define the Eyebrows With Concealer Next, I applied my foundation by using a small amount of product to cover my face as I normally would. For concealer, I dabbed a tiny bit under my eyes. I also added the Kulfi Main Match Concealer ($26) underneath my brows to help carve them out and give them a bold shape. In Barratt's video, she mentioned that carving out her eyebrows helps them look as symmetrical as possible, which is important since the passport photo will be taken head on. Step Four: Apply \"Over the Top\" Contour Barratt said in her video that she used \"OTT\" (over the top) contour for this look, so I contoured the same areas of my face as she did: above my temples, the high points of my cheeks, my nose, my chin, and my jaw line. At one point in her video, Barratt sucked in her cheeks and drew along the line by her cheeks with contour, so I did that as well. I opted to use the Milk Makeup Bionic Liquid Bronzer ($32), and I finished everything off by adding a small amount of contour to the corner of each eyelid. Step Five: Add a Little More Concealer Barratt added a tiny bit more concealer in between her eyebrows and the corners of her eyes, but this time she opted for a lighter concealer that looked three shades lighter than her skin tone. I don't own a concealer that light, but I opted to use the Lawless Conseal the Deal Concealer ($26), which was a tiny bit lighter than the other concealer I used. Step Six: Tap on Your Blush Following the steps in Barratt's video, I took a tiny amount of liquid blush and applied three dots to the high points of each cheekbone, then blended out the color using a blush brush. Step Seven: Snatch the Face With Concealer Although Barratt already applied concealer, after adding blush, she added a bit more underneath the areas she contoured on both cheeks. I did the same using the lighter of my two concealers. Step Eight: Set With Powder I then took the Laura Mercier Translucent Powder ($47) and lightly tapped it over my face to set everything in place. Step Nine: Add Bronzer Next, I added bronzer to all the areas I had previously contoured using my cream contour: my temples, cheeks, nose, chin, and jaw. Step 10: Powder on More Blush Although I already applied a small amount of liquid blush, at this point Barratt applied powder blush to the high points of her cheeks as well as her eyelids, so I followed suit. Step 11: Bake I then applied a heavier amount of translucent powder underneath my eyes, under my cheekbones, and around my nose using a beauty sponge. I let the powder sit while I completed the final steps of the makeup tutorial. Step 12: Draw on Your Winged Eyeliner As I continued to let my powder \"bake,\" I got started on my eyes. Barratt drew on a tiny wing with a brown liquid liner at the corner of each eye, and she mentioned that it should be simple and look almost like an eyelash but that the intention is to get a fox shape. To make it a bit more intense, she also lined the inner corner of her eye and brought it out a bit toward her nose. I have downturned eyes, and I've never really been able to get the hang of winged eyeliner so I don't even own a liquid eyeliner product. Instead, I used the NYX Lift N' Snatch Brow Tint Pen ($12) in a brown color. Surprisingly enough for me, it turned out nicely. Step 13: Curl Eyelashes and Apply Mascara The last step of the eye-makeup process was pretty straightforward. I used the eyelash curler I've had for roughly 10 years to curl my lashes, and I applied mascara using my current favorite, the Tower 28 MakeWaves Mascara ($20). Barratt kept the mascara focused on the outer corners of her eyes, and I did the same, which I found really elongated my eyes and is a trick I plan to keep using in the future. Step 14: Fill in Eyebrows This is the point in the tutorial when Barratt filled in her eyebrows using a pencil, but I actually did that step in the beginning (oops). I have super-sparse brows, so I always opt to do them first whenever I do my makeup. Step 15: Overline Lips and Add Gloss I already have pretty large lips, so I thought about skipping this step entirely, but I decided to go for it, and I'm glad I did. I used the Refy Lip Sculpt ($26) to \"majorly\" overline my lips, and then I used the Merit Beauty Shade Slick ($24) to give them high gloss and shine. If you stuck it out through the entire tutorial, I commend you. Even I had my doubts about halfway through, but let me just say: the results were worth it. Although this process involved way more makeup than I ever wear regularly (or ever plan to wear again), it was actually perfect for my passport photo and turned out amazing. Although it might seem like a lot, if you're looking for a perfect passport photo, this makeup tutorial is the way to get it done - my results prove it.
