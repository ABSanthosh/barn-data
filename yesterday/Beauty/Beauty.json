    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/how-much-does-facial-cost-49409553",
    "description": "There's nothing quite like the way your skin looks after a professional facial - glowy, firmer, perfectly hydrated, your pores smaller and unclogged. And while facials are typically considered luxurious indulgences, the price you pay can vary widely, largely depending on the add-ons and extra services many aestheticians offer. From LED light therapy, dermaplaning, and chemical peels - there are lots of basic extras that can be tacked onto a basic facial to further increase the benefits. Whether you are aiming to reduce redness and inflammation, or looking to address stubborn acne or dark spots, many aestheticians offer these extra treatment options to help your skin get to its healthiest state. But, like we said, these are ultimately what can affect the final price you pay. So, we spoke with aestheticians to help you understand how much is a facial - be it a standard option or one with all the bells and whistles added. Experts Featured in This Article Lucia Miranda, LE, CCMA, is a licensed esthetician and certified medical assistant with Shafer Clinic Fifth Avenue in NYC. Carmela Barabas is an aesthetician at Mario Badescu. Leslie Lee, RN, is a nurse injection specialist. How Much Does a Facial Cost? A standard 60-minute facial can cost anywhere from $75 to $300, depending on what type of spa you go to and where you live. \"Facials in larger cities like New York and Los Angeles often cost more due to operational costs and more experienced aestheticians,\" licensed aesthetician Lucia Miranda, LE, CCMA, tells PS. \"A standard facial is ideal for maintaining healthy skin, and with the right add-ons, it can target specific concerns without straining your budget,\" aesthetician Carmela Barabas says, who adds that they're a good option for all skin types. When arriving at your appointment, your licensed aesthetician will evaluate your skin, listen to your concerns, and offer suggestions and optional treatments that can be added to your standard facial. That's where the costs can start to add up; most places provide you with a menu of additional extras (along with price), which can then be added to the standard facial for a more customized experience. There are also higher-end facials, which can cost anywhere up to $1,800. These types of facials include advanced technologies that enhance the experience to give better results and are tailored to meet specific skin concerns, Miranda says. How Does a Higher-End Facial Differ From a Standard Facial? \"Higher-end facials differ from standard ones mainly due to the quality of products, personalized treatments tailored to the client's skin type, condition, and concerns, and the overall experience,\" nurse injection specialist Leslie Lee, RN, says. Lee adds that for those new to facials, seeking relaxation, or without major skin concerns, a standard facial is a great starting point. \"However, for those who require targeted treatments or are looking for more noticeable skin improvements, a higher-end service may be more appropriate.\" Popular Add-Ons to Get With a Standard Facial Miranda says the following are the most popular: Extractions: This is a manual extraction of clogged pores, blackheads, and whiteheads to clear the skin. Dermaplaning: This uses a scalpel to gently scrape off dead skin and fine hairs. High-Frequency: Delivers low-current, high-frequency pulses to the skin through a glass electrode filled with argon or neon gas for addressing acne, fine lines, and dull skin. LED Light Therapy: Uses specific light wavelengths to address acne, redness, or fine lines. Microcurrent: Uses low-level electrical currents to stimulate the muscles and collagen production in the skin. Diamond Glow: Uses a diamond-tipped wand to exfoliate, extract impurities, and infuse serums. Hydrafacial: A specialized multi-step facial machine that cleanses, exfoliates, extracts, and hydrates the skin Oxygen Therapy: This sprays a mist of highly concentrated oxygen molecules infused with vitamins, minerals, and essential nutrients into the skin. The Price of Facials at Popular Chains While add-ons and geographic location can impact the final cost, below is an overview of the average price of a facial at popular chains located across the country. How Much Is a Facial at HeyDay? At HeyDay locations, the 50-minute standard facial is $145 for non-members. Or, pay a $114 monthly membership, which includes one facial. Their standard add-ons - gua sha, LED light therapy, and professional peel - cost $50. Other enhancements available include dermaplaning, Diamond Tip Microdermabrasion, Hydro Wand Infusion, Microcurrent, Nano Infusion, and dermaplaning for $80. How Much Is a Facial at Massage Envy? Massage Envy offers customized facials: $75 for a 60-minute and $113 for 90 minutes. They also offer an hour-long customized back facial for $87. Customers can choose to add a nourishing light treatment, microderm infusion, a chemical peel, and an oxygenating treatment to their facial for $130 each. How Much Is a Facial at Glowbar? Glowbar's facials start at $60 for members and $75 for non-members. Additional treatments include dermaplaning, chemical peels, hydrating masks, extractions, high frequency, microcurrent, and LED light therapy, all for $60 each. (A monthly membership is $60 and includes a facial or one of these other treatments.) How Much Is a Facial at FaceGym? FaceGym's signature sculpt facial is priced at $108 for members and $135 for non-members. This facial features electronic muscle stimulation (EMS), the use of its branded skin-care tools, and products targeted to your specific skin needs. The \"Signature Hands\" facial, done without any of these tools, costs the same. Add-ons include LED Therapy, a vitamin shot, various masks, and buccal tension release; price range from $30-$130. How Much Is a Facial at Skin Spa NYC? Skin Spa NYC offers a $110 monthly membership, which includes one of the custom facials or other treatments (microdermabrasion, power peel, Fit Face microcurrent facial, PCA peel, dermaplaning, hydrafacial, Lightstim LED therapy). The prices for these range from $90-$350. How Much Is a Facial at Rescue Spa? Rescue Spa offers a variety of facials to choose from, ranging from $200-$750. Extras are priced from $50-170, and include options like a PCA peel, BioCell mask, customized collagen mask, oxygen, LED light therapy, and others. How Much to Tip After a Facial As a general rule of thumb, it's standard to tip your aesthetician 15 to 20 percent of the total treatment cost (including any add-ons). So, when thinking about how much a facial costs, make sure to factor that into the final price you'll pay. Given that there are so many different ways to customize a facial, there's really no universal or standard price. Your best bet? Take a look at the spa's website to better understand their pricing and various options. You can then chat with your aesthetician at your appointment about your complexion concerns and needs in order to come up with the facial protocol that's best for your skin - and your budget.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/fazit-glitter-freckles-review-49407289",
    "description": "First things first: I'm not a huge Taylor Swift fan. I know, I know - it's blasphemous to all the Swifties reading this, but it's true. I like roughly two of her songs, I'm not huge on her outfits, and for the most part I abhor her makeup choices. (Sorry, I don't look good in a red lip.) All that being said, imagine my surprise when I saw Swift sporting an accessory I knew I wanted to try immediately: the Fazit Glitter Freckles Makeup Patches ($16). At an Oct. 7 Kansas City Chiefs game, Swift wore the freckles while watching and supporting her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. She paired her silver and gold freckles with a bold red lip and some intense cat-eye eyeliner, and I have to admit, although I'm not usually a fan of her looks, this one hit a little differently. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Fazit Glitter Freckles and find out why they've become one of my favorite accessories. About the Fazit Glitter Freckles This product is a glitter makeup patch that can be applied like a temporary tattoo. The glitter freckles come in gold, silver, and rose gold as well as brown. They last up to three days and can be removed with makeup remover or cleansing balm. They come in packages of six, 12, or 18. What I Like About the Fazit Glitter Freckles I'm a retired rave baby and I think these freckles make the perfect accessory for a concert, fun night out on the town, or special event. I recently went to a birthday party in Joshua Tree and I loved how these glitter freckles elevated my look. I'm acne-prone, and these didn't break me out whatsoever, which is another plus. I also love that they come in gold, silver, and rose gold, because I snagged one of each - so I can always match up my freckles to my jewelry. I'm planning on going to an EDM concert later this month, and you can bet these freckles are going to come along with me. They're super cute and they're so easy to apply, you really can't go wrong. How to Use the Fazit Glitter Freckles To start, the brand recommends peeling off the backing and placing the patch sticky side down on your face, wherever you want the freckles to appear. Next, wet a towel and dab the patch for 60 seconds. From there, you can peel off the patch. They should last for 24-48 hours. To remove, the brand says you can use makeup wipes, micellar water, or an oil-based cleanser. It notes not to scrub hard, and instead to wash gently in a circular motion. When trying these for the first time, I followed the instructions exactly and found they worked just as described. I put them on after finishing my entire face of makeup. They were honestly extremely easy to get off as well. All I needed was the tiniest bit of cleansing balm to work them off my face, and then I double-cleansed with a gentle face wash to remove everything else. What to Consider Before Trying the Fazit Glitter Freckles I would start out by doing one half of the freckles, then moving to the center, and then doing the other half on the other cheek. I found that it was easier to make sure all of the freckles were in place when doing it piece by piece rather than trying to get each side wet all at once. Where the Fazit Glitter Freckles Are Available The Fazit Glitter Freckles are available directly on the brand's website.

    "description": "Thanksgiving manicures might not be as popular as Halloween designs or Christmas nail art but I’ll never pass up an excuse to visit the salon for a fresh manicure. With Turkey Day just around the corner, I’ve been busy saving the cutest fall nail designs and trending textures that will lend themselves perfectly to the occasion. Whether it’s a colorblock manicure in the shades of the season or a more intricate design to honor the holiday itself, these 13 ideas are festive without feeling twee. And most importantly, whether you’re dressing up in your finest or chilling in your sweatpants, there’s a nail design to vibe with whatever Thanksgiving you’re having this year.  Maple Leaves View this post on Instagram A post shared by Marnie ♡ (@thenaillologist) Brown nails are one of the biggest fall trends for 2024 and Marnie’s decision to pair this beautiful chestnut color with a minimalist leaf design and shimmering flecks of gold is inspired.   Pumpkin Spice View this post on Instagram A post shared by Eleanor Szejner 🤍 (@beautybyelee) Thanksgiving is officially the start of the holiday season and, for me, that means any excuse for a little shimmer. This cat-eye manicure created by Eleanor Szejner is packed with perfect fall tones, from deep copper and burnished brown to pumpkin orange and rose gold.  Textured Tones View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) 3D nail art might feel like a bold choice for dinner with friends and family, but Melanie Graves’ use of dusky berry shades and warm golds lends this manicure a really soft, dreamy feel. Merlot Red View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lauren ✨ (@lolo.nailedit) Red nails look good all year round but there’s something about the darker, sultrier end of the color spectrum — I’m talking cranberry, burgundy and Lauren’s deep red wine shade — that feels like a choice for a special occasion. Merlot Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charlotte Herberts (@beautyspace_charlotte) If you’re after something even more wintry, consider an additional layer of pearl chrome, like this frosty set by Charlotte Herberts. Apricot Ombré View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) If maximalist nails aren’t your vibe, then these dainty ombré tips by Iram Shelton will be right up your street. The way the orange fades from an opaque tip through to a natural nail is a chic and subtle nod to the holiday. Plaid Shimmer View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Le (@amyle.nails) Wrapping up a shimmering, black cherry base and sparkly silver accents in one cozy checked design, Amy Le’s gorgeous creation will take your nails from Thanksgiving all the way through to your winter celebrations.  Forest Green View this post on Instagram A post shared by OROSA (@orosabeauty) There’s so much brilliant nail art inspiration out there, but sometimes a simple colorblock manicure does it best. Orosa Beauty’s pared-back, deep green nails are polished perfection. Red Velvet View this post on Instagram A post shared by Queenie Nguyen | elevated nail artist (@nailartbyqueenie) Queenie Nguyen’s shimmering burgundy manicure is so shiny that it’s certain to turn heads this Thanksgiving. Simple but incredibly effective. Cranberry Blooms View this post on Instagram A post shared by pearlie pressed | nail artist | content creator (@pearliepressed) On paper, Pearlie Pressed’s combination of berry French tips, pearl accents and blooming gel petals sounds a little chaotic. In reality it creates a winter floral manicure that is chic and serene. Fall Set View this post on Instagram A post shared by rylee || oahu, hawaii nail artist 🌺 (@nails_by.ry) Combining all the colors of Thanksgiving in one beautiful set, Rylee’s fall nail design uses greens, oranges, browns and golds to create a mix-and-match manicure that is guaranteed to earn compliments. Mocha Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) Simple, elegant and elevated, this pared-back chocolate-brown manicure by Julia Diogo is infused with hints of warm copper and swirls of soft gold, transforming a basic nail look into something truly special.  Burnt Orange Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by pearlie pressed | nail artist | content creator (@pearliepressed) Pearlie Pressed’s addition of gold and silver star detailing lends this burnt orange French tip set a truly festive feel.

    "description": "Each morning, as I sit on the London Underground and am forced to lift my eyes away from the comfort of my phone screen (the service isn’t great down there), I find myself staring at everyone’s hands. I spy a set of perfectly shiny gel nails here and a bare-nailed hand there, but rarely do I spy fingernails with “normal” nail polish on them. You know the type I’m talking about: The regular polish that we all grew up with; the type that chips easily and takes an age to dry between coats. I feel like I can tell the difference between a gel manicure and a regular nail polish manicure upon quick inspection, and my morning commutes have left me with just one question: Where did all the normal nail polish go? With this question already rattling around in my head, I was startled during a chance encounter at Townhouse recently, when the lady next to me struck up a conversation. She wanted to look at my nails, which were prepped and layered with a coat of builder gel (BIAB), ready for nail art, and we discussed the design I was opting for. When I asked what she was getting, she said, “Ah, I’m old-fashioned. I’m just getting normal nail polish.” “Old fashioned?” I repeated, incredulously. “You think normal nail polish is old-fashioned?” “Well, that’s what my niece tells me.”  Is anyone using regular nail polish anymore? At the ripe old age of 27, I hesitate to begin a sentence with “back in my day” but back in my day, normal nail polish (which I’ll refer to as “OG polish”) reigned supreme. At least it did in my circle of friends and family. Every so often my mom would let me raid the drugstore for a new (usually pink and sparkly) OG polish. I wasn’t allowed to wear makeup back then, so you could say that cheap OG polish was my gateway drug to the beautysphere. I loved the joy that it brought me (I maintain that it’s impossible to have sparkly nails and not feel joy whenever you see them). My mom would paint my nails for me and I’d paint hers. It felt special. We don’t do that anymore. If we have anything on our nails, we’ve had a professional do it, probably with gel. Eager to know if this eschewing of OG polish is unique to me and my circle, I reached out to Sophia Green of Greenhouse Studio, a salon that specializes in detailed nail art. “Until recently, I didn’t realize people were still using normal nail polish,” she confessed to me. “I rarely see it in the salon.” Her clients tend to come in with — and ask for — gels or nail extensions.  A quick scour of the internet shows much of the same attitude. One nail technician on Threads claims that “99%” of her clients ask for gel polish over OG polish. She goes so far as to say that you should buy your own OG polishes and take them with you to the salon if you want a traditional manicure, as salons might not carry a wide range of colors anymore. Other users and technicians I spoke to agree, saying it makes no sense for them to stock regular polish if nobody wants it, as it just becomes thick and gloopy over time. Over on Reddit, a user notes that it’s “interesting” how gel polish is now de rigueur. “Most salons won’t offer nice regular polishes or [create] designs with [them] anymore. But if we look back, not so long ago regular polish was the norm and you [could] still get french tips or simple drawings without hesitation, right?” The replies largely agree, with some even saying that they feel judged when opting for OG polish. “I got shamed when I chose a regular polish for a pedicure even after explaining I had a gel allergy,” wrote one user. Another user, who prefers using OG polish on their toes, said, “I made the mistake of telling this to a friend of a friend, since she was a nail tech, and she told me I was a liar and became quite angry about the entire thing.” Despite plenty of anecdotal evidence, the statistics to back up this supposed OG polish purge are sparse. The global gel nail market was valued at $1.8 billion in 2023 but one report suggests that gels make up just 40% of the overall nail polish market share. Forty percent is a lot, but it’s far from being the majority. I asked Gaëlle Lebrat Personnaz, the founder of nail polish brand Manucurist, to weigh in. “Normal nail polish has seen some market decline in comparison to gel and other advanced long-wear polishes,” Personnaz says. But she adds that traditional polish formulas remain in demand for their versatility, convenience, affordability and ease of use. Her own brand’s data shows that around 48% of US consumers still buy regular polishes. When is regular nail polish most useful? Clearly, people are still using classic nail polish. “I’ve definitely seen an increase in the use of normal nail polish recently,” says Green, who adds that she was shocked when she first realized this. She maintains that her clients mostly opt for gel, but she’s noticed a shift among the general population when she works at events outside of her salon. She thinks this is because people just can’t afford gel manicures anymore. This is unsurprising considering that, in New York, a gel manicure can set you back up to $100. You can expect further charges for the likes of BIAB or the removal of your old set. Want nail art? Well, you may have to sell a kidney. Obviously, these prices are justified; the beauty sector struggled amid the COVID-19 pandemic and nails are like little canvases, ripe for what I consider to be real art. But one thing is clear: The cost of living is at a high. With this in mind, it would be short-sighted to declare OG polish dead. Would it die out if money were no object? Perhaps, but more likely not. Claire Stark, a manicurist who specializes in Bio Sculpture and decorates the fingernails of many of my editor friends, says she’s seen a huge increase in regular nail polish use since the pandemic. “It’s an at-home and user-friendly way to keep your nails looking well groomed,” she explains. “I don’t think it’s old-fashioned per se — I love [regular] polish for an easy manicure that I can change without any hassle. It’s perfect for people who are indecisive like me.” Stark maintains that OG polish holds a “well-needed space in the beauty community” and is essential for those who find painting their own nails a therapeutic and mindful exercise. OG polish does play an important role here, considering that trying to apply gels at home without proper training can be dangerous and even prompt an allergic reaction. This is because your body can form a hypersensitivity to methacrylate monomers (HEMA), which aren’t found in OG polishes. Thanks to the increase in awareness surrounding these skin sensitivities and allergic reactions to gel nail polishes, Personnaz says she’s seen a resurgence in interest among clients who want “natural” nail polishes. More brands are focusing on “free-from” formulas, too, which she says creates a niche appeal for OG polish. To that end, Personnaz expects to soon see a “rebirth” of OG polishes: “Some may return to traditional polish for a more natural aesthetic, a less damaging routine, or less exposure to UV [light].” The case for regular nail polish doesn’t end there. Podiatrist Dina Gohil of DG Podiatrist says she would always rather her clients use regular polishes over gels on their toes. While she understands the appeal of gel pedicures, she says they can cause damage to the nails during the removal process, which typically involves soaking nails in acetone and then scraping off the gel. “These actions can dehydrate and thin the nail layers, leading to peeling, splitting and weakening over time,” says Gohil. Regular polish, on the other hand, is easily removed gently with acetone-free formulas that reduce the likelihood of dryness and brittleness. This, explains Gohil, gives your nails a break between applications, which is better for nail strength. OG polish also doesn’t require any UV light curing, which Gohil explains is associated with risks of premature skin aging and skin damage. She also notes that gels can worsen fungus-based toenail conditions. This is because the gel can trap moisture and bacteria. Religion also plays a part in the enduring popularity of OG nail polish. Some Muslims believe that their prayers may not count if they wear nail polish because water can’t reach the nail during pre-prayer ablutions. Because of this, many Muslim women opt for OG polish during their period, when they’re unable to pray. In this scenario, OG polish is much easier to apply, remove and change during such a short window of time. Some nail polish brands like Inglot and Orly offer “breathable” or “halal” formulas that claim to let water pass through to the nail bed, though the permissibility of these polishes in Islam is debated. Is gel polish better than regular nail polish? With all of this in mind, it’s hard to say that gel is better than OG polish — but gels do have their advantages. They are convenient for clients, last well and don’t chip as easily, says Gohil. What’s more, we want polish to last longer without taking up too much of our time, she adds. Gel polishes — in particular, builder gel formulas — are also great for those who bite and pick their nails as they make it harder to do so. They can also help to grow your nails when applied (and removed and reapplied) regularly by a professional. Then we have to consider the rise in popularity of nail art. Gone are the days of nothing snazzy but a sparkly top coat on your ring finger. Nowadays, nail art is…well…art, using different textures, finishes, tools and formulas. As Korean and Japanese styles make their way west, 3D nail art designs are also beginning to emerge, and such complex creations are much easier and quicker to achieve with gel polishes over regular polishes. You don’t have to wait for them to air-dry between coats and you can add multiple colors and strokes after an all-but-instant flash of a lamp.  Is regular nail polish dead? Though anecdotal evidence (and my own observations of Londoners during rush hour) might suggest that OG polish is on its way out, the experts — and statistics — say otherwise. “We see consumers looking more and more for the best of both worlds when it comes to the health of their nails, long-lasting color and convenience of application,” explains Personnaz. With the invention of hardworking hybrid products like Manucurist’s Green Flash LED polish (which cures quickly but can be removed just like regular polish to avoid trauma to your nails) or Drying Drops (which take away the annoyance of long drying times), formulas that work just like OG polishes are looking more attractive than ever. As Personnaz suggests, it’s not so much about OG polishes dying out. Instead it’s about them getting a rebrand. They’re upgrading and evolving with the times to offer us more without compromise. Think of it as the “skinification” of nail polish. Already we’re seeing more formulas forgo harsh ingredients in favor of nail-strengthening and nail health-boosting additions like plant oils and amino acids. Combined with longer-lasting formulas and quicker drying times, this is sure to put regular polishes back on the proverbial map. Like what you see?
