If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. A personal trainer friend of mine has a mantra that she’ll never let me forget: “Anything is possible when you’re hydrated.” Consider me indolent, then, because my daily water intake is pretty shocking. I’ll take a big mug of tea over a glass of the clear stuff any day, and while that certainly keeps my tastebuds happy, I can imagine that my skin is less than impressed. In fact, I know that to be true. Besides obvious dehydration, the cold weather and central heating has zapped my skin of moisture. As such, I’ve navigated a persistent flaky forehead and noticed a handful of superficial lines cropping up underneath my eyes in the past few months. What does dehydrated skin look like? Don’t get me wrong. Skin texture is entirely normal and a totally usual part of aging (I just turned 32, in case you were wondering). But I know I’m not the only one to suspect that something else is up. “What does dehydrated skin look like” and “signs of dehydrated skin” are both commonly googled skincare queries.  While those new faint lines are somewhat self-inflicted, a recent appointment with a dermatologist taught me something new: Increasing your water intake can only do so much to minimize skin texture, dryness, dullness and the uncomfortable tight feeling. Rather, it’s what you put on your face that counts. Popular hydrating ingredients in topical skincare products include hyaluronic acid, which famously holds 1,000 times its weight in water, and polyglutamic acid, said to be even more hydrating than that. But another skincare ingredient has caught my eye lately, not least because it seems to promise a lot more. Enter: ectoin. What is ectoin and what are the skincare benefits? While it’s not entirely new, skincare brands are only just beginning to incorporate ectoin (pronounced ec-toe-in) into their serums and moisturizers. That now includes The Inkey List, which today launches its Ectoin Hydro-Barrier Serum, $15 — a product I had the privilege of trying before anyone else. The Inkey List Ectoin Hydro-Barrier Serum, $15 If you’re an R29 regular, you’ll know that I’m a big fan of The Inkey List, in particular its transformative Bio-Active Ceramide Moisturizer, $20, so I was excited to add the serum to my skincare rotation. But before I get into the nitty-gritty, a little science. Dr. Nava Greenfield, a New York-based, board-certified dermatologist with Schweiger Dermatology Group, says ectoin is part of a protein structure that comes from molecules found in certain bacteria which live in high-stress environments. “[Ectoin] protects the bacteria from the environmental stressors,” she says, “and it can help protect human cells in the skin barrier [the outermost layer of skin] by attracting numerous water molecules and creating an effective physical film layer.”  This film layer essentially traps water and prevents water loss; no dry, rough skin here. Dr. Greenfield adds that this helps strengthen the skin and its natural barrier function, which keeps in the good stuff (think moisture) and defends against the bad stuff (like bacteria). “In turn, it can create visible results when used in skincare,” she says.  Besides 2% ectoin, this serum also boasts 2.5% hyaluronic acid, 1% ceramide NP (a substance that occurs naturally in the skin and works like glue to keep skin cells intact) and 1% oat, which a handful of studies suggest alleviates dry and irritated skin. You’d think the texture would be thick or sticky but it’s the opposite: lightweight yet substantially moisturizing, and it absorbs in seconds. I knew that it would replace most of my skincare after the very first application. An honest review of The Inkey List’s Ectoin Hydro-Barrier Serum Unlike retinol, which takes weeks to yield results, ectoin and hyaluronic acid work almost instantly to boost hydration in the skin. (I like to apply this serum to a slightly damp face to maximize moisture.) You know the feeling that your face might crack into a hundred tiny pieces when you cleanse and don’t apply skincare immediately? I’m convinced that using this serum has mitigated that. It makes sense: The Inkey List reports that, when combined, ectoin and hyaluronic acid can hydrate the skin up to 10 surface layers deep. Most mornings I apply two pumps to freshly cleansed skin and follow with a high factor, broad spectrum sunscreen — no need for a moisturizer. In the evening, I double cleanse, apply the serum and follow with the aforementioned ceramide face cream. Super simple. While my 2025 New Year’s resolution is not to stand too close to the bathroom mirror, I can’t help but notice how those fine lines underneath my eyes — and the less deep ones on my forehead — have almost entirely filled out. It’s more obvious to me when I wear makeup because it no longer collects there. The flakes on my forehead have all but disappeared, too, and the serum does a better job of moisturizing my lips than any dedicated lip balm I own. Most notably, though, my skin is so much clearer. I think I know why: A dermatologist once told me that when skin is dehydrated, it won’t produce more water but it can produce more oil to compensate. Oil and dead skin cells are a recipe for breakouts, but seeing as my skin seems to be making less of the stuff while using this serum, it’s perhaps not as prone to clogged pores.  They say that the best skincare products are the ones you enjoy using. I look forward to applying this every morning and evening because it feels like a comfort blanket for my otherwise tight, parched skin. At $15, it’s the cheapest product in my skincare routine currently, but if you ask me — and the dermatologists who sing ectoin’s praises — it’s arguably the most hardworking for dry, dehydrated skin.  Just like the brand’s ceramide moisturizer, I have a feeling that Hydro-Barrier is going to become a staple in my skincare routine this winter and beyond.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/nail-art-manicure-trends-2025?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "The year might not be over just yet but with my New Year’s Eve nails all booked, I’m looking ahead to 2025 to collect ideas for my January manicure. And while 2024 has more than delivered on amazing trends to take inspiration from (I’m talking glass nails, chrome manicures and fresh takes on French tips), I’m glad to report that next year looks even better when it comes to incredible nail looks. Whether you’re into a minimalist manicure or bedazzled nail art with all the trimmings, 2025 looks set to deliver on color, texture and nail health. But don’t take my word for it. I caught up with some of the best nail artists in the business to get their predictions on what lies ahead for our nails next year. Here’s all the inspiration you need. Wellness Nails View this post on Instagram A post shared by Harriet Westmoreland (@harrietwestmoreland) The “clean girl” nail aesthetic has been one of the most enduring nail trends of the last couple of years but in 2025 we’ll see it go one step further with a focus on nail health. “Nail care is evolving, with a focus on health-conscious products that support and protect natural nails,” says Juanita Huber-Millet, founder and creative director of Townhouse. “From breathable polishes to strengthening treatments, consumers are seeking out products designed to provide a nourishing, wellness-led experience that support natural nail growth.” Manucurist’s Active Glow in Raspberry, $19, is a 2-in-1 treatment polish that leaves nails with a rosy sheen while nourishing them with sweet almond oil and raspberry extract. Navy Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) All the nail experts are in agreement: Navy blue will be on everyone’s nails in 2025. “Blues in general will be popular but navy will continue to be a standout color for the upcoming seasons,” says session manicurist Ami Streets. “It’s a chic, deep hue that looks great as an edgier manicure color while still being softer and more elegant than black.” Julia Diogo’s perfectly executed navy nails are timeless. Try Chanel Le Vernis Nail Color in 127 Fugueuse, $32, for a luxurious at-home manicure. Milky Pastels View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) There’s nothing new about pastels, especially in spring and summer, so it’s no surprise that all the experts I spoke to predicted they’ll make a resurgence next year. However, 2025’s iteration is going to be more pared-back than ever. “As we move into spring, I’m expecting milky shades that provide a fresh, [clean] aesthetic to be popular as they look effortlessly beautiful and put-together,” predicts international nail artist and one of Bio Sculpture’s top technicians, Julia Diogo. Her soft lavender manicure in Bio Sculpture Fluttering Lavender, $13, fits the aesthetic perfectly.  Marble Elements View this post on Instagram A post shared by San Sung Kim | 김산성 (@sansungnails) Streets has marbling pinned as a nail trend that’s set to take off in 2025. “Marbling inspired by natural events like the sunrise, skies or the ocean works really well interpreted into nail art looks, so I think this trend will be one to watch,” she says. This marbled take on a sunset by San Sung Kim is so beautiful that it might just be first on my new year manicure wish list.  Tiffany Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jaz (@paintbyjaz) Call it Tiffany blue, turquoise or aqua, this holiday-ready cyan might just be the breakout shade of 2025. Diogo notes the influence of “Tiffany blue taking over recent catwalks” as an indicator of what’s to come, while Streets talks of “aqua blues and greens inspired by the ocean with opalescent or shimmering finishes” emerging as popular choices next year. OPI’s Nail Lacquer in My Dogsled is a Hybrid, $11.99, is a similar sea green to the one used in Jaz’s minimalist double French manicure. Velvet Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Queenie Nguyen | elevated nail artist (@nailartbyqueenie) Texture is going to be huge next year and velvet finishes look set to adorn everyone’s nails. “Texture is really going to take centre stage in 2025 and velvet delivers on both depth and dimension,” explains Huber-Millet. “It’s a subtle yet impactful design that will appeal to those who like more intricate details over ostentatious embellishments.” Queenie Nguyen’s cinnamon velvet nails make for the perfect cosy fall and winter look. Recreate it at home with Beauty Pie’s Wondercolor Nail Polish in Bright Bronze, $14. Micro French View this post on Instagram A post shared by CORRINNA BIANCA | LONDON (@corrinnabianca) Not all of 2025’s nail trends are going to be new; there are plenty of manicure looks that have proved popular this year that experts think will stick around for the long haul. “Minimalist nail art isn’t going anywhere,” declares pro nail artist and educator Jessica White. “Designs like micro French tips have become staples because they’re wearable and versatile.” Corrinna Bianca’s cold brew latte French tips are so delicately painted and chic. Try it yourself (with a steady hand!) using Essie Nail Polish in Odd Squad, $11.10. Three-Dimensional View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Diogo is unequivocal about one thing for 2025: It’s all about dimension. “3D nail art was one of the biggest trends of 2024 and I have no doubt that it will continue to dominate in 2025,” she says. “I’m absolutely loving 3D swirls and outlines right now. It’s a great option for anyone who wants to try something a little playful.” Melanie Graves has shared so many amazing multidimensional manicures this year, but this monochromatic look is particularly cool. Fine Embellishment View this post on Instagram A post shared by Wendy (@mydumbnails) While 3D texture and nail decorations will continue to trend, Streets predicts a shift towards a more minimalist approach to adornment in 2025. “Embellishments will still be super popular but I think that these will be toned down in favor of more refined adornments like pearls and crystals,” she explains. Wendy’s shimmering manicure is both pretty and pared back. Get your hands on Pueen Nail Charms Multi Shapes Nail Art Kit, $5.74, which contains so many beautiful pearls and gems, to create your own version at home. Rich Burgundy View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lauren ✨ (@lolo.nailedit) While linen pastels and milky hues will take off for spring, we can still expect to see deep, rich shades reign supreme in 2025. This year’s obsession with chocolate brown will continue but we’ll see a shift towards merlot and burgundy, as illustrated by Lauren’s sultry red manicure. “Burgundy is going to remain a favorite in 2025,” confirms Diogo. “I’m noticing a lot of buzz around Bio Sculpture’s new Ghost Noir polish [available to licensed professionals only] which is nearly black with deep red undertones for a mysterious yet sophisticated vibe.” Celestial Yellow View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sonia Sanchez | GelX Nail Artist | 818 San Fernando Valley (@klawsbysonia) As we move into summer, experts agree that oranges and yellows are going to be hugely popular for manicures. “Bold orange and energizing yellow colors will really liven up your manicure in 2025’s warmer months,” predicts Streets. But it’s “celestial yellow” that she thinks is going to be everywhere. “Inspired by otherworldly elements like the sun, moon and stars, it’s one to add vibrancy to your nail look,” she says. Try OPI Nail Lacquer in Exotic Birds Do Not Tweet, $11.99, to recreate Sonia Sanchez’s embellished citrus manicure at home. Subtle Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by @yo_keshh “Chrome nails have been everywhere this year but I think they may start to feel overdone as we move into 2025,” says White. She predicts that rather than a “full-coverage chrome finish”, we’ll see a shift towards more subtle chrome accents and softer detailing for a more understated take on the trend. Keshia’s abstract gold chrome tips are the perfect example. Like what you see?

    "description": "For many, the start of a new year signifies a clean slate, a fresh start, and an overall opportunity to reset, both personally and professionally. However, for the beauty enthusiast, the new year is a time to establish new skin-care objectives and glow up. With this fresh start, it's not uncommon to want to redefine your current beauty routines and take the time to explore new products, techniques, tips, and trends in hopes of achieving the best skin possible. In the world of beauty in 2024, many of us fell in love with the \"no volume\" filler Sculptra (it was like getting eight hours of sleep injected into your face), opted to put some bizarre stuff on our faces in the name of beauty (we're looking at you, salmon sperm facials), and got creative with how we used fan-favorite treatments (don't even get us started on the genius that is scalp Botox injections). Curious about what 2025 has in store for our beauty routines? We've chatted with a few beauty pros to get the scoop on the skin-care trends that'll be all over your social media feeds next year.

Upcycled Ingredients As environmental consciousness grows, there's a rising trend in repurposing what was once considered waste into valuable ingredients that offer multiple benefits while helping consumers reduce their environmental impact. \"Upcycled ingredients have been gaining significant traction and will continue to evolve through 2025 and beyond, especially as processing technologies advance,\" Alec Batis, CEO and chemist cofounder of Sweet Chemistry, says. \"The next generation's perception of waste reduction as a form of 'prestige' will be a key driver in this movement.\" Continued Peptide Growth Peptides emerged as the holy grail skin-care ingredient in 2023 and maintained their prominence throughout 2024. Prestigious brands, from Lancôme to Glow Recipe, capitalized on this trend. According to Batis, \"Peptides are having an evolution. The industry had previously been using the same peptide supplier offerings for over two decades, but now there is a focus on developing new ones that can help boost collagen and elastin production and improve skin elasticity, pliability, and firmness.\" Epigenetic Skin Care Our skin, in its infinite wisdom and connection to our DNA, is quite the chatty Cathy when it comes to telling us about our skin-care issues, particularly as we age. The skin-care industry is riding the wave of this chatter, with brands popping up left, right, and center to address those surface-level concerns of epigenetic aging. But remember folks, beauty isn't just a surface sport - it's truly skin-deep. Lucy Goff, founder of LYMA, has developed ground-breaking epigenetic skin science that is able to treat the root causes of aging, not just the superficial signs. \"Our skin care has the highest concentration of active ingredients, hand-picked for their ability to reverse or slow down the causes of skin aging,\" Goff says.

If you're looking to treat hyperpigmentation, moderate acne, or target fine lines and wrinkles, celebrity aesthetician and brand founder Shani Darden agrees that LED light therapy is for you. \"The initial investment can be a little expensive, but over time, it will save money because of the results it produces in keeping skin youthful and glowing,\" Darden says. \"An LED mask is the perfect device to get pro-level anti-aging and skin-clearing benefits at home.\" LED Light Therapy is still keeping its momentum as we approach the new year, particularly in the field of hair growth solutions. Many brands that are trusted for face masks have created helmet or hat versions of their science to allow customers to reap the benefits of red light therapy for the scalp, too. Preventive Botox The trend of getting Botox or a type of neurotoxin before you actually need it is seemingly here to stay in the name of prevention or prejuvenation. According to dermatologist and brand founder Howard Sobel, MD, there is a \"tremendous demand for preventative skin care and Botox among Gen Z patients.\" Gen Z is embracing all types of skin-care treatments and advances that help prevent wrinkles and pigmentation, keeping their skin looking bright and clear.

    "description": "A few weeks ago, I found myself Googling \"salmon sperm face mask.\" I immediately took a second to stop and ask myself, Has my love of beauty gone too far? I wasn't always this way. In fact, just a handful of years ago, I had a minimal skin-care routine that consisted of tap water and a moisturizer my mom introduced me to when I was 13. Back then, I had no idea how to do winged eyeliner (to be honest, I still kind of suck at it), and if you had rattled off the names of five of the most popular beauty brands, I probably wouldn't have recognized a single one. My, how things have changed. These days, I'll do practically anything in the name of good skin, whether it's taking an oral medication, getting beauty treatments like microneedling, or testing out face masks made out of - yep, you guessed it - the sperm of salmon. As in, like, the fish. Have I had sperm on my face one or two times in the past? Sure. But this was an entirely different (and much better, IMO) experience. I'm talking about the viral Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask ($19 for 4). Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask and find out how it worked for me. About the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask It's a color-changing jelly mask that starts pink and becomes transparent. It's made for all skin types. The key ingredients include salmon PRDRN (DNA extracted from salmon sperm) to improve skin's appearance, hydrolyzed collagen to reduce the appearance of fine lines, and niacinamide to brighten and reduce irritation. What I Like About the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask First of all, you're probably wondering what on earth salmon PDRN actually is. Let me explain. Salmon PDRN, or polydeoxyribonucleotides, is a DNA extracted from salmon sperm that's sometimes used in skin-care treatments. You can actually get it injected into your face in the form of a salmon sperm facial - a treatment Jennifer Aniston has road-tested - but I haven't gone quite that far. . . yet. This mask, in particular, is great because of how brightening and hydrating it is. I noticed immediately after my first use that my skin looked more luminous and it felt a lot more moisturized, which is something I'm in desperate need of 24/7 because I'm always battling dry flakes around my nose. How to Use the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask The brand says the mask can be used either overnight or during the day. If you want to use it during the day, apply it after using a toner or a serum, and leave it on for three to four hours or until the mask becomes transparent. If you opt to use it overnight, the brand recommends applying the mask at the end of your nighttime skin-care routine and then sleeping with it on. In the morning, take it off and complete your normal steps. I'm a back sleeper, so using it at night isn't a big deal for me; however, if you toss and turn in your sleep, you may have trouble with it falling off. I've used the mask both ways and saw similarly good results. What to Consider Before Trying the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask One thing to note is that this isn't the type of mask you throw on for 15 minutes before hopping in the shower or leaving for a night out. To get the full benefits, you need to wait until it becomes transparent, which takes a minimum of two hours from my experience. If you don't want to sleep in it, prepare to wear it for a good three to four hours during the day. It's also important to note that while I'm totally obsessed with this mask, it won't actually stimulate collagen production (nor will any other topical skin-care product, for that matter). This is because the molecular weight of collagen is too high to be absorbed by the skin. Hydration, on the other hand? It definitely helps with that. Where the Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask Is Available The Medicube Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask is available on Amazon and the brand's website.
