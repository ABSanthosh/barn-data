If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I consider myself somewhat of a Dyson whisperer at Refinery29; I’ve tested several of its bestselling hair tools (including one for long-haired pets) as well as its debut range of hair styling products, which dropped last year. And as much as my wallet would love to say otherwise, I can confidently say that the brand’s innovations are worth every penny. If you’re looking for a spring hair refresh, look no further: Dyson is kicking spring off with a fresh drop of hair tech, including a new tool that was only recently available for hairstylists: the Supersonic r. You may have seen this hairdryer in salons already, but this pro-exclusive piece of technology is finally available for you to use at home. The Supersonic r (the lowercase r is a nod to the device’s elongated, slightly curved shape) is, in short, a smaller and lighter version of the OG Supersonic, but is truthfully so much more than just a sleek offshoot. The one-of-a-kind shape delivers precise airflow and unparalleled control (when I’ve seen stylists use it, it’s as if the device is an extension of their hand), with an ergonomic design that ensures maximum comfort during use. This matters, regardless of whether you’re styling multiple heads of hair or just your own. Supersonic r™ hair dryer (Ceramic Pink/Rose Gold), $569.99 All buttons have been designed to be within a thumb’s reach (no awkward wielding here), and the r comes with all the attachments you would expect from a Dyson dryer: a concentrator nozzle, wide-tooth comb, flyaway tool, diffuser, and a powerful air attachment to boost airflow. (Also new to the r: A specially-designed motor and smart sensors that automatically tailor the speed and temperature for each attachment.) At $569.99 (a slight increase from the Supersonic Nural’s $499.99 price tag), the Supersonic r is indeed an investment, but one that is bound to pay off in dividends if you’re serious about hair health, DIY salon-quality blowouts, and fewer hand cramps in 2025. But that’s not all: Dyson not only unveiled the Supersonic r in a gorgeous shade of matte pale pink with rose metallic accents (a from-the-vault colorway that was offered in a limited run a year ago), but has reimagined its entire suite of hair tools in the same ultra-covetable colorway. In other words, if you haven’t yet treated yourself to the Airwrap, Supersonic Nural, or Airstrait, now’s your chance to shop it in its prettiest hue yet — while they’re still in stock.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gel-polish-addiction-biab-nails-manicure?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Over lunch recently, a friend casually mentioned that her nails hurt when they’re bare: “They just don’t feel right without gel polish on them,” she told me. “It’s like they ache.”  At first, I brushed it off, but then I remembered how alien my own nails felt after getting my builder gel removed a few weeks before. I couldn’t wash my hair, type, or use my phone without wincing. It wasn’t just that my nails were naked; they felt exposed. It got me thinking — have we become too reliant on gel polish to the point where our nails don’t feel like our nails without it? A quick Google search confirms that my friend and I aren’t alone in experiencing this strange sensation. TikTok user Melodee Rose Miller describes her bare nails as feeling “so disgusting” after removing polish, while Sincerely Her jokes that undone nails make her feel “sick to her stomach”. Meanwhile, in the r/RedditLacqueristas thread on Reddit, one user asks why their nails feel sore without polish — sparking a handful of comments from people who totally get it. Like me, countless others struggle to give their nails a break for more than a few weeks before giving in to the urge for a fresh set. Could this dependence on gel polish be considered an addiction of sorts? Can you be addicted to gel nails or BIAB? If social media is any indication, “gel polish addiction” is a burgeoning topic. But is it really addiction? The Cambridge Dictionary defines “addiction” as “an inability to stop doing or using something, especially something harmful”, with drugs and alcohol as examples. Gel manicures, however, are not mentioned. Today, though, the word is used more casually, with people saying they’re addicted to anything from matcha lattes to TikTok.  Gel polish typically contains ingredients like polymers and monomers (which help it harden under UV light) and pigments for color, but none of these ingredients are inherently harmful or would cause dependency for your nails. But luxury manicurist and content creator Lois Elias is convinced that gel polish addition is a “real thing.” She explains, “There are a lot of people who don’t like the way that their hands look without gels; I had a new client recently who hadn’t seen their natural nails in over three years.”  Metta Francis, a London-based nail expert and founder of Nails by Mets, shares that potential clients have approached her for gel nails despite experiencing painful gel allergies or being advised against them for medical reasons. “It seems crazy — and the answer is, of course, no — but I guess that’s what happens when you have an addiction,” she says.   What exactly is inside gel polish? Juanita Huber-Millet, founder and creative director at Townhouse, hasn’t heard the topic described as an “addiction” before, but notes that many Townhouse clients struggle with taking a break from their gels or Builder in a Bottle (BIAB). “For many of us, our nails are a significant part of our identity,” says Huber-Millet. “They help us control how we present ourselves to the world. Removing that marker can feel very exposing and confidence-shaking.” Huber-Millet recalls a recent conversation with chartered psychologist Dr. Louise Goddard-Crawley, who confirmed that visual cues — particularly painted nails — are crucial for self-confidence. “Having manicured nails is a form of constant reinforcement,” Dr. Goddard-Crawley explained, adding, “it [creates] a feedback loop of positive self-perception.” This is before considering “nail privilege” — the idea that people with manicured nails are treated better by others.  Beyond boosting confidence, Huber-Millet says that her clients view manicures as a form of self-care, offering not only a moment of relaxation but a boost to overall well-being. Francis agrees: “Having your nails done is like pampering, and it’s something you can enjoy for a good few weeks,” she says. “Every time you look down at your nails, that perfect shade or bespoke nail art you chose can bring a smile to your face.”  It’s no surprise we keep chasing that high, but Huber-Millet isn’t convinced that “addiction” is the right word for regular self-care or a passion for healthy nails — unless, of course, your monthly manicure is putting you in debt. Why do nails hurt — or feel weird — without any polish? Regardless of semantics, one question remains: Why do nails sometimes feel sore or uncomfortable without polish — gel or otherwise?  “This can happen after gel polish removal if the [process] has been aggressive,” says Francis, but that’s not the sole reason. “If nails have been soaked in acetone, they become temporarily dehydrated and fragile,” she adds. “Damage and sensitivity can also be caused by over-filing or buffing the nails, for example, with a hand file or electric file, or by excessive pressure with metal hand tools.”  Any painful feeling should not be normalized, says Elias. “If this is the case, your nails have likely been thinned down over time with a drill, or the gel was forcefully removed, taking layers of natural nail with it,” she explains. Your gel polish should never be removed by drilling right down to the natural nail, says Elias: “It should always be soaked off using acetone following removal of 80 to 90% of the gel first. This will minimize the amount of time your nails are exposed to the acetone and any subsequent brittleness.” Choosing a properly qualified nail technician is essential. However, even if your gel polish was removed correctly, Francis notes that your nails may still feel strange after weeks — or even months — of wearing gels, as they simply aren’t used to being “naked.” She adds, “They might even feel weaker because they no longer have a strong, protective coating.” Do nails really need to “breathe”? If you want to improve your nail health, should you take regular breaks?  “Unless you need to take a financial break or want to check in on the health of your natural nails, there’s no need to quit gel polish for any length of time,” says Huber-Millet. Francis agrees, as long as proper aftercare is followed, including daily cuticle oil application and not waiting too long between appointments. Contrary to popular belief, nails don’t “breathe”, either, says Elias. “Most of the nutrients come from within the body,” she explains. “If your nails are in good condition, then there’s no need to take a break. However, if your nails are constantly feeling weak or being over-filed, then it might be a good idea to leave them bare for a while — and perhaps consider finding a new nail tech.” What about BIAB? “BIAB was designed to be infilled, but I remove it every three to four sessions to start fresh and check the nail health,” says Elias. Repeatedly infilling nails is a job for a qualified nail technician. “It’s important that all lifting is removed,” says Elias. “If not, water can get trapped underneath the nail, causing a bacteria growth called pseudomonas.” As expected, TikTok is flooded with stories of botched infills and pseudomonas infections, also referred to as “greenies,” owing to the color. “Tinted or colored builder gels can mask a multitude of nail sins, so opt for a clear builder where possible,” suggests Elias. What is the “naked” manicure?  The expert consensus is that constantly getting gel polish and BIAB isn’t inherently “bad” for your nails unless you’re allergic to them or they’re applied by an unqualified person. But we’re currently witnessing the rise of the “naked” manicure — essentially minimalist nail treatments that enhance the natural appearance of nails. Think clear and nude polish or nail tints, which boast just a hint of color.  On nail health, Francis and Huber-Millet recommend a professional IBX treatment, which helps toughen and protect the nail from within. “The product penetrates the nails to repair the keratin and immediately makes them feel stronger,” says Francis. For at-home use, Francis suggests a nail treatment or strengthener like Essie To The Rescue, $12, CND Rescue RxX, $20, or BioSculpture Ethos Lavender Base, $13.60. The jury is still out on whether our love for gel polish can be considered an addiction, but one thing is clear: Above all, our nails serve as a form of personal expression and well-being. Ultimately, achieving a balance between nail health and a set you love is key. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/biodance-collagen-mask-review-49386172",
    "description": "As someone who spends a lot of time on TikTok (and I mean a lot), I've found myself more than a little susceptible to testing out products and hacks that come across my FYP. For the most part, the things I've decided to try have been winners (like almost every single hair hack), but there have been a few questionable trends I've had to forgo (like using hemorrhoid cream for undereye bags). Recently, I've been seeing an overnight collagen face mask, the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask ($19) for 4, all over my social media feeds - both TikTok and Instagram alike. People trying it out would go to bed with what looked like a regular sheet mask on their face, but they'd wake up with what looked like a clear snakeskin on that they needed to peel it off. I really wasn't sure if the mask was legit, and I especially wasn't sure if the results were real because everyone woke up with perfect glass skin. Of course, I had to try it, and I won't lie - the results are just as good as everyone says they are. And if you're one of those people that isn't swayed in the slightest by TikTok, know that the mask has over 2,500 five-star reviews on Amazon as well. Right now, you can get it 30 percent off as an early Black Friday deal on Amazon, and it's the perfect time to stock up on a hydrating booster for your winter skin-care routine. Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask and find out why it's an automatic re-purchase for me, especially during Black Friday. About the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask This product is a sheet mask that is meant to be worn overnight. It's formulated for all skin types. The key ingredients include low molecular weight fish collagen, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. It's available in two different packaging sizes: a four-count or a 16-count. What I Like About the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Although I've seen this mask used tons of times on social media, I still wasn't entirely sure how it worked. It starts out as an opaque mask that has almost a silicone-like feel to it, but when you wake up in the morning, it's transparent and needs to be peeled off. The first time I tried it, I put it on before bed, popped a melatonin, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I was shocked to see that the mask had, in fact, completely changed. It looked like I was wearing a clear mask instead. I've used it three times since I initially purchased a pack of four. Once when my skin was fairly normal, once when I was experiencing some annoying breakouts, and once when I had a massive sunburn on my face. I'm genuinely not sure how, but the mask seemed to help with all of my skin issues. I find it to be ultra-hydrating, and it hasn't bothered my acne-prone skin or exacerbated any breakouts. I fully plan on continuing to purchase this mask and use it once a week, especially the night before a date or a special event. Just a heads up, however, this collagen face mask won't actually stimulate collagen production because the molecular weight of collagen is too high to be absorbed by the skin. It will, however, help with hydration. How to Use the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask You can use this mask two different ways. The first is as an overnight mask. For that, the brand recommends applying the mask at the end of your skin-care routine, leaving it on overnight, then removing it in the morning. It comes in two pieces - a top half and a bottom half - but it doesn't matter which piece you put on first. If you want to use it during the day, prep your skin with a toner or serum, apply the mask, and leave it on for at least three to four hours - once it becomes transparent, you can remove it. Personally, I've only used the mask overnight. I use a gentle cleanser to wash my face, and then I apply it directly to clean dry skin. In the morning, I peel it off and wash my face with lukewarm water. From there, I apply my moisturizer. What to Consider Before Trying the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Since this mask is most typically applied overnight, it does take a little getting used to. I've been training myself to sleep on my back as of late, so going to bed with a slippery sheet mask on my face wasn't too hard. However, if you put it on and try to do other things - like bend over - just know that the mask could very well come sliding off. If you're a side or a stomach sleeper, I'd recommend trying this mask out during the day because it will probably be too difficult to keep it on your face while you're in bed. Where Is the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Available? You can purchase the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask from Amazon.

    "description": "We don't know about you, but for us, if we're having a good hair day, it feels like nothing can stop us. It doesn't matter if the look took us hours to achieve or just a few minutes; there's nothing better than a G.H.D. (good hair day). We love a beachy look done with a curling iron, a fun blowout styled with a blowdryer brush, or even a simple air-dried look that's been made more cohesive with the help of some no-heat hair hacks. However, the days when our hair looks like it belongs to a supermodel and didn't take us longer than twenty minutes to achieve are the days we're most excited. On those days, we almost always used hot rollers. Hot rollers are great because you can pop them in and multitask. Whether you need to finish your makeup, fire off a work email, or finish cleaning the house before guests come over, they essentially do all the hard work for you, and you don't have to lift a finger. The hair tool has been around forever, but they recently had a resurgence in popularity thanks to hot roller content on TikTok. Not only will they give your hair tons of volume, but the curls they produce will last for hours as well. There are plenty of different options on the market, and ahead, we're breaking down the best options out there. Whether you're looking for the best hot rollers for long hair or the best hot rollers for damaged hair, we've got you covered. Keep scrolling to check out all of our picks.",
