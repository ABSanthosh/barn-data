    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunny-poudel-dental-student-makeup-creativity?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it’s a source of strength, creativity, and expression. In our series Power Faces, we’ll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear — or not. In partnership with NYX, our latest subject is Sunny Poudel, a Nepalese American beauty content creator and dental student. This story was told to Fawnia Soo Hoo and edited for length and clarity. When I moved halfway across the world from Nepal to Falls Church, Virginia at 14 years old, the first friend I made was a girl named Lily. I had this little drugstore lip gloss and she asked me what it was — and then: “Can I use it?” So I shared it with her. That was how makeup started for me — as a way to connect and make friends.  In Nepal, I played around with makeup, but for the most part, it was reserved for special occasions. When I moved to the states, I felt out of place, insecure, different as a person of color living in a predominantly white area and going to a school where no one looked like me — so I hid behind makeup. Eyeliner was the only makeup my parents allowed me to wear to school, and I remember going to the CVS near my house to buy my first — NYX caught my attention because it was affordable and accessible. Looking back at pictures, my foundation was about 20 shades too light, but at the time, it made me feel better about myself. It felt like I was taking care of myself. Then I quickly realized makeup was a way to bond with others, and I started to do my friends’ makeup.  And it was a way to connect with my mom, too. I used to basically force my little sister to let me do her makeup — she was my muse — and my mom would reprimand me and say, “You can’t buy makeup; you shouldn’t do this to her.” Eventually, my mom started to ask me if I could do her makeup for her, especially if she had events to go to. My dad, though, yelled at me for wearing makeup. “You need to focus on school,” he’d say. “You’re not gonna get anywhere if you’re putting on makeup.” But when I started dental school, he realized that makeup — and being creative — helps me deal with stress. And it allows me the opportunity to meet people in a completely different industry. Now, he’s incredibly supportive. He gets it now. Growing up, I knew I wanted to be in healthcare. As an immigrant daughter, I was the one translating at doctor’s appointments for my mother, explaining things to her in a way that made sense. I saw how overwhelming it could be to navigate the healthcare system without that support. I wanted to be part of a field where I could provide that help. For me, dentistry isn’t just about fixing teeth — it’s about representation, combined with a deeper sense of purpose to help people. At the same time, I was a super artistic child, and I began to post makeup looks and upload YouTube videos, not really knowing where that would lead. When I came to New York to pursue my dental career, I started posting more consistently, because the city inspires me. People say New York is the place where all your dreams come true, and I know it’s corny, but it’s true. I’m in a city where so many things can be true, where all my dreams can come true. Why do I have to give one up for the other? Both dentistry and makeup are equally important to me, and both are a true reflection of who I am. In dentistry, there are rules, guidelines, and a specific way things are supposed to be done. Everything has to be precise and follow an exact order. You’re working in millimeters. As much as I love the structure and organization, I also don’t want to think about it after a long day at school. When I come home, I get to be creative. I get to try something different and fun. With makeup, there are no rules. I’m free to create and let things take shape however they want. Because of that, it takes the pressure off. I’m free to “mess up.” And sometimes when I do “mess up,” it leads me to a whole new makeup look I hadn’t planned. I love that makeup lets me express myself without any limitations. Makeup is my break from school, and, when I’m in school, it’s my break from everything else. It’s like turning off one part of my brain when I’m doing the other. One helps balance the other out.  Honestly, I’m not sure if I would love makeup if I was doing it all the time. But the fact that I focus on it at such a specific time allows me to be more creative. Here’s an example: I saw some photos of people with bleached eyebrows. I loved the look, so I tried it and shared it with my audience. Not everyone liked it on me, but who cares? It was fun. So much of my inspiration comes from seeing makeup on people who don’t look like me and wanting to know how it’ll look on me.  Before, I used to stick with one makeup look. Now, I want to push myself out of my comfort zone, to experiment with trends and ideas I wouldn’t normally try. Whenever I want to experiment with colorful, creative looks, I always turn to NYX for inspiration — the brand is such a great source for ideas and creativity. I did a red lip for the first time, and I loved it; I immediately felt like a boss woman. And that’s the beauty of it all: I love that the way I perceive myself changes based on what makeup I’m wearing. And I still love the fact that makeup brings people together. It’s been that way my whole life, and it’s how I made one of my closest friends at dental school. We were at a party in our first year, and she was upset. She wanted to go home because she thought she looked oily. I said to her, “Girl, I have my beauty powder right here.”  It was the first time we met, and we laugh about it to this day. “How were you so comfortable just blotting my face?” she asked me recently. And I replied, “Because I saw you needed it.” I love that about makeup. Shop Sunny’s makeup look: Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Every makeup routine needs a finishing touch that secures the whole look and pulls it together - that finishing touch is a setting spray. Whether you're dealing with sweat, heat, creasing, or oily skin, a good setting spray can help keep your makeup looking fresh for longer. \"Priming sprays are a bit more skin-care-focused and offer more texture for a smooth surface,\" Allen Goldman, CEO of Skindinavia, says. \"Finishing sprays are about a healthy, luminous look and extended wear.\" A makeup setting spray is the last step in your routine that helps give your complexion and base makeup a blended, flawless look while protecting and preserving it for long-lasting wear. Setting sprays use special polymers to seal your makeup in place, creating a breathable mesh on top. Investing in a quality setting spray made for your skin type and needs can be more effective in making your makeup last longer than a primer might. We rounded up the best setting sprays on the market. We found top-tier picks, including the product responsible for keeping Beyoncé looking fresh, the bestselling Urban Decay All Nighter Setting Spray, and others from brands like Morphe, Charlotte Tilbury, and more. Shop all of our top best makeup setting spray picks ahead.",

    "description": "As a teen, I was guilty of the upper- and lower-lid black eyeliner look to make my blue eyes stand out. Sure, it was effective, but it's also an intense vibe that I think made my eyes appear smaller. Now, my grown-up self relies on more subtle techniques, especially for everyday wear. My biggest flex these days? Brown mascara. For nighttime, my go-to is the YSL Lash Clash Volume Mascara in brown, but it's a little too high-impact for daytime looks. For a more low-key style, I'm obsessed with the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Lengthening and Volumizing Mascara ($45) in brown. If you have blue eyes like me or just want to experiment with a softer look, keep reading to find out why the Westman Atelier formula has stood out from the brown-mascara pack. About the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara Westman Atelier is owned by celebrity makeup artist Gucci Westman. The formula is buildable and volumizing. The clean formula features carnauba and candelilla waxes for an ultra-creamy texture, shea butter to nourish and protect, and plant-derived ester for the rich brown pigment. The brush has an hourglass shape made from a plant-based filament. This mascara is vegan, gluten-free, and cruelty-free. What I Like About the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara You probably already guessed this, but I'm partial to this mascara because it's not overly dramatic. It leaves a soft touch, basically giving the effect of my natural lashes, just slightly enhanced. The brown pigment is also the perfect shade. I've had trouble with other brown mascaras in the past because they were too light, meaning they created more of a statement than I wanted. The Westman Atelier shade is a bit darker so it's nearly black, but a touch more delicate. I've also found that I can wear it on my lower lashes without coming off as too vampy - something I struggle with when using black mascaras. In that same vein, while this formula isn't technically waterproof, I've worn it (accidentally) during a hot yoga class with very little transfer - simply a tiny smudge that was probably only noticeable to me. Pretty impressive for a clean formula. Finally, it doesn't flake and comes off seamlessly, without pulling my lashes or leaving my eyes feeling dried out. Overall, this is the perfect everyday brown mascara - no notes. How to Use the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara Personally, I don't think there's a way to go wrong with mascara, especially one that starts out with a light touch and can be built up. Westman herself suggests one swipe is all I need for a natural look. I usually opt for a single layer after curling my lashes since I like the subtle look. What to Consider Before Trying the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara If you have sensitive eyes that are sometimes reactive to natural products, you might want to try a sample before committing. If you're searching for a fully waterproof formula, this probably will fall short of your expectations; same goes for if you're aiming for an ultra-dramatic vibe. Where Is the Westman Atelier Eye Want You Brown Mascara Available? The Westman Atelier mascara is available at a number of retailers: Westman Atelier, Sephora, Credo Beauty, Goop, Nordstrom, and Violet Grey.
