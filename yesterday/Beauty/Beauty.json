    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/brad-pitt-tattoo-meanings-48891818",
    "description": "Friendly reminder: Brad Pitt is exceedingly tattooed. The actor has done a decent job hiding his ink on set and at events, but amid all of the press surrounding his new movie \"F1,\" we were reminded of his extensive tattoo collection. Pitt goes shirtless in the movie, and his torso is covered with quite a few pieces that have never before been seen. Prior to this, in July of 2022, during the \"Bullet Train\" premiere in Berlin, Pitt wore a linen skirt revealing several shin tattoos previously not clocked by the public. As it turns out, the leg tattoos are part of a collection of at least 15 individual tattoos Pitt has gotten over the years. Pitt's leg tattoos largely seem to consist of various skull illustrations, while sprawling across his upper body are poems, song lyrics, and tributes to his family. It seems Angelina Jolie, who herself has plenty of body art, inspired many of the tattoos Pitt received during their 11-year relationship. For example, one forearm bears the initials of his six children, as well as his ex-wife. But Pitt also has many seemingly random scribblings we may never know the meaning behind, like a thin line on his hand, or the motorbike on his bicep. Ahead, read our breakdown of Pitt's many tattoos that's as comprehensive as currently possible. Related: 7 Fall Tattoo Ideas to Consider Before Your Next Appointment",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/laneige-lip-sleeping-mask-review-48879903",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy Very few cult-favorite beauty products have brought me as much joy as the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask ($24). Ever since laying my hands on a little tub of it for the first time years ago, it's remained a staple on my bedside table, in my handbag, and on my work desk, just to name a few spots I have them stashed. (Yes, I proudly own several flavors.) I'm obsessed with everything about this lip mask, from its pretty pink packaging to its hydrating, non-sticky texture. The lip mask is available in classic flavors like Berry and Vanilla, but occasionally, Laneige throws a limited-edition one into the mix. They unveiled Pink Lemonade Swirl in May 2022 (and fans are begging for its return now that it's unavailable) and in 2024, they launched holiday flavors Candy Cane Swirl and Eggnog Latte. With a reputation as one of the best lip masks on the market, the product has become a viral sensation - PS editors love it, beauty influencers love it, and the hydrating product even boasts a few celebrity fans. Charli XCX called it one of her everyday essentials in an interview with British GQ - perfect for brat summer and beyond - and Ashley Park named it her sleeping must have in an interview with PS. As you might guess, I wasted no time in getting my hands on these tubs, and I can confidently say that they have become new staples in my everyday routine. Ahead, you can read my full review of the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, and see why it's worth the hype. About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask The formula first made its debut in the US in 2015 with its bestselling flavor, Berry. Each mask is formulated with hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisture-locking glycerin, and skin-protecting antioxidants. It comes in four core flavors: the original Berry, Sweet Candy, Vanilla, and Gummy Bear. But the brand releases limited edition seasonal flavors, like Watermelon Pop and Mango for the summer, and Candy Cane Swirl and Eggnog Latte for the winter. What I Like About the Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask Image Source: PS Photography / Anvita Reddy I've always been the type of person who reaches for fruity scents over the sweet ones, and Pink Lemonade Swirl and Mango were just as delectably summery as I had hoped. The Mango flavor captures the fruit's smell perfectly and the Pink Lemonade Swirl is like sipping on a refreshing glass of the real deal. (I know this sounds annoyingly cliché, but I'm telling it like it is - I swear.) As for what it looks and feels like: it's a lusciously thick formula with a silky-soft texture and a glossy finish. I agree with our former content director, Macy Cate Williams, who reviewed the original Berry formula and said: \"This lip mask isn't sticky or uncomfortable - it glides on smoothly and feels very soothing on my lips.\" Like her, I'm also a fan of using it instead of a regular lip balm throughout the day. The tiniest amount goes a long way, so even with multiple applications daily, it lasts a while. What to Consider Before Buying Laneige Lip Sleeping Masks One important factor to keep in mind is the cost. At $24, this balm comes with a higher price tag and it's worth noting that there are comparable products available at a lower cost. However, the masks' sleek and visually appealing packaging, which has gained significant attention on TikTok with over 250 million views (!) for videos tagged with #laneigelipmask, likely contributes to their premium price point. It ultimately comes down to personal preference and budget when deciding whether the investment is worthwhile. While I don't make it a habit to purchase these on a regular basis, I do treat myself to one occasionally as a special indulgence - and I urge you to do so, too. Where Are Laneige's New Lip Sleeping Masks Available? Laneige's new Lip Sleeping Masks are available direct-to-consumer from the brand's website, as well as at Amazon and Sephora.

    "description": "To paraphrase Lana Del Rey, there’s something special about hot summer nights in July. Whether it’s sipping a spritz on a sunny balcony with friends or reading in the park after a day at work, the warm nights are here — and we’re cherishing every single one.The most glamorous place to be enjoying the sun, though, has been Men’s Paris Fashion Week, with hordes of celebrities flocking to the European capital for a slice of summer style inspo. From Jacquemus showing its Spring/Summer 2026 collection in L’Orangerie at the Château de Versailles to Dior borrowing paintings from the Louvre for an art museum-inspired extravaganza for Jonathan Anderson's creative director debut, the shows have been attended by some of the industry’s most famous faces.For the latter, the guest list included fashion It couple ASAP Rocky and Rihanna, with the pregnant A-lister styling a mint waistcoat and classic white shirt with pearls, yellow-lensed sunglasses, and a wavy updo. Sabrina Carpenter was also in attendance, opting for a preppy skirt suit set and a side-swept fringe complete with a statement barrette.  But it was perhaps Pharrell’s Louis Vuitton show that caused the biggest stir on the internet, when Beyoncé arrived in a full Cowboy Carter-inspired double denim outfit, accessorized with a big blond blowdry, cowboy hat, Western buckled belt, and feathery brown jacket.While our invites might have been lost in the post, there’s still plenty of serious fashion and beauty moments to get involved with over the coming month. To take a look at all the best launches coming up this July, click through the slideshow ahead. Cecilie Bahnsen x Asics SportStyle Gel-Cumulus ShoeAs part of a new Signature Series, Asics has chosen frequent collaborator Cecilie Bahnsen as the first designer to reinterpret an iconic silhouette from the sportswear brand. Known for her hyper-feminine puff-sleeved dresses and full skirts, the collaboration sees the Danish designer add her ethereal touch to the Gel-Cumulus 16 SSCB sneaker. Available in three colorways (black, gray, and butter yellow), the design combines transparent materials, floral prints, and a flower lace toggle.Available to shop at Cecilie BahnsenCecilie Bahnsen x ASICS GEL-CUMULUS 16 SSCB SNEAKERS, $, available at Cecilie BahnsenPrada Balm in Banana YellowInspired by the banana print in Prada's Spring/Summer 2011 collection, the fashion house is now bringing the sunshine yellow motif into its beauty lineup. Teased in Sabrina Carpenter's \"Manchild\" music video, the bright yellow bullet offers a sheer but sunny look, with the golden flecks effortlessly creating a juicy finish on lips or dewy cheeks depending on where you apply it. Enriched with moisturizing jojoba oil and infused with a sweet banana scent, this balm is about to be the coveted handbag staple of the summer. Available on July 8th at PradaLevi’s Brand x NikeThis summer, Levi’s and Nike are joining forces to make the shoe of the summer: Air Max 95s in distressed blue denim. Additionally offering the iconic silhouette in ecru and black (complete with red Levi’s label), the collaboration also includes a light-wash trucker jacket and baggy jeans with Nike swoosh embroidery. Plus, the shoes come with red, black, and white laces so you can choose the look that fits best with your aesthetic.Available to shop on July 10 at Levi'sCharlotte Tilbury Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil It’s summer and that means one thing: juicy lips. If you’re searching for a nostalgic hit, look no further than Charlotte Tilbury’s latest offering — a squeezy tube lip gloss. Available in six fruity fragrances from strawberry to coconut water, the lip oils lend a sheer tint and contain skin-boosting ingredients like hydrating hyaluronic acid, moisturizing vitamin E, and antioxidant-rich fruit oils that also give a shiny, hydrated finish to the lips. Our favorite is Juicylicious Cherry Glaze for a subtle just-bitten lip look.Available to shop on July 10 at Charlotte Tilbury Uniqlo Launches Third Studio Ghibli CollaborationBack in 2022, Uniqlo and cinematic powerhouse Studio Ghibli joined forces to create their first collaborative collection. Now, the popular Japanese label is back with a third drop showcasing artwork from some of the studio’s most beloved films. Featuring 14 pieces, the collection includes a T-shirt with leafy bird imagery from The Boy and The Heron, a gray My Neighbour Totoro sweatshirt, and a pink ombre Tale of Princess Kaguya T-shirt. Bonus: The collection has a matching kids collection for those shopping for little ones, too.   Available to shop on July 10 at UniqloCeraVe Balancing Air Foam CleanserFrom the spot-busting SA Smoothing Cleanser to the creamy Hydrating Cleanser, CeraVe’s face washes are affordable and effective. Now, the wallet-friendly brand is launching the Balancing Air Foam Cleanser, which pulls oil, dirt, and impurities out of the skin \"like a magnet.\" Using glycolysine cleansing technology, the foam formula promises 24-hour hydration (thanks to ceramides and allantoin), meaning it won’t strip the skin barrier — all while providing eight-hour oil control. Available to shop now at UltaCeraVe Balancing Air Foam Facial Cleanser, $, available at UltaHuda Beauty Lip Contour StainA well-defined lip is a must and nothing takes the chore out of application like a felt-tip brush.

Available in eight different shades, the product contains moisturizing argan oil and promises 12-hour wear thanks to its highly pigmented formula.

The latest iteration of the beloved styler is powered by Dyson’s fastest and most powerful motor yet: the Hyperdymium™ 2. Giving users twice the air pressure (helping to wrap hair more easily), the new tool also promises to dry hair as fast as a full-performance hairdryer — but it’s the brand's most lightweight design yet. Even better, there are six attachments for different style options, and each one connects to the MyDyson™ app with the new i.d. Curl™ feature. This helps deliver consistent curls by automatically adjusting heat and airflow. Available to shop on July 8 at DysonAsos x Adidas Capsule - Embargo 3rd JulyBlending bespoke fabrics, embroidery and new colorways, the new Adidas x Asos collaboration puts a streetwear spin on the former’s key archive silhouettes.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tanning-bed-addiction-skin-risks?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  “I’ll just do a few sessions on a tanning bed to build a base tan before my holiday,” I told myself earlier this year. The results weren’t instant, unlike the self-tanners I’ve used for over a decade, but after a few visits, my skin looked golden. I enjoyed the somewhat lasting glow that didn’t leave me looking like a slice of Dutch crunch bread after four days. I planned to stop going to the tanning salon once I returned home, but the allure of tanned skin was hard to resist. What started as building a vacation base tan — which dermatologists argue is actually a myth — quickly turned into, “I’ll keep going so I’m tanned for my birthday,” then, “I might as well continue over summer. A few more weeks won’t hurt.” Before I knew it, I was clocking up more minutes at the tanning salon than I could count. But here’s the thing: I know the potentially life-threatening risks of using tanning beds. I know that using tanning beds increases the risk of developing skin cancer, including melanoma, and that, as reported by the Skin Cancer Foundation, more than 419,000 cases of skin cancer in the US each year are linked to indoor tanning. I’m not alone in knowing the risks. In a survey conducted by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), 20% of Gen Z adults said that getting a tan is more important to them than preventing skin cancer. But exactly why do we continue?  Tanning is addictive and there’s actually a biological explanation.Dr Clare Kiely, consultant dermatologist Why do we think a tan makes us more attractive? Dr. Ravi Gill, a practitioner psychologist at Smart Mind Health, says that beauty ideals such as ‘tanned equals attractive’ can override our instinct for self-protection: “This is due to powerful social and psychological influences,” says Dr. Gill. Adding, “From a young age, we’re exposed to messages — through media, peers and culture — that link tanned skin with attractiveness, status, and health. Over time, these ideas are internalized and tied to our self-worth and identity.” Lisa, 32, can certainly relate. She used a tanning bed for the first time at just 17 years old after a friend said it would “look good” to have tanned skin. “I was curious, so I decided to give it a try,” she tells me, adding that body insecurities are a reason she still uses them: “When I’m tanned, the spider veins and cellulite on my legs, which you don’t see much of on social media, are less visible,” she says. “That makes me feel more confident. I get compliments as well, which is motivation to continue.”  Interestingly, tanning isn’t the only example of how we’re trading safety for self-esteem. This notion can also be applied to many of our aesthetic practices, like unregulated Botox and BBLs, which have a notoriously high mortality rate in comparison to other cosmetic procedures. Shedding light on this, Dr. Gill explains that humans crave social acceptance and fear rejection, choosing to conform to beauty norms — even when they involve risks: “The desire for social belonging and approval often feels more immediate and emotionally powerful than long-term health concerns,” she says. While I think tanning makes me look better in many ways, I feel particularly conflicted about the damage it’s doing thanks to my medical history: I’ve always had a few questionable moles. The fact that I use tanning beds is something I’m quite embarrassed about. Concerningly, Lisa tells me that she fears skin aging more than skin cancer: “Ironically, I’ve curated a social media feed full of skinfluencers teaching me how to look after my skin, and I’ve honed a [multi-step] skincare routine. Yet I continue to do the one thing that will damage my skin the most — something which no amount of serum or SPF can save me from.” Lisa’s honesty, or as she puts it, “silliness”, might seem extreme to some, but it reveals a deeper truth: decades of messaging have taught us that our value lies in our appearance. Thanks to the popularity of Ozempic alongside the return of thinness on red carpets and For You Pages (which notably prompted the ‘skinnytok’ hashtag ban), being slim is back on a pedestal — and tanning plays a role here. I’ve often found myself commenting on how much ‘slimmer’ I look with a tan, and who can blame me? Shows like Love Island have helped solidify the idea that bronzed skin doesn’t just look “better” but also leaner and more sculpted — like contouring for your whole body. Is tanning bad for you? While I think tanning makes me look better in many ways, I feel particularly conflicted about the damage it’s doing thanks to my medical history. I’ve always had a few questionable moles. Some are asymmetric, others have jagged borders and a range of colors. On holiday, when my skin is exposed in a bikini, friends and family have commented on it and encouraged me to get checked out. After spending time living in Australia, where UV levels are very high, I decided to follow through on this. I wasn’t a tanning bed user at the time of my first (or second) mole check, but doctors did flag that the Sydney sunshine could have put my skin at risk. After an examination of my moles, I was advised to keep an eye on them and return if I saw any “noticeable changes”.  In the years since those checks, I’ve observed a handful of changes to some of my moles. But as someone with health anxiety, I never know if I’m being paranoid or if I really should go back to the doctor. Consequently, I’m in limbo — I don’t want to waste my doctor’s time if the changes I’ve seen aren’t “noticeable” enough, but I also don’t want to ignore the issue and end up in a potentially life-threatening situation. Taking all of this into consideration, the fact that I use tanning beds probably sounds absurd. Honestly, it’s something I’m quite embarrassed about. Why do we use tanning beds despite the risks? Dr. Gill explains that this is a case of cognitive dissonance, when a person feels psychological discomfort because their actions contradict their beliefs. “In beauty culture, this dissonance is common,” she says, pointing again to societal pressures. “For example, someone may understand the risks of tanning bed use or crash dieting but still engage in these behaviors to align with societal beauty ideals.” Dr. Gill goes on to explain that we try to resolve this internal discomfort by rationalizing our behaviors rather than changing them. Telling ourselves, “It’s just for summer” or “Everyone else is doing it” is an easy way to avoid feelings of guilt. Critics, however, often think that tanning bed users should feel guilty for this choice. But here’s the thing: “Shaming people for using tanning beds often backfires, making them more likely to continue the behavior,” says Dr. Gill. She adds, “Research shows that self-criticism reduces motivation for change, while compassionate, non-judgmental support is more effective in encouraging healthier choices.” But can anyone truly say they’ve always put their health above all else? Like tanning beds, alcohol, processed meat, and tobacco, for example, are classed as type one carcinogens — substances that can cause cancer. I’m keen to know whether those who frown on my habit often indulge in a fast food burger or unwind with a bottle of wine. We are watching the number of skin cancers scale out of control in our clinics.Dr Kiely Is tanning addictive? That’s before we bring class into the equation. Research that shows those from lower socio-economic backgrounds are more likely to use tanning beds. Although further investigation is needed to explore why that is, a 2022 study concluded that tanning bed use has been historically framed through the media as a “working-class activity”. Of course, it’s not just about class, appearances or a taste for Sauvignon Blanc; the addictiveness of carcinogens plays a role: “Tanning is addictive and there’s actually a biological explanation,” says Dr. Clare Kiely, a consultant dermatologist and cofounder of The Skin Diary. She explains that when the body is exposed to UV radiation, it triggers a process that results in the release of endorphins, hormones that create a sense of “euphoria”. For many, the glow isn’t just about looking good — it’s about feeling good, too: “I’m normally in a better mood after a tanning bed,” confirms Ella, who agrees this “mood-boosting” effect is a big factor in why people feel addicted to tanning beds. Lisa echoes this, telling me she enjoys the light and “me-time” of being on a tanning bed: “It’s like dreaming myself away to a beach.”  Given how addictive tanning beds are, the responsibility to prevent their damage shouldn’t rest solely on users. Many experts argue that stricter regulation is the only way forward, especially as research shows we continue to tan in spite of the evidence before us. “I don’t believe the current regulations are adequate,” says Dr. Rakesh Anand, a consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson. He notes that while there are restrictions on under-18s and some standards for equipment and usage, there’s still a “significant” public health risk. “Given the well-established link between tanning bed use and skin cancer, stronger measures are urgently needed,” he adds. As for what that might look like, various skin cancer charities have called for tanning beds to have graphic warning signs similar to those found on cigarette packets, while a June 2025 study exposed “potential gaps in current regulations” when it comes to tanning salons marketing on social media.  Whether on a tanning bed in New York or a beach lounger in Mexico, dermatologists are firm in their answer that there’s no such thing as a safe tan — “Unless it’s self-tanner from a bottle,” says Dr. Kiely. She agrees with Dr. Anand that the only way to “eliminate” risk is to ban tanning beds, as they are in countries such as Australia and Brazil: “I’m coming at it as a person who has spent her career cutting out thousands of skin cancers, some of them life-threatening,” Dr. Kiely adds. “We are watching the number of skin cancers scale out of control in our clinics. We must take measures now to protect future generations.” Despite being reminded by every expert of the very real dangers before me, in the time I’ve been writing this article, I’ve racked up another 44 minutes on the tanning beds — although I have reduced the frequency of my visits. I want to stop altogether and pick up my once-beloved self-tanners that are currently collecting dust, but I’m trying to feel less guilt and shame about this habit, as I’ve unpicked how years of societal pressure led me to this point. Ultimately, that’s what needs to change. From Botox to fillers and beyond, we’ve all been sold on the ‘ideal’ appearance, which can differ depending on what we’ve been conditioned into thinking. The recent ban on disposable vapes proves that if people want to do something, they’ll find a way, so we all have to do our part in breaking the cycle when it comes to tanning. Mine is writing this article and being vulnerable about a paradox many of us feel but rarely discuss: the desire to protect our skin while craving the glow of a tan. It would also help to see celebrities and influencers embracing their natural skin tones, and for brands to do the same with the models in their campaigns. Whether it’s a school session or a poster in a tanning salon, better education could also go a long way — not just about the dangers of tanning beds, which clearly isn’t always enough, but about how to resist outside pressure. In learning how to accept ourselves as we are, we might just find the glow hits differently when it comes from within. Like what you see?
