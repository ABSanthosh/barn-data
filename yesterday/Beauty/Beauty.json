Most do the job just fine, but a really good hand cream feels like a lifeline, offering much comfort and relief during the year’s coldest, driest months. The latest one I’m repeatedly reaching for is none other than Drunk Elephant’s Therabu Buttered Reparative Hand Cream. Did Drunk Elephant need to make a hand cream? Probably not — but selfishly, I’m thrilled they did. As the name suggests, the texture is buttery and thick without being greasy. (My twin sister, who’s a tough critic, is already on her second tube.)  Beyond softening and hydrating, I swear it’s evened out my skin tone over weeks of use.  Let’s really get into it. Drunk Elephant Therabu Hand Cream, $24 If you’re a Drunk Elephant stan like moi, the ingredients will look familiar: Marula butter, ceramides, and squalane, along with shea butter and oat flour for extra moisture and soothing power. The warm, soft scent comes from real vanilla extract — no fragrance or essential oils here, staying true to the brand’s “suspicious six” ethos. The best part?  At $24 for a 2.5-ounce tube, it’s one of the brand’s most affordable products, easily competing with pricier luxury options.  As a self-proclaimed hand cream connoisseur, I can confirm that this one goes above and beyond. Its lipids and omega fatty acids smooth fine lines, reinforce the skin barrier and deliver long-lasting hydration. With regular use, my hands feel petal-soft, look brighter, and are better protected against winter’s wrath. In short: This tube is my new winter MVP.  If you’re like me and keep hand cream within arm’s reach — whether at your desk or on your nightstand — you’ll notice that with regular use, your hands feel petal-soft and, dare I say, visibly brighter. (I have a couple of small scars and hyperpigmentation, and after weeks of diligent use, my tone and texture look noticeably improved.) IMO, what truly sets this cream apart is its ability to lock in hydration and shield your skin from winter’s harsh elements — exactly what your hands need after everything they endure daily. A little T.L.C. goes a long way, and your hands deserve it. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Whether you’re in the gym or doing at-home workouts, chances are you’re working up a good sweat. For lots of us, the obvious thing to do afterward is jump in the shower. But do you wash your hair or whip it up into a bun and leave it for another time?  A 2023 study commissioned by dry shampoo brand Batiste found that 44% of women avoid working out to prolong wash days, while 67% of women plan their shampoo days around their activities. For those who don’t wash their hair every day, there are often times when it isn’t due for a shampoo — even post-workout. Other days, you might be feeling lazy or be in a hurry. We know the benefits of a thorough body wash (skin experts say it’s the easiest way to prevent breakouts), but does it matter if you don’t wash the sweat out of your hair every time? If TikTok is anything to go by, plenty of people are asking the question. Beauty creator @hairbykatied on TikTok recently went viral for saying that she blow-dries the sweat out of her hair after a workout — and she isn’t the only one. TikToker Meg Smart also went viral for sharing her post-gym hair hack. “I wanted to show you what my hair looked like after my workout on day 5,” she captioned the video, which has 567.9k views and counting. “It’s sweaty, it’s gross, it’s nasty, but I’m not washing my hair.” Megan uses a hairdryer to “dry the sweat in”. She says: “I know it sounds disgusting. Trust me. Blow-dry your hair ’til completely dry and you will get another day out of it.” @hairbykatied How will they know? @tinecobeauty #hairhacks #hairtalk #blowdryer #tinecostyle ♬ how would they know bad girls club – Chris Gleason TikTokers @shannonjenk, @fitbykiki and @hairby.anniebea also make a case for skipping a water-based shampoo post-workout, with Annie simply opting for a spritz of dry shampoo. Predictably, their videos have amassed plenty of comments. The consensus: Is it not unhygienic to skip washing your hair after exercise? Do you have to wash your hair after exercise? According to Dr Zainab Laftah, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson, sweat and oil can build up after exercise and create a film on the scalp over time. “This can eventually lead to something called seborrheic dermatitis,” says Dr Laftah. “This is caused by build-up of the yeast Malassezia, which appears as redness and scaling on the scalp. Therefore if you have a tendency towards dandruff, it’s best to shower following a workout.” If you don’t have a tendency towards dandruff? It’s unlikely that skipping wash day after one or two workouts is going to do much harm. Dr Hasan Benar, dermatologist and cofounder of drelif.co.uk, says: “Many of us believe that we have to wash our hair and scalp after every workout. But the truth is, how often you wash your lengths has a lot to do with your hair texture, type, and your own preference.” Dr Benar says that many beauty experts argue that it’s okay to skip your hair wash after a workout. “In addition to saving time, skipping your post-workout hair wash every once in a while can actually be beneficial for your scalp health,” he says. “If you’re a heavy sweater, then a good rinse is great to remove the excess sweat.” The type of exercise you’re doing counts, too. For example, if you’re a regular swimmer, you might want to wash your hair after every go if you’re exposing it to chlorine. “That said,” Dr Benar adds, “if your hair isn’t drenched in sweat (think Pilates, yoga, or lifted weights), then it’s totally okay to forgo washing your hair.” If you continue to avoid wash day, though, Dr Laftah adds that the build-up of dead skin cells, debris (from the environment and hair products, for example), as well as your body’s natural oils can lead to spots developing on the scalp. It’s a bit like removing your makeup and washing your face to avoid breakouts. The scalp is an extension of facial skin, after all. More often than not, you’ll know when your hair needs a wash. Sweat can make your scalp feel itchy and uncomfortable, or it might mean your hair doesn’t smell as fresh as you’d like it to. There is such a thing as washing too much, though. “Over-washing can strip the hair’s natural oils, rendering it dry, fragile, and at risk of breakage,” says Dr Laftah. How can you freshen up your hair after a workout? If you have curly or afro hair, AIRFRO’s 00.3 DFY Refresh, $28, is a game-changer for prolonging wash day after exercise. Packed with moisturizing vitamin B5 and soothing aloe vera to prevent the dreaded post-workout itch, it reduces frizz and adds definition. Spritz a little into your roots and mid-lengths and massage it in with your fingers. In fact, a little post-workout oil can be a good thing for curls. “Thick, wavy or curly hair tends to be dry since the oil doesn’t coat the strands as easily,” says Dr Benar. “Sebum is an important part of beautiful, well-defined curls because curly hair needs more moisture to stay soft and to prevent frizz.” For finer hair, dry shampoo is a great option. If you’re in the market for a dry shampoo that actually cleanses hair as it mops up oil and sweat, try Living Proof’s Perfect Hair Day (PhD) Dry Shampoo, $30. Virtually invisible, it makes limp, sweaty hair feel brand-new. If it’s the freshly washed hair smell you’re after, grab ARKIVE Headcare The Reset Dry Shampoo, $16.60. R29 contributing writer Humeara Mohamed swears by Batiste 24H Sweat Activated Dry Shampoo, $13.79, which uses microcapsule technology to release little bursts of scent upon contact with sweat: “I apply this before a workout and my head definitely feels less damp afterward,” she says. Dr Laftah explains that dry shampoo typically uses alcohol and starch-based ingredients to soak up excess oil and debris, adding, “While they can be a useful quick fix, they should not replace hair washing as overuse can result in an itchy, dry scalp.” Dr Benar has another great tip. “A hair wrap or workout headband can help minimize sweat build-up on your scalp and absorb sweat as you exercise,” he says. “They also have the added benefit of keeping your hair out of your face as you work out. Otherwise, keep a sweat towel handy to dry your face and hair.” How often should you wash your hair? Dr Laftah and Dr Benar agree that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to washing our hair and scalp. A quick whip round the R29 office shows that once or twice a week is the most common — even if exercising daily — but others wash their hair every other day. “The frequency depends on a number of factors including physical activity, age, ethnic background, hair type, and texture,” says Dr Laftah. If your hair is on the fine side and gets greasy easily, you might like to wash it more often to feel clean and comfortable. If your hair is thicker and not as oily, you can get away with not washing it every day. It also pays to invest in a gentle shampoo. Try Aveeno Daily Moisture+ Oat Milk Blend Shampoo, $9.69, or Aveda Shampure Nurturing Shampoo, $21. If you’re ditching a hair wash and letting it dry after a workout, invest in a shampoo that’s going to chip away at grease, oil and dead skin without stripping your scalp entirely. R29 recommends trying K18 Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo, $38 or OUAI Detox Shampoo, $32. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "description": "Whether you have thin hair that you're looking to bulk up, short hair that you want to lengthen, or are just in the mood to switch up your hairstyle without the commitment of a more permanent change, hair extensions are a great choice. The topic of hair extensions is vast and complex. There are a variety of different types of hair extensions - like hand-tied extensions, microlinks hair extensions, tape-in extensions, clip-in hair extensions, and halo hair extensions, to name just a few - and each kind has its own list of perks and drawbacks. Aside from the cost of hair extensions, you'll also want to know how to properly care for your hair extensions and how long they'll last before committing. If you're considering trying hair extensions for thin hair for the first time, we're sharing everything you need to know so you can find the best hair extensions for your needs with the help of four experts below. They help us break down the cost of hair extensions as well as all of the different types. Keep scrolling to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Louise Bailey is the founder of Hair Extensions London. Julia Venturin is a hair-extension expert at Luxy Hair. Tatiana Karelina is the owner of Russian hair-extensions company Tatiana Karelina. Brynn Reed is the lead extension specialist at Mirror Mirror Salon. Types of Hair Extensions \"There are many different hair types and application methods available, so you can experiment until you find the perfect look for you at a price point that suits your budget,\" Louise Bailey, founder of Hair Extensions London, says. Before we get into the different application types, let's go over the two main categories of hair extensions: real human hair extensions and synthetic hair extensions. \"Human hair extensions are exactly what they sound like - they are made out of real, human hair from top to bottom, collected from a donor,\" says Julia Venturin, a hair-extension expert at Luxy Hair. \"Remy hair means all the cuticles (the outer layer of the hair) are intact, running in the same direction at the time of collection. This allows for almost no tangling and ensures that the extensions remain smooth and silky throughout their lifetime.\" Synthetic hair extensions, on the other hand, are made out of various synthetic, blended fibers - no human hair. \"These fibers are usually very fine, plastic fibers that are manufactured to imitate real human hair,\" Venturin says. Here, we're breaking down a few of the most common types of extensions. Clip-In Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by KnappyHair by Keandra Janelle (@knappyhair) Clip-ins are perhaps the easiest, least time-consuming way of adding length, thickness, and volume to your hair, and one of the best things about them is that you don't even have to see a professional to have them installed. \"The good, quality clip-ins will look and feel natural, they will last years, there is no commitment, and you can fit and style them yourself,\" says Tatiana Karelina, owner of Russian hair-extensions company Tatiana Karelina. These types of extensions clip to your hair, and they come in handy when you want to change up your hair for a particular event or occurrence and don't want to commit to something more permanent. (You typically take them out after a day but can continue to reuse them for long after that.) Nowadays, clip-ins come in all kinds of lengths, textures, and colors, and you can usually buy them in packs. For an editor-approved option, read our full review of Bellami hair extensions; the brand has plenty of weft hair extension options. Tape-In Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Extensionaire Luxury Hair Extensions (@extensionaire) Tape-ins are considered semipermanent extensions; they're similar to clip-ins except that they can last longer and are taped to your hair. They're also pretty weightless, so you don't feel weighed down even if you're wearing a head full of them. \"Tape-ins are applied by a professional and can last for two months before needing maintenance,\" says Bailey. \"The hair is reusable with this method.\" Microlink Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Microlinks | TapeIns | ClipIns | Salon (@perfectdistractionhairgallery) Microlinks - also called microrings or microbeads - are a popular alternative option to sew-in weaves and tape-in extensions. These are normally attached to strands of hair using small tubes or rings, and they are said to be safer than other kinds of extensions because they don't damage the hair and scalp by putting too much weight or stress on them. They also don't require the use of glue or adhesive, making them a lot less noticeable in your hair. One downside, depending on how you look at it, is that getting a full head of microlink hair extensions can take anywhere from one to five hours to complete, but they can last up to two to three months. Sew-In Weaves View this post on Instagram A post shared by Taniyah 🤍 (@taniyahslayedyoullc) Installing a weave is a process that requires a bit more labor. They're usually installed by a hairstylist who braids the hair down into a specific pattern - either what's known as a beehive or straight-back cornrows - before sewing bundles or \"tracks\" down to the braids. This can usually take anywhere from two to six hours, depending on how many bundles you're installing (two or three is a good amount) and how speedy your stylist is. Weaves can last anywhere from six to 10 weeks, though it's important for people who wear them to also make sure they're still regularly taking care of their hair that's beneath the weave. Keratin Bond/Pre-Bonded Hair Extensions View this post on Instagram A post shared by Great Lengths Hair Extensions (@greatlengthsusa) Keratin extensions are also known as k-tip extensions. Bonds are fused to the hair using keratin and a heat gun. This process can take a few hours to complete since, like microlinks, each extension is connected to your natural hair individually until the desired look has been achieved. These aren't permanent, but they do last up to four or five months, depending on personal maintenance. UV Hair Extensions @lachunsoftlife #hairloss #alopecia #fyp #hairextensions #atlantahairstylist #onthisday #coldfusionhairextensions #softlife ♬ original sound - Luxury extensions LED or UV hair extensions are touted as the most seamless extension technique to date. To get the look, single strands of hair will be bonded onto your natural pieces of hair, using a special glue that will then be cured with a UV light to keep everything in place. How long the process takes depends on how large the area that you're working with is, and the results last for about six weeks. The cost is usually about $250 per session and approximately $1200 for your entire head. Halo Hair Extensions If you're looking for a quick and easy way to add length to your hair, you might want to consider Halo hair extensions. The extensions use a thin wire to secure the hair around the crown of your head, and your natural hair goes over it. They're easy to put on and take out, which makes them perfect if you want to add a little extra length and thickness for a special event. There are a few different brands that make this type of hair extension, like Zala Hair Extensions and Luxy. Read our full Luxy Halo Hair Extensions review. Do Hair Extensions Damage Your Natural Hair? Sadly, there's a lot of misinformation out there about hair extensions, including that they will damage your natural hair. In fact, this notion is mostly false. Bailey explains that when applied by a professional and cared for properly, damage is not likely. \"If you're considering getting hair extensions, it's important to do your research and consult with a hair-extensions expert to ensure that they're right for you and the correct hair type and product is used,\" she says. How to Care For Hair Extensions Hair extensions require special care. The better you care for them, the more use you'll get out of them. The No. 1 rule of handling hair extensions is to be gentle. \"Brush them gently with a soft-bristled brush, and avoid using harsh chemicals or too much heat,\" says Bailey. Venturin adds: \"The more you wash and heat style your extensions, the shorter their lifespan will be, so try to keep the washing and product use to a minimum.\" Nonsynthetic extensions can and should be washed just like the hair on your head. This helps prevent product, dirt, and oil buildup on the hair. \"Use a mild shampoo and conditioner, keeping conditioners away from the attachment points,\" Bailey says. However, just as you don't want to overwash your own hair, try to avoid washing your extensions too much. \"Unlike your own hair, which receives natural hydration from the oils on your scalp, hair extensions don't have a natural hydration source,\" says Venturin. \"Therefore, keeping them hydrated is key to keeping them shiny and in good condition.\" Cost of Hair Extensions If you're wondering, how much do hair extensions cost? That's a hard question to answer due to the many different types of hair extensions available on the market - hair extension prices are based on the hair you choose, as well as who installs it. \"High-quality, hand-tied hair extensions will look more natural and last longer than synthetic extensions but require a higher cost to purchase and install,\" says Brynn Reed, the lead extension specialist at Mirror Mirror Salon. Quality extensions made from human hair, such as clip-ins, typically range from $100 to $350, while more \"permanent,\" long-wearing extensions that are professionally installed can cost $350 to upward of $2,000. Synthetic hair extensions, on the other hand, are far cheaper. Things to Keep in Mind When Getting Hair Extensions There are many benefits to extensions, but you should consider your current hair routine to determine if they're right for you. \"Extensions are not a wash-and-go style,\" says Reed. \"They must be blow-dried. Leaving extensions wet for prolonged periods causes the wefts to break down and shortens the lifespan of your extensions. If you commit to extensions, you commit to the blow-out.\" Additionally, the haircut you have matters. Extensions are able to add volume and length to your existing style, but in order for the final result to look seamless, you'll want to avoid any blunt-style haircuts. \"This makes the job so much harder to blend,\" says Bailey.

    "description": "It's so easy to make the connection between oranges and good skin; it's intuitive: oranges are naturally high in vitamin C, and vitamin C is a brightening antioxidant deemed by many dermatologists as the gold standard of skin care. You probably have a vitamin C serum hanging out in your medicine cabinet. . . and it probably comes with an orange label. But this year, another type of fruit is captivating the skincare industry: the humble apple. Any doctor will tell you that tossing apples into your Trader Joe's cart is a good idea. Rich in natural fiber and antioxidants, apples ease digestion and inflammation, which is great for skin and overall health. Though less talked-about, apples (specifically, their enzymes and extracts) are also employed in topical skin-care products - from serums and sunscreens to peels and moisturizers - and according to skin experts, apple skin-care ingredients are ripe for growth this year. Experts Featured in This Article Teresa Song, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Marmur Medical. Elizabeth Starr is the executive director of product development for Origins. The Skin-Care Benefits of Apple Apples offer immediate and preventative skin-care benefits including protection from UV damage, hydration, barrier support, and gentle exfoliation. \"Instant benefits include hydration and skin-plumping effects, as well as a brighter complexion from gentle exfoliation,\" says board-certified dermatologist Teresa Song, MD. \"Long-term benefits include improved skin elasticity and firmness, plus enhanced skin regeneration.\" Like oranges (and all fruits), apples boast a high level of antioxidants, which effectively bubble wrap the skin and protect it from cellular damage. \"Primarily, the apple peel is an ingredient known for its powerful antioxidant properties, which provide tremendous age-prevention benefits,\" says Elizabeth Starr from Origins. Additionally, apple seeds hydrate and support the skin barrier. \"Apple seeds contain omega fatty acids and polyphenols to nourish the skin barrier,\" says Song. Apple enzymes are alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) that can be used for gentle skin exfoliation. \"Like malic acid, [they] act as gentle exfoliants to remove dead skin cells, brightening and smoothing the skin's appearance,\" Song says. How Skin Care Is Formulated With Apples No apples need to be harmed for the production of skin-care serums. Apples are often upcycled, saved from waste, and then harnessed for skin care. In the case of Origins, a brand featuring apple-derived ingredients in its Youthtopia collection, the process also involves natural fermentation to make the skin-care products more efficacious. \"We modify the apple peel ingredient through fermentation,\" says Starr. \"This process enhances its antioxidant power, effectively doubling its potency.\" The Best Apple Skin-Care Products The smartest way to introduce apple extracts into your skin-care routine is with a gentle, gateway skin-care product. \"Start with a gentle hydrating serum to layer underneath moisturizer, or a moisturizer containing apple extracts,\" Song recommends. For example, the Dr. Dennis Gross C+ Collagen Brighten \u0026 Firm Vitamin C Serum ($87) is brimming apple extract, vitamin C, and other antioxidant-rich ingredients to brighten, firm, and protect the skin. For a moisturizer, consider the Origins Peptide Plumping Apple Cream ($54), which plumps the skin with apple stem cell extract, apple peel ferment, and apple seed oil. Alternatively, consider a peel or mask that wields apple enzymes for exfoliation. \"Add a once-weekly exfoliating mask with apple-derived gentle acids,\" Song says. For example, the Origins Liquid Exfoliating Apple Peel ($44), is a great option. \"Peels are popular because they help jump-start the skin's cell turnover, but many peels on the market can be too aggressive,\" Starr says. \"Our challenge as formulators was to create something gentle enough for daily use, yet effective enough to deliver real benefits, and that's where the apple stem cell comes in.\" According to Song, we'll notice more apples and fruit extracts in skin care moving forward. \"There is likely to be an increase in plant-based skin-care ingredients, as the demand for natural products grows alongside the rising popularity of clean beauty trends,\" she says. Starr sees the rise in skin-care products using apple extracts as less of a passing trend, and more of a health choice. \"As skin-care professionals, we've always looked to nutrition and food for their functional value and explored how that translates to benefits for the skin,\" Starr says. \"The apple is such a simple yet highly functional ingredient.\" Megan Decker is a freelance writer and editor based in New York City.
