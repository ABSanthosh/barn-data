    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/conservative-beauty-trad-wife-nara-smith-black-women?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When I first came across Nara Smith’s tongue-in-cheek TikTok videos, whispering about making Coco Pops from scratch for her children while clad in Louboutins and a little black dress, little did I know that Smith, a biracial woman, would become (perhaps unwittingly) the modern face of ideological conservatism that would take the internet by storm. The 2024 “trad wife” is a doting wife and mother who glorifies domesticity in the view of a camera phone. She takes care of the home, cooks everything from scratch, homeschools her children, and does it all without breaking a sweat, and in the most aesthetically pleasing way possible.  As a second Trump term looms, this conservative cultural shift seen on social media mirrors the broader political changes happening across the Western world as it tilts to the right, from the fall of Roe V. Wade to many European countries embracing more conservative ideologies. It’s a shift witnessed beyond political arenas and is driving significant cultural changes that have influenced lifestyle, pop culture, and, interestingly, current beauty ideals, trends, and standards. It’s been argued that the rise in conservative politics has led to a noticeable shift in favor of “conservative beauty.” Nothing epitomizes this change quite like the trad wife subculture, arguably helmed by Smith, 23, where women embrace traditional gender roles and ideals of femininity. The appeal of the trad wife aesthetic, as seen in creators like Aria Lewis and Hannah Neeleman of Ballerina Farm, is clear: it offers a seemingly simple, idyllic lifestyle, a refuge from the chaos of modern life. But beneath the surface, the trend reinforces conservative beauty ideals that inadvertently exclude Black women (who do not look like Smith) marginalizing the expressive, diverse, and space-occupying representations of our beauty. What exactly is the trad wife aesthetic? It’s a fresh, natural look that emphasizes radiant skin and soft features. Hair is typically styled neat and slicked back, or flowing heatless curls often inspired by mid-20th-century style trends among white women, to reflect neatness and classic femininity. It can also look like modest tea dresses, with minimal makeup and waifish thinness that are lauded as gentle, “soft” and befitting of the male gaze. In contrast, Black beauty tells a different story. Our traditions are deeply rooted in African and Caribbean cultures. Our beauty icons range from legendary models like Iman and Alek Wek to beauty entrepreneurs and makeup artists like Pat McGrath, as well as actors like Lupita Nyong’o. It’s not just the famous faces, it’s also our grandmothers, aunties, and friends that provide beauty inspiration. The ways we wear makeup and style our hair are diverse, constantly evolving, and serve as a form of self-expression. They reflect our cultures, celebrate the textures of our hair, and enhance the richness of our skin tones.  Black beauty is also inherently political, as it challenges a Western world shaped by a history of Eurocentric beauty ideals and defines beauty in narrow terms— standards we’re told we don’t meet. By reclaiming and challenging what it means to be beautiful, Black beauty, in turn, is a powerful response to these standards. The Black beauty industry has consistently carved its own path and redefined standards within the beauty world. Pioneering entrepreneurs like Madame C.J. Walker and Annie Malone built empires that offered hair care and beauty products specifically for Black women who were neglected by mainstream brands; Anthony Overton with his large cosmetic company and Rose Meta Morgan with her iconic salon The Rose Meta House of Beauty catered to Black beauty needs, John H. Johnson’s Fashion Fair Cosmetics made sure makeup shades catered to a wider range of skin tones, to today, as Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty continues this legacy of inclusivity, celebrating all complexions. This rich history is a testament to the innovation and resilience of Black women in the world of beauty. Vibrant colors, highlights, bold eyeshadows, statement lipsticks, and intricate artistry are all ways Black women can express creativity and individuality. All of this stands in stark contrast to the more subdued aesthetic often associated with the trad wife ideal. While Black women can certainly appreciate the pastel shades, soft florals, and muted tones of this look, the idea that it represents the definitive standard of beauty is incredibly restrictive. This ideal has also given rise to a beauty ethic that reshapes perceptions of femininity and, by extension, the virtue of what it means to be a woman — a framework that is again deeply limiting. But for Black women, this is nothing new.  Our features have long been dismissed as unfeminine, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that still linger today. Prominent figures such as Michelle Obama have been recipients of dehumanizing slurs and racist abuse online, while those of us with athletic or muscular builds are seen as the least desirable. Black women are also challenging the conservative beauty ethic by reimagining the trad wife aesthetic and putting a unique spin on the trend. In this new era of beauty, the ripple effects of these biases are evident even in trends like plastic surgery, which continues to define and sculpt “perfection” through a Eurocentric lens. Cosmetic procedures such as nose jobs and the increasing popularity of weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy reflect a growing obsession with thin, lean physiques, no doubt a response to this restrictive beauty standard.  The year has also seen the continued rise of femininity coaches, another result of the new conservative beauty ethic. Even though there are countless ways to be a woman, their teachings often reduce femininity to presenting a subdued version of oneself— from telling clients to lose weight to sharing etiquette advice —  all in the pursuit of securing a financially stable marriage, one where the man is rarely held to the same high standards of perfection demanded of the woman. It didn’t stop here. 2024 saw the rise of the old money aesthetic, an ideal often linked to white, colonial history. This aesthetic does not try too hard and promotes a certain understated elegance that looks expensive but it avoids branded luxury fashion.  As beauty influencer Jackie Aina recently highlighted during her interview on The Receipts Podcast, successful Black women are often labeled as new money when they embrace luxury, and it’s a veiled insult. What makes it all so ridiculous is that many African American women are descendants of ancestors who were enslaved or denied the opportunity to build generational wealth —  being “old money” was never an option to begin with. Meanwhile, the old money aesthetic itself harks back to wealth that was built on a legacy of colonialism and slavery, so why is it something to aspire to? Though some consider Nara Smith a proponent of the online trad wife movement, I’d argue Smith is spoofing it… Amidst all the shifts we’ve navigated this year, we continue to face challenges in the Black beauty industry, despite the progress of the past five years.  This summer, popular beauty influencer Golloria faced a wave of racist abuse after calling out brands like Rhode and Armani for their blush shades that didn’t complement deeper skin tones. Her brave stance led to a massive outpouring of support from millions of Black beauty lovers online. Our voices rose loudly against the hate — support is what we always do — but it did highlight how the fight for representation and recognition in beauty is far from over. One way we’ve pushed back as a community is through beauty itself, always a form of activism. We’ve continued to create and drive trends that shape culture, assert our presence, and celebrate our beauty. Take the XXL nail trend, popularised by Black women in the ’80s and ’90s. It has since become a staple on celebrity red carpets, and this year saw celebrities like Billie Eilish, Sha’Carri Richardson, and Cynthia Erivo embrace the trend. Beauty entrepreneur Sherrille Riley explains, “As a culture, we love colors. They’re part of celebrating life and reflecting the vibrancy of our heritage. In Caribbean culture, long, colorful nails, adorned with jewelry and piercings, have always been a way for women to express themselves. It was a big middle finger to Western beauty standards.” Once dismissed as “ghetto fabulous” this trend has since been embraced by the mainstream beauty and entertainment industry, and we continue to pioneer and perfect it. Black women are also challenging the conservative beauty ethic by reimagining the trad wife aesthetic and putting a unique spin on the trend. Though some consider Nara Smith a proponent of the online trad wife movement, I’d argue Smith is spoofing it. Her insistence that she has just woken up, craving homemade bubblegum and is therefore going to show us how to make it should we ever be in the same situation, is playfully ridiculous. It also shows how with every beauty trend, we can define what it means for us and claim it in our own way.  TikTok star Kerry Ingram, for instance, challenges traditional notions of femininity by embracing hyperfeminine fashion in a way that celebrates being Black and a girl. Ingram loves princess dresses and frilly, flowy clothing. Her everyday makeup is soft glam, but she loves a glitter eyeshadow. In an interview with Allure, Ingram explained how growing up, she felt pressured to conform to the roles and conservative aesthetic others expected of her. Ingram was told her hyperfeminine style was something “white women typically do”, suggesting Blackness and femininity don’t go together. It’s why creators like her are also so important in the beauty space.  As we close out the year, it’s clear that Black women are not only navigating the complexities of beauty standards but actively reshaping them. From redefining the trad wife aesthetic to reclaiming what it means to be feminine, we continue to challenge the constraints placed on us by mainstream ideals. Our voices and our influence are louder than ever.  This article was originally published to Unbothered UK Like what you see?

    "description": "For some, a lipstick is just a lipstick. But for others, it’s a source of strength, creativity, and expression. In our series Power Faces, we’ll explore the relationship between strong women and the makeup they choose to wear — or not. In partnership with NYX, our latest subject is beauty content creator and rising social media star Ndeye Peinda. This story was told to Shawna Hudson and edited for length and clarity. My passion for beauty started long before I began creating content online. As a young, dark-skinned Senegalese girl growing up in Harlem, I was captivated by content creators on YouTube and how they would do their hair and makeup — but none of them looked like me. Even so, I couldn’t wait to try everything they were doing. I’d run to the drugstore to buy the same products and follow the same steps. Did I look like an ashy, gray mess at first? Yes, but I didn’t care — I was just excited to find something I loved.  Fast forward a few years to college when I was hit with a revelation: There was a gap. There were no Black makeup content creators — I was taking tips from people who were three or four shades lighter than me. So I thought to myself, Why don’t I see if I can do this? At first, I was scared. This was in 2017 when there was still a lack of inclusivity in the content creation community. Originally, I didn’t even want to be the face of my own content. I tried my hand at being a makeup artist because I wanted to provide the best makeup tips for deeper skin tones. But it was disheartening in the beginning — I wasn’t getting booked enough. So I pivoted and started to share tips using myself as a model. I was afraid of putting myself out there, of mean remarks, of haters. But the responses exceeded all my expectations. I was on a mission to be of service to people who look like me, and I finally started to feel like the content I was making really resonated with people and I was calling back my power. Black women are often left out of the conversation or are an afterthought when it comes to most makeup products. When I first started posting, there weren’t many brands that had inclusive foundation shade ranges, which made it harder to do my job. Now, I have plenty of foundations that I can use, but when it comes to other products like blush, contour, and bronzer, there aren’t as many options that work for my skin tone.  I’ve noticed (even to this day) that few brands go above and beyond for Black beauty consumers. There doesn’t seem to be much excitement around products that cater to Black women. NYX is one exception — the brand’s Butter Gloss in Gingersnap was the first lip gloss I fell in love with. It’s this stunning shade with incredible color payoff, and it just complements Black skin so well. Every time I wear it, I always get compliments. I felt like NYX, which offers these beautiful products that blend artistry with value, was one of the first beauty brands that made me feel seen. The fact that I can find shades in multiple makeup categories that work for me is nothing short of revolutionary.  My content now is all about representing folks who look like me and showing up as my authentic self. This confidence I have stems from within, and when it matches my appearance (especially when my makeup is on point, my hair is done, I’ve spritzed on a fragrance), there’s a completely new energy. I feel like I belong in whatever room I step into. Makeup gives me that freedom to create whatever look I want and feel like my best self.  And that’s important to me as a Black creator in a world where things look uncertain for us right now, from less diversity in the workplace to few Black women at the C-suite level. I see that and it makes me want to champion our community even more. I’m always going to show up for the community that I’ve fostered. It’s time to show brands that we’re still here, we still want to buy their products, and we shouldn’t be forgotten about.  Inclusivity is important because everyone deserves to feel like they belong — regardless of race, gender, religion, sexuality, or identity. We live in a society with these “rules” that are set out for us before we’re born and your value is based on where you “fit” into society. We’re told that only thinness, whiteness, and proximity to whiteness is what beauty is, so every day, I work toward breaking that stereotypical beauty mold. That’s why an inclusive beauty campaign is everything to me — it makes me feel like I fit in, that I belong. People need to know that they’re valued, beautiful, and that they deserve access. If I could speak to my younger self right now, I would tell her that the things you get made fun of are going to be the things that people clap for in the future. Don’t feel bad about yourself — everyone else will catch up. Shop Ndeye’s makeup look: Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Hot take: I think it's f*cking gross when people apply skin-care products on airplanes. Hear me out. There's nothing more confusing to me than watching a passenger dutifully rub down their seat with an antibacterial wipe as soon as they sit down, only to watch them do a full skin-care routine mid-flight hours later - especially when they forgo wiping down their hands prior to application. In-flight skin-care has become an activity that a lot of people participate in; there have even been products created specifically for use while traveling. I can't count the number of TikTok videos I've seen where an influencer breaks down an in-flight beauty routine, which usually involves washing their face in the tiny germ-ridden bathroom and then walking back to their seat to slather on products with their \"freshly washed\" airplane hands. Yes, I put freshly washed in quotes. Oh, you didn't know? Airplane water is dirty as f*ck. Experts Featured in This Article Charles Puza, MD, founder of MOMA Term. Rachel Nazarian, MD, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist. A 2019 Airline Water Study released by Diet Detective and Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center found that tap water on numerous U.S. airplanes was contaminated with differing levels of E. coli and coliform. They suggested that passengers avoid drinking any water on board that doesn't come in a sealed bottle, and they even went as far as to suggest that passengers avoid washing their hands in the bathroom. Instead, they recommend bringing hand sanitizer. Not only are people washing their whole ass faces in airplane bathrooms prior to putting on skin-care products, but I know of people who brush their teeth in those sinks as well. As for me? It's a hard no. Even if you avoid the bathroom (and the water) entirely, you're still not completely safe from all of the yucky stuff. You still have to contend with the high levels of germs on the airplane seatbelts, tray tables, and head rests. And don't even get me started on the seat back pockets. Have you heard about the things people find back there? Used condoms, used tampons, and dirty baby diapers - just to name a few. My opinion on this is firm: I will never do my skin-care routine on a plane unless I find myself in a \"Yellowjackets\" situation and the plane happens to be the only shelter I have on a deserted island thousands of miles from civilization. I know there are differing opinions on this, with some experts claiming it's OK in some circumstances. \"Applying skin-care products on an airplane can be hygienic if done properly,\" Charles Puza, MD, founder of MOMA Term, says. \"Airplanes are environments with dry air and can have higher levels of bacteria due to the number of people in a confined space.\" Board-certified dermatologist Rachel Nazarian, MD, FAAD, agrees it can be beneficial, adding, \"These flights can be quite damaging to skin, mostly due to the lack of humidity and the recirculated air. At 20 percent, it's nearly half of the humidity that skin operates at best.\" So, yeah, I guess you can apply products while you're up in the air (not that I'm going to do it), but there are some key rules you absolutely need to follow. The first? Make sure you have clean hands. \"Ensure your hands are thoroughly washed or sanitized before touching your face or applying any products,\" Dr. Puza says. (Just based on the previous note above, I'd go with a sanitizer versus an in-flight potential E. coli wash.) Next, you should use products that are in sealed, single-use packets to minimize any contamination risk. And last, \"limit touching your face after handling tray tables, seat handles, or other surfaces,\" he says. However, both Dr. Nazarian and Dr. Puza agree that the best option is to complete your skin-care routine prior to getting onto your flight. (Yes, people, say it with me: p-r-i-o-r to getting on your flight.) Once you're seated and buckled in, coordinating proper (and hygienic) skin-care application can be difficult. \"Prevention is key,\" Dr. Nazarian says. Instead of waiting until you're on the plane, the day you fly, or the night before if you have an early flight time, Dr. Nazarian suggests hydrating the skin internally by increasing your water intake. \"Give the body a chance to recover from any baseline dehydration and fully hydrate skin and mucosal membranes such as lips and eyes.\" She notes that it's best to avoid dehydrating drinks and foods, like alcohol or sugary treats, which she says can cause increased inflammation of skin throughout the flight. Externally, Dr. Nazarian suggests hydrating the skin from the outside and preventing environmental dehydration. Put the pause on any harsh, drying, or exfoliating products. Then, start out by washing your face with a gentle cleanser, like the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser ($18). \"Next should be a cocktail of potent antioxidants to neutralize all the free radical damage you're going to be exposing your skin to,\" she says. She suggests looking for products that include vitamin C, vitamin E, niacinamide, or even naturally derived green tea extract. Next, opt for hyaluronic acid gels and creams to help draw in moisture. \"A barrier to prevent water loss from skin, such as Aquaphor, should also be applied before boarding your flight,\" Dr. Nazarian says. \"Lastly, but certainly also as important, use a broad spectrum SPF before flying if you're traveling during the day. Ultraviolet radiation rays are much more intense at high altitudes.\" Renee Rodriguez is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

    "description": "As a professional nail artist, I absolutely love the manicures during holiday season because it's the perfect time to get creative and bring some extra sparkle into my clients' lives. There's something magical about transforming your nails into little works of art that reflect the festive spirit. When it comes to New Year's Eve nails, I go all out with glitter and shine - it's the one night where more is definitely more. I love using gold, silver, holographic glitters, and, of course, gems or crystals. Whether it's a bold, all-over glitter nail or a chic negative-space design with just a hint of shimmer, the goal is to feel glamorous while welcoming in the new year. Your hands often take center stage during holiday festivities - whether you're raising a glass, holding sparklers, or capturing moments on camera. Here's one of my favorite DIY manicures that's easy to do on your own. Just head to the crafts store, pick up a few clear gemstones, and follow the step-by-step tutorial below to create these sparkling martini nails (Hailey Bieber recently sported a colored version). If DIY nails aren't your thing, keep scrolling for a few ready-to-wear options. Happy New Year, and cheers to a fresh year of fabulous nails. How to Do Sparkly Martini Nails For New Year's Eve Step 1: Polish your nails in your favorite shade. I chose a pearly white hue. Step 2: Using a pick-up stone tool (like this Dotting Pen [$8] on Amazon), apply your clear stones to the nail, starting with a dot in the middle near the cuticle. Set this and each remaining step with either nail glue or a gel top coat. Step 3: Add a horizontal line to create the foot of the glass. Then, craft a vertical line for the stem. Follow that by creating a V shape for the body and rim of the martini glass. Again, set with a top coat after each step to secure the stone. Step 4: For the final touch, add small gold bullions for the bubbly. No Thanks, I'll Try a Product The above martini nail art look is simple, but you know what's even easier? Sticker or press-on nails. As a professional manicurist, I can assure you these options are foolproof for New Year's Eve. Best NYE nail polish strips: Color Street Polish Strips ($14) These nail polish strips apply in a flash - and without an LED light.
