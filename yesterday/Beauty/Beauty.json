The esteemed makeup artist has worked with the likes of Michelle Yeoh, Selena Gomez, and Nina Dobrev, with a signature look that’s both effortlessly glam and distinctive: A glistening complexion, cheekbones snatched to the high heavens, and subtle smoky eyes — all topped off with a luscious lip that’s overlined just so. We recently caught up with Park as he got actress Zoey Deutch ready for the Gotham Awards red carpet. Fresh off her Broadway debut on Our Town, Deutch opted for a polka-dot haute couture gown from Chanel’s FW22/23 collection, paired with white gold Chanel Fine Jewelry earrings with cascading pearls. These starry statement earrings inspired Park to create a glowy makeup look to match, using a suite of skincare and makeup products from Chanel Beauty. Ahead, Park shares his holiday party makeup tips, his beauty trend predictions for 2025, and a secret hack for perfectly fluffed-up brows. DashDividers_1_500x100 Walk us through the inspiration behind Deutch’s red carpet makeup. I took inspiration from the fine jewelry Zoey wore, which had [a] brilliant shine. I decided on creating a flawless, skin-focused makeup look, paired with fluttering lashes, well-groomed brows, and [a] hint of blush on cheeks. Her skin looked so dewy and natural. What’s your top tip for achieving this “glow from within” look? Since immaculate and radiant skin was the focal point, I applied Chanel Les Beiges Sheer Healthy Glow Highlighting Fluid (in Pearly Glow) in thin layers on high points of her face [cheekbones, brow bones, bridge of the nose, and cupid’s bow]. Then, I mixed the highlighter with the Ultra le Teint Ultrawear Foundation. I did this to thin out the foundation a bit, as well as to enhance the overall glow. After this, I [added] another thin layer of the highlight fluid on the high points for more of that ‘lit-within’ glow effect. Do you have any tips for those of us who want that same glowy look, but are short on time? I recommend keeping the Chanel Baume Essentiel Multi-Use Glow Stick in your bag. This multi-use, illuminating glow stick is such an easy way to achieve holiday party makeup. It creates the most gorgeous, ethereal glow on the highpoints of the face. You can also use it as a topcoat on your lips, and eyes if you love the look of glistening and glossy lids. To get this look, simply rub your fingertips together to warm up the balm and gently tap the product onto the areas you want to enhance radiance. Do not forget to tap the products with your fingers onto your décolletage and the tops of your shoulder area for an added, gorgeous glow. What’s your go-to when it comes to holiday party makeup? A red lip is almost always a good idea for the holiday season. I love playing with a burgundy shade of red; it doesn’t scream “Santa Claus” and is a more sophisticated (yet still festive) shade. I use the Rouge Allure L’Extrait (in Rouge Excessif) on my clients; it offers intense pigment, and the formula is super creamy and nourishing on lips. What do you think is going to be the biggest beauty trend in 2025? Fresh skin with soft bitten lips! In order to achieve that fresh, bare skin look, skincare is going to be continuously popular. And instead of fully drawn, sharp lip lines, I predict effortlessly soft-lined lips would be trending. You can create a softer, “bitten lip” effect by tapping the product onto the lip with your fingertip or [diffusing] with a smudgy eyeshadow brush. The Les Pinceaux De Chanel Dual-Ended Eye-Contouring Brush N°201 is an amazing tool for this. The rounded brush side can be used to softly fill in the lips with color and then the pointed brush side can be used to smudge and soften the lip lines. What’s your best tip for achieving the perfect fluffed-out brow, as seen on Deutch? Comb your brow hairs upward with a spoolie first. Then use a fine tip brow pencil, such as the Stylo Sourcils Haute Précision Eyebrow Pencil, and fill in the gaps only. Comb through the brows again for a more natural look, and repeat thoroughly. I always pick a lighter shade of brow pencil than the natural hair, so that brows are defined yet not so overwhelming and [this creates] a fluffy look. I also highly rate the Le Gel Sourcils Longwear Eyebrow Gel (in Transparent) for shaping and setting the brows in place. What’s the one beauty product everyone should always have in their cabinet? There are two products, actually: Vitamin C serum and sunscreen! Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. From applying SPF with makeup brushes to creating so-called skincare “smoothies” by mixing your products, the internet is awash with dubious beauty advice. For this reason, we make it our yearly mission to cut through the noise with help from our little black book of expert dermatologists, cosmetic scientists and estheticians. Whether you’re keen to brush up on the benefits of LED masks or you’re wondering how much is too much to spend on SPF, you’ll find the answer at R29. But it’s been a busy year, so to make things easy for you, here are the eight most valuable skincare lessons we learnt from the professionals in 2024 — all in one place for your perusal.  Dry skin? Try reverse double cleansing. If you wear makeup and sunscreen it’s likely that double cleansing — using a balm, oil or micellar water then following up with a proper water-based cleanse — is second nature to you. Though necessary to remove every last scrap of product, the second cleanse can often leave drier skin feeling tight and stripped, particularly if you’re using foaming cleanser. As a solution, Kat Burki, a skin specialist, nutritional scientist and founder and CEO of her namesake skincare brand, suggests reverse double cleansing.  “I do the opposite of what other [people] do to get a deep cleanse without stripping the skin,” Burki told Refinery29. “First I go in with a gel cleanser [namely her KB5 Calming Gel Cleanser, $50] and then I’ll use an oil cleanser,” she said. “That’s because you don’t want to wash away those nutrients.” If you don’t like the slip that oil cleansers tend to leave behind, try following a lathering face wash with a hydrating cream cleanser like Byoma Creamy Jelly Cleanser, $13.99, La Roche-Posay Effaclar H+ Cleansing Cream, $49, or CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser, $13.68, instead. How to tell the difference between real and counterfeit sunscreen. For Refinery29’s global sun safety campaign, Sun Blocked, writer Morgan Fargo uncovered the murky world of fake sunscreen. K-beauty brands like Round Lab and Beauty of Joseon often fall victim to counterfeiting, and the differences between fakes and legitimate products are often indiscernible to the naked eye. But there are a handful of things you can do to make sure you’re buying the real deal and protecting your skin properly.  Skin cancer expert Dr. Paul Banwell told Refinery29: “Do not believe very low prices — they are often too good to be true — and don’t buy from unverified sellers. It’s a gamble that’s just not worth taking. After that, look at the packaging for misspelt words or a lack of certification, and when it arrives, make sure the seal is intact, too.” Stick to well-known retailers that you trust and avoid third-party sellers. SPF doesn’t have to cost a small fortune. On the topic of sunscreen, it’s a common misconception that the more you spend, the better the product is at protecting your skin against UV light. Here’s the truth: The cost doesn’t really matter. An effective sunscreen should be “broad spectrum” so that it shields skin from both UVA and UVB, and most dermatologists recommend an SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 30. “Affordability is relative but you shouldn’t feel bad about using [your sunscreen] or worry about how expensive it is to replace,” esthetician Alicia Lartey told R29. “I personally don’t see why an SPF should be over $50 — unless it’s a gallon.” Lartey believes that there are lots of excellent, affordable sunscreen options out there. R29 rates e.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen SPF 30, $14, The Inkey List Polyglutamic Acid Dewy Sunscreen SPF 30, $15, and Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Acid Moisturizer SPF 50, $27.99. Ultimately, though, choosing the right sunscreen comes down to personal preference and what you can afford.  LED masks are pretty great, actually. You might be quick to dismiss LED masks as a gimmick but according to the experts, there are tangible benefits — provided you’re consistent. Dr. Jonathan Kentley, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson, told R29: “Both red light and blue light therapy has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acne, by targeting oil-producing glands, killing bacteria and reducing the number of inflammatory spots.”  That’s not all. Light therapy can increase the production of collagen and elastin, which give skin its structure. “Studies [show] an improvement in skin hydration, texture and elasticity as well as reduction in the number of wrinkles,” said Dr. Kentley. Not all LED masks are created equal so if you’re considering buying one, we’re on hand to help you with your research.  Your lips aren’t just dry. They could be sun-damaged. When Refinery29’s senior writer Venus Wong asked a dermatologist why her lips were constantly dry last summer, she never expected sunburn to be the answer. Wong wrote, “Despite diligently wearing sunscreen daily (on my face and body and reapplying every two hours), I’ll be the first to admit that I often forget SPF protection on my lips.” She asked consultant dermatologist Dr. Derrick Phillips for advice. “The skin on your lips differs from that of the rest of your body,” he told her. “It’s thin, sensitive and prone to loss of moisture. Your lips are also constantly exposed to UV radiation from the sun, which over time causes further thinning, redness, pigmentation and increases the risk of developing skin cancer.” A restorative lip balm including moisturizing ingredients like lanolin, glycerin and hyaluronic acid is key to alleviating dryness, as is investing in a lip balm with at least SPF 30 to protect your lips from damaging UV. Try Aquaphor Lip Repair Stick SPF30, $5.99, Lanolips Tinted SPF 30 Balm, $13.50, or Paula’s Choice Lip Balm SPF 50, $13, none of which tastes bitter.  Dandruff can’t be “cured” — but it can be managed easily. Your scalp is an extension of the skin on your face so it makes sense that it requires a similar level of care — specifically washing it more regularly. Going too long between shampoos can encourage dandruff, which manifests as fine white flakes, said trichologist Anabel Kingsley. Dandruff can’t be cured but it can be managed easily. “If you didn’t wash your face every day, it would get greasy,” Kingsley told Refinery29. “On your scalp, there’s nowhere for those dead skin cells to go, so they get trapped at the root on your scalp and in your hair. The act of massaging when you shampoo exfoliates [the scalp].”  Kingsley recommends using an anti-dandruff shampoo, like Philip Kingsley Flaky Itchy Scalp Shampoo, $42, down to the last drop. Once the dandruff lets up, she suggests keeping a bottle in your bathroom and using it every other wash to keep the flakes at bay. Also try OUAI Anti-Dandruff Shampoo, $38, or Nizoral Anti Dandruff Shampoo with 1% Ketoconazole, $15.89, if you’d rather spend less. It’s time to rethink our relationship with tan accelerators. Last summer, beauty journalist Tori Crowther uncovered just how dangerous tanning accelerators can be. Typically sold as gels or lotions, they contain ingredients like beta carotene, which comes from carrots, or Tanositol SPE, derived from the carob plant. Said to be “activated” by UV light, these ingredients can increase melanin (the skin’s natural pigment) and encourage a tan. But here’s the thing: Tanning, whether indoors on a sunbed or outdoors on a beach, can lead to melanoma, one of the most common forms of skin cancer. So while the ingredients inside tan accelerators aren’t inherently bad, their premise certainly is.  “A perturbing misconception around tanning accelerators is that they are believed to reduce the amount of time needed to achieve a tan,” wrote Crowther. “The fewer hours spent sunbathing, the better, right? But it’s not quite so cut and dried. Tanning accelerators lull users into a false sense of security.” Dermatologist Dr. Ellie Rashid compared tanning accelerator lotions to the idea of smoking shorter cigarettes. “Saying they are safer because they limit the length of time you smoke just doesn’t make sense,” she told R29. This is why you won’t spot any tanning accelerators on Refinery29’s website in future.   People with darker skin tend to be more deficient in vitamin D — but SPF is still beneficial. In an article titled “The Vitamin D Myth Discouraging Black People From Wearing Sunscreen”, Refinery29 Unbothered editor L’Oréal Blackett acknowledged that while regularly applying SPF can protect skin against harmful UVA and UVB rays, which can lead to premature aging and skin cancer, she is often asked one question: “If Black and brown people are more prone to vitamin D deficiency, should Black people wear sunscreen?” Blackett discovered that scientists agree on one thing: People who wear SPF every day can maintain their vitamin D levels. “Most people don’t wear enough sunscreen [on a daily basis] for them to actually worry about the amount of vitamin D their body can truly absorb,” added aesthetician Alicia Lartey. She continued, “Living in a climate like the UK, or just the northern hemisphere in general, you would have to take extra vitamin D supplements, anyway.” In other words, it pays to invest in a good vitamin D supplement and a broad-spectrum sunscreen of at least SPF 30 to protect your skin against harmful UV rays.  Like what you see?

    "description": "Over the last few weeks, I've come to the conclusion that I am PS's resident vagina girl. Wait, stay with me. I have written about my (now ex) boyfriend giving me a Brazilian wax at home, experimented with \"vabbing\" (if you don't know what that is, consider yourself lucky), tried the \"vagina\" nails trend, and just last week got my first ever vagina facial, otherwise known as a \"vajacial.\" Are we sensing a pattern? For the unfamiliar - and I trust that there are a lot of you - a vajacial isn't actually a facial for your vagina. It's a facial for your vulva, the area that encompasses the external female genitalia. (The vagina is all internal.) The buzzy treatment has been all over my TikTok FYP, which left me intrigued enough that I decided to visit Sugaring NYC in Beverly Hills to test out its \"v-facial.\" What you can expect during said appointment varies depending on where you go. According to the brand's website, the process at this salon included hair removal, ingrown-hair extractions if needed, a chemical peel, a skin-care mask, and a treatment with a high-frequency machine. When I arrived at my appointment, an aesthetician led me into a room, where I popped off my pants and hopped onto the treatment table, butterfly style. As someone who writes about weird beauty sh*t all the time, I wasn't concerned whatsoever about what was in store for me. I was feeling good. Even when the aesthetician explained that she would first be removing my hair via the sugaring method versus waxing, I still wasn't worried. I've been getting Brazilian waxes for years (I've even waxed myself), so I didn't think I needed to be concerned about the pain. I heard her say, \"Alexa, play SZA,\" from behind, and I settled in for what I thought would be a quick and relaxing treatment. I was wrong. People, I cannot express to you how much sugaring hurts. I realize the hair-removal process is just a small piece of the vajacial, but since Sugaring NYC only performs its v-facial on hairless hoo-has, I feel it's worth mentioning. The process felt like it was moving at a snail's pace, and holy Jesus, it was no walk in the park. When she started on the \"lips\" is when I truly began questioning my sanity, as well as furiously texting my friends asking them if they thought I would exit the treatment room alive or on a stretcher. (I really need to invest in one of those \"A little bit dramatic\" T-shirts.) The entire hair-removal process should have taken 30 minutes, but I tacked on an extra 10 minutes of yelling expletives and trying to calm myself with deep breaths, which did not work whatsoever. Image Source: PS Photography | Renee Rodriguez My aesthetician was nothing if not supportive - she told me when to breathe in and when to breathe out and even said, \"Girl, you've got this!\" multiple times, and yet the pain was all-encompassing. Think Steve Carell in \"The 40-Year-Old Virgin,\" except I was screaming way worse things than \"Kelly Clarkson.\" Once the sugaring was (finally) over, it was time to move on to the real reason we've all gathered here today: the vajacial. The first step was to steam the area, which she explained would soften the skin and allow the products she'd be applying later to more easily penetrate. To be honest, while I probably would have normally felt like hot air hitting my Pikachu sounded terrible, anything was better than having my pubic hair ripped out slowly and methodically. After letting the steam do its thing for a few minutes, we moved on to the second step - a glycolic-acid chemical peel. I know what you're thinking - a chemical peel? Down there? After sugaring?! Trust me, I thought the same. The purpose is to exfoliate the skin and treat discoloration, but still, I was freaked the f*ck out. She applied it to my bikini line as well as the top area of my vulva, and although I thought it would sting or burn, we only left it on for a few minutes before wiping it off, so I barely noticed it. Next, it was time for a mask. When the aesthetician asked me what kind of mask I wanted to do, I was stumped. \"We have hydrating options, pore-refining options, and brightening options,\" she said. \"What do you feel like the area needs?\" As I gazed down at my naked lower half, the only descriptive word that came to mind was \"perfect.\" I honestly didn't feel like the area needed much help, so I went with their most basic option: a lavender calming mask. Once applied, we let it sit for 10 minutes until it hardened, which was probably the most relaxing portion of the treatment. Image Source: PS Photography | Renee Rodriguez The last step was a high-frequency machine, which the aesthetician said would help eliminate bacteria by pushing oxygen into my pores. She laid down some gauze before going over the area with a wand-like tool, which didn't feel like much of anything, but it looked like a torture device all the same. It also made scary zapping noises every so often, but ultimately, it wasn't bad. By the end of the treatment, my slicked-back bun had fallen into disarray and the pillow I was initially resting my head on was on the floor, but my lower half looked damn good. Would I ever get another vajacial? If I could skip the sugaring process, abso-freaking-lutely. If not? Sorry, dear vulva, but you will just have to live without.
