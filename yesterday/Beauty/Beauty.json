    "description": "Like so many, my rollercoaster of a hair journey began in my teens: When I was 15, I took box dye and attempted to give myself blonde highlights. The result was an embarrassing brassy, brassy mess. Three years later, in a fit of frustration at my hair’s uncontrollable, unruly nature, I cut it all off (I immediately regretted this impulsive decision). Thick, coarse, dull, and wild in its random waves and curls, my hair has always been less of a friend and more of a foe — something to tackle and conquer. My childhood is punctuated with memories of my mother tugging and pulling my hair into submission. And no matter how many times I’ve had it thinned out or layered or chemically treated, it’s always left my hair frizzy, damaged, and, quite frankly, disappointing. So, over a decade ago, I washed my hands of it all — no more dyes, no more chemicals, no more hot tools. Nothing. I resigned myself to a life of taming it by twisting it into a French braid, or throwing it up into a topknot, or smoothing it back into a ponytail.  Now, I have what you call “virgin hair” — hair that is healthy, that hasn’t been chemically processed (perms, straighteners) or color-treated (bleach) in at least five years. In other words, hair in its natural state, unprocessed and undamaged. Which made me the perfect person to test-drive Glaze’s Supergloss, a semipermanent conditioning gloss designed for virgin hair that’s formulated to boost shine, inject a dose of intense hydration, and enhance your natural hair color. Yes, to me, it sounded too good to be true. Yes, like all longtime beauty writers, I was a bit of a skeptic.  So, I went in with cautious optimism. The product promises an exceedingly easy, mess-free application — and it truly was. As a child, I helped my mom dye her hair at home, so I know how much of a production it can be: there’s typically a lot of mixing of things, timing of things, laying down of things to prevent stains. So many of things. But with Supergloss, you simply pull on a pair of disposable gloves, squeeze a generous dollop, and then run it evenly over damp clean strands. I covered my whole head in Chocolate Gleam — a warm, rich chocolate-y brown shade — in a few minutes. I let it marinate for the required 10 minutes, and rinsed it off.  Under the natural light of day, I saw the true extent of Supergloss’ powers. Intriguingly subtle, yet delightfully impactful. The shine I so desperately wanted was very much there: there was a glossy, satiny sheen that, for once, reflected light instead of absorbing it; my texture was more defined in such a way that it cascaded down my back in soft, delicate waves; the color was a “my hair but better” shade that looked dimensional, not flat; and finally, thanks to Supergloss’ blend of intensive conditioners (including antioxidant-rich Babassu Oil) and glossifying complexes, my strands felt both soft and strong. Healthy.  Because it’s a semipermanent formula, it’s good for up to 10 washes. And rest assured, no damage will be incurred — it’s sulfate-, ammonia-, and paraben-free. Low stakes, high reward.  I know Supergloss isn’t for everyone. It’s a tinted moisturizer for your hair, not a full-coverage foundation. So, it’s not meant to cover grays or completely overhaul your hair color (those with non-virgin hair should check out Glaze’s range of hair toners or highlights, which were specially designed for bleached or highlighted strands). But for me — for the first time in a long time — I can confidently wear my hair down and embrace it in all its natural glory. You can shop Supergloss at Glazehair.com or find it at Target. .primisslate { display: none !important; } Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "title": "Eczema Looks Different on Melanated Skin - Here's How to Treat It",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/treat-eczema-melanated-skin-48754556",
    "description": "It's one thing to experience difficulty with locking moisture in your skin from time to time, but if the occasional itchiness and dryness linger, causing your skin to feel scaly, patchy, or like sandpaper, you may have eczema. Those with the skin condition know it can be quite a challenge to get under control, especially when flare-ups seem to keep developing overnight with no clear cause. For anyone with melanin-rich skin, this condition may be even more challenging to navigate, especially because Black skin is typically underrepresented in dermatological research, with only 4.5 percent of medical textbooks showing conditions on dark skin, according to a study published in \"Social Science \u0026 Medicine.\" This makes it difficult to recognize and identify what skin conditions are presented and how you're supposed to treat them, as well as advocate for a proper diagnosis. That's why we chatted with Jessica Shepherd, PhD, chief medical officer at Verywell Health, who recently helped launch its Health Divide: Skin Conditions and Darker Skin, to discuss how eczema looks on melanated skin, what causes it, and how to care for it. Experts Featured in This Article Jessica Shepherd, PhD, is the chief medical officer at Verywell Health. Sharon Wong is a UK-based consultant dermatologist. What Is Eczema? \"Eczema is a common inflammatory skin condition that causes dry, itchy, red, or scaly skin and affects about 10 percent of all people in the US,\" Dr. Shepherd says. \"It's generally not harmful but can be uncomfortable if left untreated.\" It's a chronic condition where an overactive immune system leads to an impaired skin barrier that can cause dry, itchy skin and even skin infections. It can appear as early as infancy and usually shows up on the face, elbows, and knees. From there, it can eventually spread to other parts of the body. Medically, it's called atopic dermatitis, and dermatologists typically diagnose eczema by its appearance and occasionally by biopsies to exclude any other issues. What makes the skin condition more complicated, however, is that it manifests itself differently for everyone. Eczema can be caused by a few things including genetics, environment, stress, or even allergies and asthma. If someone in your family has eczema, you're more likely to develop it at some point during your life. Your environment can play a role as well - air pollutants, harsh detergents or soaps, low humidity, smoking, and more can all cause outbreaks. Other factors like being stressed, having asthma, or allergies are likely to cause inflammation. Are People With Melanated Skin More Prone to Eczema? Research has shown that eczema is more common on dark skin and more likely to be misdiagnosed. In fact, eczema is more likely to affect Black children than those of other ethnicities. According to the National Eczema Association, 20 percent of Black children in the United States have some form of eczema. That's compared to 13 percent of Asian children, 13 percent of Native American children, 12 percent of white children, and 11 percent of Hispanic children. When it comes to adults, 11 percent of Hispanic adults are diagnosed with eczema, with nine percent of Asian adults and eight percent of both Native American and Black adults being impacted by the skin condition. How Does Eczema Present Differently on Melanated Skin? Most symptoms tend to be the same for people with darker versus lighter skin; however, those with darker skin may also experience changes in skin color on the affected area, swelling or oozing, or a thickening of the skin. How to Treat Eczema on Melanated Skin Treatment of eczema on melanated skin is more or less the same, but what's more important is recognizing and diagnosing the condition early on. While eczema is more common on darker skin, it's often misdiagnosed or not managed properly. This is mostly due to the condition being less noticeable on darker skin and healthcare providers not being familiar with treating darker skin. That can then lead to delayed treatment, which can make managing eczema more difficult. If you do identify the condition, there are a few key steps to take. \"When eczema is flared, pare back to simple skin care,\" UK-based consultant dermatologist Sharon Wong says. First, it's best to stay away from irritants and cut out all soaps, fragrances, and detergents as necessary; this is to ensure the skin isn't exposed to further irritation and make sure it's not stripped of its natural oils. Dr. Wong also advises not to use plant or natural oils, as these aren't as effective as moisturizers for eczema and may potentially trigger further sensitivity. Instead, be prepared to moisturize a lot using specially formulated creams. There are many lotions on the market that are specifically tailored for those with sensitive skin and/or eczema; they can help soothe flare-ups and prevent new ones from happening. \"It's not uncommon that during a severe flare-up involving a large surface area of the body, your skin will require 500 g of moisturizer every one to weeks,\" Dr. Wong says. This means it's essential to top up on moisturizer throughout the day and pay close attention to particularly flared areas of the skin. When it comes to perfumes or anything you directly spray onto your skin, try a test patch before using it all over your body. The specific ingredients include ceramides, glycerin, and liquid paraffin, which is often in thicker moisturizers, as these \"will essentially act like a plaster while the skin barrier is broken down during a flare-up, which allows the skin to heal,\" Dr. Wong says. When it comes to body wash, you should also look out for soap alternatives. As much as what you put on your skin matters, it's also important to consider internal aggressors that could be leading to your eczema manifesting externally. Try to keep stress under as much control as possible, and wear loose-fitting clothes since tighter options can cause friction that further aggravates the skin. Since dramatic temperature changes can lead to flare-ups, try changing the temperature of water when showering or bathing. Obvious as it may sound, washing clothes and sheets regularly can also help prevent pollutants from making contact with skin. With eczema, every little thing you can do makes a big difference. - Additional reporting by Tori Crowther Tori Crowther is a freelance beauty journalist and former PS UK editor.

    "description": "Boldness was calling. My long blond ends were my hair default, my security blanket since 2019. At that point, I'd been planning my upcoming nuptials - focused more on my bridal beauty look than my crumbling relationship. My Pinterest boards overflowed with \"retro regal\" inspiration - a lemony Grace Kelly bun that morphed into a Bardot ponytail. Fast forward to 2025, six years later: That wedding never happened, yet I still clung to the credence that long hair meant variety; long hair meant sexy. You can pile it high into a Dolce \u0026 Gabbana updo or slick it into a Hailey Bieber bun. I felt that way until a week before my 40th birthday this past February when I saw a photo of myself. The broken hair was obvious. My strands bore the scars of six years of bleach. It was doing nothing for me - not flattering a single feature, it was just . . . there. That's when the vision struck – what about a chin-grazing chop? A quantum beauty leap into a \"short hair, don't care\" decade. I began my research, overwhelmed by the bob-ptions - there's the \"baroque\" bob, the \"Prada\" bob, and even the floppy \"cowgirl bob.\" How short do you go?

Raphael Mauriello is the senior colorist at Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa. What Is a \"Princess\" Bob Haircut? I knew who to turn to for my transformation: the visionary French hair architect Julien Farel, CEO and chairman of the Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa in New York City and Palm Beach. Farel, an undeniable icon himself (yes, Martha Stewart has sat in his chair), is renowned for conjuring up new identities with a pair of scissors. With my heart set on a bob that would reign supreme, I settled in his chair at his bustling Park Avenue salon armed with inspo. He quickly eyed my references and said, \"Shorter than these photos. A sur mesure 'princess bob' for you - just below the ears. Polished, elegant, and sophisticated. The length is very important to capture your sharp jawline.\" But what makes a princess bob a princess bob, you ask? Inspired by one of its most popular wearers, royal 'it' girl Princess Olympia of Greece, Farel says the princess look is a chic, short bob haircut with an invisible layer to add movement, keeping the look super blunt. Worn parted down the middle, you might as well add a royal title to your bio. My Princess Bob Transformation Shorter? The haircut anxiety hit me as I wondered if I had enough time to bolt. Just as I contemplated my escape, Farel snipped off the first chunk of hair and handed it to me - a reminder of my past \"look\" akin to barn hay. I exhaled and already felt better. After I got shampooed, scalp massaged, and conditioned, I was ready for Farel, the master of makeovers, to work his enchantment. As he masterfully shaped and angled what felt like every single strand, we discussed what a new haircut can do for one's confidence. \"We are the cheapest surgeons,\" Farel said. \"You can completely change how someone looks by adjusting the volume of their hair to suit their face shape.\" When I asked about the bespoke bob he was creating for me, he said, \"This is tailored to your face and lifestyle. I want you to be able to wear it and style it any way you want - straight, sleek, wavy, curly, bouncy.\" After a whirlwind of snipping, feathering, flipping, and blow drying, I turned to the mirror, stunned by my new look. Who was this chic - and dare I say, regal - version of me? Farel smiled and said, \"When you walked in here, your hair was making you tired. It was draining your energy. I had to lift you up. I had a vision for you: You look fresh, sexy, and glam, and your hair texture looks and feels healthy again.\" He finished with, \"Next up . . . blonder. Come back for a lighter platinum look in a few days.\" Those few days with my new cut were filled with compliments and confidence overload. While on 59th Street, I snapped a selfie to share with my friends, and a stranger chimed in, \"Don't worry. You look hot.\" I was giddy. When my boyfriend saw me, he twirled me around and put his hands around my waist. \"You look younger. I can see your face.\" I walked with a new swagger. I even scored free matcha cookies while picking up my Bondi Sushi order. Next on the agenda was the color, and for any blond, nothing turns us on more than the word \"blonder.\" I returned to Julien Farel Restore Salon \u0026 Spa and met with senior colorist Raphael Mauriello to make the leap to platinum. \"Platinum is timeless and harmonizes beautifully with your coloring and short hair,\" Mauriello said. \"From Marilyn Monroe to Madonna and Kim Kardashian, platinum signifies both power and softness.\" As he painted my hair with a bowl of lavender cream, he continued, \"Platinum is perfect for you because it thrives with frequent trims, minimizing damage.\" He added, \"It also complements your vibrant personality.\" After the blond was fully baked, I enjoyed a lavish hot towel treatment to lock in moisture and got a beachy, piecey blowout. I glided through the salon, which now felt like my place of rebirth, fully reveling in my results. Princess, queen, your royal highness - whatever crowned title was bestowed on this bob felt irrelevant. I was me, just better.
