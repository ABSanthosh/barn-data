    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  It’s 2 a.m. and I can’t sleep. There is no breeze coming from the wide-open window next to me, but the air is clawing at the eczema on my neck. It feels like it’s on fire. I’m not scratching it, but it burns. I get up and grab some frozen peas wrapped in a towel; I’m not sure if it’ll help, but I’ll try anything at this point. My leathery-looking, eczema-laden wrists are soaked in steroid cream and wrapped in bandages. I lie there wondering if this is what hell feels like. Dramatic? Perhaps. But a chronic skin condition can make anyone feel this way.  In the grand scheme of things, my eczema isn’t even that “bad” considering I only get it in small patches. So I can understand why plenty of people with more extreme eczema might turn to tanning beds for relief despite their dangerous reputation.  Why do people use tanning beds to treat eczema? On TikTok, the phrases “eczema and tanning beds” and “sunbeds eczema” have a combined 233.1 million views. There, videos filled with personal testimonies and misinformation are rife, claiming positive results without noting the risks or providing evidence. One user shared a video saying they use a tanning bed for 20 minutes daily before taking a bath. “It’s doing my skin the world of good,” they insist. “I know I look better, and I know it is the sunbed use.” Another user revealed that they were willing to try tanning beds again despite getting second-degree burns in a previous session, all because “someone said, if you go on the sunbeds it helps your skin a little bit”. Others joke about ignoring the risks of melanoma, a type of skin cancer caused by UV radiation. This only appears to enable users in the comments: “Might have a sun bed after watching this,” wrote one. I was keen to know if people in the “real world” turn to tanning beds in a bid to treat their eczema, and the responses I received were alarming. Ellie, 24, admitted to using tanning beds as an eczema treatment even though she had previously had a cancer scare. “I have loads of moles and actually had a cancerous mole from abusing [tanning beds] too much when I was younger,” she says. “I did use them a few times [after that] to help my skin condition, but I stopped because long term, it isn’t good at all. I won’t touch tanning beds now, even when I have a flare-up.” When asked what changed her mind, Ellie said: “Tanning beds are just quick fixes, and I can’t help but feel like I’m causing further damage — even if it’s helping me feel better in the moment.” Ellie’s worry makes sense as the scientific research is abundantly clear: The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies tanning beds as a human carcinogen. Tanning bed usage statistically increases your chances of developing various skin cancers, and your risk of cancer becomes higher the more you use them. This is because ultraviolet (UV) radiation damages the DNA in your skin cells. The Skin Cancer Foundation drives home that even one tanning bed session is highly dangerous. In fact, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma (the second most common skin cancer) is at least 67% higher in people who have ever used a tanning bed at any age compared with those who have never used one.  Despite the well-documented risks, Elise Loubatieres-Phan Ngoc, a content creator known for sharing her experience with eczema and hyperthyroidism, says that she has received an abundance of comments over the years, mainly from people recommending tanning beds for her skin condition. Irrespective of the noise, she is steadfast in her decision to avoid tanning beds, telling me that she believes they just replace one problem with another.  Writer Chloe Laws, 29, admits to using tanning beds for her psoriasis in the past. Although psoriasis is not the same as eczema, it too causes inflammation, irritation, and dry patches of skin. As such, Laws says that her reasoning for using tanning beds was similar to those with eczema. While she has now sworn off them completely, she says that she used tanning beds out of “absolute desperation” when she was willing to give anything a try, “even though the logical part of your brain will say not to,” she adds. I can personally relate to this desperation. The impact of eczema on mental health is undeniable: According to the National Eczema Association, adults with eczema have a higher risk of anxiety or depression. Do tanning beds help with eczema? With eczema having such a profound, negative impact on quality of life, it’s understandable that people turn to tanning beds. But anecdotal evidence aside, is there any truth in their supposed benefits? It pays to understand what might cause eczema in the first instance.  Dr. Emma Wedgeworth, consultant dermatologist and British Skin Foundation spokesperson, says that alongside environmental factors (like temperature changes and allergies), a known cause of eczema is an overactive immune system. Some research shows that UV radiation, which tanning beds emit, can weaken the immune system within the skin. This is known as immunosuppression, says Dr. Wedgeworth. In short, some studies suggest that certain wavelengths of UV may relieve eczema symptoms. But it’s not quite so cut and dried. What is the difference between UVA and UVB/phototherapy light treatments? While tanning beds do emit UV, research from the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care confirms that they cannot be used to treat eczema. Rather, medical UV treatment for eczema — referred to as phototherapy — is a recommended professional option. Consultant dermatologist Dr. Alia Ahmed explains that phototherapy enlists only one type of UV light: “Something called ‘narrowband UVB’ or ‘NB-UVB’ is used to treat eczema in dermatology departments,” she says. “This type of light therapy has harmful UV rays filtered out for increased safety, and it’s closely monitored by dermatologists.” Here, the UV wavelengths target specific areas of the body affected by eczema. Conversely, tanning beds mostly emit harmful UVA (responsible for a tan), which damages the entire skin.  Dr. Ahmed adds that UVA penetrates deeper into the skin compared to other types of UV radiation. “Every time you tan or burn, you damage the DNA in your skin,” says Dr. Ahmed. “The more you damage your DNA, the greater your risk of getting skin cancer.” Tanning beds and phototherapy are not the same, and the risks of tanning beds remain unequivocal.  Considering the indisputable links to skin cancer, Dr. Wedgeworth says that using tanning beds to treat eczema is a “very high-risk strategy”. But that’s not all. While certain UV rays might improve eczema symptoms when administered by a medical professional, there is a proportion of eczema that is actually worsened by UV light, says Dr. Wedgeworth. This is known as photo-aggravated eczema and is estimated to affect around 1.4% to 16% of people with atopic eczema. Is sunshine and vitamin D good for eczema? It’s clear that there are various pervasive myths surrounding tanning beds and eczema, but it would be remiss not to acknowledge sunbathing outdoors, and it is widely believed that vitamin D from sunshine can alleviate eczema symptoms. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, getting enough vitamin D from tanning beds isn’t possible, considering that they mainly emit UVA rays. Sunshine, on the other hand, emits UVB, too, which provides the energy your skin needs to create vitamin D. Dr. Ahmed says that studies have found severe eczema to be associated with lower vitamin D levels. “The reason behind this is not fully understood,” Dr. Ahmed says, “but vitamin D plays a role in skin barrier function and may have anti-inflammatory properties.” That said, the effects of sunshine itself on eczema aren’t fully understood. “Some people report that the sun helps their skin, while others say it makes it worse. The effect of sunshine on eczema varies between individuals,” says Dr. Ahmed. While many may find their skin feels better in warm weather, Dr. Wedgeworth says this isn’t due to the sun alone. Research shows that it’s often a combination of things (like a warm climate and no drying indoor heating) as well as UV exposure. As for vitamin D supplements, Dr. Wedgeworth agrees that it’s “important to maintain healthy vitamin D levels” but notes that there is a distinct lack of evidence to support the idea that vitamin D supplements improve eczema symptoms. For all the anecdotal evidence that suggests sunshine can make your eczema feel better, research says that heat and sweat might actually make it worse. Some people might feel itchier when it’s hot and sweaty, as sodium from sweat can dry out the skin and sting or irritate already-inflamed areas, says Dr. Ahmed. Dr. Wedgeworth adds that this can lead to more scratching and exacerbated eczema symptoms.  If you enjoy spending time in the sun and feel your eczema benefits as a result, Dr. Wedgeworth reminds us that we should always take precautions to reduce our chances of skin damage and developing skin cancer. Wear protective clothing, stick to shaded areas, and avoid spending time outside between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. when the sun is at its hottest. Dermatologists also recommend using a broad-spectrum sunscreen of at least SPF 30. According to Dr. Wedgeworth, the best sunscreens for eczema-prone skin tend not to be fragranced, and some people may tolerate mineral sunscreens better than chemical sunscreens. However, the former are more likely to leave behind a white cast on darker skin. How do you get rid of eczema? Treating eczema can feel like a constant battle. Instead of self-medicating with tanning beds, which can do more harm than good, consider visiting your doctor. They are likely to start you off with topical emollient creams and soap substitutes, which prevent moisture escaping from the skin and alleviate dry, rough patches. Topical steroid creams can treat the uncomfortable dryness caused by eczema, but they require a prescription, though weaker topical steroids like hydrocortisone (found in Aveeno 1% Hydrocortisone Anti Itch, sold at Walmart) are also available to buy over the counter. Even so, it’s wise to consult a healthcare professional before you go ahead and buy.  If these topical treatments don’t help, ask your doctor to refer you to a dermatologist. Aside from topicals, Loubatieres-Phan Ngoc relies on LED light, namely the Dermalux Flex MD LED Light Therapy Device, to treat her eczema. However, at $2,569.99, it’s expensive, and there isn’t enough research to show that LED can help with eczema symptoms. Despite some anecdotal evidence, “LED is a different wavelength of light to UV radiation,” explains Dr. Wedgeworth, “and probably doesn’t have the same immunosuppressive effects [as phototherapy].”  Where tanning beds are concerned, they are certainly not a cure-all for eczema. Their risks far outweigh any potential positive side effects, and there are much more effective treatment methods available with the help of doctors and dermatologists. If you’re eczema-prone, protecting your already-inflamed skin from harmful UV rays is paramount, and attempting to treat a skin condition without the help of a trained healthcare professional isn’t recommended. As for me? My neck might sometimes feel like it’s had a harsh encounter with a cactus, but having read the research and spoken to the experts, I’ll pass on the tanning beds.   This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-no7-skincare-products?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "You don’t have to search very long to find plenty of TikTok-famous, viral beauty brands that are undoubtedly having a moment. But we would argue that longevity and credibility go much further than a trendy product. (After all, brands achieve heritage status because of their long history, consistency, and ride-or-die customer loyalty.) And when considering tried-and-true skincare brands, one name kept popping up when I polled our British coworkers: No7. The brand is a household name across the pond (it launched in 1935 ), but has been somewhat of a best-kept secret here in the States — until now. Historically, the brand focused on helping women look and feel their best with products that can be relied on for efficacy and results — without breaking the bank. That message still holds true today (most products clock in under $30, and nothing exceeds $45), and if you ask us, the brand is highly slept on. Looking to change that, we asked our team to share their favorite products from No7, ranging from sfrom serums to moisturizers — plus a mascara that rivals luxury brands. Shop them all below. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lash Impact Mascara, $9.99 “I’ve been using this product since I was 14, no word of a lie. My friend and I used to go into our local Boots in our small town and go makeup shopping, which consisted of foundation (Maybelline Dream Matte Mousse, obviously), concealer (for the lips), and mascara. This mascara is the only product that has stood the test of time in my makeup bag all those years. It’s lengthening and volumising without being clumpy. It’s the closest thing to a Chanel mascara I’ve found on the high street, at only $10.” — Kelly Washington, Social Editor Derm Solutions Daily Lightweight Moisturiser, $19.99 “As an oily skin girlie, I’ve tested every product with a combination of ‘water,’ ‘gel,’ ‘lightweight,’ — you name it, I’ve tried it. I had a chance to learn more about this particular formula this year at The American Academy of Dermatology  (the largest professional organization of dermatologists in the country) annual conference — aka, the perfect place to celebrate No7’s latest launches that were developed in partnership with dermatologists — and it’s nothing short of outstanding. The texture is silky and rich, but not heavy. It feels incredible on my skin and absorbs instantly, leaving behind a natural, healthy glow. It’s made with a proprietary complex that includes ceramides, niacinamide, and adaptogens to soothe and lock in moisture. It feels so, so luxe, I’d never in a million years guess it’s $20 (currently on sale at Target for $17!) — easily, my new holy grail day moisturizer.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer HydraLuminous+ Hydrating Dual Phase Mask, $14.99 “In the past few years, I’ve discovered the benefits of hydrating masks after dermatologists informed me of my chronically dehydrated skin. Two of my formulas of choice are Laneige’s Water Sleeping Mask and Drunk Elephant’s F-Balm Waterfacial. Both excellent, yes, but pricey at $32 and $54. No7’s HydraLuminous+ Hydrating Dual Phase Mask is like a gallon of water for your face. It’s packed with hyaluronic acid and niacinamide to quench skin and maintain clear pores, and has the most decadent serum-like texture that evolves into a gel-cream as you massage it into your skin — that’s the dual-phase formula at work. After 15 minutes, I feel like my complexion looks brighter and feels touchably softer and smoother. (You can also use it as an overnight mask to wake up to beautifully hydrated skin.) And at only $15? I’m sold.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Future Renew Damage Reversal Serum, $39.99 “At the launch of this serum a few months ago, I was lucky enough to sit next to Dr. Mike Bell — the scientist who tests all of No7’s products before they hit the market — and he told me so much about this formula that I was convinced to try it that very evening. I had an unlabelled lab sample! Even after just one use, my skin looked better the very next morning. Like magic, it appeared plumper, smoother, and brighter. The star ingredients are peptides — proteins that help strengthen the skin — but it also contains moisturising glycerin, oil-balancing niacinamide, and hydrating, soothing panthenol (also known as vitamin B5). Paired with the aforementioned serum, which I concentrate under my eyes, as well as my favorite moisturizer (currently Belif The True Cream Moisturizing Bomb), it’s a brilliant product for softening the appearance of fine lines worsened by dehydration. I also smooth it down my neck and over the backs of my hands.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Laboratories Line Correcting Booster Serum, $42.99 “While it works across the entire face, No7’s Line Correcting Booster Serum is hands-down the best serum I’ve ever used for under-eye lines. I first tried it in 2021 — and even wrote  a review for the site, I was that impressed — and it’s been my go-to ever since. The star ingredient is Matrixyl 3000+, a peptide that helps repair and strengthen skin while boosting collagen and elastin — the proteins that keep skin firm and supple. Don’t just take my word for it — the before and after photos speak for themselves. I’ve always had a deep line beneath each eye, but this significantly smoothed them out. That’s down to the Matrixyl, along with ultra-hydrating glycerin and moisture-boosting humectants like butylene glycol and sodium lactate. Whenever someone asks me for an eye cream recommendation, I point them to this. I’ll never stop using it.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Future Renew Day Cream SPF 25, $34.99 “A few years ago, I tested out No7’s Future Renew line, along with some of my colleagues. The product that I’ve kept in rotation (and re-bought) is the Future Renew Day Cream. Why? It’s deeply hydrating and leaves my dry skin looking and feeling plump and glowy (all thanks to a combination of hyaluronic acid, vitamin C, and niacinamide — aka a form of vitamin B3); it doesn’t irritate my sensitive skin and isn’t overly scented; it sinks in quickly; and has SPF 25. Simply put, this is a great day cream for anyone not wanting to shell out an arm and a leg.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Like what you see?

    "description": "I've been doing my makeup for a long time, but it's never occurred to me to venture into SPF products. After all, I'm a routine type of girl, so once I find a product that works well for me, I stick to it. Being that beauty's entered the era of hybrid and multiuse products, there's one item that's successfully found its way into my arsenal (and quickly becoming one of my favorites) - the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick ($28). This new offering is the beauty world's first blush-meets-bronzer infused with SPF 50. And since the brand's previous blush/bronzer sold out seven times, trying this iteration in stick form was a no-brainer. While all the girls have raved about blush in recent trend cycles (think Hailey Bieber's \"strawberry girl\" blush or TikTok's jelly doughnut blush trend), I've stuck to my barely-there powder blush. I've always been more comfortable with my bronzing skills to achieve the warm makeup look. Regardless, I hadn't tried a blush and bronzer balm until now, and I can confidently say that I won't be going back to powder products anytime soon. Keep reading for my full review of the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick and find out why it's become a staple in my makeup routine. About the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick Its vegan, cruelty-free, and non-comedogenic. It comes in three shades: Pink Pop, Dusty Pink, and Bronze. The stick is made with ingredients like peptides, antioxidant-rich Vitamin E, and avocado seed extract to stimulate collagen production, strengthen the skin's barrier, and repair damage caused by stressors like UV radiation and pollution. You can wear it as a finishing step in your skin-care routine or combine it with other makeup products. What I Like About the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick As someone who doesn't rely on applying too much blush, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed using this hybrid balm stick from Naked Sundays. After completing my go-to complexion routine, I proceeded to swipe the stick onto my face, and the formula felt super lightweight. I'm usually cautious when it comes to layering products since I have normal-to-oily skin, but once I swiped it a few times, it brought about a naturally glowy dimension. I always aim to do warm-looking glam, so it was pleasing to find that this bronzer-meets-blush did just that in one fell swoop (I used the shades Dusty Pink and Bronze). I also loved that this product nourished my skin while making me shine, as makeup products can be harsh on bare skin at times. And though it's a sunscreen, it didn't leave that dreaded white cast - only a dewy, matte finish. After applying, I went in with my usual setting products and was ready for my night out. How to Use the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick The Naked Sundays SPF 50 Peptide Stick comes in a handy, easy-to-use cylindrical tube where you can turn the stick so that the product comes up. Whether you're using it on a full face of makeup or your bare skin, you can swipe the stick directly onto the cheekbones. Then, tap the product into your skin with your fingertips or even a fluffy brush, blending it upwards, toward your temples (I found the brush to work best). Feel free to blend or reapply until you get your desired finish. If you're using the stick as a bronzer, you can follow the same process along the length of your nose. What to Consider Before Trying the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick In case you're looking for a blush that has more pigment, I highly suggest going with the brightest shade - Pink Pop. If you choose a shade that's relatively close to your skin tone, the color may not show upon immediate application. I used Dusty Pink as my blush, and it took a few swipes to build some noticeable pigment. This balm should only be applied as an added layer of SPF and makeup, not as a replacement, so be sure to still use your trusted face sunscreen before using it. Where Is the Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick Available? The Naked Sundays SPF 50 Glow Balm Mineral Peptide Stick is available on the brand's website.

    "description": "We don't know about you, but for us, if we're having a good hair day, it feels like nothing can stop us. It doesn't matter if the look took us hours to achieve or just a few minutes; there's nothing better than a G.H.D. (good hair day). We love a beachy look done with a curling iron, a fun blowout styled with a blowdryer brush, or even a simple air-dried look that's been made more cohesive with the help of some no-heat hair hacks. However, the days when our hair looks like it belongs to a supermodel and didn't take us longer than twenty minutes to achieve are the days we're most excited. On those days, we almost always used hot rollers. Hot rollers are great because you can pop them in and multitask. Whether you need to finish your makeup, fire off a work email, or finish cleaning the house before guests come over, they essentially do all the hard work for you, and you don't have to lift a finger. The hair tool has been around forever, but they recently had a resurgence in popularity thanks to hot roller content on TikTok. Not only will they give your hair tons of volume, but the curls they produce will last for hours as well. There are plenty of different options on the market, and ahead, we're breaking down the best options out there. Whether you're looking for the best hot rollers for long hair or the best hot rollers for damaged hair, we've got you covered. Keep scrolling to check out all of our picks.",
