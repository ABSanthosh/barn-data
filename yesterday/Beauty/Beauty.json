If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I consider myself somewhat of a Dyson whisperer at Refinery29; I’ve tested several of its bestselling hair tools (including one for long-haired pets) as well as its debut range of hair styling products, which dropped last year. And as much as my wallet would love to say otherwise, I can confidently say that the brand’s innovations are worth every penny. If you’re looking for a spring hair refresh, look no further: Dyson is kicking spring off with a fresh drop of hair tech, including a new tool that was only recently available for hairstylists: the Supersonic r. You may have seen this hairdryer in salons already, but this pro-exclusive piece of technology is finally available for you to use at home. The Supersonic r (the lowercase r is a nod to the device’s elongated, slightly curved shape) is, in short, a smaller and lighter version of the OG Supersonic, but is truthfully so much more than just a sleek offshoot. The one-of-a-kind shape delivers precise airflow and unparalleled control (when I’ve seen stylists use it, it’s as if the device is an extension of their hand), with an ergonomic design that ensures maximum comfort during use. This matters, regardless of whether you’re styling multiple heads of hair or just your own. Supersonic r™ hair dryer (Ceramic Pink/Rose Gold), $569.99 All buttons have been designed to be within a thumb’s reach (no awkward wielding here), and the r comes with all the attachments you would expect from a Dyson dryer: a concentrator nozzle, wide-tooth comb, flyaway tool, diffuser, and a powerful air attachment to boost airflow. (Also new to the r: A specially-designed motor and smart sensors that automatically tailor the speed and temperature for each attachment.) At $569.99 (a slight increase from the Supersonic Nural’s $499.99 price tag), the Supersonic r is indeed an investment, but one that is bound to pay off in dividends if you’re serious about hair health, DIY salon-quality blowouts, and fewer hand cramps in 2025. But that’s not all: Dyson not only unveiled the Supersonic r in a gorgeous shade of matte pale pink with rose metallic accents (a from-the-vault colorway that was offered in a limited run a year ago), but has reimagined its entire suite of hair tools in the same ultra-covetable colorway. In other words, if you haven’t yet treated yourself to the Airwrap, Supersonic Nural, or Airstrait, now’s your chance to shop it in its prettiest hue yet — while they’re still in stock. DashDividers_1_500x100 Dyson Supersonic r™ hair dryer (Jasper Plum), $569.99 Just in time for spring (and right ahead of Mother’s Day gifting season), the brand has also released Jasper Plum, a shimmery deep purple colorway. The shade is offset by dreamy blush pink fixtures, echoing the color palette of the Chitosan Styling Products. This will look so good on your beauty cabinet, and like the Ceramic Pop collection — its viral predecessor — we predict a total sell-out. Like what you see?

    "description": "Nothing can ever replace being with a loved one, but if they've passed on, a memorial tattoo is a lovely way to keep their legacy alive. Whether it's something tiny or an elaborate piece of art that takes up your whole arm, there's no shortage of memorial tattoo ideas out there. Getting an \"in loving memory\" tattoo inked in honor of someone you love and admire can also be a therapeutic part of the grieving process. For many, it's a permanent way to keep a loved one close when they physically can't be there anymore, as well as a permanent reminder of the memories and love you will always carry. Since it's a permanent symbol of remembrance, you want to be 100 percent sure about the design and tattoo you choose. If you're struggling to think of some inspiration, we recommend brainstorming about something that has always stuck with you, a symbolic reminder that represents what they mean to you, or a vivid memory you have of them. Whether you're searching for simple memorial tattoos or just general tattoos for lost loved ones, we've got some ideas. Here are some real-life examples of memorial tattoos to get you thinking.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/grace-stella-under-eye-patches-review-49430410",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Larry Stansbury Let's be honest: we've all had those nights where sleep just doesn't happen. Whether it's a late-night Netflix binge, a looming deadline, or endless tossing and turning, the morning aftermath is always the same: puffy under-eye bags, dark circles, and a vibe that screams, 'I didn't get enough sleep!' Thankfully, I've tackled them in my morning routine with Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches ($23). As someone with a busy schedule, I love a product that can work its magic while I get ready in the morning. After testing Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches, within 15 minutes, I looked more awake than usual. Keep reading for my full review of the under-eye patches. About the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches The patches are made of hyaluronic acid, retinol, glycerin, sea moss, allantoin, and ceramide to deeply hydrate and plump your skin. They're dermatologist-tested and unscented that works for all skin types. They provide hydration, reduce puffiness, and diminish dark circles. You typically see results in 15 to 20 minutes. The eye patches come in 6-count, 24-count, and 48-count packs. What I Like About the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches What I love most about Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches is how effortlessly they elevate my skincare routine while delivering real results. From the moment I apply them, the cooling sensation feels like a mini spa treatment, instantly soothing and de-puffing my tired eyes. The patches stay perfectly in place, allowing me to multitask without worrying about them slipping. After just 15 minutes, my under-eye area looks visibly brighter, more hydrated, and refreshed - like I actually got eight hours of sleep! Plus, the patches make me feel luxurious thanks to their vibrant color. They're vegan, cruelty-free, and free of harsh chemicals, which makes me feel even more confident about incorporating them into my routine. After applying the patches, I was preparing to go to a dinner party and needed to put on makeup. I barely had to use concealer to cover my under-eyes, just tinted moisturizer.

Start with a clean and dry face, making sure your under-eye area is free from any makeup or oils. Carefully peel the patches from their protective backing and place one under each eye, ensuring the thicker part of the patch is positioned toward the outer corner of your eye. Press gently to secure them in place. Leave the patches on for 15 to 20 minutes while you relax or multitask - they stay put without sliding. Once time is up, remove the patches and gently pat any remaining essence into the skin for maximum hydration and glow. No rinsing needed. What to Consider Before Trying the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches If you've got sensitive skin or tend to get allergies, it's a good idea to do a patch test first. The essence has powerful ingredients like hyaluronic acid and botanical extracts, so it's better to play it safe.
