    "description": "With New York Fashion Week underway, the most obvious place to scout for fresh haircut inspiration would be backstage. But while the myriad looks dreamed up by talented hairstylists are certainly something to behold, some of the coolest cuts can actually be spotted on the city’s street stylers.Sure, the outfits tend to take precedence over hair, but a good cut can totally transform an aesthetic. This season alone, we’ve spotted razor-sharp bobs, ‘90s layers and, anything-but-boring medium-length chops to name a few styles. Without further ado, here are our favorites straight from NYC’s bustling streets this fashion week. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Meet the “boxie”, a cross between a bob and a pixie cut with a little extra shagginess. James Bickmore, art director at Neil Moodie Studio previously told R29, “The boxie is perfect for those who are growing out a pixie but don’t want a bob. It’s easy to manage and gets better as it grows out. It has a very ‘I woke up like this’ vibe — with a bit of an edge.”Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.This wavy, chunky-ended cut can only mean one thing: The Italian bob is back for 2025, and we're not at all mad about it. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.This sleek lob (aka long bob) and baroque bob (essentially a short bob with sculpted waves) certainly grabbed our attention outside Sandy Liang on Sunday. Could this photo be any more chic?Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Seen on a guest outside Sandy Liang, these braided bangs are the ultimate protective hairstyle for shorter front pieces. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.In-between haircuts are far from mediocre, and this is all the evidence you need. This guest's taupe cendré hair color elevates the shoulder-length cut perfectly. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Oval layers — a more subtle iteration of flicky '90s layers — are still going strong. This long cut spotted on a guest on Sunday is all the inspiration you need to give your long hair a little extra movement.Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Guests and models at shows like Sandy Liang are embracing big and bouncy curls this season. The russet red hair color here is just as stunning. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The “jellyfish” haircut merges the best of two popular styles: the sharpness of a bob and the swish of longer, layered lengths. The straight-across bangs complete this look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Full bangs are so back, and if you're into sleek updos like these seen on guests outside Sandy Liang, they add a little something extra. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Long layers will never go out of style. We love this cut seen on a street styler outside Sandy Liang. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The '70s-esque shaggy bangs, floaty long layers, and amber blonde color earn this hairstyle top marks. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Here's picture proof that the blunt bob haircut is going nowhere. This shoulder-grazing chop is elevated by the shine-enhancing chocolate cherry hair color. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylists predict that triple XL hair, essentially long, long lengths, will reign supreme in 2025. These flowing goddess braids spotted on a guest outside the Christopher John Rogers runway show are beautiful. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Elevate any updo by asking your hairstylist for dainty face-framing pieces like this guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylist Tom Smith anticipates that bangs will become a hairstyle in their own right this year — and he's not wrong. This cut features blunter pieces among wispier sections of hair, and the result is totally unique. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.As seen outside Collina Strada, this jaw-skimming bob features shorter, wispier, face-framing pieces, which can be blown-out to add a little volume and variety. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're calling it: The “kicked” bob is the cut of the season. It's characterized by gentle flicks at the ends where the hair turns upward. Invest in a good flat iron like ghd Chronos Max, $349 to achieve a similar look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The burnished copper color is the cherry on top of this curly pineapple hairstyle spotted on a guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The side bang is back. We're especially into this longer, curled, and more voluminous style spied on a guest outside the Christian Siriano show. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Feathered layers? Yup. Face-framing pieces? Check. Shoulder-skimming length? Perfect. This cut — seen on a guest outside Chistian Siriano — nails three 2025 haircut trends in one. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're more than a little obsessed with this bluntly-sliced, wavy bob seen on Allure editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel.

    "description": "As far as classic accents go, tiny red or pink hearts make for a fun manicure any time of year, not just the first week of February. But seeing as we’re heading into Valentine’s Day season, we have a few ideas to level it up. Our favorite manicures of the moment are loosely inspired by Cupid, flowers and all things love. But just like the poppy-red Sezane cardigan in your wardrobe, these nail looks are timeless and a little flirty.  From a glossy black manicure with heart details to kitschy coquette nails, we’ve compiled the coolest Valentine’s Day nail art, ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 Coquette Nails View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) Pink ribbons, bow charms, and anything loosely Sandy Liang-inspired goes for coquette nails. DashDividers_1_500x100 Pink 3D Jelly View this post on Instagram A post shared by Celebrity Manicurist \u0026 Educator (@julieknailsnyc) A surprising trend for 2025? Jelly everything. Take your nail art inspiration from this look by celebrity manicurist Julie K, who used pink chrome polish topped with 3D Zig Zag Gel from Japanese gel brand Jello Jello. DashDividers_1_500x100 Black Heart View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) If pink and red feels too obvious, go for a glossy black manicure and a subtle heart outline. Throw in a teeny gemstone for sparkle. DashDividers_1_500x100 Pink + Red View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jess Brush💅🏻 (@nail.betch) Although, this pink and red combo is chic without being precious. DashDividers_1_500x100 Chrome Hearts View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola) If you can’t go full coquette, go for a chrome — or vanilla glazed donut — manicure with some hand-painted hearts on top. DashDividers_1_500x100 Gemstone French View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah Haidar (@heluviee) If you have access to gemstones, you might as well go all out with a cut-out heart embroidery-style design. DashDividers_1_500x100 Velvet Hearts View this post on Instagram A post shared by WhoDidHerNails (@whodidhernails) Velvet, glass, or cat-eye polish is fun on its own, but add hearts to take it up a notch. DashDividers_1_500x100 Pink Shimmer View this post on Instagram A post shared by stephanie stone (@stephstonenails) If you have a light pink polish and a glitter polish at home, you can DIY this adorable pixie dust-inspired V-Day manicure. DashDividers_1_500x100 White Hot View this post on Instagram A post shared by NAILS OF LA (@nails_of_la) A perfect complement to the chunky silver Tiffany tag bracelet they’ve hopefully bought for you. DashDividers_1_500x100 Red French View this post on Instagram A post shared by GLOSSLAB (@glosslab) Looking for something simple? Go for a French manicure and make the tip red instead of white. DashDividers_1_500x100 Cherry Bomb View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝙏𝙤𝙢 𝘽𝙖𝙘𝙝𝙞𝙠 Nails (@tombachik) Try nail stickers — like these from Le Mini Macron — with cherries and kisses. DashDividers_1_500x100 Heart French View this post on Instagram A post shared by IMARNI (@imarninails) For another take on a French manicure, ask for the tip to be adapted into a bowed heart shape. DashDividers_1_500x100 Baby Hearts View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vanity Projects (@vanityprojects) Teeny tiny hearts over an otherwise-neutral manicure look so sweet. DashDividers_1_500x100 Red Jellies View this post on Instagram A post shared by GLOSSLAB (@glosslab) To take the jelly trend a little less literally, go for a sheer, jellied red polish. It’s giving red Jolly Rancher. DashDividers_1_500x100 Ombre French View this post on Instagram A post shared by Alison • nailsbyalsn (@nailsbyalsn) This pink marshmallow manicure hits the tone. DashDividers_1_500x100 Hand-Painted Florals View this post on Instagram A post shared by Vanity Projects (@vanityprojects) If you’re seeing a professional, consider going full bouquet. DashDividers_1_500x100 French + Heart Accents View this post on Instagram A post shared by GLOSSLAB (@glosslab) If you’re a classic French manicure stan, just add some hearts to a few fingernails. It begs for a mirror selfie. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/sza-serena-williams-hair-super-bowl-49427534",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Kevin Sabitus/Kevin Mazur Aside from a monumental win for the Philadelphia Eagles (sorry, Chiefs fans), the Super Bowl LIX on Feb. 9 brought many awe-inspiring moments, namely Kendrick Lamar's highly anticipated halftime performance. While the genius of Lamar's artistry left us speechless, the show featured beauty looks that were just as captivating. He featured frequent collaborator SZA, who effortlessly dominated the stage during their hit song \"Luther,\" and Serena Williams, who did the iconic C-Walk during \"Not Like Us,\" much to our surprise and amazement. But what had us even more glued to our TVs? SZA's and Williams's curls. It's no secret the halftime show was a celebration of Black culture, from the all-Black dancers making up the American flag that reflected Lamar's thought-provoking lyrics to the ambiguity of Samuel L. Jackson's portrayal as Uncle Sam. And of course, Williams's and SZA's hair followed suit. Both stars sported long, voluminous curls (SZA's fiery red and the tennis champion's long blond) on the biggest night in football, which is highly significant given the current state of Blackness in America. Our identities are constantly being challenged - beauty companies recently eliminated DEI initiatives, for example - and yet figures like SZA and Williams continuously prove that the color of our skin and other aspects of our culture are not a threat - nor are they going away. Black people will continue being unapologetically ourselves and wearing our hair in all its textured glory on such distinguished platforms (during Black History Month, no less), and it further shows the power of Black beauty. If SZA and Williams's curls inspired you to embrace yours, both of their hairstylists shared the exact products they used to achieve their stunning looks. Keep reading for the full breakdown. SZA's Red Curls at the Super Bowl Image Source: Gregory Shamus/Getty Images Celebrity hairstylist Devante Turnbull achieved SZA's red curls using products from K18 Professional and GHD. \"We wanted to stay true to her signature big-hair look while elevating it with extra length and some color to spice things up,\" he said in a press release. He did just that, starting with the K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Leave-In Molecular Repair Mask ($75) to strengthen and protect her hair for heat styling. Then, he used the GHD Curve Wand ($167, originally $209) and Thin Wand ($209) to add more texture to her curls. He then blended them with his fingers and the All-Rounder Paddle Brush ($35). Lastly, Turnbull topped off the style with K18's Molecular Repair Hair Oil ($65) to add shine and reduce frizz. Serena Williams's Curls at the Super Bowl Image Source: Emilee Chinn/Getty Images Wella Professionals partnered with hairstylist Angela Meadows to style Williams's blond curls. \"We wanted a statement style that would be a showstopper for Serena's surprise dance moment with Kendrick Lamar but also hold up against the wind and possible humidity of New Orleans for the big game,\" Meadows said in a press release.Meadows towel-dried the hair and applied the Wella Professionals Ultimate Repair Protective Leave-In ($35) before blow-drying and curling it with the Gold 'N Hot Professional Spring-Grip Curling Iron 1/2 Inch ($24). She finished the look with what she calls the game-changing Ultimate Smooth Miracle Oil Serum ($50) to combat frizz, create a smooth texture, and bring shine and health to Williams's hair.

    "description": "We can't explain our fascination with celebrity tattoos - it's just a thing we care very deeply about. It's always fun to discover a hidden meaning behind a piece of artwork, like Halsey's match tattoo that she got with three of her fans (get it?) or Selena Gomez's Roman-numeral tattoo that she got for a family member. But for every celebrity who likes to put their body art on display, there are a handful who are a bit more secretive about that sort of thing. If you've ever found yourself searching \"Does Taylor Swift have tattoos?\" you're not alone. \"The Tortured Poets Department\" singer has never blatantly shown off any ink, but fans are still curious if that means she doesn't have any or if she's just hiding it really, really well. But in a 2012 interview with Taste of Country, Swift said she couldn't get a tattoo simply because she couldn't commit to anything. \"People are always asking, 'Would you get a tattoo?' And I just . . . I don't think I could ever commit,\" she said. \"I don't think I could ever commit to something permanent.\" She then explained that if she were to get something, it would be of her lucky number 13, before declaring once more, \"I just don't want to get a tattoo.\" Swift could have changed her mind since that interview in 2012, but it's not likely that she's gotten any ink in the last few years without her eagle-eyed fans noticing. Her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kecle's opinions on tattoos are seemingly similar. Meanwhile, plenty of her fans have gotten Taylor Swift-inspired tattoos over the years, ranging from cowboy boots as a nod to her early years to snakes in honor of \"Reputation.\" Jessica Harrington (she/her) is the senior beauty editor at PS, where she writes about hair, makeup, skin care, piercings, tattoos, and more. As a New York City-based writer and editor with a degree in journalism and over eight years of industry experience, she loves to interview industry experts, keep up with the latest trends, and test new products.",
