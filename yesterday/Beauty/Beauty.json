    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/mermaid-braids-49262634",
    "description": "The evolution of knotless braids continues to be one of the most delightful things to witness. Since the style rose to popularity back in 2018, multiple variations like goddess, bohemian, and cornrow styles have all made their way to the surface. Now, another take on the trend is on the horizon: mermaid braids. Though mermaid braids seem like a perfect protective style for summer, like any variation of the goddess trend, they can work year-round and deserve a spot on your permanent mood board. Quite a few celebrities, from Halle Bailey to Janelle Monae, have been spotted in the trend recently, and its popularity is in part thanks to the former's leading role in \"The Little Mermaid.\" Still, that's not the only reason why they're so popular. \"Mermaid braids are popular right now because it is a great way to keep your hair out of your face while still looking chic,\" says hairstylist and author Kee Taylor. \"It also is a protective style and super low maintenance.\" Ahead, experts break down everything to know about the style, including what it is, and how to get the look. Plus, check out inspiration photos as well. Keep scrolling to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Tukia Allen is an educator coach at Aveda Arts. She is based in Atlanta. Kee Taylor is a hairstylist and author as well as the editor in chief of Deeper Than Hair Magazine. She is based in Philadelphia and Los Angeles. What Are Mermaid Braids? Similar to the traditional goddess style, mermaid braids are characterized by an illusion of braids going into loose, curly strands rather than being plaited the full length. \"This trend is a mix of hair that is very loose, if not straight, and braids in between,\" sats Tukia Allen, educator coach at Aveda Arts. \"They are as versatile as any normal braiding style and can be pulled into a ponytail with ease, or gathered to then give the illusion of a looser sew-in style. They're seriously magical.\" How to Get Mermaid Braids Getting the look is similar to the process of doing goddess braids, but as you can imagine, a bit more hair is needed, and the type that you use matters. \"A few packs of traditional braiding hair is perfect and you can technically use a synthetic blend for the curled pieces,\" Allen says. \"However, human hair will last longer and you'll be able to style it like it were your own.\" As with the normal goddess style, you'll want to start with pre-parted boxes, and use braiding hair to add length. However, for mermaid braids to really get that flowy look, start adding the human pieces closer to the beginning of the braid, in the middle, and near the end of the plait. Also, instead of braiding until the full length of the synthetic mix used for the main braid is tucked away, stop about four to five inches above it. This will provide the illusion of a full head of curly tendrils but with movement, the braids will peek through. Once you curl all the loose pieces, you'll be left with a style that almost looks like you've been floating in water á la everyone's favorite underwater Disney princess. For your easy-pinning needs, we went ahead and found the best mermaid braid styles to inspire your own version. Take a look a how people have been wearing the trend ahead.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. On days when we want to wear less makeup, we’d happily ditch our trusty skin tints and liquid foundations for a slick of concealer. A great one should tuck away dark circles without effort, minimize the appearance of breakouts in moments and dial down redness fast. So whenever there’s a new concealer launch, we take it upon ourselves to investigate. The latest one, Victoria Beckham x Augustinus Bader The Concealer Pen, has so much hype around it that we made sure to get our hands on it ASAP. Victoria Beckham branched into the beauty world a while ago now — we have heard great things about Posh Balm, $32, and Satin Kajal Eyeliner, $32 — but this is the pop icon-slash-fashion-mogul’s most ambitious launch yet. The new Concealer Pen is a collaboration between Beckham and Augustinus Bader, one of the most celebrated science-backed luxury skincare brands of the moment. This concealer is available online on both Victoria Beckham and Augustinus Bader’s websites. This concealer claims to not only cover up any blemishes without any creasing, but it’s also packed with a skin-improving formula that rejuvenates your complexion in as little as four weeks. The star ingredient is TFC8®, a technology patented by Bader that encourages skin cell renewal (more on that later). Beckham herself is a long-time fan of The Rich Cream. With a steep retail price of $68, these are certainly bold claims — ones that our team of beauty enthusiasts were keen to unpack. Without further ado, read ahead for our honest review of this buzzy concealer pen, complete with before-and-after photos. DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, Deputy Beauty Director She Tried: Victoria Beckham x Augustinus Bader The Concealer Pen (in shade L1), $68 “At $68, it’s the most expensive concealer in my burgeoning makeup bag, and in the past, I’ve not been the biggest fan of click pen products. But it’s arguably the best concealer I’ve tried in recent years. So much so I’ve been wearing it on my entire face since I discovered it, not just on dark circles or breakouts. The texture is so different to everything else out there. It’s smooth and silky, as opposed to chalky, but the coverage is great. I’d say it’s on par with the Tarte Creamy Creaseless Concealer, $30, or NARS Radiant Creamy Concealer, $32. “Whenever I use this concealer, it makes my skin look glowy and alive. That’s all thanks to moisturizing squalane, glycerin and polyglutamic acid, which is known to be substantially more hydrating than everyone’s favorite skincare ingredient, hyaluronic acid. The big hitter, though, is TFC8®, a patented technology found in Augustinus Bader’s iconic skincare product: The Cream. This is essentially a mix of amino acids (the building blocks of skin-strengthening proteins) and various vitamins. As such, I’m convinced it’s making my skin look better underneath! If all you wear is concealer here and there, it’s absolutely worth the investment.” DashDividers_1_500x100 L’Oréal Blackett, Unbothered UK Editor She Tried: Victoria Beckham x Augustinus Bader The Concealer Pen (in shades MD1, M2), $68 “I take concealer very seriously. As someone with deep dark circles, freckles and a few pigmentation marks left from blemishes, I typically use a heavy-duty concealer such as Pat McGrath Sublime Perfection Concealer, $34, to, well, conceal. I will also use another one in a lighter shade to brighten under my eyes. I have been excited to try this Victoria Beckham x Augstinus Bader Concealer after reading the claims of a second skin-like finish and reduced dark circles in four weeks. Plus, I am a sucker for chic packaging. “There were several deep shades to choose from, and there was a match tool, but I still struggled to match my skin and undertone with the models pictured. Shades M2 and MD1 were a touch too light for my post-vacation skin, but will be perfect for me as the weather gets colder and I inevitably get paler. The finish was a little sheer at first and the bluish tones under my eyes peaked through, so I went heavier with the application. I looked immediately brighter and rested. I love dabbing this concealer at my inner corners to make my eyes pop. I set under my eyes with a powder to prevent creasing, but I did see some creasing by the end of the evening. The brush tip is absolutely great for spot concealing; I simply dabbed the product with my finger to blend in with my skin and poof my dark spots are gone. I can’t wait to try with a darker shade for a seamless match. It’s so easy to use and conveniently sized, I want to carry it with me everywhere.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Venus Wong, Senior Writer She Tried: Victoria Beckham x Augustinus Bader The Concealer Pen (in shades LM1, LM2), $68 “I got into a minor accident about eight years ago that left a small scar on my left eyelid. It’s not that noticeable unless you get super close, but I can tell it’s there, and I’ve tried every type of concealer under the sun to cover it up ever since. This concealer has done the best job by a long, long shot: The click pen disperses just the right amount of product that coats the scar and makes the discoloration all but disappear. The formula feels silky and nourishing, thanks to moisturizing ingredients like squalane (which retains moisture). I don’t feel like I’m wearing any makeup, and yet the product stays on all day. “The shade match quiz told me that based on my everyday concealer shade, LM2 is my best match. While it’s perfect for camouflaging my eyelid scar and acne bumps around the edge of my forehead, I find that it’s a tad too dark for my cheeks and under eye area. For that, LM1 is a much better fit. For my dark circles, I think I still prefer my go-to, Kosas Revealer Concealer, $30, since I can get a decent chunk of product from the wand in one swipe and blend with my fingers. However, this concealer pen is a marvel when it comes to hiding the finer texture and blemishes that just bug you. The fact that I can simply paint over them without any blending — and get near-perfect results — is enough to persuade me to fork over the $68.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Humeara Mohamed, Contributing Writer She Tried: Victoria Beckham x Augustinus Bader The Concealer Pen (in shades LM1, LM2), $68 “Thanks to my ‘there-again, gone-again’ acne cycle and reactive skin, I would call myself somewhat of a concealer aficionado. Think of any viral concealer and I’m willing to bet I’ve tried it. I am a hardcore loyalist to my Huda Beauty #Fauxfilter concealer, $31, and it takes a lot to make me reach for anything else. So, when this concealer landed on my desk, I was skeptical, to say the least — partly thanks to its price tag. “If you can afford it, though, the formula is phenomenal. I look airbrushed and edited in real life, but not cakey. In fact, here you can see that I’ve added a splattering of faux freckles to stop my skin from looking too ‘perfect’. It even lasts through very sweaty commutes without separating, which is a pet peeve of mine. I love that it’s packed with skin-loving ingredients like amino acids, glycerin and squalane, too. It makes me feel a bit better about slathering makeup atop my already-angry skin. “Where I think it falls is on its applicator: It’s not easy to deposit onto a separate brush. I had to put the product into a palette and then use my own brush to apply it to my acne in a bid to prevent bacteria from spreading and making my acne worse. If you also struggle with acne, it might just be too much work. My truthful verdict is this: The Concealer Pen would be the world’s best concealer if it came with a pump or doe foot applicator, with more product, and at a slightly less eye-watering price.” Like what you see?

    "description": "Fall has only just arrived, but that doesn’t mean we’re not already looking ahead to what this year’s holiday season will have to offer. (That is, if you’ve been good this year.) And while it may feel early — after all, Halloween is two months away — that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed advent calendars.While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to ooh and aah at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.) And while advent calendars are inherently an exercise in patience, we won't tell if you open up all the teeny-tiny doors the day it arrives on your doorstep...At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.
