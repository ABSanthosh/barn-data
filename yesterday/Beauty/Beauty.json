    "title": "Finally, the Answer to What Red Lipstick Taylor Swift is Always Wearing",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/taylor-swift-red-lipstick-48605055",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Aaron M. Sprecher There is but one lingering question that comes to mind post-Taylor Swift's many appearances (whether Eras Tour or NFL-related), and that is about her red lipstick. Google searches for the exact hue she wears reportedly jumped 669 percent after she was first spotted at the Kansas City Chiefs game at the start of the season 2023 - and fan tweets are alive and well today, from the \"not me wearing red lipstick again\" to the \"TAYLOR IF YOU DON'T RELEASE A RED LIPSTICK LINE IN MY LIFETIME ILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU\" - which can only confirm one thing: the people want answers. It's a happy coincidence that the Chiefs's signature color is red, supplying Swift with ample opportunities to wear the shade while cheering alongside Donna Kelce and friends, as she did for the AFC Championship on Jan. 26. The more complicated reality is that Swift has been wearing red lipstick since the moment she hit the music scene - the one constant in this ever-changing world, if you will - meaning she's had a number of favorites on rotation over the years. There's MAC Ruby Woo ($23), the classic shade she confirmed she loved to People in 2015. There's also the Nars Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl ($30), which has been a staple for the star for years. Image Source: Getty/David Eulitt/Stringer These days, according to her most recent makeup artist, the one and only Pat McGrath, the star has been wearing the LiquiLust Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick ($34) in Elson 4 from McGrath's eponymous brand, Pat McGrath Labs. The formula is also editor-approved and promises to be smudgeproof, which, if you've been watching video footage of that \"Tayvis\" kiss in Argentina on repeat (and let's be real: who isn't?) you'll know this fact is of the utmost importance. While the LiquiLust Matte Lipstick tends to be out of stock - hello, \"Swiftie effect\" - we've tested the brand's Dramatique Mega Lip Pencil ($29) in Elson 6, which is a solid alternative with a similar color payoff. (You can read our full review here, and it was also awarded a PS Beauty Award.) Otherwise, in the past Swift's longtime makeup artist Lorrie Turk has also shared a handful of red lipstick favorites that could be a good indicator of what she uses on a regular basis, including, but not limited to: Patrick Ta Major Beauty Headlines Lipstick ($32) in That's Why She's Late, Fenty Beauty Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color ($29) in Uncensored, and Lisa Eldridge True Velvet Lipstick ($36) in Velvet Ribbon. As with most things the singer touches, there's also plenty of online fodder and speculation from fans on whether her lipstick of choice gives a nod to her best friend Selena Gomez's beauty line, Rare Beauty. The punchy, cool-toned red and matte finish of the Rare Beauty Lip Soufflé Matte Cream Lipstick ($20) in Inspire looks like it could be a spot-on match, so it's certainly a contender. Only time will tell which of the above lipstick(s) was used during her date nights with Blake Lively and, ahem, others. In the meantime, we'll be sipping our caramel nonfat latte from Starbucks in a black turtleneck, patiently waiting.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/what-to-know-locs-hairstyle-47649603",
    "description": "Dreadlocks - preferentially known as \"locs\" - are a popular hairstyle that includes sections of hair that have been matted and knotted together to create a rope-like appearance. Locs hairstyles have been around for what feels like forever (historians have dated its origins back as far as 2500 BC, according to Ebony), but there seems to be a renewed obsession with the style. Stars like Lauryn Hill, Whoopi Goldberg, Chloë, and Halle Bailey have brought the hairstyle into the mainstream spotlight, proudly donning their locs for years, showing the world that this is another form of Black hair that's not only acceptable but also beautiful. From budding locs and sisterlocks to freeform and faux-locs, we've seen the style's staying power and versatility. Whether celebrities have you inspired to try them yourself or you're just looking to switch things up, there's a lot you should know about the process and maintaining locs before getting started. Keep reading a quick and easy-to-follow breakdown of everything there is to know about locs, according to an expert. Experts Featured in This Article Gabriele Benjamin is a loctician based in New York City. Dreads vs. Locs Locs hairstyles feature ropes of hair also known as Jata (in the Sanskrit language), dreads, and locs. Though all the names are accurate, the most popular and preferred name of them all is \"locs,\" due to the negative connotation of the word \"dread.\" The origin of the term \"dreadlocks\" is believed to be associated with the slave trade, a period in time when enslaved people didn't have the time or resources to properly groom their hair. As a result, enslavers often referred to this hairstyle as \"dreadful\" and enslaved people who wore this look were criticized for it, ultimately making the term a traumatic reminder of history for African American communities all around the world.

    "description": "With New York Fashion Week underway, the most obvious place to scout for fresh haircut inspiration would be backstage. But while the myriad looks dreamed up by talented hairstylists are certainly something to behold, some of the coolest cuts can actually be seen on the city’s street stylers.Sure, the outfits tend to take precedence over hair, but a good cut can totally transform an aesthetic. This season alone, we’ve spotted razor-sharp bobs, ‘90s layers and, anything-but-boring medium-length chops to name a few styles. Without further ado, here are our favorites straight from NYC’s bustling streets this fashion week. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.The “bottleneck” bob continues to be the hottest haircut of the season. Think bangs that occupy a cosy space between curtains and a fuller, more straight-across shape, and lengths that dust the top of the shoulders.Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.If you're brave enough to go shorter, consider the French bob, a cut that brushes the jawline, as seen on this guest outside Coach. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We glimpsed a handful of close-cropped afros, from the Thom Browne runway show to the city's streets. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.If you want to keep your hair long but you're keen to add some interest, consider what hairstylists are calling the “lip length chunk”, essentially shorter front pieces that meet the lips. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Meet the “boxie”, a cross between a bob and a pixie cut with a little extra shagginess. James Bickmore, art director at Neil Moodie Studio previously told R29, “The boxie is perfect for those who are growing out a pixie but don’t want a bob. It’s easy to manage and gets better as it grows out. It has a very ‘I woke up like this’ vibe — with a bit of an edge.”Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.This wavy, chunky-ended cut can only mean one thing: The Italian bob is back for 2025, and we're not at all mad about it. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.This sleek lob (aka long bob) and baroque bob (essentially a short bob with sculpted waves) certainly grabbed our attention outside Sandy Liang on Sunday. Could this photo be any more chic?Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Seen on a guest outside Sandy Liang, these braided bangs are the ultimate protective hairstyle for shorter front pieces. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.In-between haircuts are far from mediocre, and this is all the evidence you need. This guest's taupe cendré hair color elevates the shoulder-length cut perfectly. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Oval layers — a more subtle iteration of flicky '90s layers — are still going strong. This long cut spotted on a guest on Sunday is all the inspiration you need to give your long hair a little extra movement.Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Guests and models at shows like Sandy Liang are embracing big and bouncy curls this season. The russet red hair color here is just as stunning. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The “jellyfish” haircut merges the best of two popular styles: the sharpness of a bob and the swish of longer, layered lengths. The straight-across bangs complete this look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Full bangs are so back, and if you're into sleek updos like these seen on guests outside Sandy Liang, they add a little something extra. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Long layers will never go out of style. We love this cut seen on a street styler outside Sandy Liang. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The '70s-esque shaggy bangs, floaty long layers, and amber blonde color earn this hairstyle top marks. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Here's picture proof that the blunt bob haircut is going nowhere. This shoulder-grazing chop is elevated by the shine-enhancing chocolate cherry hair color. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylists predict that triple XL hair, essentially long, long lengths, will reign supreme in 2025. These flowing goddess braids spotted on a guest outside the Christopher John Rogers runway show are beautiful. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Elevate any updo by asking your hairstylist for dainty face-framing pieces like this guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylist Tom Smith anticipates that bangs will become a hairstyle in their own right this year — and he's not wrong. This cut features blunter pieces among wispier sections of hair, and the result is totally unique. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.As seen outside Collina Strada, this jaw-skimming bob features shorter, wispier, face-framing pieces, which can be blown-out to add a little volume and variety. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're calling it: The “kicked” bob is the cut of the season. It's characterized by gentle flicks at the ends where the hair turns upward. Invest in a good flat iron like ghd Chronos Max, $349 to achieve a similar look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The burnished copper color is the cherry on top of this curly pineapple hairstyle seen on a guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The side bang is back. We're especially into this longer, curled, and more voluminous style spied on a guest outside the Christian Siriano show. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Feathered layers? Yup. Face-framing pieces? Check. Shoulder-skimming length? Perfect. This cut — seen on a guest outside Chistian Siriano — nails three 2025 haircut trends in one. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're more than a little obsessed with this bluntly-sliced, wavy bob seen on Allure editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel.
