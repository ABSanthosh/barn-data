    "description": "You know when you have two friends from different groups finally for the first time, and you (being the common link) knew they would get along? Learning about Amika’s new collab with indie fragrance brand Ellis Brooklyn felt exactly like that — but in beauty product form.  For starters, both brands have roots in NYC, and as I chat with both Shapiro and Amika CEO Chelsea Riggs, it’s immediately clear this isn’t just another beauty collab — it’s a friendship. (“Amika” actually means “friend” in Esperanto, the world’s most popular international auxiliary language.) The fact that I also happened to find the dry shampoo I’ll be using nonstop this summer? A total bonus. “Perk Up has been in the market for almost 15 years, and it’s also ranked as the number-one premium dry shampoo,” Riggs tells Refinery29. “We knew we wanted to have a moment for that, and fragrance was where we wanted to lean in.” Ellis Brooklyn was a natural fit; during our conversation, Ellis Brooklyn founder Bee Shapiro shared that she was a former client of Amika’s (sadly, now closed) salon in Williamsburg. Kismet! Amika x Ellis Brooklyn Miami Nectar Perk Up Dry Shampoo, $28 Just in time for summer, Amika has reimagined its bestselling Perk Up Dry Shampoo with the scent of Ellis Brooklyn’s Miami Nectar. The result? The same instantly refreshing dry shampoo, now with tropical notes of pink pineapple, coconut water, and amber. “We tested a bunch of different fragrances that Bee and the team sent, and I really thought we were going to end up with Sun Fruit, given the color and it feeling very Amika,” Riggs shares, adding that it was a lab sample of (then-unreleased) Miami Nectar that wont the team over. “It smelled as if Amika had gone to the beach.” But this sun-soaked version of Perk Up isn’t just a way to refresh your roots and add a boost of volume; it’s an invitation to layer your fragrance for a unique blend of good smells. I’ve been using it nonstop in my hair, adding a floral scent like Aesop’s new Aurner Eau de Parfum when I’m feeling more feminine, or leaning more into the warm, woody notes by wearing something like Le Monde Gourmand’s Santal Supreme. DashDividers_1_500x100  “We were thinking about what exactly is ‘functional fragrance?’” Shapiro tells me. “And at the end of the day, what’s more functional than my favorite dry shampoo with our amazing scent?” While Amika products are already beloved for their fruity-floral scents, Shapiro says this limited-edition collaboration was a chance to take things to a whole new level. “There are already amazing scents in hair, but we’re coming at it with a little bit more complexity [with this launch],” she adds. Miami Nectar Perk Up retails for $28 (the same as a full size of OG Perk Up), and is available at Sephora, as well as Amika and Ellis Brooklyn‘s respective websites. If you’re not already using Amika products, chances are you could spot a brightly-colored, patterned can from across the room and know it was the brand’s. A closer look at the packaging reveals Easter eggs that nod to the fragrance (coconuts, pineapples, groovy florals) and Miami’s sun-and-fun lifestyle (pool slides, ice cream cones, seashells, and even a few dolphins). In the few weeks since I received an early sample to test, I’ve been using it nonstop — after workouts, to add texture to my style, or simply as hair perfume. (BTW, I’m a dark brunette, and this stuff disappears into my roots without a trace.) I was already a fan of Ellis Brooklyn’s Miami Nectar fragrance (especially as someone living in Miami) and Amika’s dry shampoo, so to have them combined into one? Nothing less than a match made in beauty heaven. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glass-nail-file-growth-benefits?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "My nails have been through a lot over the past three decades. I was a compulsive nail biter throughout most of my childhood and teen years, and it wasn’t until college that I kicked the habit for good. From there, I’ve struggled with brittle, weak nails on and off depending on my anemia, stress levels, diet, and other factors. Even though I no longer instinctively chew my nails like I once did, I was still prone to picking if I noticed a scraggly edge or a hangnail. Until one day, I decided that I’d be a lot less likely to pick if I had a better alternative than taking matters into my own hands — literally.  I was first introduced to glass nail files a few years ago through Bare Hands’ Dry Gloss manicure kit, and ever since then, my natural nails have never looked better. Most manicurists have sworn by glass files for years, thanks to their ability to shape nails without snagging, but I had no idea that the right tool could actually prevent me from damaging my nails and help them grow. Recently, I was traveling and broke a nail; instead of picking at it, I ran to the closest beauty store and picked up a glass nail file to reshape and prevent further damage. The one I found? Ulta Beauty Collection’s version, which came in a travel-friendly sleeve perfect for keeping in a makeup bag or purse for on-the-go use. It also turned out to be the best impulsive buy for my natural nails. Read ahead for a deep dive into the benefits of glass files — and exactly why they’re worth the investment. DashDividers_1_500x100 Why are glass nail files better for your natural nails? You might not think twice about the kind of nail file you’re using, but there’s a good chance it could be causing more harm than good to your natural nails. “Traditional emery boards cause microscopic tears at the tip of the nail,” explains Dr. Dana Stern, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of nail care brand Dr. Dana. “Glass files create a perfectly smooth edge that seals keratin [which nails are made of] and prevents splitting, peeling, breakage, and even premature polish chipping,” she adds. How should you use a glass nail file? According to Dr. Stern, glass files are best suited for filing the free edge (aka the “top”) of the nail to shape and shorten. Unlike other types of files, glass versions can be safely used to file the nail in any direction. With other, more abrasive materials, you are usually instructed to only file nails one way to avoid creating a jagged edge. How often do you have to replace glass nail files? Happily, glass files are a sustainable, reusable alternative and can be cleaned between uses. “In salons, any porous item should be considered one-time-use as they can potentially harbor infectious material and cannot be sterilized,” Dr. Stern says. “Another advantage of glass tools is that they don’t dull and are therefore continuously reusable.” Keeping your glass file in a protective case will help shield it from chemicals and getting scratched (or scratching other things).  How do glass nails help natural nails grow? It may seem counterintuitive that a tool designed to shorten your nails can actually help them grow, but think of it as a long game strategy, like how regular hair trims can help avoid split ends. “Switching to a glass file is advantageous because the nail is less likely to peel, split, and break, so over time, you are more likely to achieve length with a glass file than a traditional emery board,” explains Dr. Stern.  For me, having neat, groomed nails — with or without polish or gel — discouraged me from picking at them, which would cause them to peel or break, and set my growth journey back to square one. I’ve been using the Ulta one several times a week since it lives in my bag and therefore accompanies me almost everywhere. I’ve found myself fixing my nails waiting in line at a coffee shop, or when I touch up my lipstick in the bathroom at happy hour. Despite the $9 price tag, it’s just as good as any other brand (including more expensive ones) I’ve tried; it’s lightweight but doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap. Plus, the grain is on the finer side, making it quite gentle on my nails. Within a month, my nails looked visibly better and were breaking and splitting less often. In the past, I swore by builder gel to achieve any meaningful growth. It’s been months since my last gel manicure, but with my wedding coming up, I’ll likely get one in the books soon — especially now that I’m set up for success with healthier natural nails. Is there any recommended “aftercare” post-glass nail file use? It’s not required, but then again, pampering your nails is never really a bad thing. “Nothing needs to be done [after using a glass file] for the nail per se, but I always recommend keeping the cuticle well hydrated,” says Dr. Stern, adding that a healthy cuticle is foundational for a healthy nail. Her go-to? The Dr. Dana Nourishing Cuticle Oil, which contains indigo naturalis (an herb used in traditional Chinese medicine for reducing inflammation), plus sunflower and jojoba oils to moisturize (yes — your nails need that too!) and support nail growth. “When used regularly, cuticle oil will keep cuticles properly hydrated and allow nails to grow healthier and stronger,” Dr. Dana explains. I keep one on my nightstand as a reminder to use it at least nightly, but am trying to be better about using one a few times a day. I’m a fan of Olive \u0026 June’s Cuticle Serum pens, which absorb quicker than an oil for easier, grease-free use during the day. Which glass nail file is best for me? Not all glass files are created equal, and Dr. Stern specifically notes that the level of abrasiveness can vary among glass files. What’s more, not all of them are meant for natural nails. (Grittier ones may be used as a first step to remove gel polish, for example.) If you’re simply looking to replace your basic emery board, something like my new Ulta find or the Dr. Dana Glass Nail File will be a major upgrade and gentle enough for regular use.  Glass files also come in a variety of shapes, which can lend themselves to other purposes besides filing. Germanikure’s Moonfile has a slight arched shape (hence the name), which is ergonomically designed for a comfortable hold, but is also great for pushing back cuticles and gently exfoliating dead skin on the sides of the nail.  In addition to using a glass file, I also like to use a glass polisher tool — namely Bare Hands’ polisher — to gently buff the nail surface. It works by removing the superficial layer of keratin (which will look like mini clouds of whitish dust) on your nails, resulting in a naturally shiny appearance. According to the brand, the polisher lasts for around six months if you buff once a week for your nails. With less frequent use, it can last up to a year. Mind you, I’ve had mine for nearly two years and it’s still in pretty good shape. Using a glass buffer comes with a caveat, though: Dr. Stern is quick to note that a glass file is not the same as a buffer, which is safe for the nail plate. “Using a glass file at the surface can dislodge nail cells, creating an uneven surface that is more prone to peeling and breakage,” she says. “Also, filing or even over-buffing the nail surface can result in a nail that is too thin.”  Besides using a glass file on the free edge of my nails, I buff the surface once every other week at a maximum to avoid compromising their integrity, and I think it’s helped my nails not only look better (they have a natural luster, so sometimes I skip polish entirely), but grow in healthier. (Think of it as maintaining a healthy skin barrier — less is more!)  Ready to become a card-carrying member of the glass file club? Shop our favorites below. Like what you see?

    "description": "The Expert Edit features interviews with specialists about the products they swear by in their chosen field. For the latest installment, we spoke to Emmy-winning celebrity makeup artist Donni Davy, the visionary behind \"Euphoria\"'s trendsetting beauty looks. From her must-have complexion products to the eye-catching pigments she reaches for on set and in everyday life, Davy shares the beauty staples she can't live without. The bold, shimmering makeup of \"Euphoria\" is just as iconic as the show itself. But for Donni Davy, the makeup artist behind HBO's hit series, creating viral-worthy makeup moments wasn't always part of her plan. \"I never thought I would be a makeup artist,\" she says. \"I was never really a makeup girly growing up. I was more of a shy art kid.\" Davy's artistic roots run deep - she studied photography at Pratt Institute, initially envisioning a career behind the camera. But after a conversation with a family friend, she realized makeup artistry could merge her love for painting, drawing, and storytelling. That revelation set her on a path that would change her life. Her breakthrough came when HBO tapped her for \"Euphoria\", drawn to the dreamy, avant-garde aesthetic she crafted for the 2018 film \"Under the Silver Lake.\" On set, Davy particularly loves working with Hunter Schafer, whose looks are often the most unpredictable. \"Sometimes, when you have that much freedom, you almost have no idea what to do,\" she says. But that creative challenge is what keeps her inspired. Davy's work has become legendary, earning her a second Emmy in 2022 for Outstanding Contemporary Makeup. As production for season three is officially underway, she continues to treat each character's look as an emotional extension of their journey, meticulously considering lighting, wardrobe, and script cues. \"Makeup communicates so much to the audience,\" she says. \"It's extra info; a storytelling tool.\" Beyond her work in television, Davy is making her mark in the beauty industry. In 2022, she co-founded Half Magic Beauty with A24, bringing a bold, boundary-pushing aesthetic to everyday beauty lovers. With her signature blend of art, emotion, and self-expression, Davy continues to redefine what makeup can be - one shimmering, rhinestone-studded look at a time. Here, Davy shares her must-have beauty picks, the essentials in her makeup bag, and the go-to products that help her power through the day.",

But Dr. Lee's penchant for treating skin conditions is far more complex than a slew of viral moments. She was exposed to dermatology at a young age as her father was a specialist in the field, so it was only natural that Dr. Lee would follow in his footsteps. \"We had a lot of textbooks at home with all things dermatology, and I looked through them while I was eating my cereal for breakfast,\" she says. \"When I got to medical school, I found out that it was one of the hardest specialties to get into, which charged me up to think, I'd love to be in this specialty.\" Although Dr. Lee got a head start in dermatology by way of that early introduction, she faced challenges actually breaking into the industry. She recalls graduating from med school and not receiving an envelope on Match Day. However, as a natural go-getter, she persevered, working at her private practice with her husband before garnering success on YouTube. She started posting pimple-popping videos and discovered a world where the procedure dominated search bars - particularly on Reddit. She then decided she was going to be the one to foster that public demand. \"It was like people who were sharing popping videos with each other, which I thought was insane - but then I also thought I could be the one that provides it for them because I see it all the time at work.\" She started posting on her Reddit account, and Dr. Pimple Popper was born. It's sad when someone says you just need to wash your face because that can make people feel defeated, especially when they're doing things they're supposed to do and [a change] is not happening. Fast forward to today, Dr. Lee is one of the most renowned and trusted dermatologists in the country, and rightfully so. With a current Instagram following of 4.7 million skin-care lovers, the reality star has enjoyed many groundbreaking moments in her career. She's appeared on many shows, including \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" won a Critics' Choice Awards for Female Star of the Year in 2021, and most recently, debuted her new series, \"Dr. Pimple Popper: Breaking Out,\" on Lifetime. Beyond her work in front of the camera, the skin-care expert is making strides to help those who don't get the chance to come into her office. Through her brand, SLMD Skincare, Dr. Lee makes dermatology accessible to all with affordable products that target acne issues and other skin conditions like a doctor would. With so many misconceptions about skin care floating around, she endeavors to bring premier education on skin health to everyone, regardless of age or tax bracket. \"People think they get acne because they need to wash their face more, but you aren't in control - there are hormones that are really in charge, especially for women during certain times of the month,\" she says. \"It's sad when someone says you just need to wash your face, because that can make people feel defeated, especially when they're doing things they're supposed to do and [a change] is not happening.\" Dr. Lee is committed to not only popping pimples, but helping people see their beauty regardless of their skin-care journey. On her show, she values the human connection above all else, debunking skin-care myths and helping people push past societal pressures, one skin condition at a time. Below, Dr. Lee shares her must-have skin-care picks, the most underrated acne tips, and the go-to products that help her power through any day.",
