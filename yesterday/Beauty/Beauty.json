    "description": "Fall has only just arrived, but that doesn’t mean we’re not already looking ahead to what this year’s holiday season will have to offer. (That is, if you’ve been good this year.) And while it may feel early — after all, Thanksgiving isn't even here yet— that hasn’t deterred brands from releasing some of their big-ticket holiday items. Case in point: Beauty-stuffed advent calendars.While these blockbuster sets usually come at a premium price point, that's for a few reasons: They tend to be limited in quantity, feature exquisite packaging, and contain myriad products, including full sizes or limited-edition shades. All that's to say that the beauty-filled advent calendars you'll find here are not only marvelous to ooh and aah at but also provide a surprisingly good value, given the ample contents inside. (Pro tip: Find a buddy to go halfsies with and divide the spoils.)

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. When it comes to holiday gift-giving, model/entrepreneur Georgia May Jagger is attempting something different this year: staying chill.  “I’m trying to start my mother’s approach, which is to buy things all year [round] when you see something someone will like. Then, you’re not in a mad rush,” Jagger, who’s the daughter of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger and supermodel Jerry Hall, tells Refinery29 over email. “I try to think about something they would not buy for themselves, but that they would want. It’s harder with some people than others. If I can’t really think of anything, I try to make something — I make miniature sculptures, so I make those for people who I am very close with. I think a successful gift is not about spending a lot of money, it’s about making someone feel something unexpected.”  As a new mom, Jagger has been relishing in getting baby gifts (“It’s so cute to see all the wonderful tiny clothes that people have picked out.”) But she also has beauty on the brain, having brought her plant-powered organic skincare line, May Botanicals, to the U.S. earlier this year. So, we asked Jagger to share the most covetable beauty products on her holiday wish list — for both giving and receiving. Read on to discover her top picks.  Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey  “I recently became obsessed again with this lipstick. I love the cool tone and that it’s more like a balm. And it looks great on everyone.” Diptyque Feu de Bois Candle  “I think this candle is a classic, but I just love it because it reminds me of my mum.”  May Botanicals Kelp! Seaweed Sheet Mask Set of 4  “The Kelp! sheet mask from my brand is actually made of 100% kelp and infused with a collagen boosting serum. The sachets are so great for travel and stocking fillers.” May Botanicals Golden Hour Face Oil  “My new face oil is amazing for winter. It’s infused with rosehip, chamomile, and carrot oils that really make your skin glow. It’s great to add to your moisturizer or use on its own.”  Isamaya x FaceGym Sculpt 01  “Isamaya [Ffrench] is so clever, and I absolutely love a face sculpting tool. I’ve been using this one every morning with the May Botanicals face oil. I really want to try the body sculpting tool she made as well.” Slip Lovely Lashes Pure Silk Contour Sleep Mask  “I love an eye mask — they’re so good for traveling and at-home use.

    "description": "As someone with thin, fine hair, it's hard to find a haircut that works for me and my everyday lifestyle. I don't love to wash my hair every day or even style it regularly, but I've found that my roots fall flat pretty quickly if I don't do anything to it. I've tried plenty of hacks and layered haircuts to help add volume and movement, but it wasn't until I was introduced to \"ghost layers\" that I realized exactly what my hair had been missing. The term \"ghost layers\" was first coined by celebrity stylist Ramon Garcia, but the style is also commonly referred to as invisible or internal layers. Essentially, it's a cutting technique involving subtle layers that are camouflaged within the hair to give the appearance that everything is one length. The style allows you to keep the bulk of your hair's body and length, all while giving it a little extra texture and movement. I visited Andy LeCompte Salon in West Hollywood to see stylist Madison Clifford. When we sat down to discuss what I wanted to do with my hair, I explained I wanted to try ghost layers as a way to grow out a very overly layered Farrah Fawcett-esque haircut I had gotten earlier in the year. Although I've loved bringing back everything '90s - including haircuts with exaggerated layers - I wanted a more blended style that was less choppy as it started to grow out. Experts Featured in This Article Madison Clifford is a celebrity hairstylist who works at Andy LeCompte Salon in West Hollywood, Los Angeles. Before we went over to the shampoo bowl, Clifford showed me where she would be cutting and removing bulk from my hair. I was worried about the curtain bangs I was desperately trying to grow out, but she assured me that this technique would help everything look blended. \"The front pieces seem a bit heavy to style since you're growing them out, so we're going to cut in through with the ghost layers to give the hair movement without taking any length off the tips,\" she tells PS. \"This will help your hair flow back as it gets longer without weighing the hair down.\" After shampooing and conditioning my hair, we went back to the salon chair, where Clifford proceeded to go over my hair with the blow drier before starting on a dry cut, which is the best way to employ texturizing techniques. \"With ghost layers, I want to see how everything lays,\" Clifford says. \"It's more like carving a sculpture rather than doing a technical cut - there will be technical sections, but I'm being visual with the pieces I'm taking out.\" First, she prepped my hair with a volumizing mousse, then began separating my hair into sections and blow-drying it piece by piece using a round brush. To finish everything off, she used a twisting motion with the round brush as she dried it to give my hair a soft bend. As she worked with my hair, Clifford explains that ghost layers look great styled with a twisted-out blow-dry, which gives the hair a lived-in wave. \"I love to do that or something really piecey and undone, which will show the movement,\" she says. As for the actual cut, the technique was different than anything I had seen before. Clifford took sections of my hair and cut into them rather than straight across, which she says creates hidden layers within the different sections. As she cut, I could see that my length was staying the same, but as soon as she let go of the section, there was so much more movement. The best part, she told me, is that this cut is a great option for any hair type. \"Ghost layers are a perfect option for anyone with super-fine hair that wants to see movement but is scared to lose bulk and doesn't want their ends to be sheer,\" she says. \"They're also really nice for people with extremely thick hair who want to see movement but don't want chunky layers.\" Once she was finished cutting, Clifford came in with the final touches. \"I like to use the Vegamour Dry Shampoo ($36) on the roots after a blow-dry to prolong the style,\" she says. \"You don't have to use it on dirty hair, and you actually get more volume when using it.\" (I can also add from personal experience that it won't leave white residue on your hair and smells amazing.) Before and After Ghost Layers When I examined the results in the mirror, I couldn't have been happier with the final look. My choppy, chunky layers had been expertly blended so they looked soft and light, and my hair had more bounce than it had in months. If you've been looking for a haircut to help you easily grow out your layers or a style that will give you lots of texture without being too \"in your face,\" ask your stylist to give you ghost layers.
