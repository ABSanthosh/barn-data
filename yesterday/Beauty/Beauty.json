If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I may not have much (read: anything) in common with Hollywood celebrities, but if there’s one thing a career in beauty has granted me, it’s unfettered access to some of the best products money can buy. I can’t help but think about that as I prepare to hop on the phone with e.l.f. Cosmetics’ latest campaign star, actor Joey King. As I tell her on the call, e.l.f.’s products are not only amazing for their price point, but amazing period. (e.l.f.’s Satin Glow Foundation beats many others in my collection that are quintuple the price).  “e.l.f. proves that whatever you want, you don’t have to spend a ton of money to have great products that last you a long time and make your beauty routine easier,” King tells Refinery29. You may remember King as The Kissing Booth’s refreshingly real Elle Evans, but she has since gone on to show her impressive range in complex roles like Gypsy Rose Blanchard in The Act and the saccharine yet sinister Prince in action-thriller Bullet Train. (This year, she also starred in Netflix’s Uglies, an adaptation of the popular YA book series of the same name.) Below, Refinery29 sat down with the actor and chatted about her favorite affordable beauty products and how beauty helps her get into character. DashDividers_1_500x100 Refinery29: How did this opportunity come about? Have you always been a fan of e.l.f. Cosmetics? Joey King: I was so excited when they reached out because I have been a genuine, lifelong fan of e.l.f. I mean who isn’t? If you wear any sort of makeup, you are aware of e.l.f. Something about e.l.f. that I’ve always loved is that it’s a bonding point for people. My sisters and I love to do each other’s makeup. My nieces are just now getting into makeup and they love e.l.f. — and I love e.l.f. We’re completely different ages, but we still can borrow each other’s products and it’s just such a sweet thing. Makeup has always been a huge part of my life and a bonding point for me and my sisters. So when this came about, it just felt perfect and natural for me to do. I was beyond excited and thrilled and flattered that e.l.f. thought of me.  R29: For sure. We’re talking a lot about the Power Grip primer, which is a fan favorite. What are some other products that you love from the brand?JK: I use my Power Grip primer all the time, and I’m also a huge of the Pout Clout Lip Plumping Pen. It’s the best — I’m a sucker for a tingly lipstick, but just the colors…I love the way it looks and I also love how well it stays. I also love their eyebrow pencils. Eyebrows are a huge part of the face and I didn’t pay enough attention to them for a long time. I use the Instant Lift Waterproof Brow Pencil and the Wow Brow Gel. I don’t always use both [together], but all their products are really great for me because I feel like I can have a simple makeup look and then if I really want to go for a full beat, I can do that too.  R29: What was it like working with Lucien [Laviscount] on the campaign? Any funny moments on set?JK: It was so much fun. He’s such a sweetie and it was such a free set. We had so much fun being silly and trying out new things. One of my favorite moments was when we were shooting the part where our faces stick together: We did so many different takes of that and he was cracking me up every time because he would just do the most ridiculous, hilarious things. It’s always really nice to work with somebody who’s down to clown and he was down. R29: The campaign is a nod to getting your game face on for life’s biggest moments, and I love the intersection of beauty and sports that we’re seeing these days. (fun fact: R29’s own Sara Tan made a cameo in e.l.f. 2023 Super Bowl commercial!) How would you define getting your game face on? What does that mean for you?JK: In every role I’ve done, it was so important for me to transform into my character through a lot of aspects and one of those big aspects is beauty. Whether it’s something like We Were The Lucky Ones where I’m playing a woman in the 40s and I’m wearing a red lip and my hair is curled, it’s very different from my everyday beauty routine. Or with The Act, where it’s very stripped down and bare, but we’re doing things to make me look a little bit unwell, like adding dark circles. Beauty is so important in transforming into a role and it is a huge part of how I get my game face on whether it’s for a carpet or being on set.  I love crafting looks with my makeup artist, Allan Avendaño. Every time we do a red carpet, we want to do something different, but also whenever I sit in the chair — and he knows me so well, I’ve been working with him since I was 10 — I sit down in the chair and he’s like, okay, what do we want to do today? And I’m like, “Just please make me look hot!” That’s my game face. I just want to look hot for the red carpet. But then sometimes we go for looks that are less focused on looking [traditionally] beautiful, while also highlighting different aspects of my beauty that are more unique. Getting my game face on is listening to my intuition of what I’m feeling and what parts of myself I want to highlight. R29: Allan is so talented, and your face card never misses! If you don’t mind, I’d love to go through a speed round and match some of your most iconic roles to e.l.f. products, starting with Elle from The Kissing Booth.JK: I might pair Elle with the Halo Glow Blush Beauty Wand in Pink Me Up. I feel like she’s a girl who loves a rosy cheek. R29: What about The Princess?JK: Power Grip Primer. She needs all the help she can get because she is sweaty, she is fighting all these dudes, and she needs some real sticky stuff. R29: And then what about The Prince from Bullet Train?JK: I’m going to say the H2O Proof Eyeliner Pen because she needs her eyeliner sharp, just like her horrible killing instincts. She’s a killer in eyeliner and in life. R29: Absolutely. And my last one is Zara from A Family Affair.JK: Oh man. Zara needs something to take away the pain of seeing her mother and her boss get it on. I’m going to say something with sparkle, so maybe we’ll do the Duochrome Liquid Eyeshadow so that the blinding light of the pigmented eyeshadow can take away some of the things she’s seen.  R29: Glitter solves a lot of problems! Do you have any beauty secrets that people might be surprised by? Or anything you’ve learned from working with Allan Avendaño all these years?JK: I’ve learned so many tricks over the years. Something that’s kind of simple but I found to be very effective when I started doing it correctly is if you’re curling your lashes and it doesn’t hurt slightly, you’re not doing it right! It needs to hurt a little bit because you need to get just up to the root and that’s where you get that beautiful curl.  Also, for me personally, just the way my eyes are shaped and the way my face is, I find it really nice to put eyeliner on the upper and lower waterline to highlight my eyes. Even if I’m doing a very simple, no-makeup makeup look, I always do that because I think it just makes my eyes pop in a nice way that isn’t too much. Like what you see?

    "description": "/* Uppercase Product Names */ .multi-product-carousel-container .product .short-title { text-transform: uppercase !important; } Despite all this transparency surrounding salaries, investments, and such, in matters of personal finance, it’s still just a touch gauche to talk about it. Certain details, even with all this progress we’ve made, are still mostly kept under wraps. And that’s why there’s something so absolutely thrilling, so deliciously voyeuristic about getting a glimpse into the spending habits of another person — even a complete stranger.  Here, Simran Kaur, an investor and content creator, opens up about how she spends in other parts of her life (outside of work) and how she invests in herself. Her day begins with an iced latte before she takes some meetings and a quick bite. But easily the best — and splurge-worthy — part of her day: an appointment at the Upper West Spa during which she gets a signature treatment — a Hydrafacial using SkinCeuticals products — to cleanse and hydrate her skin ($300). “My skin has been so congested” she says. “Joanna [the technician] took such good care of me.”  She ends her busy day with her full skin-care routine, which includes her favorite SkinCeuticals P-TIOX serum ($148), “because it helps give me that glass skin glow,” she says. That “glass skin” radiance is achieved through SkinCeuticals’ incredibly novel, peptide-powered serum that’s proven to reduce the appearance of nine types of expression lines (dynamic wrinkles that commonly appear around the eyes, forehead, cheeks, and mouth, and that deepen over time as the skin elasticity naturally declines) and improve the appearance of skin texture over time. “Engaging in personal and financial well-being is such an empowering move,” she says. “I’m already starting to see the improvements in my energy and my joy and my confidence in my skin.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Refinery29 (@refinery29) Watch the video, above, to follow Kaur (and her expenditures) as she goes about her day.

    "description": "Experiencing hair loss can feel frustrating, but thankfully, you are not alone. In fact, it's even normal. According to the American Academy of Dermatology Association, hair loss affects an estimated 80 million Americans, and the average person loses 50 to 100 strands a day. Whether you've experienced changes in your diet, stress levels, or a poor reaction to a chemical treatment, there could be several reasons your hair is thinning or shedding. But here's the good news: hair growth shampoos can make a real difference. Packed with ingredients like biotin, keratin, collagen, and rosemary oil - all known to nourish, strengthen, and lengthen strands - hair growth shampoos promise to help stimulate the hair follicle and promote growth at the root. The right shampoo will help nourish and unclog the hair follicle, while preventing damage. So, if you're experiencing breakage, or your hair simply can't get past the same, stagnant length - the list curated ahead is for you. It's important to remember that Rapunzel-length strands don't happen overnight. Healthy hair grows half an inch a month, so make sure you give the shampoo three to four months to produce noticeable results. Ahead, discover 11 shampoos to aid in your hair growth goals.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/How-Use-Castor-Oil-Beauty-Routine-43587263",
    "description": "Oils are essential in many people's beauty regimens for years, but one that is often overlooked is castor oil. Castor oil is a vegetable oil from the plant ricinus communis and has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory properties, making it a wonder treatment for any beauty routine. The main benefit of castor oil is the stimulation and promotion of hair growth -- and this includes on your head, eyebrows, and lashes. The fact, there are plenty of positive effects it can have in your beauty routine when applied topically. Castor oil's benefits for skin target a range of concerns and goals, despite hair growth being the most widely known. \"It is commonly taken orally as a laxative,\" dermatologist Purvisha Patel previously told PS. \"It is also found in soaps and used directly on the skin to help inflammatory conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. It is used to stimulate hair growth and moisturize hair as well.\" Read on to learn more about castor oil benefits for skin, as well as to find out how to use castor oil in your beauty routine. Experts Featured in This Article Purvisha Patel, MD, is a dermatologist and cosmetic surgeon in Tennessee. Kunal Malik, MD, FAAD, is a dermatologist based in New York City. How to Use Castor Oil For Hair As the winter closes in, your skin may suffer from the harsher weather. It isn't uncommon for scalps to get flaky. The fatty acids in castor oil can penetrate hair follicles and moisturize deep into the scalp, preventing flaking skin. \"It has ricinoleic acid, which has anti-inflammatory properties that can help soothe an irritated scalp,\" Dr. Malik says. \"I would advise applying it as a pre-shampoo treatment, massaging into the scalp for 10-15 minutes before washing with shampoo.\" Castor oil can be difficult to work with as it is very thick, so if you're having difficulty using it on its own, try adding other oils, such as jojoba oil and coconut oil to get the best benefits from the oils and create an easy-to-use mask. Due to the anti-fungal properties of castor oil, it can also be used to treat minor fungal infections, like dandruff. Dandruff is effectively treated because of the anti-bacterial property of ricinoleic acid, which kills the bacteria causing the flakes. Castor oil is most widely used in a beauty regimen to promote growth for eyebrows and eyelashes. The ricinoleic acid and omega 6 present in the oil is great for promoting circulation \"In skin care, castor oil can be beneficial as an occlusive ingredient, particularly for eyebrows and eyelashes,\" Dr. Malik says. \"Its thick consistency helps lock in moisture and can protect these delicate areas. I think it's important to note that claims about castor oil stimulating hair growth lack strong scientific evidence.\" If you do want to try using castor oil for hair growth on the eyebrows and eyelashes, after cleansing and moisturizing skin, apply a small amount directly onto the eyebrows and eyelashes before going to bed. Using a clean spoolie/mascara wand may help with application. At the very least, the ingredient will help condition the hair so it's soft and more manageable. How to Use Castor Oil on the Face The entirely natural properties of castor oil make a great DIY face mask at home to deeply moisturize the skin. Ensure you create a mask with other oils, such as jojoba and almond oil, containing lots of vitamin E to nourish the skin. While castor oil is not an acne treatment, it can aid in the repair of spots and scars due to the anti-inflammatory properties in the oil, and the anti-bacterial properties can help kill bacteria found in the skin causing the breakout. Additionally, castor oil has recently been found to help with dark circles. In a single-arm clinical trial by the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology conducted in 2021 and 2022, patients who applied a topical castor oil cream twice daily for two months noticed \"reduced melanin levels, wrinkles, and skin laxity in the infraorbital region. However, Dr. Malik notes that if you do plan to incorporate castor oil into your skin-care routine, due to the thick nature of the ingredient, he suggests applying it at night. All of this said, precautions must be taken before incorporating castor oil into your beauty regimen. As with any new product you plan on incorporating into your routine, always do a skin test beforehand to ensure you have no allergies. Don't ingest castor oil unless directed to do so by a health professional. - Additional reporting by Renee Rodriguez Tori Crowther is a freelance beauty journalist and former PS UK editor..
