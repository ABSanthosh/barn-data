    "description": "Image Source: Getty/Richard Harbaugh What do you get when you combine Rita Ora, a mullet, a pixie haircut, and a bottle of bleach? Rita Ora with an iconic \"mixie\" haircut. On Dec. 2, Ora attended the 2024 British Fashion Awards at London's Royal Albert Hall wearing a look that can only be described as '80s punk-rock. Outfit-wise, she sported a gray suit with a striped shirt and a pink tie, paired with chunky silver accessories. Our eyes, however, were glued to her hair. Ora has most recently been seen with long, \"brond\" hair, but last night, she switched things up dramatically. Not only was her hair cut into a mixie - a mix between a mullet and pixie - but the color was completely different, as well. The top was bleached into a golden-honey tone, and the longer area in the back was a deeper brown. (Also, her eyebrows were bleached to match, so it's clear Ora has no trouble committing.) Ora's new look is a substantial switch-up from anything we've seen her with recently. While she has been blond in the past, the short cut is what really caught our attention. Experts Featured in This Article Jenny Cho is a celebrity hairstylist who has worked with stars like Kristen Bell and Daisy Edgar-Jones. \"A mixie is an edgy haircut that is longer in the back, like a mullet, and short, like a pixie, in the front,\" celebrity hairstylist Jenny Cho says. \"Mixie as a haircut feels uniquely different from what we've been seeing but also has a slight '70s retro vibe that feels familiar.\" This isn't the first time we've seen a celebrity sport a mixie - Halsey, Zoë Kravitz, Kristen Stewart, and Charlize Theron have all had one at some time or another. While it does require frequent salon visits to keep the style in tip-top shape, it does typically work for all hair types and textures. Additionally, they're deemed fairly low-maintenance when it comes to day-to-day styling. Keep scrolling to take a closer look at Ora's new 'do.

Getting a new haircut is one of the easiest ways to change your look up and embrace a new vibe or style. For anyone looking to give their hair a major chop, short bob haircuts are a trendy yet easy-to-manage look that'll never go out of style. Just look at Hailey Bieber's dramatic bob transformation. Whether your hair type is wavy, straight, curly, or coily, there's a bob hairstyle out there for you that's sure to flatter. Not sure where to start? We spoke with editorial hairstylist Mariah Molina from Dop Dop Salon to discover the chicest short bob haircuts for fine hair, thick hair, and everything in between. Keep scrolling to learn more and to get some short bob haircut ideas. Experts Featured in This Article Mariah Molina is an editorial hairstylist at Dop Dop Salon based in New York City. \"The short haircut trending this year is also the most universal haircut for most face shapes, and it's the french bob,\" Molina says. \"[It's] a classic and iconic haircut that can be customized.\" A french bob is characterized by its ultra-cropped length, typically hitting just below the ears. As Molina says, it's on most people. \"French bobs are great for fine hair because they are known to be light and fluffy with layering,\" she adds. No matter if you're interested in a short bob haircut with layers, an inverted bob, or a shaggy style with bangs, we rounded up options to inspire your next trip to the salon.",

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In a very crowded sea of lip oils and buttery balm-gloss hybrids (à la Rhode’s Peptide Lip Treatment and Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm), it’s genuinely impressive when a newcomer manages to cut through the noise. But that’s exactly what happened with Ole Henriksen’s Pout Preserve Peptide Lip Treatment. When it launched nearly two years ago in January 2023, Pout Preserve was somewhat of an underrated fave among editors and influencers. However, that all changed earlier this summer when Olympic gymnast (and 2024 R29 Powerhouse) Suni Lee revealed that Pout Preserve was her go-to for the glossy lips that had fans begging her to drop the lip combo stat. And now, after a cycle of selling out, restocking, and repeat, Ole Henriksen is making our holiday wishes come true with three new shades of the highly coveted lippie. The hydrating, peptides (a game-changing ingredient that helps rebuild and heal dry lips and skin) and kokum butter-infused formula has gotten a holiday makeover with added shimmer — a first for the brand. I was lucky enough to get a sneak peek of the new launches, which retail for $22 apiece, or $60 for a trio set.  Pout Preserve Peptide Lip Treatment, $22 First up is Lingonberry Jam, a berry hue that nods to Ole Henriksen’s Scandi roots. Then, there’s Citrus Sunshine, which takes the OG sheer Pout Preserve to glimmery heights. And lastly, we have Crème Brûlée, a glittery rosy brown that smells like your favorite caramel dessert. There’s truly something for everyone: A true berry pink that’s perfect for holiday glam, a barely-there tint with a hint of glitter, and an everyday nude hue that you can swipe on for a “my lips but better” effect. And best of all, the plush, non-sticky formula actually does what it claims to: Naturally plumps and hydrates lips for that pillowy-soft effect that doesn’t feel too heavy or makeup-y. (My biggest beauty pet peeve is when glossy balms “sit” on top of my lips, rather than absorb and moisturize.) They can be worn alone for a shimmery kiss of color, or layered underneath a pencil and worn as a sparkly topper. Compared to its rivals, I was impressed with the color payoff and hydrating properties; it really does feel like a treatment for the lips that just happens to also be pretty. My lips are on the thinner side, and I really did love the non-tingly, plumping benefits that filled in all the lines and dry spots in my lips, rather than enhance them. The new shades just launched last week, but are already gaining popularity online. (And to give you a peek behind the curtain: Pout Preserve was Refinery29 readers’ most-shopped product from the recent Holiday Savings Event.) Our predictions: These shades will be perfect stocking stuffers for the beauty lovers on your list, so make sure you add yours to cart while your favorite shade(s) are still in stock. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",
