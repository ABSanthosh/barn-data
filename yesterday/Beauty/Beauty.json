    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  Six weeks of summer break now feel like a distant memory. Blink and suddenly your free time is rationed out in PTO days. Back then, summer followed a familiar pattern: in between playing Snake on my mom’s old-school cell phone and reading my latest library book, I’d wait patiently for the first kid on our quiet street to knock on my door with the simple question: “Do you want to come out and play?” This usually meant transforming our empty driveways into makeshift baseball fields, with green trash bins expertly placed as bases, before taking turns to whack a ball as far as we could. Hours in the sun inevitably left me with a tan, the mark of an enjoyable summer. But not everybody saw my tan as a badge of honor like I did. One day, I walked back into my house after a fun-filled afternoon, ready to relay tales of my (largely fabricated) sporting triumphs. Instead, my aunt led the conversation. She was in total shock — actually, disgust — at my darker skin tone, and scolded my mum for allowing me to play in the sun all summer. “You look dark just like that Bipasha,” she said with disapproval. She was referring to Bipasha Basu, a prominent Bollywood actress, who was heavily criticized throughout her career thanks to her darker skin. Basu was relentlessly picked apart for not being “fair and lovely” — a beauty standard thrust on South Asian women. As such, even her acting talent was called into question. The message from then on was clear: dark skin was not pretty.  Why is tanned skin still taboo among South Asians? For South Asians, this is a deeply entrenched belief. Historically, darker skin has been associated with lower status, especially among outdoor laborers who spent significant time in the sun. Meanwhile, lighter skin was often considered the ultimate mark of privilege, wealth, and a higher social standing. Fast forward to 2025, and this deep-rooted stigma is still pervasive among darker-skinned South Asians today.  Being teased and likened to Basu was a regular occurrence during my childhood, and it was confusing. After all, Basu was beautiful; she was a Bollywood star for goodness’ sake. So why were our similar skin tones such a bad thing? And why was it acknowledged with so much overt distaste? While it felt conflicting, I saw no appeal in hiding away from the sun just to stay fair. I didn’t recognize it then, but I’d later realize that this was colorism rearing its ugly head.  I’m certainly not the only one who’s been side-eyed — or openly shamed — for enjoying some sun. In fact, this tension is commonplace in South Asian families. Bhavi*, who was 25 at the time, recalls returning from a beach vacation feeling herself. She’d attained a “nice glow”, but her family didn’t take the same view. They were worried she would look “too dark” for an upcoming wedding, and Bhavi tells me that she was strongly encouraged to use tan remover to ensure she looked good in her sari. After this incident, not to mention a string of similar experiences that followed, tanning now has a derogatory connotation for Bhavi. Even if somebody genuinely compliments her tan, it still feels like criticism: “I automatically take it as a negative thing,” she says. I think it’s time to let go of the myth that melanin is some type of super shield — or worse, something to fear or be ashamed of. Why are so many South Asians reluctant to wear sunscreen? South Asian beauty standards have long dictated the “right” skin tone, among other ideals such as clear skin and thinness. This has inevitably shaped our complex relationships with tanning — and inadvertently sun protection, too. Colorism and outdated beauty ideals also shape how — and if — South Asian women use sun protection. Sunscreen is rarely used for skin health, but rather to appease internalized fears of becoming “too dark”. In some cases, sunscreen is avoided altogether, and there is evidence to support this. According to a 2024 study in the Journal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities, one-third of South Asian American respondents reported being more concerned about the prevention of tanning over skin cancer. This makes sense, given that sun protection advice for South Asians tends to be limited to: “Don’t get too dark, otherwise nobody will marry you.” In a similar vein, a 2025 study showed that 41% of surveyed South Asian adults said they skip sunscreen due to “low perceived risk” of sun damage. This goes to show just how little the benefits of wearing sunscreen are discussed in South Asian households, let alone taken seriously.  It is unsurprising, then, that many South Asian women tell me they began their SPF journeys much later in life. Riya*, who is 43 next month, admits that she only started using sunscreen three years ago. It wasn’t a dermatologist or a skincare influencer that got through to her, but her 13-year-old daughter, who Riya says is “constantly schooling” her on the topic: “I genuinely never knew how much of a concern [sun damage] was,” she says, grateful to her daughter for pushing the subject. This is particularly heartening because, speaking from experience, getting a South Asian to change their viewpoint is no small feat. As a community, we are undeniably stuck in our ways, so Riya’s story is a reminder that the next generation of South Asians can be better informed and break the cycle. Similarly, Meena*, 47, rarely used sun protection growing up, but began to take it more seriously in the last ten years. This has become even more pressing after a recent health scare. Meena had a basal cell carcinoma — the most common type of skin cancer, usually caused by sun exposure — removed earlier this year. “I never thought I could get skin cancer,” Meena tells me. She was surprised to learn from her doctor that it was not down to new sun exposure, but rather the result of several years of UV exposure over time. Reflecting on South Asian attitudes around sunscreen, Meena points out: “Darker-skinned communities don’t really think about [skin cancer] as they’ve lived without sun protection for generations, so it’s pretty standard to not use any.”  Is it time for South Asians to rethink our approach to sun protection? If there was ever a time for South Asians to rethink their relationship with sun protection, it’s now. Meena’s story tracks with what consultant dermatologist Dr. Angela Tewari is seeing in the clinic. She tells me that skin cancer statistics and the demographics it affects have shifted since COVID: “The number of early melanomas, basal cell carcinomas, and squamous cell carcinomas is increasing,” she explains. There’s data to support Dr. Tewari’s anecdotal evidence. Skin cancer cases are on the rise, and the projected numbers for 2025 are sobering. In the US, the Skin Cancer Foundation estimates 212,000 new melanoma cases and 8,430 related deaths.  While there is less data on skin cancer rates among South Asians, the risk is still very real and stories like Meena’s are a stark reminder of the price of dismissing sun care. This is especially important given the longstanding myths that “brown people can’t get skin cancer” or “brown people can’t burn”. I have personally shown the latter to be false. These beliefs clearly still hold a lot of weight in South Asian communities; nearly half of the surveyed South Asian Americans in the aforementioned study from 2024 believe they are not at risk of skin cancer.  Our melanin makes us beautiful, yes — but it doesn’t make us invincible. What’s behind the sunscreen myths in South Asian communities? Consultant dermatologist Dr. Shaaira Nasir wants to dispel the falsehood that South Asians are somehow immune to skin cancer: “Even though melanin provides some protection against the sun’s harmful rays, as [South] Asians we still need to protect our skin by using sunscreen,” she explains. She adds that sun exposure is cumulative and causes around 80% of our skin aging. So where do you even start with sun protection? Dr. Shaaira recommends a broad-spectrum sunscreen with SPF 30 to 50. “It’s worth investing in a tinted mineral sunscreen (containing zinc or titanium oxide) that will protect against both UV and visible light,” she adds.  It sounds simple enough, but for many South Asian women, finding the right sunscreen is anything but. Many sunscreens on the market are guilty of leaving a lingering white cast, which may be another reason why sunscreen is often skipped. Of course, some products don’t leave the cast of shame, but they’re not always easy on the wallet. What the industry needs is innovative sun protection with brown skin tones in mind, as well as accessible price points. Dr. Tewari agrees that increased melanin is nowhere near enough protection on its own. Even more concerningly, she sees many South Asian patients with darker skin tones who are often worried about skin issues like hyperpigmentation — worsened by sun exposure — but far fewer who are considering the risk of skin cancer. To bridge this disconnect, Dr. Tewari is keen to see South Asians not only protect their skin but also celebrate their skin color, regardless of the shade. “We all need to love and accept our skin tone,” she says, adding, “My patients of color probably don’t appreciate how lucky they are to have a beautiful, darker skin tone.” But the narrow goal of fair skin often means that we can’t see past the cultural constraints and aren’t thinking of the bigger picture when it comes to sun protection.  I think it’s time to let go of the myth that melanin is some type of super shield — or worse, something to fear or be ashamed of. Our melanin makes us beautiful, yes, but it doesn’t make us invincible. We also don’t need to hide from the sun (despite what the whispers of cultural stigma might have you believe), but rather rewrite what sun protection looks like for us, with daily SPF and regular skin checks (perhaps even mole mapping) as part of that routine. More crucially, we need a shift in the cultural conversation around sun care. There is an undeniable knowledge gap around this in South Asian communities, stemming partly from ignorance and generational beliefs. But as Meena’s “eye-opening” skin cancer experience shows, it has never been more important for South Asians to educate themselves, not just for their own sake but for future generations. *Name has been changed.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/doing-own-wedding-bridal-makeup-advice?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I’ve always felt that the best part of going out is getting ready. I’m a proud bathroom makeup girl (see required TikTok viewing here), and few things bring me more bliss than uninterrupted time with my makeup, brushes, girly pop playlist, and enhancing my features with glam.  So why would things be different when it came to my wedding day? For the three years that I was engaged, I always hoped to do my own makeup (hair was a different story). Not only have I been a beauty editor for years, but I’ve always loved doing my own makeup for special events. However, the more people I floated the idea to, the more well-intentioned friends tried to talk me out of it. “You’re not going to want the pressure,” they’d say. “Just sit back and let yourself be pampered.” I mean…that did sound nice. But I can probably count on one hand the number of times I’ve genuinely loved getting my makeup done. Being a beauty-industry professional has made me pretty particular (and knowledgeable, even though I’m no artist) about how I like my makeup done, and even the most experienced artist is at a disadvantage compared to my years of practice applying eyeliner at the precise angle that elongates my eyes, or a pop of blush right at my cheekbones to lift and wake up my complexion. And that’s not even counting getting the shades and undertones right; I’ve been scarred by too many frosted berry and magenta lipsticks than I’d care to admit.  Which brings me to a few months before my wedding, when I was surrounded by a small mountain of product and a weekend afternoon dedicated to bringing my Instagram saved folder of soft, bridal glam to life. I felt good about translating elements of each inspiration photo IRL, but in order for my look to last from first-look photos through the reception — not to mention, show up on camera — I definitely wanted some advice from the pros.  “To make your makeup show up in photos — especially with flash — adding warmth and depth is essential,” says Rose Siard, beauty educator and founder of Rose and Ben Beauty. “Bridal makeup means different things to different people, but to me, a timeless bridal look features a lightly defined crease, a highlighted lid, a half wing starting from the iris outward, and a pair of Ardell 424 lashes.”  After an afternoon of meticulous swatching, I narrowed down my “kit” that included everything I needed to execute my dream bridal beat. Then, I figured out the order to precisely document each step in my Notes app for flawless recreation. My goal was to make the day-of as stress-free as possible; with a recipe to follow, I knew I wouldn’t be forgetting a step somewhere. (Just Virgo things.)  “For longevity, layering is key. Build your complexion in thin, even layers and set with a puff and powder,” recommends Siard. “A great trick: spritz setting spray before powdering to lock in each layer and help the powder grip better.” Luckily for me, I lived in Florida at the time and was getting married in Vermont; if I could get my practice look to last in humid 90°F weather, then I’d feel more than confident in it lasting in breezy, mountain air.  Another tip from Siard was avoiding products with sunscreen — the only time she (or I, for that matter) would ever recommend doing so. “While great for daily wear, SPF can interfere with makeup formulas and cause flashback in photos,” she explained. The entire process took me a little over an hour, and I went about my day as normal: walking my dog a few times, getting coffee after lunch, and hopping on Zoom calls (albeit much more glam than usual). I intentionally did as few touch-ups as possible (aside from re-applying my lip after lunch) to see how my makeup held up. I examined (and photographed) my face every few hours and asked my fellow beauty coworkers for their candid feedback. (“Oh my god, Karina,” said Jackie. “Wait, I think it’s perfect,” added Lia. I work with the loveliest people!) The night before my wedding, I unpacked all the makeup and tools in one of my suite’s bathrooms (the only time I will ever say that!), grouping them by eyes, face, lip, and brushes. The following morning was a blur of breakfast and bobby pins, and then it was time for me to start the routine. While my bridesmaids finished getting ready, I retreated to my private makeup oasis (the aforementioned extra bathroom). Accompanied only by my mom (and trusty iPhone note), I began recreating my previous practice sessions.  As with many brides, my goal was to look like a more romantic, glam version of myself. I knew I wanted the focus to be on the eyes — my favorite feature — and settled on a soft, warm smoky eye with a hint of champagne sparkle. Paired with a glossy, terracotta rose lip (a dialed-up version of my everyday hue) and luminous, diffused skin, it was decidedly less “done” than a traditional bridal makeup, which tends to skew heavy on the smoky eye and lipstick.  Some core products key to my look were the Rare Beauty Always An Optimist Pore Diffusing Primer that I tested earlier this year alongside R29 beauty-editor favorite, Lawless’  Forget The Filler Foundation mixed with my go-to Make Up For Ever HD Skin Foundation.  I crafted a soft, warm shadow look by starting with a base of e.l.f.’s Liquid Metallic Eyeshadow in Moon (a game-day swap from what I had in my OG breakdown), Chantecaille’s Jasmine Eyeshadow Duet, and my favorite travel eyeshadow palette, Natasha Denona’s Mini Glam Palette. A dual-ended Stila waterproof liquid eyeliner has always been my must-have for my signature feline flick, and I wouldn’t have trusted anything else for my big day. A full strip of falsies (even trimmed down to size) tends to weigh down my eyes, but I love individuals or clusters; I added two Ardell trios to the outer corners of my eyes for an extra winged, lifted effect. Patrick Ta’s Major Headlines in She’s Seductive transformed me into a blushing bride, and Nars’ Explicit Lipstick in Body Heat (which I discovered after interviewing Ciara, the face of the campaign) paired with Lisa Eldridge Sculpt and Shade Lip Pencil in 2W was my bridal lip combo, topped with the 2.0 version of middle school favorite gloss, Stila Plumping Lip Glaze in Kitten. (Yes, this was for both sentimental and performance reasons.)  Lastly, I set my face with a dusting of Tower 28’s GetSet Blur + Set Pressed Setting Powder in Balboa Banana and locked everything in with Morphe’s Continuous Setting Mist. Looking back on it now, doing my own makeup was easily one of the best moments of my wedding day. I fell in love with beauty watching my mother do her makeup day after day, and having her by my side on one of the biggest moments of my life was incredibly special. I feared that I’d get nervous or stressed — if there was one occasion where I’d falter with liquid eyeliner, it would be my wedding — but that couldn’t have been further from reality. All the practice paid off, and I felt muscle memory kick in as I blended my shadow and carefully set my complexion.  I knew I could execute my look in an hour, but left myself nearly two to avoid feeling rushed. “One of my biggest tips: don’t stress during application and enjoy the process,” says Siard, who also did her own bridal makeup. “I still cherish the memory of sitting in the venue with a small vanity, calmly applying each step. It was such a beautiful, grounding moment.” As a beauty editor I did have an advantage with access to professional expertise, in addition to gratis product. Nonetheless, I hope this inspires and empowers fellow beauty-loving brides considering doing their own wedding makeup to trust themselves and go for it.  Now that I’m on the other side, I truly feel like doing your bridal makeup is not only possible, but can be extremely fun and rewarding. (Not to mention, it was also a rare moment of quiet serenity in a busy weekend of socializing.) Every time someone complimented my glam, I was so excited to share that I did it myself. And I may or may not already be accumulating ideas for a vow renewal… Like what you see?

    "title": "“Ozempic Butt” Is a Real Side Effect of the Drug - Here’s What It Means",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/ozempic-butt-49229561",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty / Luis Alvarez By now, you've probably heard all about Ozempic. The popular drug is a brand name for semaglutide, which is primarily used to help people with type 2 diabetes better manage their symptoms. However, over the last few months, conversations around the injection have shifted, thanks to people starting to position it as a quick way to lose weight. (Seriously, there are now Ozempic ads in subway stations.) After millions of views about the topic on TikTok, rumors started to circulate that some celebrities were taking the shots. Still, as with any drug, there are side effects to taking Ozempic, especially when it's used outside of its intended purpose. That could include regaining the weight you had rapidly shed, as well as a lesser-known phenomenon that has started to become more prominent: \"Ozempic butt.\" Not dissimilar from \"Ozempic face,\" this effect instead affects the appearance of the glutes in a way that many people don't expect and are, therefore, unprepared for. To help us understand exactly what \"Ozempic butt\" is, we asked dermatologists Amy Brodsky, MD, and Jennifer Levine, MD, to explain everything. Keep reading for more on the science behind the phenomenon and how you could possibly reverse it, ahead. Experts Featured in This Article Amy Brodsky, MD, is a Chicago-based dermatologist at The Derm Chicago. Jennifer Levine, MD, is a double-board certified, New-York based plastic surgeon. What Is \"Ozempic Butt\"? \"'Ozempic butt' is what happens when people take the drug to stabilize diabetes or simply lose weight, but they end up losing a large amount of fat and muscle mass as well,\" Dr. Brodsky says. \"This is often reflected in the face and the butt.\" Aside from lack of volume, there are a few other changes that cause the overall appearance of Ozempic butt. \"There is also an increase in skin laxity caused by loss of collagen and elastin,\" Dr. Levine says. That means skin around the buttocks and thigh area might look saggier than usual as a result. What Causes \"Ozempic Butt\"? To get technical for a minute, Ozempic is known as a GLP-1 inhibitor, and this volume loss in certain areas is common with this type of drug. \"It inhibits your glucose from turning into fat, so when we stop that, we avoid your fat cells from getting larger and everything kind of just shrinks,\" Dr. Brodsky says. \"It can happen with any drug that inhibits GLP-1, not just Ozempic.\" Can \"Ozempic Butt\" Be Reversed? The good news is that \"Ozempic butt\" can be reversed. The not-so-great news? Aside from stopping the treatment and eating more to regain weight in the area - and even then, that doesn't guarantee the added mass will go where you want it to - it may take a combination of costly treatments to do so. \"I would recommend Emsculpt Neo and Emtone with biostimulatory fillers such as hyperdilute Radiesse and Sculptra,\" Dr. Levine says. \"These treatments in combination will lift and sculpt the buttocks, as well as add volume and improve laxity, skin quality, and texture.\" This, she says, will also help the body build more collagen and elastin. Before and After Emsculpt Neo For Ozempic Butt View this post on Instagram A post shared by Wellness Choice (@wellnesschoice) Ozempic For Weight Loss: Is It Worth the Side Effects? While your aesthetic decisions are your own, it should go without saying that the use of Ozempic should be under the watchful eye of a qualified physician and highly monitored. \"People should really be careful about the actual injectable itself,\" Dr. Brodsky says. \"There are a lot of compounded drugs, or the generic versions of a drug that is a bit cheaper, out there now that are similar to Ozempic, but you never really know what's in them, so you have to be cognizant of what you're putting into your body.\" Though off-label use of the injection may seem tempting, Ozempic being utilized for weight loss already comes with its own host of side effects like nausea, vomiting, and changes in bowel habits. The last thing you want to do is inject any unknown substances into your body. For this reason, should you use it outside of its intended scope of use, always see a professional, and never try to cut corners to save a buck - it may cost you way more in the future. \"Ozempic butt\" is only the latest side effect of the drug to make waves, but be sure to address the possibility of any others with your provider should you choose to use it. If you're worried about this potential outcome, it's always better to initiate the treatments while the weight loss is occurring so your body can maintain its collagen and elastin as well as volume. \"It's better to prevent some of the more extreme changes than try to correct them,\" Dr. Levine says. You know how the saying goes: prevention is always better than a cure. Ariel Baker is a former assistant editor for PS Beauty.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/leah-kateb-shower-routine-review-49383716",
    "description": "\"Love Island USA\" season six took over my life. From the friendship goals of cast members Serena Page, JaNa Craig, and Leah Kateb to the drama-filled Casa Amor and hilarious (and sometimes shady) challenges, the entertainment was truly unmatched. What started as a way to support Ariana Madix as she steps into her hosting era became my newest reality TV obsession. I downloaded the app to vote on time, followed most of the cast on social to keep up with their post-villa shenanigans, and watched nearly every interview they've done. I even started picking up on the cast's lingo, from Kendall Washington's \"nausty,\" Kaylor Martin's \"fawk Aaron,\" or Kateb's \"spare me!\" Thanks to the show's instant popularity, several Love Islanders have entered their influencing era and shared their favorite products along the way, including Kateb and her now-viral shower routine. Noting that she always gets complimented on her soft skin and how good she smells (she's now chief creative officer of clean fragrance brand Skylar), she claims that her under-$40 regimen will be the upgrade you need. @leah.kateb Youre welcome in advance!😋😍🧁🍰🎂 #fyp #fypシ #showerroutine #showerproducts #vanillagirl #softskintips ♬ original sound - leah.kateb The routine consists of four products that are described as \"vanilla girl\" scents or, as Kateb puts it, \"girls who like to smell like a cupcake,\" featuring an array of gourmands and sweet notes. As a fan of both Kateb and sweeter fragrances, I had to see if Kateb did her big one with this routine and if her product recommendations live up to the hype. Keep reading for my full experience below. Note: Depending on the sizes you get, the price of the entire routine varies. In Kateb's viral shower routine TikTok, a few products are smaller or travel sizes. Kateb starts her shower with an antibacterial wash and then goes in with the Lush Sticky Dates Shower Gel ($13). She describes the scent as \"everything good you can put together in this world\" - and she's not wrong. With a date syrup base and notes of vanilla and sandalwood, it has a deep, sweet fragrance that reminds me of warm brown sugar. I squeezed a dollop of the body wash on my exfoliating gloves and instantly got a whiff, and soon enough, it filled the entire bathroom. It's very fragrant and lathers beautifully for a gentle, yummy cleanse. Next, Kateb goes in with the L'Occitane Shea Body Shower Oil ($12), describing the scent as similar to baby soap. I found the shower oil to be lightweight and silky, and its scent was powdery, very similar to the Pond's Talcum Powder that my grandmother uses. I applied it onto my wet skin, giving myself a relaxing body massage as the oil emulsified into a milky white froth, and then washed it off. Its smooth texture also lends itself as a great conditioning agent for shaving. Kateb notes that Sticky Dates is the more overpowering scent that stays on the skin; however, I noticed the opposite. For me, the L'Occitane Shea Body Shower Oil scent lingered on my skin post-shower. Depending on her skin's needs and mood, Kateb moisturizes her body with either the Eos 24H Moisture Body Lotion in Vanilla Cashmere ($12) or the Kiehl's Creme de Corps Body Butter ($49). Kateb notes that the Creme de Corps Body Butter will leave your skin softer and hydrated for longer than the 24H Moisture Body Lotion, but the Eos body lotion is more fragrant compared to the body butter. Although I do not have the Kiehl's Creme de Corps Body Butter on hand, I do have the Kiehl's Creme de Corps Body Lotion ($39), which is just a thinner consistency, according to the Kiehl's site. Both lotions are deeply moisturizing and pleasant to apply. Given Kateb's analysis, I decided to apply the Creme de Corps Body Lotion first to help hydrate my skin and then layer the Eos 24H Moisture Body Lotion in Vanilla Cashmere on top for the buttery, warm vanilla scent. After the entire routine, my skin was left feeling soft and (in Kateb's words) \"ma ma ma ma moisturized\" with a beautiful glow that glistened in the sun. The vanilla cashmere scent lasted all night long, and I even woke up the next morning with the fragrance still lingering on my skin. Kateb ends her routine with a spritz of her favorite vanilla perfume, which she did not initially disclose until she posted a follow-up TikTok on her perfume collection. \"The scents I like, I like to smell edible. I like to smell like you can eat me off of a plate. I want to smell like you want to come and taste me,\" she says in the clip. Kateb is a big fan of the Kayali Vanilla 28 ($100), which was a popular fragrance amongst the Villa girls on \"Love Island USA,\" and as a result of her influence, it sold out a few times. After she revived its popularity, she collaborated with Kayali founder and Dubai Bling star Mona Kattan and became the brand's newest ambassador. Kateb loves the Kayali Yum Pistachio Gelato ($138), a gourmand with notes of nutty pistachio and hazelnut, cotton candy, and whipped cream, and even layers it with the Kayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow ($138), a sweet, fruity scent with pink marshmallow, strawberry, coconut, vanilla, and pink musk. Kateb's other favorite \"how to smell edible\" fragrance recommendations include the Skylar Vanilla Sky Perfume ($90), Love by Kilian Don't Be Shy ($295), Philosophy Fresh Cream ($54), and Guerlain Spiritueuse Double Vanille ($425) which is a woody-amber vanilla fragrance that has been her go-to for six years. Kateb put us on one of the most luxurious shower routines, and I highly recommend it - times a million. Here's hoping she drops her hair-care routine next.
