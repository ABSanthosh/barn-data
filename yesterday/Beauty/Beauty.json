    "description": "No matter how many decades pass, some scent memories still hit me like a bus when I encounter them again: The smell of bookstores — specifically Barnes \u0026 Noble — takes me back to my childhood days of being a voracious reader. The smell of Subway sandwich shops (how do they all smell exactly the same, regardless of where you are in the world?) reminds me of my freshman year of college, when I frequented the chain several times a week. To me, Grand Central Station smells like brand-new dollar bills with metallic undertones (don’t ask why). Hopefully, I’ll be adding one more to the list: My upcoming wedding. DashDividers_1_500x100 What is scentscaping? Beyond my dress and the guest list, one detail I’m thinking a lot about is scent. I want every part of my wedding, from the ceremony to the dancefloor, to evoke “love is in the air.” In wedding circles, it’s referred to as “scentscaping.”  “Scentscaping is the art of creating a signature scent around your event or wedding,” explains Allison Cullman, vice president of brand marketing and strategy at online wedding planner Zola. But it’s not just a beloved perfume or cologne worn by the bride and groom (though Viktor \u0026 Rolf Flowerbomb, Chloé’s eponymous scent, and Jo Malone English Pear and Freesia are all timelessly popular picks for brides). Scentscaping is about scenting the space itself to elevate and enhance the experience for guests. We do, after all, have five senses — so why should wedding music, florals, and plated dinners take a front seat while scent is overlooked? “Scentscaping usually involves infusing the scent subtly into multiple touchpoints — from scented stationery to diffusing scent in the reception — throughout the wedding,” says JJ Vittoria, founder of Olfactory NYC, a custom fragrance studio (located not only in NYC, but with outposts in Boston, Miami, and Washington D.C.). Famously, the wedding of Kate Middleton and Prince William was scented with Jo Malone Orange Blossom (which prompted a frenzy of fans clamoring for the floral citrus scent), whereas Meghan and Harry opted for Diptyque (the exact scents remain a royal secret). I’m no royal, but as it turns out, these bougie practices seem to have mass appeal when it comes to making your special day extra special. When scentscaping is done right, you may not even notice it. You’ll know you’re having a great time, but it may not click until later that scent played such a major role in your positive feelings. “I’ll give an example,” shares Cullman. “There’s a particular hotel in Miami that I have such incredible scent associations with: It was so warm and welcoming, and blended into the vibe versus taking your breath away or being overpowering.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Why is scentscaping so popular? From candles to diffusers, scentscaping is becoming popular for several reasons: “When we asked couples, ‘How do you want your wedding to be perceived by others?’ the top word was ‘memorable’,” says Cullman. As couples seek more meaningful and memorable weddings, custom scents are becoming a popular part of the planning process. With the rise of personal fragrance, it’s no surprise that scent is now being used to enhance wedding spaces, too. (According to a CEW report, fragrance was the fastest-growing beauty category from January through September 2024, rising 14% in prestige and 2% in mass, with home fragrance in particular swelling to $14.2 billion alone in 2025.) There’s also science to confirm the link between scent and memory: Scent is processed by the brain’s olfactory bulb (the part of the brain that processes smells) and takes something of an express route to the areas related to emotion and memory. That’s why it’s not uncommon to experience a wave of nostalgia after smelling a loved one’s perfume or a beloved childhood treat (for me, it’s Fruit By The Foot). “[Scentscaping] adds to the multisensory experience of the wedding for the guests as well as the couple, creating a distinctive association of that specific scent with that special day,” says Vittoria. “Like a wedding photo, smelling the scent in the future will create recollections of that day.” DashDividers_1_500x100 What are some popular notes for scentscaping? According to Vittoria, florals (groundbreaking!) are a popular choice for spouses-to-be, but lately, he’s noticed a trend in wedding scents inspired by the destination itself: “We recently made a scent for a couple getting married in Kiawah Island, South Carolina. [It] was an aquatic green scent with notes of elemi [a tree that emits a spicy, fragrant resin] and fig to encapsulate the lush green locale,” he explains. “We’ve also had citrus for a Florida wedding and even a ‘Big Apple’ scent for New York.” Vittoria, who got married in Vermont, created a maple scent for guests to enjoy during the day — and take home as favors: “We’ve had guests looking to get refills already,” he shares.  I’m getting married at a ski resort and have already been looking for something that complements the mountains and cozy cabin ambiance of our venue. During a recent trip to Olfactory NYC, I created a bespoke sandalwood, cedarwood, rosewood, (all of the woods!), and musk scent that felt warm, sensual, and utterly comfy. I ordered it as an eau de parfum to wear down the aisle. To complement my custom perfume, I ordered Bois de Balincourt diffusers from Maison Marie Louis to scent my reception space. (Pro tip: Check if your venue allows open flames before ordering 100 mini candles.) DashDividers_1_500x100 How do you choose a signature wedding day scent? If you’re ready to “scent” your own upcoming nuptials, Cullman advises having a conversation with your partner about what scents you love — and perhaps more importantly, don’t — so that you can align on which emotion you want to convey or elicit with your custom scent. “It really depends on a couple and their preferences, where they’re getting married, the type of vibe that they’re trying to create,” she says. Another aspect not to overlook? In a deluge of stressful deadlines, contracts, and logistics, teaming up with your fiancé(e) can be a highlight of the planning process: “The act of making a custom scent is a fun, relaxing activity to incorporate into the wedding day lead up,” Vittoria adds. At the very least, my curated scentscape will enhance the cozy mountain wedding vibe for our guests — and at best, instantly transport me back to the day I said “I Do.” The Best Candles \u0026 Diffusers For A Spring/Summer Wedding Diptyque Tubéreuse (Tuberose) Room Spray, $82 Diptyque’s iconic Tubéreuse scent is a popular choice for weddings year-round, and it’s easy to see why. The intoxicating white floral is sweet yet fresh, and perfect for creating the ultimate romantic mood at any wedding. We recommend this one in room spray form, but the French fragrance maison also makes large room candles (pictured), should you wish to have your scent double as décor. Maison Louis Marie No.13 Nouvelle Vague Diffuser, $95 Maison Louis Marie’s diffusers are a gorgeous addition to any wedding décor, and the brand’s new Nouvelle Vague scent (which also comes in candle form) is actually inspired by an iconic destination wedding locale: The Amalfi Coast. Summery citrus accord meets subtle white florals with a hint of Tuscan fig and agave throughout, making this a beautiful choice for any warm-weather bride. Jo Malone London Peony \u0026 Blush Suede Candle, $82 Jo Malone is already a go-to brand for scenting high-profile nuptials, and if we had to choose one fragrance for spring weddings, it would be this one. Peony \u0026 Blush Suede (also available as a diffuser) juxtaposes sweet floral and fruit notes with grounding suede notes for a springtime scent that’s anything but boring. Olfactory NYC Custom Diffuser, $45 Bring your creative vision to life by making a custom fragrance diffuser with Olfactory NYC. Start with your choice of 16 base scents, and then make it your own by layering various accords for a result that’s as unique as you are. Phlur Missing Person Candle, $45 Phlur’s bestselling Missing Person scent is all about capturing the essence of a loved one’s presence, making it an especially sentimental choice for weddings. Featuring delicate, skin-like notes of white musk, sheer florals, soft woods, and jasmine, it’s a nuanced, evocative scent that’s perfect for any intimate ceremony. Like what you see?

Keep scrolling to shop them all. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Multi-Styler, $349 “Ever since I first reviewed the Shark FlexFusion, it’s been my ultimate hair tool obsession. It’s astonishingly user-friendly, delivers salon-quality blowouts, and dries hair in single-digit minutes. The brush attachment boosts natural bounce and volume, while the curling barrels effortlessly create soft waves (I sometimes brush through to loosen the curl a bit). There’s no better time to invest in one with a 10% discount that saves you over $30 is on the table.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Glossier You Doux Eau de Parfum, $78 “Glossier didn’t hold back with its expansion of the You cinematic universe, and I’m endlessly grateful for that bold move. This warm, woody scent has skyrocketed to the front of my fragrance collection, and I even have it in rollerball form to refresh during the day. It has subtle floral notes of violet, with sultry palo santo and ambrox (the hero ingredient in every You scent). Glossier rarely does discounts, so this Sephora sale is a rare, sneaky chance to knock a few bucks off.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Fara Homidi Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil, $36 “I’m not typically a lipstick or gloss girl, but I’m always on the hunt for the perfect everyday lip pencil to pair with a basic balm. Fara Homidi’s Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil in minky nails that natural pinky-brown nude that’s balanced and never too warm. The formula is soft, blendable, and comes in packaging that feels utterly luxe.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Ilia Limitless Lash Lengthening Clean Mascara, $29 “ILIA’s mascara has always been a favorite of mine because it delivers a natural look without irritating my sensitive eyes. Now, with a newly-released brown shade in the mix, I’m using the Sephora sale as the perfect excuse to add it to cart.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm, $24 “Every purse of mine is a graveyard for balms and glosses I’ve loved, used, and, sadly, forgotten about — except one. Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm — it’s  the only product I’ve finished down to the last drop, and I keep coming back for more. I love the Iced Coffee and Hot Cocoa shades, both of which lend a wash of juicy nude that’s perfect for everyday wear. Cherry is the next hue on my list. It’s giving juicy, just-bitten glossy lips while nourishing with shea and murumuru seed butter — unbeatable!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush, $27 “Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush brings a radiant, backlit glow to my complexion (it’s so convincingly natural, people always ask what’s my secret). It blends seamlessly (unlike most powders) and doesn’t budge until I’m ready to call it a day. I’m so smitten that I even gifted various shades to my mum and grandma. The airbrushed finish serves major smooth and plump. Plus, I love using a touch on my eyelids for a subtle, effortless glint.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Amika Reset Cleansing Oil, $30 “I’ve tried my fair share of clarifying hair products, but Amika’s Reset Range remains the gold standard for me. I started using this cleansing oil in college as a pre-shampoo treatment, and it still works wonders for banishing buildup and that greasy scalp feeling. The charcoal-infused formula transforms into oil and foams up beautifully. I go through it fast, so I’ve got my calendar marked for a discounted restock.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Milk Makeup Hydro Grip + Glow Illuminating Primer, $30 “I’m already an OG Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer stan — it locks in makeup all day, hydrates without greasiness, and creates a flawless base (sans pilling). For summer, I’m excited to give the Illuminating Grip + Glow Primer a go, which promises to prime, prep, and give my skin that lit-from-within glow.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, $24 “I swear by this lip sleeping mask! I keep two pots close by my side— one as the final step of my nighttime routine (waking up to baby-soft lips), and one on my desk for an on-the-go boost of softness and sticky-free shine. The Sephora Spring Sale is the time to stock up.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Chunks Medium Box Hair Claw Clip in Olive Check, $22 “If you’re hunting for a hair claw that won’t snap after a few uses, look no further — Chunks clips are elite. The AAPI-founded brand cracked the indestructible code with its FSC-certified cellulose acetate, a plant-based bio-plastic. I’m almost always rocking an updo, and these never hurt my head – this olive checkerboard print is calling my name for spring.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Ultra Violette Supreme Screen SPF Facial Sunscreen, $36 “Our beauty editors introduced me to this Australian sunscreen brand Ultra Violette, and I’ve been eager to test the Supreme Screen SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Moisturizer and Primer for my daily SPF protection. With sun season fast approaching, I’m thrilled to add this non-greasy, no-pilling formula to my daily routine.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Merit Signature Lip Sheer Lip Liner, $24 “Lip liners are the moment, and I’m loving MERIT’s latest fleet of buttery-smooth, beginner-friendly blurring liners. They add just the right dimension without looking overdone. I’ve been defaulting to Brownstone to match my coffee-hued lip gloss for a ‘90s-inspired look, but I’m excited to get my hands on Coupé —  a soft pink that’s quite difficult to find in a shade.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Like what you see?

Bieber's nail artist Britney Tokyo posted the look to her Instagram page, captioning them \"textured nails,\" but we couldn't help but notice they are reminiscent of the lava trend that consists of 3D sculpting gel to create a flowy, flame effect on the nails. Tokyo used metallic hot pink polish that reflected the sun, which is a deviation from Bieber's usual minimal and clean aesthetic. She is, after all, the woman who gave us glazed-doughnut nails, aka the trend known for having a classic pink or nude base with just the subtlest hint of shimmer glossed on top. Although many celebrities at Coachella this year opted for subtle makeup looks (and who can blame them when temperatures were so high?), most festival goers chose to express themselves through fun nail art, hairstyles, and, of course, fashion. In Bieber's case, it seems her outfit choice could have inspired her nail design. She rocked a vintage Mugler leather bustier that featured lava-esque flame details along the neckline and paired the top with casual black pants and sneakers. Our nail queen has done it again, and we hope there are more experimental designs from her in our future. In the meantime, check out Bieber's lava nails as inspiration for your own festival manicure.
