    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/gray-hair-in-30s-women-aging?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It arrived the year I turned 30. My first gray hair, fluttering above my temple like a flag planted by an advancing army. I plucked it, examined it, and let it fall to the carpet. This was no concern of mine. Fresh out of a relationship that had spoken for my 20s, I was busily engaged in all the activities I had longed to do when I was shacked up in the suburbs, making weekend trips to homeware stores: living with friends in fashionable parts of the city, having serious conversations with unserious boys, experimenting with drugs for the first time. I felt young in a way that had so far eluded me and I was not about to let a single gray hair — an interloper, an outlier — spoil my party. I threw on my jacket, ran out the door, and forgot all about it. Samantha Jones was right. Six more grays (and the rest) came to that first gray’s funeral. At a festival a few summers later and crushing on a boy in the next tent along, I presented a friend with my scalp and a pair of tweezers and told her to go to town. But for the most part, I remained unperturbed, content to let nature do its thing. The partying subsided, as it does, and I settled back into adulthood, accumulating the markers of a thirtysomething life — a mortgage, a dog, a baby — and the fine lines and wrinkles that come with them. These unmistakable signs of aging bothered me even less than the grays and I congratulated myself on my composure in the face of getting older. Then at the end of last year, something changed. Have you noticed that a lot of people who embrace gray hair at a comparatively young age tend to fit a rigid mould? The look is deliberate — a chic stripe or an all-over dye job — and the effect sleek and statement-making, unencumbered by suggestions of age. On a bright December morning, my boyfriend and I bundled our daughter and our dog into the car and drove out to the country for a walk. It was one of those rare winter days that make you feel glad to be alive and I pulled out my phone to capture the memory. In bed that evening, my boyfriend asleep beside me, I looked at the pictures. All I could see were my grays, glittering in the sunshine. I tried to refocus my attention — on the joy on my little girl’s face, on the landscape bathed in light — but I was horrified. I looked like I had been attacked with a can of silly string. A wave of adjectives crashed over me, none of them complimentary. Straggly. Wiry. Witchy. Mad. The image of myself that I had carried for years disappeared in an instant and I lay awake into the small hours, wondering when I had grown old. What is it about gray hair that provokes such anxiety, still, about getting older? Every now and again, a woman will pop her head above the parapet and declare herself a champion of aging gracefully. Problematic euphemism notwithstanding, have you noticed that a lot of people who embrace gray hair at a comparatively young age tend to fit a rather rigid mold? As with so many beauty movements, there is a popular look and a particular lingo. The look is deliberate — a chic stripe or an all-over dye job — and the effect sleek and statement-making, unencumbered by suggestions of age. It is as bold a choice as pink or green and equally high maintenance; the reason you do not see women like me championing gray hair is because it requires investment. We may not like to admit it but silver privilege exists. Going gray in public before retirement age is acceptable so long as the hair is well groomed and intentional. Going gray in public before retirement age is acceptable so long as the hair is well-groomed and intentional. We may not like to admit it but silver privilege exists and the unfortunate truth is that if you do not have the money for regular salon visits or the time for conditioning treatments and a blowdry every morning — and many of us do not — then you’re probably better off grabbing a box of Nice’n Easy and concealing the evidence. I wish I had the fortitude to persevere through this stringy, straggly, in-between stage; to sit in the pub without comparing myself unfavorably to every young woman who walks through the door; to stop worrying about being the old mom at baby group. Feminism is all but a dirty word these days yet I still consider myself — would describe myself if asked — as a feminist, and this new preoccupation with the way I look feels like a betrayal of my worldview. I have always thought of myself as only marginally interested in my appearance — I rarely wear makeup, I have never had a professional manicure and if I am ever on trend, it is most likely by accident. In truth, this is the product of a vicious circle of laziness and lack of ability but somewhere at the back of my mind, there lingers the suspicion that I am a better feminist for never having learned to apply lipstick. That I am morally superior because I do not know how to contour, or what a cut crease is. This is stupid and wrong, not to mention inconsistent — I wax my bikini line every five weeks without fail — and I am ashamed to admit it. I am beginning to wonder, too, whether I have never bothered with my looks because I have never really felt like I had to. Pretty privilege is a recognized phenomenon that bestows extra advantages on people who are considered attractive according to a very narrow, extremely outdated standard that prioritizes Eurocentric features and is filtered through the male gaze. By no means do I think of myself as pretty — and it is definitely an awkward choice of word for someone approaching their 40th birthday — but when I look at photos of myself from as little as five years ago, I see clear skin that needs no coverage, eyes that are plenty wide enough without mascara, a lower lip wearing nothing but Carmex. I am no beauty but have I been dishonest with myself in failing to recognize this indifference towards my appearance as a privilege afforded to me by, shall we say, inoffensive features? And where does that leave me now that my hair is graying, lines are appearing on my forehead and my lower lip isn’t as full as it used to be? There is a voice in my head, still, that says I am letting the sisterhood — and my daughter — down by capitulating to a system that calculates a woman’s worth on the basis of her perceived youth and beauty. But I realise now that this attitude is a hangover from a prescriptive brand of feminism that stopped being relevant a long time ago. In the salon chair, it turns out, watching a stylist paint my hair for the first time in my life. (I would have grabbed the aforementioned box of Nice’n Easy but I have heard too many DIY horror stories to trust my inexperienced hands with a task as delicate as repairing my self-esteem. At 16, a clumsy dye job is no big deal; at 39, it can make a distressing situation worse.) I would love to tell you that I had a moment of madness and requested balayage or a zeitgeisty shade like mocha mousse but true to form, I asked the stylist to match my natural color as closely as possible and emerged from the salon a couple of hours later looking much the same as when I arrived. I feel different, though. If nothing else, it is a relief to stand in front of the bathroom mirror without fixating on the grays writhing across my scalp. I do not think I look younger but that was never really my goal. Getting older is a privilege and women should be permitted to own their advancing years without fearing the consequences, like the 36% of women over 50 who, according to a new report, say they have been discriminated against. There is a voice in my head, still, that says I am letting the sisterhood — and my daughter — down by capitulating to a system that calculates a woman’s worth on the basis of her perceived youth and beauty. But I realize now that this attitude is a hangover from a prescriptive brand of feminism that stopped being relevant a long time ago. Perhaps, then, by dyeing my hair I have done something truly radical. I have owned up to the errors in my way of thinking — which only gets harder the deeper one digs into adulthood — and how do we begin to address the flaws in a system if not by addressing the flaws in ourselves first?

    "title": "14 Best Self-Tanners For a Year-Round Glow",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Best-Self-Tanners-43759177",
    "description": "If you're looking for a little glow this summer, but you don't want to spend countless hours in the sun, your best bet is trying a self-tanner. Whether you're looking for the best self tanning lotion or the best self tanner for face, there are tons of products to shop from brands like Isle of Paradise, Jergens, Coco \u0026 Eve, and Bali Body, but it's hard to know which one is right for you. Before you start searching for the best self-tanners online, it's important to keep a few tips in mind. First, be aware of your body's pH level and anything that could affect it, such as showering right before a tan or certain body washes. DHA, the ingredient in tanning solutions that creates the bronze color, interacts with your skin's pH, which means things like your period and when you shower can affect how well your skin accepts the tan. \"I can tell within two seconds, within that first spray, if you've showered right before, which is not good,\" Brittney Bennett, a spray tanner at Be Bronze Tanning Studio in Los Angeles, tells PS. \"If you shower, I like a good 12 hours but a minimum of four hours prior - shower, shave, exfoliate - because if you do it right before, your tan will be 20 to 30 percent less dark. Same thing with your period. The pH balance of your skin is what the tan is working with.\" Ahead, we've curated expert advice, bestselling formulas, and customer favorites to make shopping for your next self-tanner a little easier. When to Get a Spray Tan After getting a spray tan, you might notice that distinct tan smell, but avoid spritzing a fragrance to mask it. \"A patchy neck can be caused by perfumes and products left on the skin before application,\" says Sophie Evans, St. Tropez's skin finishing expert. She suggests the St. Tropez Tan Remover Mousse if the patchiness is too noticeable to cover with makeup. \"You can also apply a little loose translucent powder after your tan application to avoid any dark neck creases.\" When it comes to big events, Evans suggests giving your tan 24 hours to develop and settle before the event. \"If an event is Saturday, I recommend getting a tan on Thursday night,\" she says. \"Sometimes, a self-tan instant bronzer can take two showers to remove fully. You could also opt for a clear water mousse or gel, like St. Tropez's Purity Water collection. This range contains no bronzers, so there is nothing to transfer. Plus, you can wear it all day without feeling sticky or the need to shower.\" Now that you've read a few facts about spray tans, it's time to answer the one question we're all thinking: what is the best self-tanner?

    "title": "22 Editor-Favorite Beauty Products That Are FSA and HSA Eligible",

    "description": "Shopping for beauty products can be fun, but it can also add up fast. No matter how good they make you feel (or look), no one looks forward to seeing the credit card bill post an Ulta or Sephora trip. However, you can save on your beauty routine by using your FSA (flexible spending account) and HSA (health savings account) on beauty products that are eligible. Enrolling in either of these programs allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars for certain medical expenses and conditions, like over-the-counter medications and even skin-care products. To help you make the most of your FSA or HSA benefits and shop strategically, we enlisted the help of board certified dermatologist Nithin Reddy, MD, to break down the benefits, what types of products qualify and why, and how to optimize your shopping list. We also included some of the best FSA and HSA-eligible skin-care products you can stock up on with your funds, including a few of our editor-backed picks. What is the difference between an FSA and an HSA? In order to fully take advantage of these benefits, it is helpful to understand what exactly FSA and HSA accounts are and the differences between them. Both FSA and HSA benefits let you set aside pre-tax money to spend on healthcare costs, but there's an annual contribution limit for an FSA that you can specify during your enrollment period, according to Dr. Reddy. He points out that employers usually offer FSAs, and HSAs are contingent on enrolling in a high-deductible health plan. \"One of the main advantages of an HSA is that it is portable, staying with the account holder through job transitions,\" Dr. Reddy says. \"Other HSA advantages include higher contribution limits, rollovers, investment opportunities, and flexible withdrawals. It is crucial to thoroughly review the terms and conditions, contribution limits, and qualified expenses with both types of accounts to determine their suitability for your needs.\" How can beauty products qualify for the tax-free benefit? Dr. Reddy says that while beauty products alone may not qualify as FSA/HSA eligible, those containing ingredients proven to treat medical conditions - like acne, eczema, or in the prevention of skin cancer can be eligible for FSA/HSA coverage. \"For instance, over-the-counter retinol, a well-known antiaging ingredient in many beauty products, is in many acne treatments, making it eligible for FSA/HSA funds,\" Dr. Reddy says. \"Similarly, blemish correctors that contain salicylic acid, another effective ingredient for treating acne, often qualify as FSA/HSA eligible.\" Along with acne treatments, sunscreen is also eligible since they help prevent skin cancer. He also notes that some moisturizers can qualify for the benefit if they help with eczema management. \"If there is any doubt about a specific product's eligibility, it is always advisable to first consult with your account administrator,\" he says. How can consumers take advantage of their FSA/HSA benefits for beauty products? \"Any products labeled as FSA/HSA eligible can be purchased using your FSA or HSA account, providing a convenient way to manage your healthcare expenses by offering tax savings,\" he says. Sites like Sephora, CVS, and Amazon have specific sections you can shop from that filter the products that are eligible for the benefit. \"I recommend carefully assessing your skin-care routine to identify which products may qualify for coverage. Consulting with your local dermatologist can help you develop a tailored skin-care routine that caters to your specific skin conditions,\" Dr. Reddy says. He recommends swapping products that aren't covered by the benefit with FSA/HSA-eligible items but warns not to overspend on non-essential items if you can help it. Ahead, we rounded up the best beauty products you can get using your FSA or HSA benefits. Expert Featured in This Article Nithin Reddy is an NYC-based board certified dermatologist.",
