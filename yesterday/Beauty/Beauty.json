    "description": "Whatever your plans are for the summer, one thing’s for certain — vacation season doesn’t officially start until you’ve got a fresh manicure. While there’s no shortage of cool summer nail trends to inspire your next trip to the salon — from dreamy aurora nails to chic matcha manicures — consider this summer’s hottest nail your shortcut to vacation vibes. Enter: beach nails.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Stacey Machin Nail Artist (@staceymachin) Slowly taking over my social feeds as the hottest nail look of summer 2025, the beauty of beach nails lies in their versatility. With no passport required, your nails can be your ticket to a tropical coral reef complete with 3D ocean critters, and a rainbow of colors, or a verdant coastline dotted with the prettiest seashells and shimmering pearls. Ahead, I caught up with two nail experts to break down exactly what makes beach nails so appealing for summer. View this post on Instagram A post shared by JHIRELY BEAUTY STUDIO (@jhire.beauty) What are beach nails? Beach nails are a total celebration of the spirit of summer, which means that, unlike more classic manicures like French tips, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to this look. There is one thing that unites them all, though— they feel special. “Clients rarely choose beach nails for everyday wear; they have a celebratory feel and act more like an accessory to complete their [vacation] look,” explains nail artist and founder of MVK nail salons, Viktoria Kolodii.  Thanks to the free-spirited nature of the trend, beach nails are undeniably a manicure that’s made to suit you. “Whether you’re going on a coastal getaway or just want to embrace the summer mood, you can keep beach nails simple and neutral or go wild with pastels, bright shades, and 3D elements,” explains nail artist Stacey Machin. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Glamorous Nails | Beckenham (@glamorous_nails_beckenham) Of course, when you think of the beach, certain things will likely spring to mind: marine hues, sun-drenched pastels, and seashell textures, to name a few. “We draw inspiration from everything associated with the sea and summer for beach nails,” says Kolodii. “Think sunsets, sand, waves, and coral, with 3D gel techniques being used to the effect of droplets or sea foam, and decorative details like tiny pearls, starfish, nail stickers, and themed nail stickers adding to the overall aesthetic.”  The best beach manicures seem to have one thing in common: they take a multifaceted approach to nail design with various techniques, colors and finishes used. “Shells and starfish are easy to incorporate into a manicure and can be painted with normal and 3D gel, while chrome powders can be used to give a mermaid-core pearlescent effect along with metallics to create embellished oyster nails,” says Machin. Combine embellishments like beads and pearls with more sculpted details like flowers, and you’re on track for one of the most joyful manicures ever. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Stacey Machin Nail Artist (@staceymachin) How long do beach nails take to do? Some of the beach nails I’ve seen on my social feeds lately are seriously intricate, so I was keen to find out if this is the kind of manicure that you can book in for last-minute before you head to the airport. While it all depends on the amount of detail and 3D sculpting you opt for, Machin suggests leaving between one and a half to three hours for your beach nails salon appointment. View this post on Instagram A post shared by PrettyInPolish (@prettyinpolish) Don’t have the time? It’s possible to recreate a beachy manicure at home: “There are plenty of ready-made decorations available, like rhinestones, shells, or tiny nail stickers, that are easy to apply using nail glue,” says Kolodii. As for polish, she suggests looking for options with a pearlescent finish or a “wet-look” effect. “They instantly feel summery and on-theme, without requiring advanced skills for application,” she explains.  Ready for the ultimate vacation manicure? Here are some of our favorite beach nail looks to inspire you. DashDividers_1_500x100 Pastel Resort View this post on Instagram A post shared by Stacey Machin Nail Artist (@staceymachin) Stacey Machin is the queen of beach nails, and this beautiful set wouldn’t look out of place at a 5-star luxury hotel, thanks to its refined peach and pearl color palette. Blue Crush View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tayla (@beautique_kent) Taking a monochromatic approach to beach nails, this ocean blue manicure by Tayla is fresh and undeniably cool. Pearly Princess View this post on Instagram A post shared by Arlene | Indiana nail tech (@nailsxarlene) Shirking the mix-and-match approach to beach nails, nail technician Arlene sticks to a pearlescent shell texture with gold detailing for a chic minimalist manicure. Coral Splash View this post on Instagram A post shared by ✧ 𝑮𝒆́𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒔 ✧ (@nailsbygenesisaranda) This playful set by Génesis is so incredibly fun with its cute starfish detailing paired with hot pink and orange. Serene Dream View this post on Instagram A post shared by Daisy Marsden (@dais_does_nails) Daisy Marsden’s ethereal set pays homage to hidden rock pools with koi carp, freshwater pearls, and the texture of ripples on the water’s surface. Tidal Wave View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐍𝐚𝐢𝐥 𝐂𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐧🤎 (@the_nail_cabin_x) Taking a more-is-more approach to the beach manicure, The Nail Cabin layers a butter yellow base with sea creatures and oyster pearls for a gloriously maximalist vacation set.  Summer Shells View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hannah Leong (@han.polished) Inspired by vacations in Hawaii, nail tech Hannah Leong’s bold and bright manicure uses seashell French tips, ombre color splashes, and the cutest of sea critters in this joyful manicure.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/bella-hadid-orebella-fragrance-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "As a self-proclaimed fragrance obsessive, it’s rare for a new perfume brand to grab (and hold) my attention — and even rarer when it’s fronted by a celebrity. That’s not to say there aren’t gems: Kylie Jenner’s Cosmic 2.0 and Eilish by Billie Eilish have both been mistaken for far more expensive designer scents on me. Most of the time, though, they all smell… kind of identical. But ‘Ôrebella, dreamt up by the one and only Bella Hadid, is built different. Sure, there are the usual wearable notes (vanilla, jasmine, and rose), but alongside them are spicy cardamom, savory sea salt accord, and briny olive — elements I can’t say appear in any of the perfumes in my current collection.   If that’s not unique enough, you can wear them — I mean really wear them — like skincare. Each of the four eau de parfums is designed to be shaken to activate, since they’re formulated without alcohol. Alongside the essential oils that give each fragrance its potency, they’re filled to the brim with moisturizing oils like shea, almond, and jojoba. It definitely takes the skin scent trend to a whole new level. Of course, you can spritz them onto your clothes, too, but be mindful that the high oil content might leave behind marks on certain fabrics.  The brand’s been around for a hot minute here in the US, holding it down at Ulta — but Miss Bella is really having a moment right now. I mean, have you seen her new hair color? Divine. But back to the fragrance. Beyond the milky elixir, the geode-inspired bottle (which doesn’t stand upright on its own; you’ll need a separate stand, at an additional cost, if you want to display it) is garnering a lot of attention. So I made it my mission to try every single perfume in ‘Ôrebella’s collection, and here’s what I want everyone to know.  DashDividers_1_500x100 ‘Ôrebella Nightcap Eau de Parfum, $72 This is a warm mug of milky masala chai, bottled, and hands down my favorite of all of Ôrebella’s fragrances. Something about the soothing vanilla, spicy cardamom, and creamy guaiacwood makes it perfectly nuzzly and cosy, so much so, I love wearing it to bed. I’m convinced it sends me off to sleep faster. I wore it to a concert recently, where it’s impossible not to get up close and personal with the other guests, and received a handful of compliments; one even wrote the name down in her phone immediately, it’s that good. It makes sense. Nightcap was created by perfumer Clément Gavarry, the visionary who gave us Phlur, Kayali, and Chloé’s most viral fragrances.  ‘Ôrebella Salted Muse Eau de Parfum, $72 Legendary French perfumer Jérôme Epinette, the nose behind multiple Noyz, Byredo, and Victoria Beckham fragrances, is the architect of Salted Muse. Described as a “woody marine” scent, it blends sea salt accord with fig, sandalwood, and amber. At first spritz, it’s invigoratingly fresh, not unlike CK One, with a nostalgic ‘90s feel. It doesn’t lose that freshness as it dries down; instead, the green notes (fig, lavender, and olive tree accord) come to the fore. It’s reminiscent of warm air drifting through a garden at golden hour, when everything smells a little more alive. What I love is the comforting warmth it leaves on the skin hours later — that’ll be the all-encompassing amber. My partner and I fight over this fragrance — it’s genderless. This one lasts longer than any other in ‘Ôrebella’s lineup. ‘Ôrebella Window2Soul Eau de Parfum, $72 This is freshly showered skin, sun-dried laundry, and cool cotton sheets — though you wouldn’t guess it from the long list of lush notes. Think vanilla-esque tonka bean, rich damask rose, and intoxicating jasmine. That’s all balanced by a sprig of fresh mint and a squeeze of lemon, which cut through the richness and give it a clean, energizing lift. I love spritzing this on my neck and décolletage post-shower — it sets me up for the day. Better still, the moisturizing oils in the formula more or less double as a body serum. Genius. ‘Ôrebella Blooming Fire Eau de Parfum, $72 I’m calling it: Blooming Fire will be summer’s most viral scent. It captures that unmistakable feeling of spending all day at the beach, then heading back to the hotel, freshly showered, sitting on the balcony, waiting for your hair to dry while dipping into your snack haul. Sweet jasmine and Tahitian monoi — essentially gardenia petals soaked in coconut oil — give it a warm, sunscreen quality, while zingy bergamot adds freshness, and peppery clove evokes sun-drenched skin. As tempting as it is to bathe in this, I’m saving it for my upcoming vacations. Again, perfumer Clément Gavarry masterminded this one, and he has a special talent for creating the perfect skin scent. Phlur’s Vanilla Skin and Peach Skin are just a few of his creations, but if you ask me, Blooming Fire trumps them.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/cyclar-vitamin-c-body-oil-review-49445255",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes I think it's safe to say that Hailey Bieber has made a serious name for herself in the beauty space. After Rhode was acquired by E.l.f. for a whopping $1 billion, she's truly become the queen of glowing skin - a billion-dollar queen. And yes, our editors stand behind Rhode. I mean, have you tried the Barrier Butter? And let's not even talk about our obsession with the Peptide Lip Treatment. Knowing her skincare brand is top-tier and her recommendations are usually spot on (this eye mask is supposed to be amazing), I decided to take a cue from her rec book. Bieber recently posted on her Instagram Stories about her love for the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil ($38), mixed with the Naturium Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Butter, calling it her \"go-to body combo.\" So consider me influenced. I'm a Belieber . . . when it comes to anything Hailey recommends. And after testing this body oil for a solid few weeks, you guessed it: I'm sold. Actually, more than sold - I'll definitely be repurchasing. About the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil This product is a skincare-infused body oil, crafted with oil-soluble Vitamin C, ectoin, squalane, and antioxidant-rich oils. It promises to deliver luminous, even-toned skin without any greasy residue. Bieber uses the Vanilla Verve scent, but it's also available in Naked Neroli and Sacred Santal. What I Like About the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes As someone who loves the sun, keeping my skin hydrated is a non-negotiable. I'm outside constantly - whether I'm working (yes, I wrote this article under the sun), going for a run, or walking to my favorite restaurant or sunset spot, the outdoors gets a lot of face time with me. That's why I take my skincare seriously - not just for my face, but for my whole body. I look for nourishing, hydrating products that actually improve texture, not just sit on the surface. Enter: this body oil. I've tried my fair share of body oils over the years, but this one? It's become a staple. What sets it apart? For starters, it's not greasy like so many others. It sinks in beautifully and is packed with ingredients that truly support the skin. Think: multiple plant oils for deep hydration, Vitamin C for brightness, and Ectoin to help protect against environmental stressors. Oh, and the Vanilla Verve scent? It's divine - warm, subtle, and sweet without being overpowering. I get compliments on it every single time I wear it. And if that's not enough, Hailey Bieber herself says she's been using it since she was pregnant. Consider me fully convinced. How to Use the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes When it comes to using this oil, it couldn't be easier. Just pump out as much as you need to cover your body. If I'm showing my legs, I'll apply a bit there to enhance texture and add a dewy glow. But if I'm just lounging in pants, I'll stick to a light layer on my arms and chest. According to Cyklar's website, the best results come from applying it right after a shower, while your skin is still damp. So if you're in the mood for a post-shower lather that leaves your skin soft and radiant, this is one of your best bets. I've tried it both ways and honestly think it works great either way - even when I'm rushing out the door last minute. What to Consider Before Trying the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil While it definitely leaves your skin with a lit-from-within radiant glow, there's no shimmer or visibly glowy ingredient in the formula. The finish is very natural - almost subtly so. I love it for that reason, but if you're looking for something that noticeably enhances the look of your skin with visible shine or sparkle, you might want to opt for a different product (like this Summer Friday's one). Where to Buy the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil The Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil is available directly on the brand's website or on Amazon.

    "description": "Image Source: Lionel Hahn/Getty Images/ Karwai Tang/WireImage It's safe to say the May 28 news that e.l.f. Beauty is acquiring Hailey Bieber's brand Rhode for $1 billion rattled the beauty world. Whether you're a Rhode loyalist or someone who merely has a TikTok account and likes beauty, chances are you've heard of the massive impact this brand has had on the market. The deal itself shows its value: the partnership is the fastest sale of its size in beauty, and Rhode's valuation is likely due to the brand's equity and stock value, plus the fact that it routinely does over $200 million in sales each year since its 2022 launch. The move will also help facilitate Rhode's expansion into Sephora, making the brand more accessible than ever. As a beauty writer whose job it is to scour headlines, trending topics, and hot-button conversations, I was expecting to see endless reposts of this news with, of course, a combination of Bieber supporter and hate - such is the internet. What I wasn't expecting to see was Selena Gomez's name buzzing this morning on Google Trends and social media. While \"Rhode beauty sold,\" \"Rhode elf,\" and \"Hailey Bieber net worth\" made up the first three trending searches when you looked at topics related to \"beauty,\" \"Rare Beauty valuation\" was listed in spot four. \"Selena Gomez net worth\" was also trending this morning, seeing a 4,450 percent increase in search inquiries. People all over the internet are also comparing the success of the two beauty founders. Rare Beauty is successful, and Rhode is successful, and neither of those successes negates the other. I get it: headlines about these women have been circulating online for, what, nearly 10 years? But I think we can give it a rest now. Justin Bieber and Gomez broke up in March 2018, and a lot has happened since then. Yet, once again, comparisons between Gomez and Bieber continue. In an interview with PS in 2022, Bieber addressed this very issue head-on: \"I've struggled enough with comparison to other people, and I don't want that for this brand,\" she said. \"There is space for every woman to succeed and thrive in this industry. We don't need to compare brands, people, whatever it may be - that's something that's been very sensitive for me.\" Gomez's brand, Rare Beauty, has been a customer favorite since it launched in 2020, and its liquid blush has garnered a cult following. The brand is still going strong to this day and has since expanded into lip oils, perfumes, and more. Rare Beauty is successful, and Rhode is successful, and neither of those successes negates the other. Women are often pitted against each other, being forced to compare and contrast opportunities, successes, relationships, looks - you name it. But the beauty industry is vast, and there is more than enough room at the table for everyone. In fact, according to IBIS World, a business industry analysis website, there are over 5,000 cosmetic and beauty brands operating in the United States alone as of 2025. But fans who are nostalgic, bored, or just still heartbroken over an old relationship refuse to stop acting like these two women - and their brands - are dueling. According to Forbes, the beauty industry is valued at $570 billion in sales in 2023 per year (and that number has only gone up since then). Bottom line: one woman's success is not another's failure. There's no need to choose between clapping for Bieber on this iconic win and buying Rare Beauty's lip gloss. Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.
