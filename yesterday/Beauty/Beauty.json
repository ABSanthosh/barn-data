If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. As much as we love sniffing out the latest trending perfumes, many of them can be prohibitively expensive. A large bottle of Maison Francis Kurkdjian’s Baccarat Rouge 540, the It girl of designer perfumes, costs a whopping $665 — a third more than the average cost of a round-trip domestic flight in America. While a signature scent can be worth the investment to some people, many perfume lovers are turning to less costly alternatives, Take a look at the hashtag page for #dupes on TikTok, and you’ll find an overwhelming majority of top-viewed content is about cheaper versions of designer perfumes. This is exactly how we came to discover Oakcha perfumes. We’ve been seeing Oakcha’s lineup of affordable scents all over our FYP, many of them “inspired by” some of the most prolific luxury scents of the moment, including Parfums de Marly’s Delina, Le Labo’s Santal 33, and the aforementioned Baccarat Rouge 540. Creations from this New York-based brand are priced between $35 and $50, which are significantly more wallet-friendly compared to their designer counterparts. Oakcha also exclusively sells extrait de parfum, a good marker of longevity. According to Eudora Nwasike, a certified fragrance specialist, extrait de parfum has the highest perfume oil concentration of around 20% to 40% (in Oakcha’s case, the concentration is 30%). They can last longer on the skin compared to eau de parfum, which typically has a concentration of 15% to 20%. Naturally, we had to smell them for ourselves. We rounded up a team of R29 editors and perfume experts — who happen to own the OG scents — to give Oakcha’s bestselling ones a sniff. Let’s just say that we were pleasantly surprised… DashDividers_1_500x100 Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum The designer: Chanel Coco Mademoiselle Eau de Parfum, $143 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Oakcha Senora, $30 for 1.7 oz “Chanel’s Coco Mademoiselle is a timeless classic and my personal ‘good luck perfume’: I’ve worn it to many job interviews and important life events over the years. There’s something unique about the blend of mandarin, orange blossoms, jasmine, and patchouli that never fails to make me walk with a little more confidence. “I was on my very last drop of Coco Mademoiselle when I encountered Senora, Oakcha’s budget-friendly dupe. It opens with a striking similarity to the original, offering that same vibrant burst of citrus and floral notes. The DNA is pretty much identical, but I would say that it has a slightly more intense floral profile, while the original skews more fruity. The dry down diverges from the original, but the scent impressed me by how long it stayed on my clothes. The value-for-money is unbelievable, and I will happily use this as my Chanel replacement for the time being.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum The designer: Burberry Goddess Eau de Parfum, $138 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Oakcha Silent Melody, $40 for 1.7 oz “Burberry’s Goddess is a floral-vanilla scent that makes you feel like you’re wrapped in a luxurious cashmere blanket. Weaving together warm vanilla, aromatic lavender, and a hint of spicy ginger, it’s by far one of the most sophisticated gourmands I’ve tried — and is the furthest thing from smelling like a sugary cupcake. “Silent Melody is a remarkably faithful interpretation that captures the essence of its high-end counterpart at a fraction of the cost. While it may not boast the same sillage (diffusion of the scent as you move around) or longevity, it pretty much mirrors the original’s nuanced blend of notes. The cocoa is a touch stronger than the original, creating a super yummy profile when combined with vanilla absolute at the base. I love wearing Silent Melody to bed; it’s lovely to get wafts of this inviting scent when I’m tossing and turning at night. The best part? I don’t have to be precious with my spritzes, given its very reasonable price.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540 The designer: Maison Francis Kurkdjian Baccarat Rouge 540, $335 for 2.4 oz The dupe: Oakcha Sweven, $69 $50 for 1.7 oz “In recent years, Baccarat Rouge 540 has earned itself Chanel No.5-level fame. I firmly believe that it will go down in history as one of the best perfumes ever. Fir resin and cedarwood give it a vibrant, sparkling quality, while amber, saffron and jasmine make it warm and cozy. It’s my most complimented perfume, so it’s safe to say that I was more than keen to see how Oakcha’s version would compare — especially as it’s a snip of the price. “At first spritz, Sweven smells like Baccarat Rouge and… burnt plastic. I will say that it’s better when you wear it in — and it’s far nicer on clothes than my skin. I sprayed it onto my dress, and as it wore off, I caught whiffs of it throughout the day; it wasn’t too dissimilar to its designer counterpart. At one point, I questioned whether I’d mistakenly spritzed the original on my dress previously. It boasts the same woody notes and an element of warmth thanks to amber and saffron, but up close and personal, it’s got nothing on Baccarat, which sticks around forever. There’s a winter coat hanging in my wardrobe that still smells of the stuff!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Deputy Beauty Director Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Le Labo Santal 33 The designer: Le Labo Santal 33, $235 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Oakcha Ruhe, $50 $37.50 for 1.7 oz “If I had to pick a signature scent for myself, it would be Le Labo’s Santal 33. I know every millennial living in Brooklyn wears it, but it’s just the right mix of smoky, woodsy, and spicy for me. It’s not floral or sweet, and it doesn’t smell super traditionally feminine or masculine, which I think is why this fragrance has become so universally loved. At first spray, I found Oakcha’s Ruhe so similar to Santal 33, but when I applied it to my skin, it seemed a touch more fruity; I almost caught a whiff of melon. “The overall fragrance definitely seems lighter to me, and didn’t quite have the richness of Santal 33. Considering the scent is still so close, these subtle differences didn’t bother me much, but I did notice Ruhe wore differently throughout the day and didn’t have the same staying power and seemed to develop into something slightly more floral. Although I think I’ll be sticking with my Le Labo, this is a great and much more cost effective option. Alternatively, I can see someone loving this for daytime if they feel Santal 33 is too heavy for their tastes.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Kilian Love, Don’t Be Shy The designer: Kilian Love, Don’t Be Shy, $295 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Oakcha Sweet Addict, $45 for 1.7 oz “Love, Don’t Be Shy quickly grew to become Kilian’s hero perfume when it was revealed to be Rihanna’s signature scent. In addition to this, perfumes that will make the wearer smell extremely sweet, addictive, and irresistible — the effects of a gourmand scent — have been gaining popularity in recent years. I must say that Oakcha hit it out of the park with Sweet Addict. I was shocked at how similar it is to the original; in fact, it smells stronger on my skin. The fluffiness of the marshmallow, combined with the sweetness of honeysuckle and vanilla, gives the fragrance a playful element. “I was surprised and impressed by the longevity of Sweet Addict: It lasted a total of eight hours on my skin, whilst Kilian’s Love, Don’t Be Shy lasted five hours. The scent had moderate projection [ how much it radiates from you], and I’d catch whiffs of the scent on me throughout the day. For $45, this is an exceptional dupe of the original and ideal if you want to smell good on a budget.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance Foundation Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium The designer: Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium, $130 for 1.6 oz The dupe: Oakcha Midnight Nymph, $35 for 1.7 oz “Black Opium is my go-to scent for a girls’ night out. It’s sexy, unique, and gives major bad bitch — or dare I say, brat — energy. The black, glittery bottle looks gorgeous IRL, and the warm, spicy notes of saffron, sandalwood, and orange blossom don’t smell ‘perfume-y’ — you just feel like you naturally smell amazing when wearing it. I found Midnight Nymph to be shockingly similar to Black Opium. Truthfully, I’m not 100% confident I can tell the two apart in a blind test. The warm, sensual woody notes really come through in the Oakcha version, and I loved that it lasted a few hours on my skin. For nearly $100 less than the YSL original, it’ll be very tempting to replace it with the Oakcha version if and when I run out of my bottle.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Parfums de Marly Delina Eau de Parfum The designer: Parfums de Marly Delina Eau de Parfum, $220 for 1.0 oz The dupe: Oakcha Madame Rose, $45 for 1.7 oz “The moment I smelled Delina, I knew I had to have it. The fragrance had gone viral long before then, of course, thanks to TikTok — but it’s entirely deserving of the hype. It opens with a punchy rose note that’s lush and fresh as opposed to old fashioned, but it’s the addition of syrupy rhubarb and zingy bergamot that make this so moreish. It makes me feel feminine in a powerful way. I didn’t believe it would be possible to dupe something as unique as Delina, but this is absolutely spot on. I couldn’t tell the difference one bit, and that shocked me considering the enormous price difference. “Madame Rose boasts the same striking rose and rhubarb notes that are so unmistakably Delina, but once it dries down, it becomes a little sweeter than its designer counterpart, which retains the tarte-ness from the citrusy bergamot. This, I think, is what makes Delina so distinctive; it’s more nuanced. When it comes to staying power, though, there isn’t much difference between them. I tested both on my skin and clothes and my jacket still smelled strongly of Madame Rose even days later — just like Delina. All in all, this is probably the closest ‘dupe’ I’ve ever tried.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Deputy Beauty Director Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Tom Ford Lost Cherry The designer: Tom Ford Lost Cherry, $405 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Oakcha Sinful, $50 for 1,7 oz “Lost Cherry is massively popular because it’s an edgy perfume. Most cherry fragrances tend to be overly sweet or too playful, but with Tom Ford’s iteration, you get a mature, intriguing, and sophisticated scent thanks to cherry liqueur that wonderfully compliments the juiciness of the fruit. In Sinful, I noticed the boozier notes are not prominent on my skin when I compared both side by side. Sinful accentuates the nuttiness of the cherry with woodsier base notes [vetiver, sandalwood, cedarwood], which I actually preferred. The scent lasted for six hours on my skin, and sat closer to my skin as the fragrance dried down, creating an intimate scent bubble around me. The staying power was more impressive than Lost Cherry. For a price point of $50, that’s pretty exceptional.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance Foundation Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Creed Aventus For Her The designer: Creed Aventus For Her, $300 for 1 oz The dupe: Oakcha Akimbo, $50 for 1.7 oz “I call Aventus For Her my ‘rich auntie’ perfume, since it’s the kind of scent I’d always picture myself wearing as a grown up. Fresh, floral, and woodsy is a combination I can never get enough of, and this sophisticated perfume offers exactly that. It develops into something fruitier over time, with refreshing hints of sweet peach, pineapple, and green apple. I’d say that Akimbo, Oakcha’s copycat iteration, is about 85% on point. You smell the pineapple and green apple notes right away, but they are a bit too overpowering and cloying in this case, and you don’t get as much of the amber, rose, and ylang ylang notes compared to the original. It does have a lovely projection and you can smell it from a distance. Overall, Aventus For Her edges out Akimbo for me as I prefer how the former interacts on my skin and it’s a bit more complex. But given Akimbo offers great value-for-money, I’m going to use it as an everyday stand-in and save my Creed for special occasions.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Byredo Gypsy Water The designer: Byredo Gypsy Water, $225 for 1.6 oz The dupe: Oakcha Morning Rain, $45 for 1.7 oz “Byredo’s Gypsy Water is my all-time favorite unisex scent. It has that rare alchemy of refreshing, creamy, and woodsy notes that smell interesting on both me and my partner, albeit in different ways. On him, the scent reminds me of a sharp gin and tonic — the juniper and pine notes immediately jump out — while it has a more subtle profile on my skin. I would say that Oakcha’s Morning Rain is like a more palatable younger sibling to Gypsy Water. While you can still detect the citrusy and leafy top notes, the vanilla, amber, and sandalwood base is more prominent, making this a muskier and warmer experience. I would even say that Morning Rain has a lovelier initial blast compared to the original, since it smells less alcoholic to my nose. I do find that it requires a few more sprays to get my desired level of sillage. But given this retails for less than a quarter of Byredo’s price tag, I feel rather comfortable dousing myself in the perfume. My partner also loves it, so I’m certain we’ll go through the whole bottle in no time.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Shop Oakcha DashDividers_1_500x100 Valentino Donna Born In Roma The designer: Valentino Donna Born In Roma, $135 for 1.7 oz The dupe: Oakcha Love In Rome, $35 for 1.7 oz “Born In Roma is my favorite summer daytime scent. I love it so much, I actually got the Uomo Born In Roma cologne for my fiancé so we can match on date nights. Needless to say, I was pretty familiar with it going into my test with Oakcha’s very similarly named Love In Rome, which boasted similar notes of blackcurrant, jasmine, and bourbon vanilla. While it has a similarly light, bright impression, Oakcha’s Love In Rome was overall more saccharine, bordering on powdery on my skin. It had pretty decent staying power, but the dry down had less of the fruity floral kick that I love from Valentino’s. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing if you love sweet scents, but definitely a point of differentiation to take note of.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Shop Oakcha Like what you see?

    "description": "The first time I realized I had crooked teeth, I was 15. My then-boyfriend zoomed in on a photo of me to highlight the gap between my front teeth and how the disjointedness made my smile lopsided. That weekend, my mouth joined the excruciating list of hyperfixations — along with my arms, my stomach, and the acne on my forehead — sending me into a spiral of internal cringe. At some point in the last decade, my smile grew less toothy and more self consciously tight-lipped. I wear a retainer every night and have come frighteningly close to getting Invisalign.  At the start of 2025, as I oscillated between should-I-or-shouldn’t-I, a tweet appeared on my algorithm: A photo of Ayo Edebiri and Margaret Qualley grinning — their teeth on full display — with the caption: “Teeth are so back.” I wasn’t the only one who felt seen; it had nearly 40K likes and over 15K retweets from others giddy to be free from the pressure of shiny, white, and perfectly-straight teeth. Relief washed over me as I read the replies celebrating the return of ‘normal’ teeth: “Win for the normies”, “Big day for girls with big beautiful smiles,” and numerous iterations of “slay” filled the comments.   teeth are so back pic.twitter.com/cTdGtadrze— ijbol adjani (@MOULlNR0UGE) January 6, 2025 Happily, the imperfect teeth renaissance has only gained momentum in recent months, with more celebrities embracing lopsided smiles. Its poster child? Actor Aimee Lou Wood who is currently playing free-spirited Chelsea in The White Lotus season three. In the first episode, Wood’s character is complimented on her unforgettable teeth. Off-screen, she has spoken about overcoming anxieties about her smile and resisting braces. Bong Joon Ho’s sci-fi comedy Mickey 17 further fuelled the pro-teeth movement with a full cast sporting wonky fangs. Online, fans are admiring protagonists Robert Pattinson and Naomi Ackie’s tooth gaps with one X user declaring, “tooth gap enjoyers, we are so back.”  Seeing famous figures stray from conventional beauty standards feels like a statement. They have the resources for the best dental care, yet they choose to keep this perceived ‘flaw’ unchanged.  If you’re taken aback by this highly anticipated return to ‘normal’ teeth and are wondering what replaced them in the first instance, let me introduce you to the world of veneers. In this cosmetic dental procedure, natural teeth are shaved down and fitted with custom-made porcelain or resin shells to improve the appearance of the smile and smooth out any imperfections. Cardi B, JoJo Siwa, Hilary Duff, and Doja Cat are a handful of celebrities who have publicly acknowledged theirs. While veneers aren’t new — the first pair was created by California dentist Charles Pincus in 1928 to temporarily cover actors’ teeth during filming — the industry has developed into a different monster in recent years. What was once reserved for camera-facing celebrities has grown into a global phenomenon, fueling insecurities while making everyone’s teeth appear white, straight, and uniform. According to GII Research, the global cosmetic dentistry market is projected to reach $37.5 billion by 2030. London-based periodontist and gum specialist Dr. Reena Wadia credits the boom to the pandemic, specifically the increased time spent on Zoom. “Since [then], people have become more conscious of their teeth, willing to invest in the best procedures for the aesthetic appeal and overall oral health,” she says, noting that it has driven the desire for self-optimization, making perfectly aligned teeth a common goal.  It’s no surprise that celebrities like Edebiri, Wood and Qualley keeping their natural teeth has been reassuring for many of us. Seeing famous figures stray from conventional beauty standards feels like a statement — they have the resources for the best dental care, yet they choose to keep this perceived “flaw” unchanged.  For Megan Hayward, 27,  the shift towards embracing natural smiles feels personal and empowering: “I have ‘buck’ teeth with ​​quite a prominent gap, and that’s probably the first thing someone notices about me,” Hayward tells me. “Seeing Aimee Lou Wood praised on TikTok for her natural teeth makes me hopeful that having a non-conformist, distinct look will gain popularity again.” Growing up, Hayward hated her school photos because she tried to smile without showing her teeth. Now, to reclaim her full grin, Hayward shares photos of food that she has bitten into to rate the uneven teeth marks left behind. “Babybels are a 10/10 for tooth gap impressions,” she jokes. Similarly, Natalie Sima, 31, has considered veneers for years: “I saw the before-and-after photos of Kylie Jenner’s teeth and wanted the same,” she says, even exploring dental finance options. Sima says that she was ready to spend her savings — until she watched The Bear. “I am obsessed with Ayo Edebiri,” says Sima. “She may single-handedly change my opinion on what ‘perfect’ teeth look like.”  This emphatic appreciation for Edebiri and Wood highlights our growing desire for authentic representation in popular media. Instead of cookie-cutter, flawless beauty, we want to see more people who look like us on screen. This raises the question: Is it finally time for natural teeth to take the spotlight? With famous people happy to have unaltered smiles, do we mere mortals now have the validation to accept our big gaps and lopsided grins, too?  If you’re thin and your skin is clear and youthful, you can have crooked teeth; the slight imperfection may even seem charming. But would you still celebrate natural, uneven teeth if they belonged to a poor, fat person?Jessica DeFino It might depend on who you are. It’s paramount to recognize that the celebrities praised for their imperfect teeth are optimized in almost every other way. They exude success and benefit from pretty privilege. Jessica DeFino, the writer behind the Substack The Review of Beauty, tells me, “We often misunderstand beauty standards as one static [ideal], but it is a set of parameters, and people have permission to deviate a little.” DeFino adds, “If you’re thin and your skin is clear and youthful, you can have crooked teeth; the slight imperfection may even seem charming.” But she asks, “Would you still celebrate natural, uneven teeth if they belonged to a poor, fat person?”  DeFino compares this carefully manufactured double standard to Tyra Banks’ infamous “Flawsome” ideology. In the early 2010s, while hosting America’s Next Top Model, Banks encouraged contestants to see their unique features as assets, insisting that their flaws make them awesome. “Of course, this one weird quirk made a model marketable only if she ticked the boxes on other variables like body type, height and skin,” explains DeFino.  The timing of this shift toward big teeth is equally compelling. As we reach peak “Instagram face” — where easy access to fillers and Botox has created a homogenized appearance among celebrities, influencers, and everyday people —  the elite are seeking to distinguish themselves. In the past, only a select few could afford veneers or Invisalign, making perfectly straight and white teeth aspirational.  As cheap dental tourism rises, more people are seeking affordable options for teeth implants in places like Turkey and Latin America. In the US, porcelain veneers can cost upwards of $900 per tooth, whereas a full set of implants might cost you $4,000 in Turkey. For those hesitant to fly abroad, a surge of buy now, pay later options are making cosmetic dentistry even more attractive and attainable. “Many private clinics now offer interest-free dental financing where patients can spread the payment across 10 or even 24 months, which is becoming popular among younger people,” says Dr. Wadia.  If I embrace my tooth gap as trendy today, the tide could change tomorrow, and no one will show me the same grace as Ayo Edebiri or Aimee Lou Wood.Natalie Sima Interestingly, the once-exclusive appeal of dental implants is fading in favor of unique, natural-looking teeth. Polished white teeth — often associated with new money — are increasingly seen as a sign of conformity, while those with greater means tend to favor a more understated approach to beauty. This divide is particularly evident in the response to reality stars’ cosmetic dental surgeries; after all, these contestants are often seen as occupying the lowest rung of stardom. In 2024, Love Island star Tiffany Leighton was brutally trolled for her shiny white veneers, while former contestant Sam Gowland also debuted flashy dental implants, which people decried as “piano keys”.  Dr. Sepideh Jalal Jalali, dentist and clinical director at The Tooth Club, reminds us that this critique does not imply the end of veneers, merely the end of implants as we know them: “As dental work becomes more common, there is a growing demand among high-profile clients for the ‘invisible treatment,’” she says. “The days of ultra-white, high-shine veneers are over. Now people want veneers that look untouched, healthy and natural,” she adds. Dr. Jalali notes that translucent ceramics, which seamlessly mimic the real enamel with soft, curved edges, are seeing more takers. “We are now using 3D scanning, AI smile simulations, and digital mock-ups, so both the client and I can see a preview and have more control over the process to ensure they are getting what they want,” explains Dr. Jalali. While the natural teeth renaissance is in full swing, trends are cyclical, and pearly white, straight teeth could make a comeback. Dr. Jalali is hopeful that personalized teeth will continue to gain momentum but warns that “the beauty standard is always changing,” so it might be wise not to commit to anything too permanent. Sima shares similar concerns: “If I embrace my tooth gap as trendy today, the tide could change tomorrow, and no one will show me the same grace as Ayo or Aimee,” she says. I can’t help but resonate with Sima’s fear. While it’s inspiring to see celebrities wear their natural teeth with pride, it’s hard to overlook how distant that glamorous context feels from my own reality. What happens when, or rather if, natural teeth fall out of fashion again? It’s a crucial reminder that teeth aren’t just for aesthetics; they’re essential for our overall health and function. In our pursuit of beauty, we must remember that veneers are irreversible — once teeth are shaved down, they have to be covered. Whether perfect teeth are in or out, the truth is that rigid beauty standards continue to influence how we view ourselves and others. As such, DeFino is cautious about prematurely celebrating the return of natural, wonky teeth: “For teeth to truly make a ‘comeback’, we need to think critically about why we are charmed by this feature and who we see it on, not to mention how much we’re willing to accept deviations from what is expected,” she says. Without these conversations, DeFino suggests that the trend will simply be a fleeting moment, failing to foster real acceptance and diversity in beauty.  Now, if you ask me whether I have finally booked an appointment with my dentist or if I plan to, the answer is a cautiously optimistic nope. A part of me still wonders how relieved I would feel if I gave in to Invisalign — how dreamy it would be to get tagged in a selfie and not be taken aback by my overbite. In all honesty, I don’t know, and for now, I’m okay with that.  I may not have wholeheartedly accepted my natural teeth, and I’m also fairly certain that straight, white teeth will continue to be the gold standard among celebrities and plenty of regular folks. But I’ve decided to stop overthinking it. Maybe I’ll make like Hayward and rate my tooth impressions for fun. Either way, the plan is to approach this with less angst and more lightheartedness. This brings me to a giddy thought: If I’m not spending $6,000 on teeth correction, does that mean, according to the sacred rules of girl math, that I’m rich?

    "description": "Viral skin-care hacks and products are so plentiful that it's almost impossible to discern which ones are actually worth your time, energy, and money (thank you, TikTok). However, occasionally, a product breaks through the noise and actually lives up to the hype. Case in point: the viral Qure Micro Infusion System ($119), which yields glowy, even-toned skin and supercharges your entire skin-care routine. Plus, you can opt for a month supply option: a Qure Micro Infusion System 3 Month Supply ($149, originally $357), which is nearly 60 percent off. Celebrity aesthetician Shani Darden swears by Qure's Micro-Infusion System so much that it has become a staple in her personal routine. It's also endorsed by top dermatologists Dr. Dendy Engelman and Dr. Muneeb Shah. As a beauty editor who tries products and treatments for a living, I'm sometimes cautious about at-home treatments that mimic in-office procedures. But since this one has earned the seal of approval from numerous pros, I was game to test it out. Before I get into the specifics of Qure's Micro-Infusion System and what happened when I tried it, it's important to note that needles are involved in this at-home treatment. Contrary to what you may think, it's extremely different from using a derma roller or at-home microneedling, which has earned mixed reviews. While both help skin-care ingredients penetrate deeper and spur collagen production by creating little microtears in the skin, the improper use of derma rollers (rolling needles) can damage skin, while micro-infusion uses a stamping method with sterile, delicate needles. This method prevents skin damage caused by blunt needles and inadequate technique. Even if you've never used an at-home micro-infusion system, there's no need to worry about damaging your skin or doing it incorrectly. With this system, you can safely transform your complexion at home. About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Customizable to your skin needs – there's a system to tackle dark spots and uneven skin tone, and another one for fine lines and wrinkles. A safe, at-home microneedling-like product that \"stamps\" your skin with 24K gold 0.5mm needles that are thinner than human hair. Virtually painless and with minimal-to-no downtime. Infuses the skin with active ingredients through microchannels. Helps to boost hydration for a plump and dewy appearance. Reduces the appearance of fine lines, pores, and dark spots. What I Like About the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Even though it sounds complicated, Qure's Micro-Infusion System is easy to use: The instructions are clear and the system comes with disposable microneedles to ensure your tools are new and sterile with each use. Additionally, in-office microneedling and Aquagold (an in-office micro-infusion treatment) can run you hundreds of dollars a visit, while the Qure Micro-Infusion System is cost-effective and provides comparable results. I like to use the system before bed and love that it takes less than 10 minutes - perfect for a busy schedule, especially if you can't spare the time (let alone the money) to go for an in-office treatment. How to Use the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System The system consists of four easy steps and comes with six serum concentrates and replaceable needle heads. Step one involves filling the chamber of the device (where the serum is housed) with the serum concentrate that will be micro-infused into your skin. For the second step, turn the chamber upside down for one to two minutes to allow the serum to seep into the needles. I advise washing your face at this time so that it's nice and clean. Next, remove the lid from the microneedles and begin infusing the serum into your skin with a stamping motion. Start at the center of your face and work your way around, exhibiting care to cover all areas of your face. Though it's best to start off with one pass, if you feel that your skin can handle it (and if you're gentle enough), you can pass twice over areas that you may have missed or want to treat again. If you choose to use the needles around your eyes, be extra cautious and gentle. Finally, place the lid back on the needle head, twist it off, and dispose of it. You will use a new needle head for your next treatment. If you have any leftover serum, which you probably will, gently pat it on your face and neck and allow it to absorb overnight. Follow with your favorite gentle moisturizer and then clean out the chamber and discard any remaining serum. Darden recommends stamping with 50 percent overlap to ensure that you cover every area of your face. Qure recommends harnessing the treatment every two weeks, with full results shown after three uses. However, I noticed significant results a day or two after a single treatment. As with any skin care, the more consistent you are, the more benefits you'll accrue from the system over time. What to Consider Before Trying the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System It's important to consider if you'll actually be consistent with the treatment in order to see the best results possible. Additionally, since there are needles involved (granted, they are thinner than human hair), there's an element of discomfort with the treatment: It's minimal but still present. When you first start using it, you'll feel a slight pricking feeling as the device goes into your skin. If needles on any level make you feel uncomfortable, micro-infusion may not be for you. You may also experience some slight redness afterward. Steer clear of using the system if your skin is currently irritated or sensitized, and avoid using it on active acne. You also don't want to apply chemical exfoliants or other harsh topical products immediately after using it. Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Worth the Splurge? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is absolutely worth the splurge, whether you want to maximize your existing skin-care routine or prepare for a special occasion. The results are blatant - my glow after using the treatment speaks for itself. You'll notice hydrated, radiant, and healthy-looking skin. Where Is the Qure Skincare Micro-Infusion System Available? Qure Skincare's Micro-Infusion System is available at QureSkincare.com.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/heal-dry-skin-eyelids-48119307",
    "description": "The only thing more persistent than dry skin is those 15-second insurance company ads at the beginning of YouTube videos you're not allowed to skip. You can try to avoid them (or it, if we're talking about dry skin) but they will undoubtedly pop up again. While you might come to expect parched, flaky skin, dryness on your eyelids is a different story. It's the kind of skin-care dilemma that makes you say to yourself in the bathroom mirror \"Seriously?\" as you assess the damage. Dry eyelid skin can be itchy and uncomfortable, can make achieving a smooth makeup application nearly impossible, and is hard to treat due to its less-than-ideal location. (Is it even safe to put a normal face moisturizer on your eyelids?!) We're sharing how to heal dry patches on your eyelids and determine if it's just a regular case of the winter blues or due to a chronic condition like eczema. Experts Featured in This Article Angela J. Lamb, MD, is an associate professor of dermatology at Mount Sinai in New York. What Causes Dry Skin on Eyelids? Genetics, environmental factors, beauty products, and lifestyle factors can all contribute to dry skin on your eyelids - flakey skin on your eyelids can be triggered by a number of things, just as dryness anywhere else on your body. \"Often in the winter, it is eyelid eczema or just common dry skin,\" professor of dermatology Angela J. Lamb, MD, says. \"Often eczema is more chronic and doesn't respond as well to thicker moisturizers. Some of the most common symptoms of eczema include red and inflamed skin, an itchy rash, [and] dark-colored patches.\" If you're unsure, the best way to determine whether you have eczema or just regular dry skin is to see a dermatologist. Dry skin on your eyelids is such a common issue, even those who usually have an oily or normal skin type can experience it. This is because the skin around your eyes is the thinnest on your entire body. \"The eyelids are particularly vulnerable to the harsh weather conditions,\" says Dr. Lamb. \"Particularly, the skin around this area is thin, so it's difficult to protect from the different elements.\" How to Treat Dry Skin on Eyelids So, what's the best way to treat it and what products can you put on eyelids? Dr. Lamb recommends applying cortisone (something you probably already have tucked away in your medicine cabinet) several times throughout the day for extreme cases and eczema. \"Using a plain moisturizer [that's] fragrance-free, suitable for sensitive skin, and paraben-free is definitely something that you should opt for,\" she sys. It also doesn't hurt to look for additional ways to add moisture into your routine, like by incorporating a hyaluronic acid serum and switching your cleanser out for a hydrating formula in the winter or whenever you're experiencing dryness.
