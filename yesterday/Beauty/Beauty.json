    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/best-led-light-face-masks?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "In the annals of popular beauty Instagram posts, selfies with LED light therapy masks have become as time-honored as swatch-loaded arms and pigment-mixing videos. But aside from providing Jason Voorhees-from-the-future photo ops, LED light therapy masks promise a more lasting impression: glowy skin with less acne.The technology has been around for decades and is commonly used by dermatologists and estheticians as an in-office treatment to help reduce inflammation after facials, minimize breakouts, and give an overall boost. “LED light is one of my absolute favorite treatments because it boosts collagen in the skin, minimizes fine lines and wrinkles, speeds up healing, and increases circulation to give you an amazing glow,” says celebrity esthetician Shani Darden. “Blue LED light kills acne-causing bacteria to clear up existing breakouts and prevent new ones from forming.”But ever since stars like Jessica Alba (who happens to be Darden’s longtime client) started posting LED mask selfies from their own facial appointments back in 2016, the drive for at-home light therapy treatment has picked up steam, with countless devices of widely-varying price points and quality popping up for sale on Amazon, Sephora, and other retailers. Plastic LED masks made for home use may now be readily available, but how do they compare with heavy-duty machines used in the offices of the pros?“Models in medi spas, which cover the whole face, are effective, and usually the treatment takes half an hour, making them good add-ons with a facial,” says Gabriel Chiu, M.D., a Beverly Hills-based plastic and reconstructive surgeon. That said, even light therapy treatments administered by pros don’t offer instant results, notes New York-based dermatologist Joshua Zeichner, M.D.: “It takes several weeks of continuous use to achieve skin improvements with light-based treatments.” Both doctors stress that LED masks for at-home use are typically less powerful, and, therefore, less effective than what you might get in an office. “For LED light therapy to work, it has to be applied for at least half an hour over any area,” says Dr. Chiu. The catch? Many of the at-home devices are made to be used just 10 minutes at a time. “Realistically, at-home devices are not being used for the proper amount of time to be effective,” Dr. Chiu confirms. While LED masks may not kill the degree of acne-causing bacteria or stimulate collagen at the rate an in-office treatment might, Dr. Zeichner says there may still be benefits to lighting up at home: “At-home devices can give modest improvements and are most beneficial for people with modest or mild skin challenges. They're also useful as maintenance between professional laser treatments done in an office and can typically be used alongside traditional topical creams.” Still, the derm warns LED light therapy isn't for everyone, as people with sensitive skin or rosacea are often not advised to undergo the treatment, as well as those who are prone to hyperpigmentation or melasma. He suggests people chat with their derm before making a DIY light therapy treatment plan at home.If you're ready to take the LED plunge, selecting the right device is crucial. “Unfortunately, many of the devices on the market do not have adequate data to prove their effectiveness. My best recommendation is to stick to trusted brands who have published data,” Dr. Zeichner says. “The good news is that the energy level of most of the at-home devices is relatively low, and they have almost no side effects — so the only harm to using them is to your pocketbook.”For her part, Darden relies on the Deesse Pro mask, which uses a robust 770 LED lights and costs a whopping $1,700. (Though you can get it on sale right now for 15% off.) “The more affordable LED masks on the market do not contain this many lights,” she says. “The strength of the lights, as well as the quantity, has a huge impact on how effective the mask is.” Although in-office treatments are ideal, few of us are working with a celebrity-sized bankroll to get them on the regular. At-home LED masks are not only more budget-friendly, but many have clinical research and third-party testing to back them up. Keep reading to find the best options, including several on sale. At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff. All of our market picks are independently selected and curated by the editorial team.

It’s no wonder why the mask is popular with celebrity facialists. Stars like Jessica Chastain, Mindy Kaling, Quinta Brunson, and Lili Reinhart have all used it during awards season to get their red carpet glow.Shop Omnilux Omnilux Contour Face, $, available at OmniluxTheraBody TheraFace MaskThe makers of Therabody are behind this LED mask, which uses three wavelength options to treat wrinkles, acne, dark spots, and more. It also features a 15-minute vibrating massage option for extra stress relief.  Shop NordstromTherabody TheraFace Mask, $, available at NordstromDr. Dennis Gross Skincare SpectraLite Faceware ProThis mask is made of a more substantial molded plastic that fits snugly on the face (rather than hovering over it from a distance) and features more LED lights (162 in all) than other masks we tried. The treatment itself — a quick three minutes under a choice of red, blue, or a combination of red and blue lights — didn't emit a slight warming sensation like the other two devices (likely thanks to a layer of silicone that separates the lights from the mask), and ultra-bright light didn't creep into our field of vision. Shop NordstromDr. Dennis Gross SpectraLite™ FaceWare Pro, $, available at Nordstrom15% Off PRO by Déesse PROThe original LED light therapy mask loved by Darden uses four different wavelengths for six treatment modes to help with everything from breakouts to bruising and every skin concern in between.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/Holiday-Nail-Art-45521288",
    "description": "For most people, one of the best things about the holidays is dressing up in a fancy outfit. However, for beauty enthusiasts, the star of the show is either the holiday-themed makeup or the accompanying nail art. But just because you're partial to festive holiday nails doesn't necessarily mean you prefer tinsel designs, an ugly-sweater-inspired manicure, or Christmas tree nails. In fact, we're here to prove that holiday nail art doesn't have to be cheesy to be cute. (Although, for the record, we'd call Christmas tree nails anything but cheesy.) We're in a new age of creativity led by stellar nail technicians. Holiday nail designs can range anywhere from chic candy-cane swirls to Santa-hat nail-art designs, ombré polish with mistletoe, and even subtle snowflake nails. No matter where you decide to take it, there's an option for you. If you want to keep it classy, graphic lines and glitter finishes are the way to go. If you're looking to step it up a notch, cashmere and crystal nails are as stylish as they are cool. Winter nail art is beyond any specific holiday, so don't be afraid to experiment with the entire cozy aesthetic of the season. Ahead, we've rounded up the chicest holiday nail ideas that will have you celebrating tastefully. Related: Sweater Nail Art Is the Coziest Winter Trend So Far",

    "title": "Pisces Tattoo Ideas For the Zodiac Lover In Your Life",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/pisces-tattoo-ideas-49315825",
    "description": "If you're a Pisces, you've likely been told - in the kindest way possible, of course - that you need to get back to reality numerous times throughout your life. Still, for those who fall under the twelfth and last astrological sign in the zodiac, your ability to see beyond your current circumstances is your superpower. It's the reason you are one of the most creative signs there is. From dominating the music industry (hello there, Queen Latifah) to starring in some of our favorite movies (looking at you, Lupita Nyong'o), Pisces is one of the most multi-faceted signs of the zodiac. Born between February 19 and March 20, on one hand, Pisceans are typically described as highly emotional and very intuitive. On the other, this ability to daydream might cause some people to label them as escapists. Regardless, we like to see them as creative visionaries, which is why they'd likely be the zodiac sign most open to getting some new body art. Pisces tattoos can range from straightforward zodiac designs to more abstract interpretations of the sign's constellation. Notable celebrities have added their own special touches to their Pisces tattoo designs (see Rihanna's interpretation of the zodiac sign behind her ear), and if you like to buck against the norm, their collections can be a great starting point when ideating your own Pisces tattoo ideas. Whether you're a fan of more unconventional designs, like to incorporate spiritual elements, or just want something small and dainty, ahead, find some of the best examples that you can add to your collection, like Pisces constellation tattoos and Pisces symbol tattoos.",
