    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/higherdose-red-light-hat-review-49430989",
    "description": "From infrared sauna blankets to recovery mats, HigherDose has earned cult status for innovative wellness tech that actually works. I was fed an advertisement for its Red Light Therapy Hat ($449), and halted mid-scroll: \"Go into the light, Alana,\" it beckoned. Red light therapy harnesses low levels of red light to increase mitochondria in our cells, triggering repairs, improving circulation, and reducing inflammation. A clinical study demonstrated red light therapy on the scalp yielded 37 percent hair regrowth for women, while another trial produced a 35 percent increase for men. Numerous others support these findings, so in other words, red light therapy for hair regrowth is no joke. If you've experienced hair loss, you may have contemplated red light therapy and found products that resemble cartoon brain drains. If the sheer humiliation and confusion of those products puts you off, let the HigherDose Red Light Therapy Hat seduce you. The minimalist black cap doesn't scream, \"My hair is falling out!\" More like, \"I'm chic, tech-savvy, and also smart enough to stimulate my scalp.\" All you need for treatment is 10 minutes daily under the hands-free hat. I struggle with designating 10 minutes a day to toning exercises and online shopping returns. But for the chance at a fuller head of hair, could I bear it? And more importantly, would the HigherDose Red Light Therapy Hat work on my anemic ends? About the HigherDose Red Light Hat The device boasts 650 nanometers of red light and 120 medical-grade LED diodes to stimulate blood circulation to the scalp. The hat is cordless, which allows for on-the-go use. It's intended for daily use and shuts off automatically after a 10-minutes treatment. What I Like About the HigherDose Red Light Hat As a seasoned (read: geriatric) beauty editor, I'm well-versed in at-home devices and machines. The following typically ensues: initial excitement and detailed visualization of use before shoving the device in my bathroom closet to languish till the end of time. It's not that I don't enjoy the results: it's the cords strangling my bathroom for dear life, the short-charge life, and the tedium of maintaining utility. With the HigherDose Red Light Hat, there's zero nonsense and nary an excuse. It arrives in a cheery blue box with minimal packaging, charged and ready to radiate. Its discreet black power source easily clicks into place on the back of the hat - there is no guesswork. Then, there's the wear: light as a feather, stiff as a board. If you're a fan of red light therapy/LED masks for your face, you know that red light exposure to your eyes is often present. With this hat, I honestly can't tell whether it's on or off. Beeping sounds alert you that the session has concluded. I'll summarize my feelings about the HigherDose Red Light Therapy Hat by quoting Elizabeth Barrett Browning: \"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.\" I realize this sounds rather dramatic, but it's true: I've nothing negative to say; I love everything about this device. How to Use HigherDose's Red Light Hat After charging, place the magnetized black battery on the back of the hat until it clicks into place. Turn it on by pressing the power button and waiting until red lights appear, then place the hat on your head. Do whatever your heart desires (within your legal rights) for ten minutes until the hat beeps to signify it has turned itself off. Even though the red light revitalizes your scalp, ensure the environment is clean and free of debris and build-up. I continue to trust my roster of healthy scalp-spurring topicals: Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo For Thinning Hair ($30), Dr. Groot Scalp Revitalizing Solution ($30) in lieu of conditioner, and Verb Ghost Exfoliating Scalp Nectar ($21) between washes. What to Consider Before Trying HigherDose's Red Light Hat Combatting hair loss is multifaceted, progressive, and often shrouded in mystery. If you don't like topicals/serums, this mess-free hat keeps your roots clean and dry. With minoxidil formulas, you contend with a sticky texture, potential harm to your cat, and an initial shedding phase. If you're taking oral supplements like Nutrafol ($88), which I and many dermatologists recommend, you must remember to swallow several pills daily. The HigherDose Red Light Therapy can be combined with both of those, but talk to your doctor about using it if you're receiving ultrasound treatments, injections, or implants/plugs. If you're experiencing significant and/or sudden hair loss, consult a doctor/trichologist to ascertain what's happening internally. Hair loss is often genetic and age-related, but it can also be a symptom of health issues. Don't expect immediate head-turning results. Like any hair loss treatment, it's a gradual process. The brand recommends four months of daily wear and three to four times a week of subsequent maintenance treatments. I've been wearing mine for a month now, and my hair regrowth is most obvious near my hairline, where the curious cowlick I've had since childhood seems more full. I'm committed to this undertaking and I'll update this story when I've reached the full time period. Despite its stealthy vibes, the hat isn't entirely covert – the power attachment protrudes a bit on the hat's posterior. Anyone who scrutinizes the back of your head will notice something is there – but does anyone really do that? I wore my hat to the grocery store, parks, and out for errands, and if anybody was onto me, they sure didn't say so. Even if someone did notice, it's like wearing cute pimple patches in public – I'd feel adorably relatable. Regarding sizing, the hat is roomy if you have a smaller noggin. It fits me like a Von Dutch trucker hat in the early aughts. Where Is the Higher Dose Red Light Therapy Hat Available? The HigherDose Red Light Therapy Hat is available on the brand's website, as well as at Sephora and Nordstrom.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/olaplex-scalp-serum-review-49430887",
    "description": "It's easy to forget that your scalp is an extension of your skin - that is, until it's covered in dandruff, you can't stop itching it, and you're forced to wear a hat to cover up how angry it is (yep, that's me). As someone with an unruly scalp, I'm always looking for treatments to help give this often-neglected area some TLC. Enter the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum ($44), which I discovered at the perfect time to offset the scalp damage I've accrued during these brisk transitional months. Curious to learn how a famous bond-building product tackles the scalp? Read on for my full review. What Is the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum? The Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum is a weekly scalp treatment that offers both short- and long-term benefits. It helps hydrate and soften the hair with a blend of ceramides, hyaluronic acid, and rice bran oil. Long-term results include preventative protection against scalp aging, with a more balanced scalp microbiome after two weeks of consistent use. The formula includes a pro-balancing blend of black pepper seed, magnolia bark, patchouli extract, and manuka branch leaf oil. It can be used on all hair types and textures (including sensitive scalps prone to irritation). It's also laced with antioxidants to halt premature scalp aging and protect against free radical damage. What I Like About the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum As someone with dark hair and dandruff, I was excited to see that the pesky white flakes that once took up real estate on my scalp subsided after using this treatment consistently for two weeks. My problem area is usually the front part of my hair along my hairline - it's itchy, and this is where I'd normally see the most dandruff. Now, there are no visible flakes and my scalp feels some much-needed relief from the itchiness. Aside from nixing dandruff, using this scalp treatment is pretty straightforward. The formula boasts a gel texture (versus a more thin, serum-y texture), which I appreciate because it's less messy to apply. Surprisingly, despite its thicker consistency, I don't find that it weighs my hair down or contributes to build-up. It's ideal for layering with other styling products and enhances my hair overall. Packaging-wise, I've always loved the sleek minimalism of all of Olaplex's products - this tube fits into my bathroom lineup perfectly without sticking out like a sore thumb. The scent is clean and subtle rather than strong and overpowering, making it great for those with sensitive noses. How to Use the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum Applying this formula is a breeze thanks to the thoughtful applicator, which is long and pointed - the perfect size and shape to part the hair and apply directly onto the scalp. (The brand recommends targeting three to four sections on the crown and back of head.) To use, I squeeze the tube along my middle, left, and right part lines, gently massaging the product in with my fingertips (or a scalp brush if I'm feeling fancy). This formula can be used on wet hair prior to styling or on dry hair as an overnight treatment. I love that this doesn't interfere with styling or make my hair look or feel oily come morning, which makes me more inclined to use it as part of my general hair-care routine. While the scalp treatment is gentle enough for daily use, I found that I got results using it only three times a week. What to Consider Before Trying the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum One thing to note about this scalp treatment is its size: If you're using it consistently three times a week or even daily, you may run out of the 1.7-ounce bottle quickly. Where Is the Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum Available? The Olaplex No.0.5 Hydrating and Strengthening Scalp Serum is available at the brand's website, Sephora, and Kohls.

A funny thing happened recently — I was rewatching Legally Blonde when a scene stood out to me: One of Elle’s sorority sisters was struggling with her lip liner. Lip liner? I thought. It sounded so… dated. And yet, lip pencils (and their softer, creamier cousin, lip crayons) are inescapable in GRWM videos. I had to ask myself — did we all quietly re-brand lip liners into lip pencils without realizing it? Because that’s exactly what it feels like. There’s no doubt that lip pencils are bigger than ever, but did they ever really leave? “Lip liner has always been transformative and is a hallmark of so many iconic makeup looks,” makeup artist and Sephora beauty director Myiesha Sewell tells Refinery29, referencing signature techniques from the ‘90s supermodel era and Chola culture, which popularized dark, contrasting lip liner. “As a Black girl who went to school in East Los Angeles, [lip liner] still heavily influences my signature makeup look,” she says. “It adds polish and style to any makeup look and is one of my favorite parts of my makeup.” Another reason for lip pencils’ meteoric rise in popularity? Its versatility and convenience, says celebrity makeup artist Alexandra French. “Lip liners have become the ‘It girl’ of makeup simply because they’re so easy to use,” says French. “You can shape your lips with it and tap it out for a more natural effect, or you can go bold and make it the star of the show.” For additional proof of just how versatile lip pencils can be, look no further than makeup artist Emily Wood’s viral videos, where she uses them not only on lips but as blush, contour, and even eyeshadow. (Just make sure the ingredients are safe for the eyes before trying this.) View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emily Wood (@emilywoodmakeup) In case you haven’t noticed, lip pencils are really good these days. Recent innovations in formulations have introduced hydrating and plumping effects, featuring ingredients like vitamin E and hyaluronic acid — a welcome departure from the drier, harder pencils of the past. “I love the Maybelline Lifter Liners,” says French. “They’re creamy, easy to blend, and last.” She also sings the praises of Kosas’ Hotliner and Too Faced’s Lip Injection pencils for pout-enhancing results. “Isamaya Lip Liner and Sephora Collection Rouge Gel Lip Liner have ingredients like triglycerides and polyglycerols that can help give moisture and glide to the formula,” adds Sewell. Editor’s Favorite Lip Liners \u0026 Pencils An informal poll among R29’s beauty editors revealed an abundance of standout favorites: A nude lip is my go-to, and Make Up For Ever’s Artist Pencil is among my most-reached-for products; the brand nailed the array of luminous, warm tones that never look flat. I’m partial to shades Wherever Walnut and Anywhere Caffeine (also a favorite of Hailey Bieber’s). Beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita is partial to Laura Mercier’s Caviar Perfecting Lip Liner, which is as pigmented as lipstick and stays put even after eating and drinking. “These liners also tend to be less waxy, so they last longer and don’t feather,” said Sewell of both picks. “Some of my go-to shades are Fenty Beauty Trac’d Out Lip Liner in Extra Thigh and Rare Beauty Kind Words Lip Liner in Wise.” Another modern use of lip pencils is lip contouring, a key feature of Rhode’s newly-launched Peptide Lip Shape, which is a hit among several R29 staffers. French shares a new trend in lip enhancement: “I’ve recently learned [that people] are giving up lip fillers and instead using cool tone lip liners to create an illusion of fuller lips,” she says. “You can create this lived-in, sexy pout, smudge it out with your finger, and add a lip balm on top. It’s natural, effortless, and so easy to do.”  The Rise Of The Lip Combo All of this has led to the rise of the biggest beauty obsession of the moment: the lip combo. On TikTok, the hashtag #LipCombo has racked up an enormous 9.19 billion views and climbing as users mix and match lip liners, lipsticks, and glosses to craft a bespoke lip look. Scroll through the comments, and you’ll find endless requests to “drop the lip combo.” Some pairings have achieved cult status: American gymnast (and R29 2024 Powerhouse) Suni Lee recently revealed her go-to: Make Up For Ever’s Artist Pencil in Anywhere Caffeine and Wherever Walnut (yes, my favorite shades too!) topped with Ole Henriksen’s Pout Preserve Peptide Lip Treatment. But it’s not just about adding more products for the sake of it. The lip combo trend exemplifies the highly personalized magic of makeup — the thrill of discovering the one (or several) that bring your look to life. With the term “lip liner” itself fading from favor, it seems that 2025 is all about coloring outside the lines. Like what you see?
