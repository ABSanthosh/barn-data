    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/fsa-hsa-eligible-beauty-products-49322272",
    "description": "Shopping for beauty products can be fun, but it can also add up fast. No matter how good they make you feel (or look), no one looks forward to seeing the credit card bill post- Ulta or Sephora trip. However, you can save on your beauty routine by using your FSA (flexible spending account) and HSA (health savings account) on beauty products that are eligible. Enrolling in either of these programs allows you to set aside pre-tax dollars for certain medical expenses and conditions, like over-the-counter medications and even skin-care products. To help you make the most of your FSA or HSA benefits and shop strategically, we enlisted the help of board certified dermatologist Nithin Reddy, MD, to break down the benefits, what types of products qualify and why, and how to optimize your shopping list. We also included some of the best FSA and HSA-eligible skin-care products you can stock up on with your funds, including a few of our editor-backed picks. What is the difference between an FSA and an HSA? In order to fully take advantage of these benefits, it is helpful to understand what exactly FSA and HSA accounts are and the differences between them. Both FSA and HSA benefits let you set aside pre-tax money to spend on healthcare costs, but there's an annual contribution limit for an FSA that you can specify during your enrollment period, according to Dr. Reddy. He points out that employers usually offer FSAs, and HSAs are contingent on enrolling in a high-deductible health plan. \"One of the main advantages of an HSA is that it is portable, staying with the account holder through job transitions,\" Dr. Reddy says. \"Other HSA advantages include higher contribution limits, rollovers, investment opportunities, and flexible withdrawals. It is crucial to thoroughly review the terms and conditions, contribution limits, and qualified expenses with both types of accounts to determine their suitability for your needs.\" How can beauty products qualify for the tax-free benefit? Dr. Reddy says that while beauty products alone may not qualify as FSA/HSA eligible, those containing ingredients proven to treat medical conditions - like acne, eczema, or in the prevention of skin cancer can be eligible for FSA/HSA coverage. \"For instance, over-the-counter retinol, a well-known antiaging ingredient in many beauty products, is in many acne treatments, making it eligible for FSA/HSA funds,\" Dr. Reddy says. \"Similarly, blemish correctors that contain salicylic acid, another effective ingredient for treating acne, often qualify as FSA/HSA eligible.\" Along with acne treatments, sunscreen is also eligible since they help prevent skin cancer. He also notes that some moisturizers can qualify for the benefit if they help with eczema management. \"If there is any doubt about a specific product's eligibility, it is always advisable to first consult with your account administrator,\" he says. How can consumers take advantage of their FSA/HSA benefits for beauty products? \"Any products labeled as FSA/HSA eligible can be purchased using your FSA or HSA account, providing a convenient way to manage your healthcare expenses by offering tax savings,\" he says. Sites like Sephora, Target, and Amazon have specific sections you can shop from that filter the products that are eligible for the benefit. \"I recommend carefully assessing your skin-care routine to identify which products may qualify for coverage. Consulting with your local dermatologist can help you develop a tailored skin-care routine that caters to your specific skin conditions,\" Dr. Reddy says. He recommends swapping products that aren't covered by the benefit with FSA/HSA-eligible items but warns not to overspend on non-essential items if you can help it. Ahead, we rounded up the best beauty products you can get using your FSA or HSA benefits. Expert Featured in This Article Nithin Reddy is a NYC-based board certified dermatologist.

    "title": "WNBA Star Cameron Brink Shares Her Sweatproof \"Meditative Makeup\" Routine",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/cameron-brink-beauty-interview-49406153",
    "description": "As you may have noticed, the WNBA looks a whole lot different this year - and not just in the sense of its record-breaking viewership. Between high-fashion \"tunnel fits,\" countless beauty brand sponsorships, and women who are actively working against the idea that you must choose between being a fashion-and-makeup-loving girly and a competitor, the league quite literally does look different. Enter Los Angeles Sparks rookie Cameron Brink. As the second overall pick in the 2024 draft, it's clear that she's a powerhouse on the court - but her boundary-bending accomplishments off the court are just as notable. She's posed for high-fashion campaigns, attended Paris Fashion Week, and regularly shows up to games serving looks. She unabashedly wears makeup to play (occasionally, she'll even pop on some individual lashes), routinely shows off her routine on social media, and now is the newest face of Urban Decay's iconic All Nighter Setting Spray ($36). \"As early as elementary school, I was pinpointed to feel like the tall, athletic girl. It felt like I couldn't be two things at once,\" Brink tells PS, echoing the sentiments of numerous athletes we've spoken to this year. \"At heart, though, I'm a girly girl who also loves sports and things that are 'masculine' as well.\" Like many other women, Brink first fell in love with beauty by watching her mom get ready. \"I would sit and watch her do her makeup and think how she was the most beautiful woman ever, and that she just used makeup to enhance that,\" she says. \"She was such a confident figure in my life, and that motivated me to learn more about beauty.\" As she got older and - with the help of countless YouTube tutorials - found her footing with her own regime (which has included All Nighter since high school), she began to love the escape that came with putting on makeup. \"Taking the time to have a routine [is so important to me], and it's become almost meditative for me to get ready and feel like the best version of myself,\" she says. Now that Brink's a full-blown superstar, \"meditative makeup\" has become even more critical - especially on game day. \"Before games, there's a whole routine that starts with me waking up from a beauty nap, then putting on a podcast or some good music and getting ready,\" she says. \"I sit down at my nice vanity in front of my little mirror, and I get very calm [putting on my makeup]. Instead of foundation, she applies longwear concealer (her favorite is Urban Decay's Quickie 24-Hour Waterproof Concealer ($33)). \"By the end of my routine, I feel ready to walk out the door confident.\" It's no wonder that shortly after she had surgery to mend her ACL injury this spring, she was \"propping up [her] leg and taking the time to get ready.\" Season-ending injuries present physical and mental challenges for athletes - but Brink is \"doing great\" in rehab and resisting self-pity. \"I haven't let being injured box me into not living my life as a 22-year-old who lives in LA and wants to travel the world. I'm proud of myself for the way I've kept working with brands and that I've let this be something empowering instead of depressing.\" As a basketball star, fashion icon, and beauty ambassador, Brink intentionally shows the world that she's more than just one thing. This holds true in her beauty routine, sure (\"I have no one aesthetic - some days, I'm high glam; other days, I'm just a girl in California who likes to chill and be casual,\" she says), but really, it exceeds that: \"I've always had multiple dreams - of course, to join the WNBA, but also to be a model and to be feminine,\" she says. \"The ultimate goal is to inspire girls who like to compete and be aggressive on the court but also embrace their femininity.\" For Brink, self-expression is crucial to this mission - and often, that comes in the form of her #looks. \"What's so great about 'tunnel fits' in the league is that they show off how many different types of people and players we have and that they can be multiple things at once,\" she says. \"I can show up to each game feeling like a beautiful version of myself in an outfit and makeup that express how I'm feeling. I can express myself however I want, and to know that it's accepted is a really beautiful thing.\" Zoë Weiner is a freelance beauty and wellness writer.
