    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/double-french-manicure-trend?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "While nail art trends come and go faster than you can say “glazed donut”, there is one nail look that never dwindles in popularity: the French manicure. New interpretations of this classic nail style emerge each season, like the “deconstructed” French manicure, micro French tips and the chic French fade. There’s no denying that this timeless style has to be one of the most versatile manicures to opt for. It’s this latest iteration of the French manicure that has really got us excited for our next salon appointment, though. Enter: the double French manicure. Also known as “floating French tips”, the double French follows the same arched style as the classic French manicure, but with two strips of color at the tip instead of the single strip of white. It provides the perfect opportunity to play with different shades and widths and is pretty straightforward to achieve in a salon, or even at home if you have a small nail art brush. “I think floating French tips really resonate because of their versatility,” explains Kirsten White, nail technician and CEO and founder of London Grace. “The negative space created by the design can showcase the natural nail while also adding a touch of colur in an interesting way. It’s the perfect nail art if you want your nails to make a statement and still look elegant.” Ahead, we’ve pulled together 11 of our favorite double French manicure ideas to inspire your next nail appointment. Golden Touch View this post on Instagram A post shared by Emma (@nails.byemmaess) The sliver of gold at the tips of this irregular French manicure by Emma, aka @nails.byemmaess, adds a subtle hint of sparkle. It’s a chic nod to the double French trend and an undeniable winner for wedding season. Ruby Red View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) A glossy red polish always looks good — and it looks even better when used to create these beautiful floating French tips by nail artist Iram Shelton. Get the look at home with Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Rhapsody Red, $12.99. Pastel Pop View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Nail Gal (@thenailgaledinburgh) Pastel minimalism is dominating in this summer’s biggest nail trends. These candy-colored tips by Zara at The Nail Gal look so good paired with a more dialed-down nude base. Neon Glow View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sadie J Nails (@sadiejnails) Proving that negative space manicures aren’t just for minimalists, this vibrant orange double French style by nail artist and content creator Sadie Jordan is so playful and perfect for sunshine season. China Glaze Nail Lacquer in Orange Knockout, $6.19, will help you recreate the look at home. If you prefer shorter nails, take inspiration from this neon orange and pastel blue combo by Lois Samantha. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lois Samantha (@polishedbylolo) Electric Blue View this post on Instagram A post shared by Karma 💋 BRIGHTON NAIL ARTIST (@nailsby.karma) Floating French tips provide the perfect opportunity to experiment with nail polish shades that you might otherwise steer clear of. This ’80s-inspired cobalt blue nail art by Karma looks so crisp teamed with a simple nude base. Essie Butler Please, $10, is a great option if you want to try a similar color for yourself. Not sold on cobalt? The trend is equally as cute with baby blue, like these right angle tips by nail artist and educator Bryony Howell. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Bryony Howell (@gelsbybry) Technicolor Clash View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) While a lot of the double French nail art looks leave some bare space between the lines, this one pairs a vibrant tip with a micro line of contrasting color for a kaleidoscopic effect. Look to Melanie Graves for inspiration. Monochrome Tips View this post on Instagram A post shared by Iram Shelton (@iramshelton) Why were French tips ever white when black looks this good? From the almond-shaped nails to the effortlessly sophisticated onyx double tips, this nail art by Iram Shelton is simple yet striking. For the perfect glossy black shade, try OPI Infinite Shine in Black Onyx, $11.99. Gilded Pine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Le (@amyle.nails) This teeny-tiny line of gold would pair perfectly with basically any nail color, but these deep forest green tips are undeniably captivating. Take inspiration from nail artist Amy Le. Open Space View this post on Instagram A post shared by M e g (@gel.bymegan) Taking negative space to the extreme by bringing the second line of color down past the midpoint of the nail, these micro metallic lines by manicurist Megan prove that sometimes simple nail art can be the most impactful. Red Carpet Manicure Flash Glitter Special Effect Gel Polish, $10.99, will help you recreate this minimalist style at home. Rose Gold View this post on Instagram A post shared by Amy Le (@amyle.nails) There’s a cute preppiness to this double French look by Amy Le, where instead of leaving the floating gold lines blank, they’ve been filled with a pop of candy pink polish. Minimal Simplicity View this post on Instagram A post shared by KENZO NAIL STUDIO (@kenzonailstudio) Pared back and elegant, there’s no arguing with how stylish this simple take on floating French tips looks. Courtesy of Kenzo Nail Studio, it’s a graceful nod to the classic French manicure, but with a modern upgrade. All you need is a steady hand and an opaque white polish like Sally Hansen Insta Dry Nail Polish in White on Time, $5.99, to get the look on your own.

    "description": "Here’s the thing about a good haircut: It only takes one photo to spark inspiration. If you’re feeling a little lost this summer, we’re here to help. Bob haircuts are particularly fun because if you’ve been a Refinery29 reader for a while you know, we appreciate the often imperceptible but critical details that make an Italian bob different from a French bob (the former is more cropped to the ears, and the latter is often structural and includes a bang). Here, we’re breaking down the top bob trends of the moment — for summer 2025 — in hopes that they might inspire your next appointment. Find our predictions with imagery for you to save and expert styling advice, ahead. Carved bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Spoke \u0026 Weal (@spokeandweal) The technique used to create a carved bob gives the hair a very lived-in look, “similar to when you cut hair using a razor,” explains hairstylist Amanda Lee. The cut, which is purposefully grown-out with tapered ends, was popular in 2018 and 2019 and is seeing a resurgence. “It’s a creative cut based on removing weight and creating layers that provide lift and movement into the hair,” explains hairstylist Cassadi Currier. Flipped bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lindsey Neavitt (@lindseyneavitt901) Many stylists track the origins of the flipped bob back to the ’60s. “It had a very retro feel,” explains Lee. “Jackie Kennedy is the first name to come to mind when I think of the flipped bob.” There’s an innate elegance to this style but it’s pretty versatile. The current variation is cut short, maybe slightly asymmetrical, and has some polish. For styling, Lee recommends using a hot brush (like the Mane Medium Hot Brush, $98) to give your hair a good flip on the ends and a smoothing balm (she prefers the Emi Jay Angelstick, $38) to polish any flyaways. Fluffy bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by DECEMBER FULLY BOOKED (@hairbyanaiss) A fluffy or “soft-sweeping layered bob” is a modern favorite among stylists. “It’s one of my favorite types of bob haircuts,” says Currier, “and I love that most of them have a deep-set side part.” Lee considers the fluffy bob a modern version of a classic cut. “The fluffy bob is really just a modern take on the classic bob shape, giving it more volume and movement,” she says. To style, she recommends a big round brush, a round brush blow dryer, or a round brush attachment (if you’re using a Dyson). Japanese bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by 菊池 洵 / 美容師 (@jun__kikuchi) “The Japanese bob is also a chin-length bob that really hugs the curvature of the face,” says Currier. “This bob is usually parted in the middle and has gorgeous sweeping layers that go away from the face with blunt ends.” The name comes from the country of origin and inspiration. In Japanese hair salons, this is just a short bob. For styling a Japanese bob, Currier recommends using a flat iron and “beveling” sections, curving the hair under. But for the pieces around the face, “you’re going to want to direct the flat iron forward in the opposite direction and sweep backward towards the ear to give a bit of a curved, sweeping look to the fringe,” she explains. Bitchy bob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jenna Perry Hair Studio (@jennaperryhairstudio) This bob is fun. It’s polished, one-length, and hits right at the corners of the mouth. It has some high-fashion edge and attitude, which is likely why hairstylist Jordan Luger at Jenna Perry Salon in NYC calls it the “bitchy bob.” If you’re thinking of inching up this summer, this is a charming way to go about it.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/got2b-glued-brow-edge-gel-review-49038005",
    "description": "Throughout the years, my eyebrow routine has taken no more than five minutes. I've always had naturally thick brows, so I've never felt the need to manipulate them. And even during eras like 2000s skinny brows and or laminated brows, I was the girl who rocked natural brows (not even threading or waxing). As I got more acquainted with doing my makeup, I started trying brow pencils, but still, my glams looked best with them au naturel. Now as much as I've appreciated their thickness, they tend to get a little wild at a times, but I quickly found the perfect product to tame them while maintaining that authentic look I love: brow gel. It was only five years ago that I started wearing makeup, so I've only used one brow gel. I've never really had problems with it, but it would flake at times, especially in extreme temperatures. Fortunately, I came across göt2b's Brows \u0026 Edges 2 in 1 Wand Gel ($8) - thanks to TikTok - and it's the only brow gel I use now. Not only does it have impressive staying power (even during a New Orleans heat wave), but it's highly affordable, allowing you to get that polished beauty look without breaking the bank. Keep reading for my full review along with another editor who used it on her edges, and find out why it's so good even Kylie Jenner wears it. About the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel It promises up to 72-hour hold for brows and edges without flaking. It has a two-sided fiber brush for easy application. It's made of a vegan and silicone-free formula. What I Like About the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel What I love most about this gel is that's easy to control, while keeping your brows in place. I'd usually have to dip my old brow gel in its tube multiple times to get my desired look, and with this gel, I got the perfect, tamed thick brows with just one use. I used it during a recent trip to New Orleans for the annual Essence Festival, and my brows stayed in place for hours, even in 109 degrees. And if it can survive that level of heat, I know my brows are in good hands. How to Use the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel While this gel is a 2-in-1 product, it's super simple to use. It comes in a durable plastic tube that you can unscrew to reveal a spoolie applicator. With just one dip, the gel dispenses the perfect amount of product onto the wand; ideal enough if you happen to be in a hurry when your Uber is downstairs and your friends are yelling at you to hurry up. What to Consider Before Using the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel Because it also claims to be perfect for edges, another editor tried it on her type-four hair. She applied it on her hairline since she often rocks slicked back styles, rather than using it for baby hairs. She notes that the spoolie does deliver a good amount of product, but the brush's size isn't ideal for thicker hair textures, so that's something to consider before purchasing. Review: \"At first, the spoolie glided through my hair, but toward the end, it started getting caught on the brush, making it look a bit frizzy. It's a bit too small to really comb through your edges like a normal brush would. At $19, you realistically could continue to use a spoolie with the normal Göt2b styling gel and get similar results.\" - Ariel Baker, former assistant editor, Beauty Image Source: PS Photography / Ariel Baker Where Is the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel Available? The göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel is available on the brand's website and Target.

They can have a debilitating impact on those who experience them, but on top of the emotional toll are hidden costs that are rarely shared. The 2020 All-Party Parliamentary Group on Skin Report put out by the British Skin Foundation revealed that a staggering 98 percent of people with a skin condition said it affected their emotional and psychological well-being. Sadly, we know it can influence self-esteem, relationships, and work life, but the financial cost can be just as draining. The financial burden that comes with skin flare-ups and chronic conditions is one that's often not openly discussed and something many who haven't experienced it struggle to understand. To highlight this, we spoke to someone who has experienced it firsthand as well as an expert who treats patients daily and who understands (and empathizes with) the topic deeply.

The Economic Burden of Skin Conditions \"At the height of my eczema flare-up, I was spending an absolute fortune on products to help manage my condition,\" content creator Elise Loubatieres says. And she's not alone. One look at hashtags for \"eczema\" and \"rosacea\" on TikTok produces thousands of videos of people sharing their tips, struggles, and stories. A big part of that conversation, particularly among Loubatieres's followers, is how difficult the additional cost can be. \"Having a skin condition is very expensive, but your sanity is priceless,\" Loubatieres says. \"I can see how people go broke trying to fix their skin.\" The first economic factor is the sheer number of products people with conditions like eczema need to manage it. \"As well as paying for prescriptions, I would be purchasing additional products, often spending anything between $50-$100 a month on skin care,\" Loubatieres says. \"I can easily go through two shower gels and two body creams in a week - I wash and moisturize my skin that much. When in a full flare-up, I actually apply emollient before showering, as even water can make my skin sting, so I need that extra protective layer.\" @littlemissplumful This is completely normal behaviour for an #eczemasufferer 😅 Smothering my #eczema in #emollient #ointment like #hydromol not only helps to make my dry #eczemaskin feel more comfortable but also prevents #transepidermalwaterloss \u0026 protects my skinbarrier.

Loubatieres says this is where advocating for yourself really comes into play. Alia Ahmed, MD, a consultant dermatologist and psychodermatologist (where psychological well-being and the skin are interconnected), notes that nutrition and supplements are something a lot of her patients have to consider, too. Some with skin conditions respond particularly well (or badly) to certain foods, adding an expense to already very high food bills. Similarly, supplements can be a fantastic addition to a daily routine for those with skin conditions, but they don't always come cheap. In the same vein, Dr. Ahmed explains that many of her patients have to consider things like clothing, bedding, air purifiers, and water softeners. \"I don't think many people realize that all of this is a financial cost,\" she says. Loubatieres explains that even wearing creams to bed can stain sheets, meaning these need replacing more often in some cases. These are things many people take for granted and don't consider, especially in the cost-of-living crisis we're currently facing. \"Having a skin condition is very expensive, but your sanity is priceless. I can see how people go broke trying to fix their skin.\" Loubatieres says that she feels lucky to live so close to her local GP and hospital so that she's able to walk to her appointments and not have any added travel costs. When people do have to travel, many are understandably reluctant to use public transportation. \"When my eczema was at its worst, I wouldn't take public transport partly because of how self-conscious I was of my red, raw, flaking skin,\" Loubatieres says, noting that this was also in an effort to avoid getting infections, as her skin would often be broken and exposed. Then there's the difficulty of working when you have a chronic, debilitating skin condition. If you've never experienced this or known a loved one who has, it's common to dismiss the idea of not working due to your skin, but we're not talking about a small blemish here and there. Chronic, full-body skin conditions can be incredibly painful and life-limiting. \"Living with a chronic condition is a constant consideration not only when it comes to covering costs but also balancing it out with the possible loss of work due to the condition,\" Loubatieres says. Dr. Amhed notes the cost of time is also a factor to consider. Time is money, and when you're spending hours over the course of the week applying products, organizing appointments, picking up prescriptions, and so on, it really adds up. The Emotional Cost of Skin Conditions Not only is the financial cost of a skin condition difficult to deal with, but the emotional cost must be taken into account. This is something that Dr. Ahmed champions: taking patients' mental health seriously. \"People think that no one dies in dermatology, but they do, and they die by suicide,\" Dr. Ahmed says. \"It might seem like a small statistic, but five percent of people with skin conditions feel like they don't want to continue their life,\" she says. \"It's our job to support these people, not only medically for their skin, but also psychologically for how their skin has made them feel.\" Loubatieres notes that people affected by skin conditions can also be seen as \"anti-social and unwilling to go out when in a flare-up, making everyone else change their plans in order to accommodate the person living with a skin condition,\" which can be emotionally challenging. How to Cut Costs With a Skin Condition If you're finding yourself struggling financially due to the cost of your skin condition, the first step is to tell your family and friends that you're having a difficult time. Book an appointment with your GP and have a loved one come with you to help advocate for you. To keep product costs down, Dr. Ahmed says you don't need to go for big-name brands. You can ask your GP or dermatologist for specific advice when it comes to your skin condition, but most products with similar ingredient lists will get the job done fine, regardless of the brand. Loubatieres advises that tubs of hydromol are a firm favorite in the eczema community, as they're cost-effective and can be used as a soap alternative and moisturizer. Dr. Ahmed emphasizes the importance of using your products effectively to keep costs down, like keeping cream in the fridge if you find relief from burning and itching with cold compression. It's important not to get sucked into clever marketing claims, too. \"People who are chronically suffering with a skin condition are absolutely desperate for a cure or a quick fix, that one product to fix all their problems,\" Loubatieres says. \"Desperation can lead to people trying anything no matter the cost in the hope that this may finally be the product to fix it all. Brands know this and absolutely exploit those in need.\" Dr. Amhed also recommends making use of retailer offers. Similarly, you can use subscribe-and-save with repeated, regular purchases. Finally, Loubatieres notes that it's important to consider all elements of your life and how they relate to your condition in order to manage it holistically. \"Evaluating your lifestyle, diet, allergies, stress levels, sleep, and how these correlate to flare-ups is so important.\" Tori Crowther is a freelance beauty journalist and former PS UK editor.",
