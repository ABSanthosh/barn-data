If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. If there’s one time of year to purchase a Dyson, it’s Black Friday — aka today! Whether you’re eyeing a sleek new vacuum or a salon-worthy piece of beauty tech, the brand’s innovative devices come at a premium, which makes Cyber season (because it’s gone from a single shopping weekend to an entire month of internet-breaking deals) a uniquely opportune moment to knock hundreds of dollars off your investment. We’ve raved about Dyson numerous times — it’s no exaggeration to say that its suite of hair tools truly changed the game for several R29ers — and this year, the brand has outdone itself with its Black Friday deals, some of which you can already shop. From price-slashed Supersonic hair dryers and stick vacuums to unprecedented discounts on air purifiers and new innovations (case in point: those newfangled headphones), keep reading to scope out the best sales on Dyson products this Black Friday. DashDividers_1_500x100 Dyson Supersonic™ hair dryer (Onyx Gold), $429.99 $329.99 Promo: Save $100 on Dyson’s Supersonic™ hair dryer (includes five styling attachments and a complimentary gift with purchase). Dyson’s inaugural hair tool is still the GOAT among hair dryers, and there’s no better time to make it yours than during Black Friday. Nothing comes close in terms of power and drying speed, and we won’t lie — it’s pretty. Plus, if you shop it during Black Friday, you’ll score agift with purchase (in addition to the litany of attachments that already come with it). Dyson Corrale™ styler straightener (Strawberry Bronze/Blush Pink), $499.99 $399.99 Promo: Save $100 on the Dyson Corrale™ styler straightener (includes three accessories plus a complimentary gift with purchase). This innovative take on the classic flatiron achieves sleek, pin-straight looks in just a few passes — and without the extreme heat that fried your strands in the aughts. The trick: flexible plates that “hug” your hair as they go, resulting in more evenly applied heat. (More efficient heating = fewer passes = less damage.) Dyson Airwrap™ multi-styler and dryer Straight+Wavy, $599.99 $499.99 Promo: Save $100 on the Dyson Airwrap™ multi-styler and dryer (includes six attachments and two accessories plus a complimentary gift with purchase). This is a big deal: Starting later this week, you can score $100 off the Airwrap, including its new iterations with a round brush and diffuser attachments. (This brings the total price down to $499.99, which rivals prices on certain refurbished models.) What’s more, you can choose among several signature colorways, including Strawberry Bronze, Prussian Blue, and Copper Nickel. Shop Hair Deals DashDividers_1_500x100 Dyson V12 Detect Slim Vacuum, $649.99 $399.99 Promo: Up to $250 Off Dyson home technology If you’re in the market to upgrade your vacuum, Dyson has Black Friday offers to sweeten the deal.
