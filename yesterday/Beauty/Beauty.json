    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/oneskin-os-o1-hair-scalp-serum-review-49452080",
    "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Deena Campbell My haircare philosophy has always been rooted in tradition. Growing up in a Black household, Jamaican black castor oil was the gold standard: trusted, time-tested, and deeply woven into our haircare routines. Anything too clinical or serum-based felt overly complicated and, honestly, a little impersonal. Oils also meant growth. So when I first came across the OneSkin OS-01 Hair Peptide Scalp Serum ($62 for one-month supply, originally $69) and OneSkin OS-01 Hair Dermaroller ($20), I was equally intrigued and skeptical. A biotech-backed peptide serum for the scalp? Still, my edges (which had been slowly thinning and weakening over time) were in need of serious reinforcement. Curiosity won, and I decided to see how science could change my life. Also, while pricey, the brand does offer the chance to save 20% on the OneSkin OS-01 Hair Peptide Scalp Serum 3-Month Supply ($166, originally $207) and 25% on the OneSkin OS-01 Hair Peptide Scalp Serum 6-Month Supply ($321, originally $424). So, there's a win - read on to see why I think it's worth the splurge. About the Peptide Scalp Serum and Dermaroller The OS-01 HAIR Peptide Scalp Serum is part of OneSkin's longevity-based line, developed with the goal of optimizing skin health at the cellular level, including your scalp. It contains their patented OS-01 peptide - the same ingredient in their cult-favorite OneSkin OS-01 Face Topical Supplement ($120) and OS-01 Body Topical Supplement ($99) - along with panax ginseng root extract and oryza sativa (rice) bran water that support a healthier scalp environment and help reduce hair shedding over time. The Dermaroller is a sleek, 0.5mm microneedling tool meant to increase serum absorption and stimulate circulation at the hair follicle level. You roll it across the scalp before applying the serum, kind of like aerating your lawn before watering it. How to Use The Peptide Scalp Serum and Dermaroller The duo is meant to be used together for best results. First, use the OS-01 Hair Dermaroller by gently rolling it across the scalp in multiple directions: front to back, side to side, and diagonally. I was sure to focus on areas of concern like my thinning edges. Then, I applied a few drops of the Peptide Scalp Serum directly to my scalp and massaged it in with my fingertips. I used the combo three to four times per week, always on clean, dry hair. The dermarolling takes less than two minutes, and the serum absorbs quickly so you can use styling products shortly thereafter. Image Source: PS Photography / Deena Campbell What I Like About the Peptide Scalp Serum and Dermaroller Real talk: I was fully bracing myself for pain with the dermaroller. I hate needles! But to my surprise, it didn't hurt at all. The sensation was more like a light tingle than anything sharp, and after the first few passes, I barely noticed it. Weirdly enough, it made the whole process feel kind of luxe, almost like I was giving my scalp a spa moment. Technically, you can use the serum on its own, but I wouldn't want to. The dermaroller helped it absorb faster and more evenly, and my scalp felt like it was soaking up every drop. The serum itself was pleasant, too. I initially expected a goopy mess, but it was anything but. The lightweight, non-greasy, and nearly fragrance-free formula dried down quickly and didn't leave any weird residue or build-up. I could apply it in the morning and go about my day without feeling like I had product sitting on my scalp. But what ultimately sold me was the science. OneSkin's entire philosophy centers around cellular longevity. Their signature OS-01 peptide was developed to target senescent cells (aka \"zombie cells\" that stop functioning but don't die off), which can accumulate in the skin and contribute to inflammation, thinning, and delayed regeneration. In clinical studies, the brand found that consistent use of the OS-01 peptide not only improved markers of scalp barrier function and hydration, but also helped reduce pro-inflammatory aging signals. Healthier scalp skin creates a more supportive environment for hair follicles, which is essential for anyone dealing with hair shedding. That level of transparency and intention really spoke to me, especially as someone who's not just chasing a temporary cosmetic fix but focused on building long-term strength and fullness. I still love my oils and always will, but these science-forward products have earned a permanent spot in my routine. Image Source: PS Photography / Deena Campbell What to Consider Before Trying the Peptide Scalp Serum and Dermaroller Consistency is key. This isn't a one-and-done miracle. You need to stick with it to see results. Don't skip the dermaroller. It makes a huge difference in how the serum absorbs (and no, it doesn't hurt!). If you have scalp sensitivities, test patch the dermaroller first or check in with a dermatologist. Where Is the Peptide Scalp Serum and Dermaroller Available? OneSkin Peptide Scalp Serum and Dermaroller is available on the brand's website.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/hairstylist-alopecia-journey-lessons-49451057",
    "description": "In a lot of cultures, hair is more than just hair. It's pride, it's power, it's expression, and it's a part of our identity. For many Latinas - curly-haired Afro-Latinas, especially - our relationship with our hair often begins with contradiction. We're told to love it, but also encouraged to tame it. Embrace it, but only under certain conditions that are based on an ideology that isn't even our own. I grew up as my Puerto Rican mother's first mixed-race child, and my hair was a beautiful challenge - loved but not always understood, which led us to local Dominican salons where straight hair was the norm. Torn between embracing my natural curls and conforming to expectations, I eventually found confidence in letting my curls be free. But a year into my career as a hairstylist, I started noticing changes: intense scalp pain, swelling, inflammation, and a strange shininess to my scalp's skin. It took me two years to see a dermatologist. Over the next few years, I bounced between doctors, misdiagnoses, medicated shampoos, and topical treatments, and still was left with no answers. As an established hairstylist at this point, I felt lost. It wasn't until after having my daughter in my late 20s that someone finally suggested a biopsy. I was around 27 or 28 when I got the confirmed diagnosis: lichen planopilaris (LPP), a rare autoimmune condition that causes scarring alopecia. Essentially, my immune system was attacking my hair follicles, and as they scarred over, the hair stopped growing back. I tried everything, including oral treatments and even painful steroid shots to slow down the progression, but my crown began to show signs of balding. I had small, shiny, smooth spots that later scabbed and scarred. I had rocked short hair by choice before, but this time, it wasn't my decision. I felt completely betrayed by my own body. The one thing I fought so passionately for as my source of physical expression had now been taken away from me without my consent. As a hairstylist, the irony was heavy. I was the one helping women fall in love with their look, but I couldn't do the same for myself. There were days when I missed the ability to switch it up, wear it big, or just feel carefree with my natural hair. I was losing myself while losing my hair. There are so many misconceptions about alopecia. People often think of small bald patches or assume it's caused by stress. They don't know about the inflammation, the pain, or the rare scarring types like mine. One dermatologist even attributed my alopecia to my Blackness, assuming that I must have worn braids or used harsh chemicals. I didn't. That was never part of my hair story. There are so many misconceptions about alopecia. People often think of small bald patches or assume it's caused by stress. Thankfully, I eventually found providers who gave me better insight. They explained that LPP is more common in women of African American descent not because of how we style our hair, but because of our genetics. And once I had that clarity, I started advocating not just for myself, but for others, too. Now, I help my clients look good and stay healthy. I've spotted early signs of alopecia, caught vitamin deficiencies, and supported clients in getting answers they didn't even know they needed. This condition has made me a better stylist - more informed, more empathetic, and more focused on wellness from the root (literally). I have learned so much about scalp health and natural ways to help cure some common issues. LPP has taught me that beauty is deeper than hair and encompasses so much more than the traditional vision of a woman that we are conditioned to subscribe to. As a biracial Afro-Latina, I had to redefine what confidence truly looks like. I tell my daughter all the time, \"Be kind. Be warm. Be smart. Be funny. That's what makes you beautiful, because physical beauty can be taken away from you at the drop of a dime.\" In this journey, I've learned that the real crown isn't what's on your head, it's what's in your heart. If there's one message I hope people take from my story, it's that we are more than our hair. We are our laughter, our resilience, our culture; we are our fight and our joy. Afro-Latinas have carried so much history in our coils and curls, but also in our hearts. Let's honor that. Let's celebrate each other for how we show up, not just how we look. And maybe, just maybe, the hairstylist who lost her hair is exactly who she was meant to become. Not just someone who creates beauty, but someone who reminds you that it was there all along; you just needed a little guidance. Kys Clark is an Afro-Latina hairstylist, performer, and single mother from the Bronx with nearly two decades of experience behind the chair. She's also a fitness instructor and a certified horticulture therapist, and she finds joy in nature, travel, and creative expression.",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/ysl-beauty-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "When you think of YSL Beauty, a few things come to mind. For me, I think of Touche Éclat concealer and Dua Lipa. For others, you may simply know the three iconic initials as an iconic French fashion house. All of these things are true, but during a recent trip with the brand to Marrakech (a home and huge source of inspiration to the brand’s founder, Algerian-born Yves Saint Laurent), I discovered that there was so much to YSL Beauty that meets the eye. And not to mention, some seriously excellent products to boot.  Over four days, I got the chance to visit Morocco’s Ourika Gardens, where YSL Beauty grows botanical ingredients for its suite of makeup, skincare products, and fragrances. (I’ll never forget hand-picking jasmine flowers that would end up in bottles of Libre perfume.) It’s as good a crash course as I could’ve dreamed of, and along the way, I tested out hundreds of dollars’ worth of product to determine which are the most exciting, covetable ones to try this year. DashDividers_1_500x100 Loveshine Plumping Lip Oil Gloss, $40 In a crowded landscape of lip gloss-treatment hybrids, YSL Beauty’s Loveshine is a standout. The shades are curated and truly unique — my two favorites are California Sunshine, a shimmery cinnamon, and Thunder Stealer, a sparkly frosted lavender that feels like it’s from the future. In addition to a kiss of color, the formula has ginger and pepper oils to boost circulation and naturally plump lips. DashDividers_1_500x100 Make Me Blush 24H Buildable Powder Blush, $45 These adorable powder blushes remind me of French macarons — colorful, cute, and utterly irresistible. Available in both matte and satin finishes, these silky powder blushes are intensely pigmented and have pretty impressive staying power. (They held up all day, even on the hottest days walking around Marrakech.) My favorites of the bunch are Peachy Nude and Berry Bang, but to be honest, there’s not a blah shade in the bunch. DashDividers_1_500x100 Candy Glaze Lip Gloss Stick, $42 Lip gloss in a stick? Genius, if you ask me. It’s easier to apply without a mirror, less prone to getting everywhere, and when the packaging is this good, what’s not to love? I love to wear this with a lip pencil for an easy, effortless lip combo. You can also wear it alone for a barely-there hint of hydrating color. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lash Clash Extreme Volume Mascara, $33 I’m pretty picky with my mascara. I like my lashes to look effortlessly fluttery and defined, even when I do a more bold, voluminous lash look. I’m wearing YSL Beauty’s Lash Clash mascara here, and as you can see, it’s all about flirty, look-at-me lashes without any heaviness or clumps. YSL Beauty’s Global Makeup Artist Sam Visser gave me a life-changing tip for applying lots of mascara: Wipe off any excess from the wand before applying it to your lashes, which gives you more control over building up coats as needed.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Couture Mini Clutch Eyeshadow Palette, $68 These compact eyeshadow quads are high fashion, but for your eyes. There are two new palettes to look forward to this year, Captivating Dunes and Sunrise Safari, and the former has become my current obsession. It’s the perfect mix of earthy, cool-toned neutrals that are super elevated. I like to apply a wash of champagne shimmer all over my lid, and then define the crease with the medium taupe. For date night, I turn it into a smoky eye with the dark chocolate matte along the upper and lower lash lines. The powders are silky and soft to wear — never chalky — and are actually infused with fig cactus oil from the Ourika Gardens that I toured.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Candy Glow Tinted Butter Balm, $42 Yes, it’s a lip balm — but a really, really nice one. Like, the nicest I own. I love the shade 8B (a warm rose) to prep my lips while I do the rest of my makeup. It’s silky and hydrating, but not too heavy. I will be honest, the tint on this is quite sheer; but that isn’t a dealbreaker for me since I’m not a huge lipstick person anyway. The packaging is also stunning, and looks like something Marie Antoinette would’ve kept in her vanity.  Libre Eau De Parfum, $140 I’m not normally a floral perfume girlie but Libre’s gorgeous mix of orange blossom, jasmine, lavender, and musk is like a warm, sensual embrace in olfactive form. According to perfumers Anne Flipo and Carlos Benaim, Libre was born from the idea of starting with a fougère — a traditionally masculine structure within fragrance — and adding feminine, floral notes for a juxtaposition. The result? A sexy, complex floral scent that evokes both strength and sensuality. We filled our own bottles in the gardens, and I love how the refills include two bottles’ (aka 100mL) worth of juice for $135. (A 50mL bottle retails for $140.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Hyper Luminize Powder Highlighter, $55 I’m not a huge fan of highlighter, since I already have very oily skin that usually gleams a bit too much on its own. (I also lived through the unicorn strobing trend of the mid-2010s and had years of highlighter fatigue!) But trust YSL Beauty to snap me out of my funk with this finely milled powder highlighter. It’s shockingly subtle, which is why it’s so good: I added a dusting along high points of the face (and even as eyeshadow!) for a bit of eye-catching brightness, as if I turned up my phone’s exposure levels. Hypnotic Honey is the prettiest golden-hour shade that doesn’t look too pigmented — just an expensive, gilded glow. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Nordstrom's Anniversary Sale is officially open to the public, and you know what that means: epic deals on designer fashion, chic home decor, and so, so much more. However, it’s my professional belief that the most compelling deals happen to be in the beauty space — not that I'm biased or anything.Unlike any other beauty event, the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is packed with sale-exclusive value sets on makeup, skincare, hair, fragrance, and beyond that you can only 1) find at Nordstrom and 2) shop for the duration of the sale. We're talking rarely (if ever) discounted brands like Charlotte Tilbury, Dyson, Westman Atelier, and Byredo, among many other treasures. For your haul, we've cherry-picked the 29 most stellar (and likely to sell out fast) deals that you’d be remiss not to cart ASAP.At Refinery29, we’re here to help you navigate this overwhelming world of stuff.
