If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Ask any beauty insider and they’re bound to have at least one Paula’s Choice product in their skincare arsenal. Since the brand’s inception 30 years ago, it has earned a solid reputation as a source for science-backed, no-nonsense skincare. Not one for flashy packaging, the brand’s appeal lies within its high-performing formulations that do exactly what they say on the packaging. In fact, Paula’s Choice was one of the very first brands to pioneer leave-on exfoliants — namely the BHA Liquid Exfoliant, now a staple in many editors’ skincare routines — way back in 2000. Paula’s Choice also operates the Beautypedia Skincare Ingredient Checker, a comprehensive dictionary explaining the benefits of different compounds found in skincare (names like bakuchiol and omega fatty acids come to mind). As you might expect, it has become an invaluable resource for beauty obsessives and novices alike. It’s this commitment to ingredient transparency that keeps the brand in heavy rotation on our bathroom shelves. With the Sephora Spring Savings Event in mind, our editors share their favorite Paula’s Choice products that they’ve finished down to the very last drop — and will be topping up before the sale ends. DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant, $35 “When I was dealing with hormonal breakouts a few years ago, a top dermatologist recommended Paula’s Choice 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant — and I’ve used it ever since. With 2% salicylic acid, it’s the perfect concentration for sinking into pores and breaking up the mix of oil and dead skin cells that causes congestion. Since incorporating it into my nighttime routine, my skin has become clearer, with no blackheads or pesky whiteheads, and my hyperpigmentation fades much more quickly. It’s so gentle that I feel confident using it every night. My routine is as follows: Cleanse, apply the BHA Liquid Exfoliant and finish with a simple moisturizer. Easy!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice Pro-Collagen Peptide Plumping Moisturizer, $49 “My skin is always craving more hydration in the spring, and this Paula’s Choice Peptide Moisturizer is what I use to keep it bouncy and plump. The formula contains a trio of peptides that send signals to skin cells to produce more collagen and lock in moisture. I’ve noticed my skin looking more awake with continued use, and it has helped reduce the appearance of the fine lines on my forehead. The fast-absorbing texture sits beautifully under makeup and sunscreen, too. I’m nearly done with my bottle since I keep applying pumps of this to other dry patches of my body, such as my elbows and inner thighs.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice Clinical 1% Retinol Treatment, $65 “When I discovered this retinol treatment last year, I used it down to the last drop. The 1% retinol packs a punch, resurfacing the skin, smoothing out fine lines, fading hyperpigmentation and keeping breakouts at bay. I was initially wary of the added vitamin C, which usually irritates my skin, and I feared the combination with retinol would be a disaster. But by following the instructions to a T (only using it three evenings a week and pairing it with a simple moisturizer) I was impressed by the results. It completely banished the little bumps under my skin, especially on my forehead. If you’re using this, be sure to wear sunscreen during the day, as retinol can make skin more sensitive to the sun.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice Resist Hydrating Fluid SPF 50, $39 “It takes a lot for a sunscreen product to impress me. I’m really fussy about texture: anything deemed too greasy, pills easily, or breaks me out goes straight into the trash. This Paula’s Choice sunscreen passed my wear test with flying colors. I sampled it at a department store and liked the milky-fluid texture so much that I immediately added it to my collection. Beyond offering SPF 50 broad spectrum protection, it boasts hydrating glycerin and green tea extract, which helps to calm redness and irritation. It has a lightweight, satiny finish that makes my skin look and feel dewier; I like to pop this over my bare face when I’m running out of time for my usual daytime skincare routine. The texture is so lovely, it makes reapplication feel like much less of a chore.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice Pro-Collagen Peptide Gloss Balm, $24 “This lip balm has made a big difference to my dry, constantly chapped lips. The non-sticky formula glides on effortlessly, and I love how the slightly curved applicator delivers just the right amount of product. It contains a blend of peptides that hydrate and plump the skin and boost collagen production. The product comes with a subtle sweet scent and feels less heavy and sticky compared to other peptide lip treatments I’ve tried. I often slather on this balm the night before I’m due to wear lipstick, so my lips emerge conditioned and prepped with as little creasing as possible.” — Venus Wong, senior writer Shop Sephora DashDividers_1_500x100 Paula’s Choice 10% Niacinamide Booster, $49 “I have oily, acne-prone skin, and this serum is a go-to of mine whenever I’m feeling congested. You can use it alone as your serum step, but I love cocktailing it into my AM and PM moisturizer to boost it. Niacinamide is one of my favorite ingredients because of its brightening and texture-refining properties, and the feel of this one is so lightweight and luxurious that I genuinely look forward to using it daily.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer Shop Sephora Shop our favorite Paula’s Choice bestsellers This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In general, my parents blessed me with some very solid genes; I inherited a thick, healthy head of hair, my dad’s full eyebrows, and my mom’s olive complexion. But I never lucked out in the lip department. They’re perfectly fine and cute, but I wouldn’t describe them as pouty or naturally plump. Fortunately, I’ve found that half a vial — and not a drop more — of Volbella works wonders to add a bit of fullness that still looks natural. I don’t get filler like clockwork (mostly because it hurts and my lips bruise very easily), but rather whenever I notice them looking a little thin or a month before a special occasion. However, it’s been over five months since I’ve last gotten my lips injected — and this drugstore lip plumper is the reason why. French drugstore brand RoC is perhaps best known for its retinol products, but its new Derm Correxion Lip Volumizer is a must-try, IMHO. For needle-phobes like me, plumping glosses and treatments are a game-changer for achieving fuller lips. I’ve tried ones that burn with the fire of a million scovilles and others that sadly don’t do much of anything. Then there are the rare ones that work beautifully — but come with a triple-digit price tag. (I love Ourself’s Lip Filler, but at $145, I ration it.)  RoC Derm Correxion Lip Volumizer, $30 RoC’s Derm Correxion Lip Volumizer goes on as a clear glossy balm and has only a hint of minty tingle upon application — no burning or stinging. (The metal tip also enhances the cooling effect.) It adds a slight flush to lips but nothing like the inflamed, reddish swelling that I’ve experienced with other plumping glosses. (Let’s just say that Too Faced Lip Injection Maximum Plump is not for the faint of heart.)  While RoC’s lip volumizer features capsicum frutescens fruit extract (derived from the cayenne chilli pepper plant) as well as ginger root oil, these ingredients very gently boost blood flow to the lips — and that’s when it starts to work its magic: It gives my lips a kiss of rosy color (they are naturally a pale purplish pink) and visibly fills them out. Plus, unlike other plumping glosses, I feel like RoC’s actually hydrates my lips from the inside out, thanks to some tried and true ingredients. One of the hero ingredients is hyaluronic acid — the same stuff that’s in most cosmetic fillers as well as topical skincare products. Hyaluronic acid is beloved for its ability to hydrate the deepest levels of the skin and lend a plumping effect that softens fine lines and refines texture. Unsurprisingly, it has the same benefit for your lips, thanks to its moisture-binding properties that offer short- and long-term hydration to smooth and soften sin.  Next, there’s one of my all-time favorite skincare ingredients: Peptides. I love peptide serums and moisturizers since they nourish and strengthen my skin barrier. RoC’s pro-collagen peptide complex not only improves the elasticity and appearance of lips but reduces the appearance of wrinkles and enhances lip shape and contours. If all that wasn’t enough, RoC’s lip volumizer also contains squalane and shea butter for hydration, which is partially why I find it so similar to a lip balm — because it pretty much is one! In addition to an immediate, temporary plumping effect after just one use, the brand also touts long-term results with regular application, so I’ll be sure to report back once I’ve finished my first tube. At $30, it’s not the cheapest lip plumper I’ve tried, but it’s certainly nowhere near the most expensive. (For comparison, a single lip filler session in the US averages around $742, but can exceed $1,000.) The key takeaway is that it just plain works (see my before-and-after photos for photographic proof), minus the uncomfortable spiciness that comes with capsaicin-based plumpers. Dare I say, the perfect lip plumper doesn’t ex— Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/best-drugstore-conditioner-48765461",
    "description": "Regardless of the time of year, a good conditioner is worth its weight in gold. Whether we want to keep our hair moisturized in the cold winter months or give it a lustrous shine in the spring and summer, conditioners are our first go-tos when our hair craves some much-needed TLC. Not only are they typically extremely hydrating, but there are now conditioners on the market that target specific hair concerns, such as healing split ends, addressing frizz, and protecting color-treated hair. It's even popular (especially in the natural-hair community) to use leave-in conditioner to aid the creation of natural hairstyles. Besides their versatility, the best thing about conditioners is that you don't always have to spend a lot of money to get a quality product that will ensure good results. Drugstore conditioners can be just as, if not more, effective than their higher-end counterparts - for a fraction of the price. Many people have found a holy-grail conditioner that works magic in their routine on a random Target or CVS trip. There are admittedly quite a few options to choose from, so we narrowed down twelve of the best drugstore conditioners ahead.",

It's never too late to join the Beauty Insider Program if you want to get in on the savings (we recommend you do; it's free). To reap the savings, use code SAVEMORE at checkout. Here are the dates each tier of Beauty Insiders can shop and the percentage off they get: Sephora Rouge members get 20 percent off the entirety of the sale online and in stores from April 4 through April 14. Sephora VIB members receive 15 percent off and gain access to the sale online and in stores starting April 8 through April 14. Sephora Insiders receive 10 percent off and gain access to the sale online and in stores April 8 through April 14. All tiers get 30 percent off Sephora Collection items from April 4 to April 14. All tiers will also get free shipping with no mininum spend. Fun Fact: all tiers will have access to participating brand events in-store, with exclusive Gifts With Purchase (stackable with the Savings Event promotion) for the duration of the sale. You can check out this events page to see what's happening near you. Can the Sephora Savings Event Discount Be Used More Than Once? Yes, you can use the code multiple times throughout the sale. However, Rouge members get to share their 20 percent off discount one time only to a non-Rouge friend from April 4 to April 7. Best Deals From the 2025 Sephora Savings Event The Sephora Beauty Insiders Savings Event is a great opportunity to save on top-tier beauty products you've been eyeing. And we've cracked the code on how to shop the sale to get the most bang for your buck and shop smart (spoiler alert: it's girl math). To rack in the most amount of savings, we recommend shopping value sets and gift sets. More often than not, you end up saving money replenishing products and sometimes get to enjoy extra products, essentially for free. It's also the ideal time to shop for splurge-worthy beauty tools and products, like an LED face mask, new drops from Fenty Skin (for Rouge members), the coveted Libre parfum from Yves Saint Laurent, or the Haus Labs foundation you've been seeing all over TikTok. That way, you can splurge on something you've been eyeing or give into that urge to purchase something you've been influenced to buy with a price cut. If you're a member who's looking for great items to shop, you've come to the right place. We curated our favorite beauty products from Sephora ahead, including several editor-vetted picks. Hurry and stock up on your beauty favorites and splurges before it's too late. Take a look at our top picks ahead.",
