If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. From millennial pink to mocha mousse, countless color trends have captivated fashion and beauty. This spring, there‚Äôs no question that butter yellow is having its moment in the sun; the understated hue first caught our attention during last year‚Äôs spring runway collections (which are now hitting boutiques) and has been virtually inescapable now that warmer weather has finally entered the chat. And as much as we have a color crush on butter yellow dresses and accessories, we would argue that the pastel shade is prettiest when worn on your fingertips. ‚ÄúButter yellow is the perfect neutral to celebrate spring,‚Äù New York City-based nail artist Miss Pop tells Refinery29. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs light and feels especially fresh and sunny as we leave winter behind.‚Äù Ahead, we scoured our Explore pages and beyond to find the freshest takes on butter yellow nail art ‚Äî¬†and they‚Äôre easier to DIY than you think. Below, find 11 designs that we‚Äôll be wearing all spring long. Darling Daisies View this post on Instagram A post shared by Megan Rose (@gel.bymegan) Daisies are a quintessential spring motif, making them a perfect match for nail art design featuring butter yellow nail art ‚Äî like this look crafted by Amy Rickaby. Use a dotting tool to carefully make five small dots in the color of your choice (white being the go-to), leaving room for a middle dot. ‚ÄúEssie‚Äôs Rev It Up is the perfect buttery yellow for the center of a daisy [in a] floral look,‚Äù recommends Miss Pop. Seeing Stars View this post on Instagram A post shared by Miss Pop (@misspopnails) Another clever use of butter yellow? Paint a constellation on your nails (like this look courtesy of Miss Pop) with a long, thin detail brush like Doublemoss‚Äô Arte 4 to meticulously craft stars, mixing and matching colors for extra fun factor. Butter Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lights Lacquer (@lightslacquer) Skip the nail art altogether and take your butter yellow mani to the next level with a chrome finish, inspired by this look by Anahi Victoria. Start with a pale yellow base with peachy undertones (like Lights Lacquer in Afternoon Tea), and add chrome powder on top for a luminous finish.¬† Let The Sunshine In View this post on Instagram A post shared by ùêâùêöùê¨ùê¶ùê¢ùêßùêû (@notorioushandjobz) The aura nail trend is still alive and well, thank you very much ‚Äî¬†and it works perfectly with the butter yellow color trend. Get this look created by Jasmine Allen at home by applying a milky white base to nails, and carefully dab on a hazy aura motif in your gradient choice of sunny yellows using a disposable sponge. (Miss Pop loves OPI‚Äôs Infinite Shine in Slay Hello to Yellow, a sheer bright yellow with a hint of sparkle.) Glazed French View this post on Instagram A post shared by NailsxMina (@nailsxmina) A French tip will never go out of style. You can use a brush, nail stamp tool, or sticker guides to create the classic shape (created here by manicurist Mina on Instagram) in a warm buttery hue like Essie‚Äôs Gel Couture in Atelier By The Bay. For extra luster, add a dusting of chrome powder. Wavy Baby View this post on Instagram A post shared by TGB Academy üåé (@tgbacademy) Feeling groovy? Butter yellow swirls (like this set by Charlotte Cliff) are a fun motif for DIY nail art because they don‚Äôt need to be perfectly even. Just grab a striping brush and an opaque, gel-like nail polish (anything too sheer will require multiple strokes) like OPI‚Äôs Infinite Shine in This Chic Is Bananas. A Little Lemon View this post on Instagram A post shared by MANICURE | PEDICURE | LASHES | BROWS | HAIR (@alleycatssalon) At the risk of sounding like the ingredients for a tasty marinade, lemon and butter appear to be a springtime match made in heaven. Alley Cats Salon‚Äôs cheeky take on a classic French tip features meticulously painted lemon wedges adorning nail tips.¬† Spot On View this post on Instagram A post shared by JENNA KELLY | Utah Nail Artist (@nails_by_jenna.k) Polka dots are a quintessential spring print, making them a natural choice for nail art ‚Äî manicurist Cassie Morse‚Äôs look here is a prime example. Since butter yellow is basically a springtime neutral, it‚Äôll look great with any color dots you choose (or several, if you desire). Simply grab your dotting tool and palette, and let your creativity do the rest. You can even explore using a sheer base, like Essie‚Äôs Nail Art Studio Jelly Gloss Nail Polish in Buttercup Jelly, for a fresh take on the trend. Get Gilded View this post on Instagram A post shared by Shannon Gray (@artbetweenthelines) This liquid metal manicure by manicurist Shannon Grey is a work of art. Get a similar effect at home with some 3D nail stickers sourced from Etsy and Amazon. For the base, we love Chanel‚Äôs Le Vernis in Ovni for an added touch of luxe. Coquette Core View this post on Instagram A post shared by Stacey Machin Nail Artist (@staceymachin) Combine several sweet motifs ‚Äî¬†dainty bows, tulip bouquets, and pearls ‚Äî¬†for this utterly charming springtime mani moment by nail artist Stacey Machin. Here, decals will be the easiest way to DIY at home. For a similar look, we love Deco Beauty‚Äôs Petal nail art stickers, which can be applied with tweezers and set with top coat for a salon-quality effect. Crystal Crush View this post on Instagram A post shared by Holdyn | Vegas Gel-X Nail Tech (@hkgelnails) This dazzling manicure by manicurist Holdyn Kim lends major wow factor thanks to crystal studs and chic French tips. Once you‚Äôve settled on your base color (and any nail art, like the French tips here), apply stick-on nail gems like these ones from Ulta Beauty ‚Äî no glue required.¬† Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glaze-supergloss-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Like so many, my rollercoaster of a hair journey began in my teens: When I was 15, I took box dye and attempted to give myself blonde highlights. The result was an embarrassing brassy, brassy mess. Three years later, in a fit of frustration at my hair‚Äôs uncontrollable, unruly nature, I cut it all off (I immediately regretted this impulsive decision). Thick, coarse, dull, and wild in its random waves and curls, my hair has always been less of a friend and more of a foe ‚Äî something to tackle and conquer. My childhood is punctuated with memories of my mother tugging and pulling my hair into submission.¬†And no matter how many times I‚Äôve had it thinned out or layered or chemically treated, it‚Äôs always left my hair frizzy, damaged, and, quite frankly, disappointing. So, over a decade ago, I washed my hands of it all ‚Äî no more dyes, no more chemicals, no more hot tools. Nothing. I resigned myself to a life of taming it by twisting it into a French braid, or throwing it up into a topknot, or smoothing it back into a ponytail.¬† Now, I have what you call ‚Äúvirgin hair‚Äù ‚Äî hair that is healthy, that hasn‚Äôt been chemically processed (perms, straighteners) or color-treated (bleach) in at least five years. In other words, hair in its natural state, unprocessed and undamaged. Which made me the perfect person to test-drive Glaze‚Äôs Supergloss, a semipermanent conditioning gloss designed for virgin hair that‚Äôs formulated to boost shine, inject a dose of intense hydration, and enhance your natural hair color. Yes, to me, it sounded too good to be true. Yes, like all longtime beauty writers, I was a bit of a skeptic.¬† So, I went in with cautious optimism. The product promises an exceedingly easy, mess-free application ‚Äî and it truly was. As a child, I helped my mom dye her hair at home, so I know how much of a production it can be: there‚Äôs typically a lot of mixing of things, timing of things, laying down of things to prevent stains. So many of things. But with Supergloss, you simply pull on a pair of disposable gloves, squeeze a generous dollop, and then run it evenly over damp clean strands. I covered my whole head in Chocolate Gleam ‚Äî a warm, rich chocolate-y brown shade ‚Äî in a few minutes. I let it marinate for the required 10 minutes, and rinsed it off.¬† Under the natural light of day, I saw the true extent of Supergloss‚Äô powers. Intriguingly subtle, yet delightfully impactful. The shine I so desperately wanted was very much there: there was a glossy, satiny sheen that, for once, reflected light instead of absorbing it; my texture was more defined in such a way that it cascaded down my back in soft, delicate waves; the color was a ‚Äúmy hair but better‚Äù shade that looked dimensional, not flat; and finally, thanks to Supergloss‚Äô blend of intensive conditioners (including antioxidant-rich Babassu Oil) and glossifying complexes, my strands felt both soft and strong. Healthy.¬† Because it‚Äôs a semipermanent formula, it‚Äôs good for up to 10 washes. And rest assured, no damage will be incurred ‚Äî it‚Äôs sulfate-, ammonia-, and paraben-free. Low stakes, high reward.¬† I know Supergloss isn‚Äôt for everyone. It‚Äôs a tinted moisturizer for your hair, not a full-coverage foundation. So, it‚Äôs not meant to cover grays or completely overhaul your hair color (those with non-virgin hair should check out Glaze‚Äôs range of hair toners or highlights, which were specially designed for bleached or highlighted strands). But for me ‚Äî for the first time in a long time ‚Äî I can confidently wear my hair down and embrace it in all its natural glory. You can shop Supergloss at Glazehair.com or find it at Target. .primisslate { display: none !important; } Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "description": "Building a collection of great makeup products is only half the battle, while the other is finding the best makeup brushes to make application a breeze. When searching for the best face makeup brushes, it's important to keep one thing in mind: the tool that you use to apply your makeup is just as important as the powders, liquids, and creams themselves. That's why when we find a makeup brush we like, we stick to it. While many of us typically search beauty retailers like Sephora and Ulta Beauty for new makeup brushes to try, some of the best drugstore makeup brushes can be found at the likes of Target, CVS, and Amazon. On the list ahead, we've rounded up our favorite brushes of all time - ones that have earned that title not only for their ability to seamlessly apply our beauty products but also for their ultrasoft bristles, not-so-hefty price tags, and durability. Some are new to the market, while others have been our editors' go-tos for years. Whether it's a buffing foundation brush that pairs beautifully with all formulas and gives skin an airbrushed finish, a dense eyeshadow brush to pack on the pigment from your favorite palette, or a travel-friendly kabuki brush you'll want to bring with you everywhere, we've included them all. Check out our editors' favorite makeup brushes ahead.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/digital-lavender-nails-49141428",
    "description": "From milk-bath manicures to \"glazed-doughnut\" finishes and even the \"supermodel\" nail look, there's no shortage of nail ideas out there. But recently, industry experts are predicting that we'll see a rise in one particular color: lavender nails. Back in 2023, digital lavender nails were all the rage. \"This color was named by trend forecasting website WSGN - along with its sister company Coloro - as 2023's color of the year,\" celebrity manicurist Julie Kandalec says. \"We saw it everywhere from runways to nail and makeup looks.\" Now, light purple nails in various forms are taking over. \"Lavender always invokes the feeling of spring for me,\" celebrity manicurist Elle Gerstein says. \"It's such a tranquil color.\" If you've immediately started searching for lavender nail ideas, you'll likely find numerous manicures that can fit your personal aesthetic because the shade is so versatile. \"It's a non-boring neutral that still has some pizzazz,\" Kandalec says. Whether you're a fan of glitter, negative-space designs, or a classic french nail art, lavender-themed manicures will never steer you wrong. While single-color manicures are an easy way to get in on the fun, there are so many lavender nail designs to choose from that you're going to want to dedicate a whole Pinterest board to the ones you'll find from a simple Google search. To help you narrow down your options, we went ahead and rounded up the best lavender nail ideas that you should consider replicating at your next manicure appointment. Trust us: you may want to call ahead and secure your spot in your favorite nail tech's chair now. Experts Featured in This Article Julie Kandalec is a celebrity manicurist and a member of PS Council.",
