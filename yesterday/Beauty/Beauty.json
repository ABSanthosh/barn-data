    "description": "With New York Fashion Week underway, the most obvious place to scout for fresh haircut inspiration would be backstage. But while the myriad looks dreamed up by talented hairstylists are certainly something to behold, some of the coolest cuts can actually be spotted on the city’s street stylers.Sure, the outfits tend to take precedence over hair, but a good cut can totally transform an aesthetic. This season alone, we’ve spotted razor-sharp bobs, ‘90s layers and, anything-but-boring medium-length chops to name a few styles. Without further ado, here are our favorites straight from NYC’s bustling streets this fashion week. All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission.Here's picture proof that the blunt bob haircut is going nowhere. This shoulder-grazing chop is elevated by the shine-enhancing chocolate cherry hair color. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylists predict that triple XL hair, essentially long, long lengths, will reign supreme in 2025. These flowing goddess braids spotted on a guest outside the Christopher John Rogers runway show are beautiful. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Elevate any updo by asking your hairstylist for dainty face-framing pieces like this guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Hairstylist Tom Smith anticipates that bangs will become a hairstyle in their own right this year — and he's not wrong. This cut features blunter pieces among wispier sections of hair, and the result is totally unique. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.As seen outside Collina Strada, this jaw-skimming bob features shorter, wispier, face-framing pieces, which can be blown-out to add a little volume and variety. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're calling it: The “kicked” bob is the cut of the season. It's characterized by gentle flicks at the ends where the hair turns upward. Invest in a good flat iron like ghd Chronos Max, $349 to achieve a similar look. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The burnished copper color is the cherry on top of this curly pineapple hairstyle spotted on a guest outside Christian Siriano. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.The side bang is back. We're especially into this longer, curled, and more voluminous style spied on a guest outside the Christian Siriano show. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.Feathered layers? Yup. Face-framing pieces? Check. Shoulder-skimming length? Perfect. This cut — seen on a guest outside Chistian Siriano — nails three 2025 haircut trends in one. Photographed by Flordalis Espinal.We're more than a little obsessed with this bluntly-sliced, wavy bob seen on Allure editor-in-chief Jessica Cruel.

    "description": "January is that curious month where our new-year ambitions collide with the reality of winter. Many of us started off with grand plans to transform our lives — whether it was working out more or finally committing to daily journaling — but when it’s freezing outside, staying bundled up on the couch suddenly feels like the more reasonable choice. The anonymous data gathered from our shopping stories shows that our readers also felt this tug-of-war between lofty aspirations and the urge to hibernate.Exhibit A: The surge in running shoes and workout clothes. Clearly, many of you were determined to keep moving despite the temptation to stay indoors (honestly, kudos). At the same time, skincare buys also saw a major uptick, signaling a collective resolve to invest in self-care during the colder, drier months. These shopping trends prove that the start of 2025 was as much about nurturing our goals as it was about embracing comfort.

    "title": "Confessions of an NFL WAGs Makeup Artist",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nfl-wags-makeup-artist-interview-49335687",
    "description": "Image Source: Getty / Gilbert Flores Kevin Mazur Scott Winters AnthiaCumming Yuriy_K and Illustration by Aly Lim Before Taylor Swift became the NFL WAGs poster child - signature red lip, custom bomber jacket, and all - there have, of course, been other sports wives and partners. Behind many of them on the Kansas City Chiefs (plus 14 other NFL teams) is makeup artist Allison Kaye. After getting her start in the beauty industry a decade ago, Kaye's entry to the WAGs world came by way of the 2021 NFL Draft. In April of that year, she was presented with the opportunity to do the glam for Sophie Scott, who is Mac Jones (the now quarterback of the Jacksonville Jaguars)'s girlfriend. From that night on, word of mouth did its magic. Other WAGs started following her on Instagram, and soon thereafter, the bookings for game day came pouring in. \"I thought doing makeup for the NFL draft was a once in a lifetime opportunity, but it turned into something much bigger,\" she tells PS. \"My favorite part is that now teams will fly me out to do their makeup for Sunday game days.\" Here's exactly what a day in the life of a WAGS makeup artist is like. Getting Ready For Game Day First, it's worth noting that Kaye is hired by the WAGS themselves - not the NFL. Because of that, \"my schedule is random.\" Kaye splits her time between Cleveland and Miami, so during football season she'll often glam up the WAGS of the Browns and Dolphins teams in each respective city. That means she also has to fly out to wherever another team is playing, which is paid for by her WAGS clients. \"Last year I was flown out by the Pittsburgh Steelers, Washington Commanders, Philadelphia Eagles, and the Jacksonville Jaguars to do glam on location for a home game this season,\" she says. As for the day-of run of show, she'll typically head to either their house or hotel two to three hours before kickoff, working with anywhere from two to eight WAGS per game, depending. \"The girls like to get to the stadium early because they can go on the field and say hi to their husbands and get photos before the game,\" she says, adding that she'll send each client off with their own \"makeup touchup kit\" to reapply as needed. While she has done some light-touch makeup for the athletes themselves - mostly a little foundation, concealer, and eyebrow grooming - for photoshoots, game day makeup is mostly for the WAGS. Image Source: Courtesy Allison Kaye Her Game Day Makeup Picks The makeup looks vary depending on the WAGs' preferences, but typically her clients opt for a \"neutral soft glam,\" she says, which usually entails a medium to full-coverage foundation, blush, bronzer, neutral or pink lip color, and neutral eyeshadow. More importantly, however, is that the makeup stay put all day. To help, she leans on the Temptu Airbrush Foundation ($52) \"because it is waterproof and sweat-proof.\" Then, she reaches for neutral shadows like the 12 shades in the Makeup by Mario Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette ($50) and Dibs Beauty Duo blushes, both the powder Duet ($34) and the cream Desert Island ($36). For lips, Kaye swears by Charlotte Tilbury's lip products \"because they are long wear and blend nicely on the face.\" (We personally recommend the brand's Lip Cheat Lip Liner ($25) for the same reason.) If you want something a little more hydrating, she recommends the Revlon Super Lustrous Glimmer Lip Oil ($9), which can be layered on top of any lipstick color. \"[It's] also really moisturizing, so my my clients' lips don't get dried out – especially during long game days out in the cold weather,\" she says. If you're after a Swift-approved lip pick, we recommend her tried-and-true Pat McGrath Labs LiquiLust Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick ($34) in the shade Elson 4. \"A lot of teams aren't able to wear a classic red lip due to the teams colors but I do know a few of the Chiefs girls love to wear red lipstick because for them, it matches,\" she says. Her Super Bowl Beauty Prep Like years past, Kaye will be busy with her makeup brush ahead of the 2025 Super Bowl - no, not on Swift (who has her own glam team, as you would imagine a globally renowned pop star might), but for 12 WAGs throughout the day. She'll be working with everyone from Lyndsay Bell and Emily Winchester, of Chiefs WAGs fame, to Carolyn Estephany of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Sydney Warner on the 49ers side. \"I've had the pleasure of doing some of my Super Bowl Sunday clients multiple times throughout the regular season and at past Super Bowls,\" she says. \"It's so fun for me to have the opportunity to glam them time and time again.\" Typically, when curating game-day looks, \"I always ask for [inspiration] photos and for them to tell me what they are wearing. A majority of the clients that hire me tell me that they trust me and to glam them with what would be my signature glam, a neutral soft glam.\" Whether you're a major football fan and are watching for the game itself or will just be tuning in for fear of missing out, you can count on one thing: it will be a night to remember.

    "description": "While testing a new mascara or lipstick will never get old, I get especially giddy when I get my hands on a new beauty tool. From microcurrent devices to smart hairdryers, there are a lot of innovative gadgets out there that bring with them professional-quality results - and I want to trial them all. The latest high-tech tool to make its way across my desk - and into my routine permanently - is the new Shark Beauty CryoGlow LED Face Mask ($350). How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. While I'm a long-time user of LED therapy and have a few at-home red light masks in my possession already, this new device from Shark Beauty also includes cryotherapy benefits, a combination I've never seen before in my many years as a beauty editor. After trying it for over three weeks, it really knocked my socks off. Allow me to explain. About the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask This LED face mask contains high-energy, tri-wick LEDs in blue, red, and deep-penetrating infrared light. It features cryo technology in the undereye area that can be used during every LED treatment or on its own. It's cordless, allowing you to move freely during your treatment. The mask comes with a rechargeable smart remote that allows you to select your program and view your progress. It contains four treatment settings: Better Aging for collagen and wrinkles, Skin Clearing for acne, Skin Sustain to maintain your results, and Undereye Revive for depuffing. It was developed with dermatologists, is backed by clinical testing, and is FDA-cleared. What I Like About the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask I've used my fair share of LED masks over the years, so when I first heard Shark Beauty was releasing its own version, I figured it'd be more of the same. This is not to say it wouldn't be great, but I didn't expect it to be very different from its competitors. Boy, was I wrong. Shark's CryoGlow is the smartest LED mask I've tried thus far. Humor me while I nerd out a little: The mask contains high-energy, tri-wick LEDs in blue, red, and deep-penetrating infrared light. What that means is each bulb has the capability to produce red, blue, or infrared light, allowing for full-face coverage no matter what treatment you choose. Many other masks on the market have different bulbs for different light settings, which means, for example, you could be getting red light from half of the bulbs in the mask and blue light from the other half, allowing for more gaps between treatment areas. The fit of the mask is also worth applauding. The hard shell features padding and an adjustable head strap meant to mimic the fit of snow goggles, which is to say it's super comfortable and secure. While some masks are flexible and sit flush with the face, this one is designed to hover at the perfect distance from your face to allow for better light coverage. Now, onto the super advanced remote that comes attached to the mask. The small controller features a wheel-style button that allows you to power on/off the device and toggle through the treatments. There's a small screen that displays each one, along with the key benefits and length of treatment. There's also an option to view your progress and see how many days you've used the mask. Being the impatient girl I am, I love that the remote shows you how much time is left while you're using it. The four treatments have you covered no matter what your skin goals are. Better Aging, which lasts six minutes and uses red and infrared light, promotes collagen and minimizes wrinkles; Skin Clearing is eight minutes long using blue, red, and infrared, to kill acne-causing bacteria; the four-minute Skin Sustain option uses red, blue, and infrared light and is designed to be used after you complete eight weeks of one of the other treatments to keep up the benefits you'll have seen. Lastly, you have Undereye Revive, which is a 5- to 15-minute treatment to depuff the undereye area; it has three temperature settings and can be used alone or coupled with any of the other LED treatments. I like to use the antiaging treatment for overall skin maintenance every day, while I reserve the acne treatment for whenever I'm breaking out. No matter what treatment I'm doing, though, I turn on the undereye cooling treatment, which helps with inflammation and puffiness. It feels heavenly and leaves me looking refreshed when I'm done. How to Use the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Using the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is simple. First, you'll want to ensure the head straps are properly fitted so the mask stays on while you walk around, should you choose to do so. From there, power on the device by long-pressing the button on the remote and scrolling to toggle to your desired treatment. The mask will instantly light up, and you'll hear a low fan running to ensure it doesn't overheat (don't worry, it's not too loud; you'll still be able to hear the TV or TikTok). You should only use it on clean, dry skin sans any skin-care products. Because of this, I usually reach for it either first thing in the morning or at the end of the day, after washing my face but before I do the rest of my routine. I'll use it while I'm scrolling on TikTok or cleaning my apartment. What to Consider Before Trying the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Though you may notice a subtle glow to your skin after using the mask just once, it's important to keep in mind that real results take time. Consistency is key with LED therapy, and the more you use it, the better your skin will get. Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Worth the Splurge? LED masks are expensive, and the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is no different. However, the brand did manage to make its device cheaper than many other options on the market. At $350, it's still a splurge, but it's well worth the price tag, in my opinion. It allows you to get a medspa-quality treatment (which can run a couple of hundred dollars for a single facial) from the comfort of your home, and if you use the mask regularly, it'll eventually pay for itself. Where Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Available? The Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is available on the brand's website. Rating:",
