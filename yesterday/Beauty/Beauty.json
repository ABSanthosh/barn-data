    "description": "Finding the perfect skin tint takes a lot of trial and error. A good one should offer lightweight coverage and a natural finish that subtly enhances your skin, without sitting heavy or erasing your features. Add reliable SPF protection (which can complicate the texture of the formulation) to the list of requirements, and the search gets even more challenging. So when Merit Beauty unveiled The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45, $38, a tinted mineral sunscreen that offers both sheer and buildable coverage, not to mention broad spectrum UV protection, we were quick to take notice. This new launch is a labor of love from the brand by all accounts. It took two years of development and more than 50 formulation attempts to get the consistency and finish just right. The sun protection comes from zinc oxide, a mineral filter that shields against UV rays by scattering and reflecting them away from the skin’s surface. Also featured in the ingredient lists are moisturizing plant-derived emollients (in place of heavy silicones) and ultra-fine natural powders for a weightless and even application. We got our hands on this highly anticipated launch and have been wearing it as our go-to SPF over the past month. Read ahead for our honest thoughts on why it deserves a top spot in your summer beauty routine. DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director She tried: Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45, $38, in shade 24 “I don’t say this lightly: this is hands down the best tinted sunscreen I’ve ever tried. It’s replaced my foundation — and even my concealer. The texture is like a lightweight lotion, and whether I use my fingers or a brush, it melts into my skin easily, offering medium coverage that blurs dark circles and the marks left behind by breakouts. The finish sits in a cozy space between dewy and matte, so I don’t need to powder over the top, and the staying power is excellent. I can go a full day at work — in office air, no less — and come home to more or less immaculate coverage. “On my hand, shade 24 skews a little pink, so I was apprehensive it wouldn’t suit my green undertones. But once on my face, it blends seamlessly into my light olive complexion, giving it a more uniform appearance without erasing my features. If I wanted to wear this on its own without blush or bronzer, I absolutely could, and it wouldn’t look like I was wearing a mask. One thing to note: it’s important to use a dedicated sunscreen first. Yes, this contains SPF 45, but it’s well known that we rarely apply enough SPF makeup (a teaspoon or two finger-lengths for face and neck) to properly protect ourselves from UV damage. So I layer it over my trusty sunscreen — it’s like insurance for my skin.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Venus Wong, senior writer She tried: Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45, $38, in shade 22 “To me, the hallmark of a truly great sunscreen will always be whether I’m willing to wear it on an unbearably hot day. Anything that feels too heavy and icky breaks me out and will promptly get the boot. I took The Uniform out for a whirl on my recent travels around Asia, where temperatures hovered around 90°F with super high humidity, and I’m happy to report that it passed with flying colors. Out of all the sunscreens I’ve tried, this one has one of the most imperceptible textures. The carefully calibrated formula has definitely made a difference here; it feels very light and powdery and spreads evenly across the skin. There were days I almost forgot I’d put this on, if not for the flattering glow it imparts. For me, shade 22 provides the ideal level of coverage: just enough to neutralize redness and blur blemishes while maintaining a genuine skin finish. When it gets really hot this summer, I feel comfortable ditching all my other makeup and just wearing a layer of this tint, with my trusty Dr. Jart+ SPF stick as the final touch.” DashDividers_1_500x100 L’Oréal Blackett, Editor, Unbothered She tried: Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45, $38, in shades 10 and 12 “I’m not the easiest to please when it comes to skin tints with sunscreen. With a medium-deep skin tone and a golden to neutral undertone, some skin tints tend to leave me with a grey-ish, dull finish — a familiar story for anyone with brown skin. This is not the case with Merit’s tinted sunscreen. This formula blends with my skin beautifully, slightly evening out my skin tone and leaving a fresh glow. It’s barely perceptible and doesn’t look like I’m wearing any makeup, but that’s the point. It is very lightweight and perfect for everyday wear — I’ve even been wearing it to the gym. However, I still need to go in with a concealer as it doesn’t blur my dark undereyes and blemishes. “This is not for the full coverage-loving girlies. I wear other skin tints that offer me more coverage, such as Fenty Beauty Eaze Drop Blurring Skin Tint, $38 (shade 18 for my shade twins!), and Beauty Pie’s Luminous Mineral Skin Tint with SPF 40. Still, I love that Merit’s tinted sunscreen offers some of the highest sun protection and is a great shade match. I also have a darker shade of the skin tint on deck for my upcoming travels; I get significantly darker within five minutes of being in the sun and love that the tint contains SPF 45 and can help me prevent pigmentation issues. I typically wear a full-coverage foundation or no foundation at all, so this gives me a nice, reliable in-between option.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Vanese Maddix, contributing beauty writer She tried: Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45, $38, in shade 8 “The Uniform has quickly become a staple in my routine. The formula is lightweight and blends effortlessly into the skin. As someone who prefers her skin tints and foundations to sit on the lighter side, this ticks all my boxes. While I typically dislike when brands describe their shade ranges as ‘flexible’, I was pleasantly surprised to find I could actually switch between shades 6, 8, and 10, depending on the look I wanted. I also appreciate that the deeper shades are numbered first (a thoughtful detail that didn’t go unnoticed, and one I wish more brands would adopt). “My only critique is the packaging: The tube has a gray-ish tint, which makes it harder to see the true shade without swatching. The cap also falls off quite easily. It’s worth noting that the brand has created a shade range that corresponds with The Minimalist, its bestselling complexion stick, so finding your perfect match is a lot easier when you happen to own the latter. This product has shot straight to the top of my makeup bag thanks to its lovely finish and genuine lightweight feel. I wouldn’t rely on it alone to meet my recommended SPF protection, but it has become my go-to for layering over a trusted sunscreen.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer She tried: Merit The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45, $38, in shades 22 and 24 “Let’s start with the positives. This is a lovely formula. The tint gives just the right amount of coverage, and it dries down on skin while still appearing hydrated and fresh. I love how easy it is to apply with fingers. Where this product falls down for me, though, is in the very pink-leaning shade range. As a yellow-olive girlie, I found all of the shades I could make work too pink. Even the shade that corresponds to the Merit foundation stick I have (which I’ve used for years) is more pink. With this new product being a tint, the off-undertone shade isn’t a dealbreaker. Once it’s blended out with the rest of my makeup, it looks fine. But I wish I could apply this more confidently and without other makeup to offset the wrong undertone. Merit team, if you’re reading this: The yellow-olive girlies would love a shade expansion!” Like what you see?

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nuance-nails-49329198",
    "description": "When it comes time to search for nail ideas before your next salon appointment, there are plenty of places to look. Pinterest always has some goodies, as does Instagram (especially if you take a deep dive into some of your favorite celebrities' profiles). However, when you're looking for something truly innovative that no one else has seen yet, TikTok is a gold mine. The app has led to some of the best, most out-of-the-box trends, like \"junk\" nails and the \"bimbocore\" manicure, and recently, we stumbled across another new one that's worthy of your attention. \"Nuance\" nails are all over the platform, and they're perfect for anyone who wants to test out nail art without committing to anything too extreme. Ahead, nail experts break down what the trend is and how to get the look for yourself. Experts Featured in This Article Rachel Joseph is a manicurist with Nailing Hollywood in Los Angeles. Chelly Soto is a V Beauty Pure educator. Tara Haye is a manicurist with Nailing Hollywood in Los Angeles. What Are Nuance Nails? \"Nuance nails [have] a cloudy, smoky effect using nail-art inks or gel polish,\" Rachel Joseph, manicurist, says. \"Think of a marble look, but more delicate.\" The look often resembles stones or crystals, so the trend features shades that would appear in different stones, like marble or granite, which means you can expect to see a lot of browns, burnt oranges, grays, whites, and pearlescent colors or tones. The manicure also tends to incorporate 3D gold or silver accents layered on top of the marbled design. The trend is suitable for all nail shapes and lengths, which means you can either change things up and experiment with something new or stick with your tried-and-true silhouette. One thing to note, however, is that it's most frequently seen on short, squoval-shaped nails. How to Get Nuance Nails If you plan on visiting a salon, Chelly Soto, V Beauty Pure educator, says you should always arrive with inspiration photos in hand. \"We always suggest coming prepared with photos when you want to accomplish a specific look,\" she says. \"We would also suggest requesting a nail technician who is experienced with marbling designs.\" If you're planning on taking the DIY route, we'd suggest having at least a little bit of experience with nail art under your belt since this design is a bit complicated. The look can be achieved with regular nail polish, but the process will be much smoother and faster when using gel because there are numerous colors involved. To get the look, start by prepping your nails, which includes cutting and shaping them and trimming your cuticles. From there, manicurist Tara Haye says you'll want to apply a base coat. Then, select the nail polish colors for your design by looking for complementary hues. Apply the first color on top of the base coat, beginning with the lightest shade, and work your way up to the darkest, instructs Haye. From there, you'll want to create your gradient, which Hayes says you can do by starting at the cuticle area and blending the colors outward toward the tip of the nail using a sponge or nail brush. The idea is that you'll lightly dab and blend the colors together. If you're looking for inspiration to get you started, or photos you can bring with you to your nex salon appointment, keep scrolling for some of our favorite iterations of the trend.",

    "title": "I Tried a Waterless Pedicure, and I’m Never Going Back",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/waterless-pedicure-experience-49359882",
    "description": "I love getting my nails done. Actually, let me rephrase that: I love what my nails look like when they're done, but I'm not a huge fan of the process. Whether it's a manicure or a pedicure, I always feel like my time at the nail salon is wasted because I'm stuck sitting somewhere for two-plus hours and I can't even use my hands. While I do normally find pedicures on their own to be more relaxing, after one too many late nights scrolling on TikTok, I've started to get a little nervous about whether or not regular pedicures are sanitary. Enter: waterless pedicures. Waterless pedicures, which are sometimes called dry pedicures, are exactly what they sound like: pedicures without water. \"It's a more sanitary way of receiving a pedicure because you're eliminating the tub where lots of other people have placed their feet,\" celebrity manicurist Deborah Lippman says. With waterless pedicures, you can eliminate the chance of cross-contamination between clients, you'll avoid contracting a water-borne infection, and you won't come into contact with any chemicals that are used to clean the tubs in between customers. Not only that, but apparently, applying your nail polish to wet nails isn't great in terms of longevity. \"Water is very damaging and drying to nails, which leads to polish chipping sooner,\" Lippman says. \"The nail plate is porous and therefore, absorbs water while soaking, leading it to expand. If you apply polish to an expanded nail, the polish will not adhere as well and is likely to chip when the nail dries out and shrinks back to its normal state.\" Learning all of this made me game to try out my first-ever waterless pedicure, and now that I've dipped my toe (no pun intended) in the dry pedi game, I don't think I'll ever look back. My pedicure was administered by celebrity nail artist Vanessa Sanchez McCullough, and it was one of the most luxurious nail experiences I've had - no tub of water required. McCullough started by removing the old polish I had on my toenails and clipping my nails to the proper length. Then, she filed them down so they all looked even. From there, she took a buffing tool and began exfoliating my heels and the bottoms of my feet. Next, it was time to put on collagen socks. \"We aren't using any water and I want to make sure you're getting moisturized,\" Sanchez McCullough says. They fit over both of my feet and were toeless so she could continue working on my nails. While my feet were sitting in the collagen socks, Sanchez McCullough applied a cuticle remover and began removing any excess dead skin. She then trimmed my cuticles and went over my nails with a buffer. Next, she took off the collagen socks and used the leftover product to massage my feet and legs. She went over my toes one more time with nail polish remover to ensure there was no residue on them, and then she painted them using the CND Vinylux Nail Polish ($11) in the shade Wildfire. The Vinylux line doesn't require a base coat and is fast drying, but we still topped it off using the Vinylux Gel-Like Effect Top Coat ($9) and the CND SolarSpeed Spray ($10) so I could walk around ASAP after the treatment. The entire process was just as luxurious as a regular pedicure, but honestly felt a lot better. I found that after the pedicure, my feet felt more moisturized than they typically do with regular pedicures because the prolonged time soaking in water dries my skin out. My polish looked better and more vibrant than it usually does, and the backs of my feet still felt hydrated. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
