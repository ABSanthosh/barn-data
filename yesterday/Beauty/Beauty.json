    "description": "Is it just us or are dark spots so hard to eliminate? Yes, there are plenty of holy grail products like the Remedy for Dark Spots serum that take care of pigmentation and discoloration. But these treatments - which often include acids and exfoliants - can sometimes be too heavy and rough on the skin. Are there any treatments for hyperpigmentation and acne scarring that won't cause those with sensitive skin redness and contact dermatitis? Enter: kojic acid and particularly, kojic acid soaps. Kojic acid, a gentle and lightweight skin-care ingredient, is a potent antioxidant derived from fermented mushrooms. Like its sister ingredients, glycolic acid and salicylic acid, kojic acid has anti-aging and anti-inflammatory properties, helps boost elasticity in your skin, and eliminates fine lines and wrinkles. Its true selling point, however, is how well it can tackle dark spots. This antioxidant works to lighten hyperpigmentation and reduce melanin production, all of which help minimize discoloration, acne scarring, and even sun spots. Kojic acid comes in many forms, from serums to creams and the aforementioned soaps. If you're ready to add kojic acid to your skin-care routine, we suggest starting with a kojic acid soap because it's less intense. And lucky for you, we have the 10 best kojic acid soaps for every skin concern listed below. Keep scrolling to shop our favorites.",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/bella-hadid-blond-hair-color-49045413",
    "description": "Image Source: Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images Nudity may be banned from this year's Cannes Film Festival, but there are still plenty of ways to shock on the red carpet. Take Bella Hadid, for example, who decided the iconic event was the perfect time to debut a totally new hair color. We can't blame her. We are fresh off the heels of Aries season, which means we're all looking for a bit of healthy attention. Hadid's blond is soft, subtle, and perfect for summer. The shade is giving \"syrup blond\"- a trend we first reported on in October 2024. Essentially, syrup blond is a darker version of blond that incorporates honey and golden undertones. It's rich like syrup and is all about dimension. Instead of going bright or platinum blond, syrup blond is warmer. Since Hadid has been sporting an edgy-meets-western look as of late, this hair color makes sense for her. Plus, it's the perfect color to rock when you're transitioning from brunette to a brighter color, which is evidenced by her best friend, Kendall Jenner, who went with a similar hue last year. Image Source: Sylvain Lefevre/Getty Images Hadid's color was created by Jacob Schwartz, a celebrity hairstylist and Schwarzkopf Professional U.S. Hair Color Trend Ambassador, who says the blond is more of a return to Hadid's natural hue from childhood. \"Bella and I wanted to do something that felt fresh, elevated, and unexpected,\" says Schwartz. \"The blond we landed on is soft, luxurious, and ultra-feminine and was inspired by her natural hair color as a baby. We looked at some old photos of her and used that as our guide throughout the process.\" Schwartz took Hadid from brunette to blond of the course of two days. \"We took a very methodical approach to maintain the health of her hair and to ensure we got the tone exactly right-creamy, not brassy, with a luxe, natural finish,\" he says, and he used Schwarzkopf Professional's products for the blond shade. To achieve this look, Schwartz began by highlighting ultra thin sections of Hadid's hair with the Igora Vario Blond Super Plus ($31). This allowed Schwartz to lift the darker color with minimal breakage. After washing and drying the hair post-lifting, Schwartz went in with the Schwarzkopf Igora Royal Vibrance Tone ($13) and let it sit for 20 minutes before starting the low-light process a second time. From there, he detailed the roots and hairline with more Igora vibrance tone. To finish out the look, he hand-painted strands with the Igora Vario Blond Super Plus. If you want to try this look for yourself, Schwartz has a few tips. \"Ask your colorist for a dimensional blond that's customized to your skin tone and starting color. Bella's blond has depth and softness - it's not one-dimensional,\" he says. \"It's also important to make sure your colorist uses the best product .\" And of course, inspiration pictures always help the process go a little bit smoother.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/lenox-and-sixteenth-serum-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "It all started a couple of months ago at a beauty event during Art Basel. I was milling about the room when a beauty founder friend of mine told me I couldn’t leave without meeting Amy Peterson. I’d heard of her before — she’s a celebrity medical aesthetician with a confidential list of high-profile clients. As it turns out, she’s been working on launching her own line of products, inspired by the treatments she provides in her clinic located at the cross-streets of — you guessed it — Lenox and Sixteenth in Miami Beach. As someone who has had acne for nearly half her life (I’m 31), I loved the concept — and could see why it was the talk of the party. A quick intro later, and Peterson herself handed me lab samples of one of her soon-to-be hero products, The Laser Serum, right then and there as we sipped on our club sodas. The name is a nod to the product’s brightening, resurfacing benefits — not unlike the in-clinic laser treatments Peterson is known for. Powered by a trifecta of lactic, glycolic, and mandelic acids, The Laser Serum gently exfoliates skin for a visibly brighter, even-textured complexion. “I loved seeing patients’ skin change when I did a laser treatment or microneedling, but didn’t feel like there were products on the market that offered similar results without substantial downtime,” Peterson tells me. “For example, a lot of people have issues with retinol. So I felt like if I could create [something better]…” And so, Peterson’s dream product was born.” The Laser Serum, $219 After I got home, I took the tiny, nondescript sample from my purse and immediately added it to my nighttime routine. Plain bottle or not, the stuff inside was liquid gold. Within a week, I was noticing touchably smoother skin and fewer breakouts (“It’s amazing for acne as well,” she says). After I finished my second lab sample (she generously included two, so I had more than enough time to experience the product), I was convinced that this could be the next big name in luxury skincare — not something I throw around lightly. At $219, it’s expensive. But compared to other similarly priced serums, I have to say — it’s worth every penny. “In office treatments and at-home care go hand in hand,” Peterson explains. “And I actually think in-office treatments inspire better at-home care because you’re trying to protect your investment.” The serum’s texture is lightweight, but absorbs quickly,  with just a hint of tingle. After two months of nightly use, the stubborn texture around my chin and jawline had dramatically improved, and the acne hyperpigmentation on my cheeks was barely noticeable. Following The Laser Serum, Lenox and Sixteenth is also launching The Preservationist — a vitamin C serum-cream hybrid. “I wanted to create a one-stop shop vitamin C,” Peterson shares. “The texture and the glow you get is incredible.” Along with vitamin C, The Preservationist includes peptides and vegan exosomes to plump, firm, and strengthen the skin barrier. “I believe people come into the clinic and they’re either put in two different categories: corrective or maintenance,” Peterson says, adding that she’s noticed an uptick in clients looking to “pre-juvenate” — aka, get ahead of visible signs of aging with smart, savvy treatments and products that keep skin looking its best.At $249 (or bundled with The Laser Serum for $398), the decadent, creamy texture is a dream to use. I’ve been dabbing it on at night, since it’s a bit rich for my oily skin during the day. (The exception: using it as skin prep on makeup days, since it creates a glowy, hydrating base.) My skin has always tolerated vitamin C well — even in high concentrations — and I loved layering this after The Laser Serum as a moisturizer, then locking in all the goodness with an oil or additional cream, depending on how my skin was feeling. (BTW, the dark brown glass doesn’t just look luxe — it helps block sunlight and heat that can compromise the integrity of notoriously fickle vitamin C.) “I joke with my team [that] I wish they could package me in every bottle so I could show up at your house and see how you’re doing,” Peterson tells me. “The reason we have a successful practice is because I’m all over it. I want to make a difference. I want to see change. I want that to happen, and I care a lot.” Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/vitamin-d-myth-sunscreen-dark-skin?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  Of all the Black hair and skincare myths I’ve heard throughout the years as a magazine editor (and among my family and friends), the most pervasive is the “Black people don’t need sunscreen” myth. I’ve heard every anti-sunscreen conspiracy theory there is. You may have, too. Our ancestors never wore sunscreen! Black people in hot climates don’t wear sunscreen so why should we? Aren’t Black people immune to UV rays? While these are somewhat legitimate queries — especially considering Black people are rarely included in skincare research — dermatologists and estheticians are clear: Yes, Black and brown people should wear sunscreen. Period.  Regularly applied SPF is the best defense against harmful UVA and UVB rays, premature aging, hyperpigmentation, and skin cancer — this includes melanated people who are less likely to develop sunburn. And yet, recently a colleague asked a question that made me pause: “If Black and brown people are more prone to vitamin D deficiency, should Black people wear sunscreen?” I can understand the need for clarification. To say that Black and brown people need the sun is an understatement. According to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), those with darker skin are more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency, as increased melanin in the skin reduces a person’s ability to make vitamin D from sun exposure. Depression, fatigue, bone and joint pain, muscle cramps, and a low immune system are just some of the reported symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency, making it important for darker-skinned people, like myself, to acknowledge our increased risk. However, because of this, many “anti-sunscreen conspiracy theorists” are falsely purporting that those with a vitamin D deficiency should ditch sunscreen entirely, especially on TikTok where there is a reported anti-sunscreen movement.  For R29’s Sunblocked series, Black dermatologists and estheticians helped Unbothered demystify the science concerning vitamin D and sunscreen to ensure misinformation doesn’t stand in the way of adequate sun protection.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Does wearing sunscreen prevent vitamin D absorption in darker skin tones?  Since the pandemic, there have been more necessary conversations in mainstream media about how vitamin D deficiency uniquely affects Black people’s health, and there’s still more to learn. Understandably, many Black people feel conflicted by some of the advice they receive to “top up” vitamin D levels by going outdoors. Considering that the body creates vitamin D from direct sunlight on the skin when outdoors, can sunscreen — which protects skin from UVB rays — prevent vitamin D production? “Several studies have looked at the effect of sunscreen on vitamin D production, and there is little evidence that wearing sunscreen reduces the production of vitamin D by the skin,” says Dr. Derrick Phillips, a London-based consultant dermatologist. “However, these studies mainly involved fair-skinned populations,” he adds, referencing the Fitzpatrick scale, a dated measurement used to estimate the response of different types of skin to ultraviolet (UV) light. It has been criticized for its Eurocentric bias in the past. However, scientists agree that people who use sunscreen daily can maintain their vitamin D levels. “Most people don’t wear enough sunscreen [on a daily basis] for them to actually worry about the amount of vitamin D their body can truly absorb,” says Alicia Lartey, esthetician and skincare content creator. “Living in the northern hemisphere, you would have to take extra vitamin D supplements anyway,” she explains. “I always tell people to wear sunscreen, regardless of whether you are vitamin D deficient.” While regular sun exposure can help those who are vitamin D deficient, Lartey suggests prioritizing supplementation rather than standing around in the sun to see long-term health benefits. Should Black and brown people wear SPF in the winter? I live in the UK, where it can be “bad vibes” for various reasons, and the country’s dark and gloomy winters are particularly miserable. It’s during the winter months when I and many Black and brown folk are encouraged to take vitamin D supplements to support our immune health and stabilize our mood — especially when living in colder climates. “We know that skin of color is not very good at converting UV rays into vitamin D, therefore most people with Black and brown skin in the UK are vitamin D deficient and should supplement throughout the year, especially during the winter months,” explains Dr. Phillips. Dr .Phillips adds that while the majority of vitamin D is absorbed by the skin, its effects benefit the entire body. Doctors and scientists agree that some sun exposure is one of the best ways to get more vitamin D, as well as taking supplements. However, in the UK, the sun is only strong enough for us to make the vitamin from sunlight between April and September. Similarly in the US, if you live north of Los Angeles on the West Coast and north of North Carolina on the East Coast, per Health magazine, it’s reported that the lack of winter sun makes people more at risk of a vitamin D deficiency. With that being said, should Black people bother wearing SPF in the winter? Lartey says that there often times when the UV index — a measurement of the strength of sunburn-inducing UV rays — is very low in the UK. Elsewhere, a UV Index reading of 0 to 2 means low danger from the sun’s UV rays for the average person (it’s worth checking your state or city’s UV index rating for clarity). In these instances, Lartey says that wearing sunscreen isn’t particularly necessary. But it’s beneficial to get in the habit of applying it daily. “I don’t think I’m sophisticated enough to remember to check the UV index and then apply my sunscreen as needed,” Lartey says. “It’s a lot easier for people to build the habit of wearing SPF every single day so when the sun is out, it’s not an extra step that you have to take on.”  Why should Black people take sun protection seriously? While more melanin means more sun protection than people with paler skin tones, it doesn’t make Black people exempt from sun-related skin issues. “The high concentration of melanin in Black and brown skin affords a degree of protection equivalent to SPF 13. However, prolonged exposure to harmful UV rays will still result in damage to skin cells, and structures within the skin. Sunburn can also occur with prolonged exposure to high-intensity UV radiation,” explains Dr. Phillips. “Darker skin tones are more susceptible to hyperpigmentation and some conditions that are more prevalent in skin of color, such as lupus, are aggravated by sunlight. So there are many good reasons for people with highly melanated skin to wear sunscreen.” Alicia Lartey adds more food for thought. “Our definition of Black is very broad as well. My Blackness is not the same as my mum’s Blackness, who has more melanin than me, so she wouldn’t burn as quickly as I do in the sun. The rapper Ice Spice, for example, I would categorize on the Fitzpatrick scale as 1-2, meaning she’s very, very light but is considered Black. So I do think that there are certain nuances,” she adds. In recent years, SPF made with Black and darker-skinned people in mind has become more prevalent on the market. Black-owned brands such as Black Girl Sunscreen and inclusive products such as Supergoop!’s Unseen Sunscreen ensure our communities are given adequate protection without having to deal with the dreaded white cast, and Black skincare content creators, such as Janet (@skinandbase) and Okikiola Emaleku (@theskinpriest), are doing the Lord’s work when it comes to encouraging daily sunscreen use in our communities. Happily, Lartey also reports that large strides are being made within the beauty industry to alleviate the “medical distrust” that many Black people have about some of the skincare advice aimed in our direction. For example, there are now many Black experts in the sunscreen formulation field.”  “We have many Black experts in this field,” she says. “When I do product development, they so many Black people that I meet behind the scenes.” Largely, this shows that attitudes are improving when it comes to including darker-skinned people in this (very important) conversation. And, over time, the myth that Black people don’t need to wear sunscreen is increasingly falling out of favor. The evidence points to one conclusion: Sunscreen is highly beneficial for darker skin tones, it’s the anti-SPF myths that are the most detrimental to our skin health.  Dermatologist and esthetician-approved sunscreen brands for dark skin tones If you’re not sure where to start, consider these expert-approved sunscreens that have broad-spectrum formulations that protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays and do not leave a white-grey cast.
