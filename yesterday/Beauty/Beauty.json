If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly-anticipated savings event is back for 2024. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite luxe moisturizer, the Sephora’s Holiday Savings Event is the time to do just that. Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your Beauty Insider membership tier (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge depending on how much you spend annually), you can get 10, 15, or 20% off, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on November 1, and both VIBs and Insiders on November 5. All tiers have until November 11 to use the promo code SAVINGS at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from November 1 to November 11, no code needed.) As with previous years, there is some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to one Dyson item (choose wisely), one Shark Beauty item, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. The Ordinary products, MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount.  Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Styling Hair Dryer System  We recently reviewed Shark’s latest hair tool launch, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. Sephora also stocks both the straightener and diffuser systems, but this version comes with several attachments — curling barrels, smoothing brush, finishing tool, and a concentrator nozzle — to achieve a variety of looks. Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Longwear Lip Liner Anywhere Caffeine, Wherever Walnut, Endless Cacao…the list of beloved shades of this Make Up For Ever pencil goes on and on. From makeup artists to beauty tastemakers like Hailey Bieber and Suni Lee, these beautifully pigmented, long-lasting pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. Patrick Ta Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eyeshadow Duos Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta only recently launched these shimmering eyeshadow duos, and they’ve already begun to make waves online. If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that these will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Sol de Janiero Cheirosa Perfume Travel Minis Set Can’t choose a favorite Sol de Janeiro fragrance? With this set, you don’t need to. Featuring the brand’s most popular Cheirosa scents, this quartet of mists is already a steal at $34 — and that’s at full price. Olehenriksen Pout Preserve Hydrating Peptide Lip Treatment There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but this Ole Henriksen one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. From luminous pinks to decadent cocoa, there’s a shade (including crystal clear) for everyone to stock up on this sale. Glow Recipe Blackberry Retinol Blemish Serum Another recent editor-favorite launch comes in the form of Glow Recipe’s new Blackberry Retinol Blemish Serum, which gently yet effectively sloughs off dead skin cells before they get a chance to cause breakouts and dullness. Don’t miss out on trying it for yourself, and at a discount! Sephora Collection Best Skin Ever Full Coverage Multi-Use Hydrating Concealer If you’ve been sleeping on Sephora’s in-house range of products, now’s the time to wake up. One of our choice picks is the Best Skin Ever concealer, which has been lauded as a dupe for high-end brands. It’s creamy, blendable, and provides full coverage with a natural finish — and at only $11 and change during the sale. K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Oil K18 launched its hair oil in 2023, and it’s been a staple in my routine ever since. I’ve yet to find a more concentrated, hydrating formula that makes my hair smooth and super shiny. A little goes a long way, but this sale is a great time to stretch your savings by knocking dollars off the $65 price tag. Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush, $23 Rare Beauty’s liquid blush is intensely pigmented, available in gorgeous shades for every skin tone, and is utterly giftable as a perfect stocking stuffer.

But if you told me that burgundy tones were creeping up to dramatically flushed cheeks and lids, I’d think twice, then think again. Red eyeshadow automatically makes me think of Lydia Deetz (which honestly, is an unlikely source of inspo in 2024) or a nasty case of pink eye — not exactly chic. And rouged cheeks? More Madame Alexander than Bridgerton, but all that’s changed with modern interpretations of the iconic fall hue. When it comes to fall beauty trends, moody oxblood lipstick and dark, vampy nails are nothing new. But if you told me that burgundy tones were creeping up to dramatically flushed cheeks and lids, I’d think twice, then think again. Red eyeshadow automatically makes me think of Lydia Deetz (which honestly, is an unlikely source of inspo in 2024) or a nasty case of pink eye — not exactly chic. And rouged cheeks? More Madame Alexander than Bridgerton, but all that’s changed with modern interpretations of the iconic fall hue. “This trend is something I’ve been playing with for a few years now, and it’s been growing within the editorial makeup world — it has now developed into a mainstream trend,” Sephora beauty director David Razzano tells Refinery29. “The initial inspiration for using burgundy again was a reference to authentic post-punk ’80s goth makeup styles. That subculture is clearly a defining moment that is being referenced heavily in editorial work as well as runways.”  Just as the dark red hue swept fall runways this past season, burgundy has been slowly taking over makeup launches — and not just in the realms of lip and cheek products, but notably in eye makeup form: Bordeaux eyeliners, mascaras, and more have been trending among brands like Rare Beauty, Patrick Ta, and Kosas. “Burgundy is a very flattering shade on almost all skin tones and eye colors making it the perfect eye and complexion enhancer,” makeup educator (and TikTok beauty guru) Rose Siard tells Refinery29. Ready to rock some red? Keep reading for a deep dive on how to try the trend (and the key products to get you there). DashDividers_1_500x100 Eyes View this post on Instagram A post shared by steph hui🦋 (@stxph.h) Rich, luminous jewel tones on eyes are always a fall mood, and burgundy on eyes is an evolution of warm terracotta tones from years past. (I personally love a thin band of dark red eyeliner on my upper lashline — it makes my dark brown eyes glow.) “Starting small with your waterline is the perfect way to incorporate [burgundy] into your everyday routine,” says Siard. “Both your eye color and complexion are factors when it comes to this color family. If you are fair to light, the Kosas Soulgazer Intensifying Waterproof Gel Eyeliner in Bewitch would be a great starting point, and for deeper skin tones, try the Lancôme Le Stylo Eyeliner Pencil in Ruby Fever,” explains Razzano. Ready to turn things up? “For a bold eye, use Danessa Myricks Beauty: ColorFix Multi-Use Eye, Cheek \u0026 Lip Waterproof Liquid Pigment in shade Vamp, creating an intense smokey eye,” he adds. “Finish off the look with a few coats of mascara.” (Bonus: Danessa Myricks’ ColorFix pigments can also be worn on lips and cheeks — and pro tip: A little goes a very long way.) DashDividers_1_500x100 Lips View this post on Instagram A post shared by FENTY BEAUTY BY RIHANNA (@fentybeauty) Perhaps the most traditional take on this trend is in the lip category, where brick red hues have long been a popular choice for the fall and holiday seasons; however, the modern interpretation is less prim and more punk. “I love pairing a lip like Sephora Collection Cream Lip Stain 10HR Liquid Lipstick in Red Desert with a soft smokey eye in light grey tones like those in the Makeup By Mario: Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette in The Neutrals, to create a beautiful, chic look,” says Razzano.   Refinery29 contributing writer and beauty journalist Humeara Mohamed is equally as enamored with burgundy: “I think moody, burgundy-toned lips look beautiful on light and darker skin tones alike, which makes it feel quite wearable and less daunting than other statement tones. You can also smudge out a burgundy hue to look a little more lived-in and less ‘night out’. After years of the clean girl aesthetic and its subtle glossy lips, burgundy is the antidote to forced, fake perfectionism. It allows us to experiment and have fun with our makeup again.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Face View this post on Instagram A post shared by JO BAKER (@missjobaker) Hot blush summer has given way to cozy blush fall, so don’t be afraid to swap rosy tones in favor for a darker, plummy red. (I love dotting a stain on the apples of my cheeks that makes it look like I’ve just come in from the cold.) “A great and easy way to create a beautiful, simple, monochromatic burgundy look is to use Milk Makeup: Lip + Cheek Cream Blush Stick in shade Muse and softly create a stained cheek and lip look,” says Razzano. Cream formulas tend to be a little more forgiving in terms of color payoff, but if you’re ready for a dramatic, flushed look, don’t hesitate to try a powder version like NYX Buttermelt Blush in Back and Butta (a favorite of Siard’s).

    "description": "Deodorant and antiperspirant - it's the same thing, right? Most people use the two words interchangeably, but there are actually some key differences between the products. It's easy to mistake the two, especially when drugstores and beauty retailers have a slew of options packaged similarly, but knowing the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant can help you find the right product for your needs. Simply put, one helps mask the smell of sweat while the other prevents sweat and body odor. The choice may appear obvious, but everyone's armpits and body chemistry are different. To help you figure out if deodorant or antiperspirant is right for you, we spoke with Dendy Engelman, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon, to learn how they differ, know what to look for when shopping for each, and get a few recommendations, so you can add some dermatologist-approved picks to your bathroom counter. Experts Featured in This Article Dendy Engelman, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and Mohs surgeon located in New York City. Antiperspirant vs. Deodorant The main difference between antiperspirant and deodorant is that one prevents sweat while the other masks body odor. Want to dive deeper? Dr. Engelman tells PS that an antiperspirant is a product that \"blocks glands that produce sweat in order to prevent or reduce sweating.\" That's why they're called antiperspirants, because they stop you from perspiring. Whereas \"deodorant helps control body odor by making the surface of the skin more acidic and killing and/or preventing the growth of odor-causing bacteria.\" In recent years, natural deodorants have become quite popular, but unlike antiperspirants, Dr. Engelman explains, they do not prevent sweat. According to Dr. Engelman, most antiperspirants are made with aluminum-based compounds, such as aluminum chlorohydrate (a type of salt complex) and aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrate glycine complex (a common active ingredient in personal-care products). If you're looking for an aluminum-free antiperspirant, she explains, these may use ingredients like talc, baking soda, and cornstarch to help prevent sweating. When shopping for deodorants, Engelman says these are typically \"alcohol-based and include the bacteria-killing ingredient triclosan, along with odor-binding ingredients (for example, baking soda) and odor-masking perfumes and fragrances.\" How to Find the Best Deodorant Before you add a new product to your cart, Dr. Engelman advises it may take some trial and error to find the right one. \"I recommend looking for a deodorant that is free of aluminum, parabens, added fragrance, and other potentially harmful ingredients - especially if you have sensitive skin,\" she says. \"Labels like natural, fragrance-free, and aluminum-free can help guide you.\" Dr. Engelman recommends the Tom's of Maine Natural Deodorant Stick ($8) to anyone, as it's a unisex brand with fragrance-free options and all-natural ingredients. \"These deodorants are natural, aluminum-free, and produced with sustainable and responsible ingredients,\" she says. Another great option is the Lume Whole Body Invisible Cream Tube Deodorant ($15), as you can apply it anywhere. \"I like the versatility of Lume's Cream Deodorants as the water-based formula makes them easy to apply anywhere bacteria may thrive for whole-body odor protection,\" she says. \"The aluminum- and paraben-free formula is both safe and effective with clinically proven 72-hour odor control.\" How to Find the Best Antiperspirant If you're worried about sweat and odor, you may want to consider opting for an antiperspirant instead. These will help keep you dry and BO-free. The Secret Clinical Strength Antiperspirant ($13) acts as a long-lasting shield against sweat and odor. \"This invisible antiperspirant and deodorant offers 72 hours of protection against stress, heat, and activity sweat in a clinically backed formula,\" Dr. Engelman says. Another great option is the Degree Clinical Protection 5-in-1 Antiperspirant ($25). Not only does this antiperspirant work to prevent body odor, but it's also dermatologist tested and available at prescription strength. \"The five-in-one formula helps reduce sweating, control odor, moisturize the skin, and more,\" she says.
