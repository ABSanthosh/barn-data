If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In April 2021, when most coronavirus restrictions had been lifted and we rejoiced in our newfound freedom, the first thing I did was book into my local salon for a bob haircut. Lopping off five inches became something of a metaphor for shedding the past and starting afresh. Ever since then, the bob has been my hairstyle du jour.  I’ve rocked the “bottleneck” bob (so named for its face-framing fringe), the Italian bob (characterized by volume and chunky, blunt ends) and even the “boyfriend” bob (arguably the shortest — and, surprisingly, most controversial — of the bunch). But last June, as I grappled with the straighteners for the umpteenth time (bobs are high maintenance, you know), I decided on a new hair goal: to grow my hair long and strong so that I didn’t have to put as much heat on it, or style it constantly. It grew at a snail’s pace. No matter how many spiky silicone head massagers I collected, or how enthusiastically my beauty editor peers recommended biotin supplements (more on why I chose not to heed their advice later), my hair wouldn’t pass my shoulders for what felt like forever. In a bid to find out what was going on, I reached out to various hair experts, even paying a visit to the Philip Kingsley Trichological Clinic for a hair scan with trichologist Anabel Kingsley. What I learned transformed my hair-care regime as I knew it, and by December my hair had grown a little over five inches. Fast-forward to this month and my friends, family and colleagues can’t get over how quickly and effortlessly my hair seems to have sprouted. I won’t gatekeep. This is everything the professionals taught me about growing longer, stronger and healthier hair — and how to apply it to your own routine. I wash my hair more often Unsurprisingly, the TikTok-viral concept of “hair training” — leaving your hair longer in between washes in the hope that your scalp produces less oil over time — is unfounded. Previously, I’d wash my hair once or twice a week, thinking that eking out my wash days would preserve the integrity of my strands. But the trichologists I spoke to hinted that I was probably doing more harm to my growth cycle than good.  In fact, not washing my hair regularly enough resulted in seborrheic dermatitis: an inflammatory condition that makes the scalp itchy and results in yellow, sticky flakes. Like dandruff, seborrheic dermatitis is caused by a common yeast called malassezia, and while this yeast is entirely normal, an oily environment causes it to multiply and wreak havoc on the scalp. “As seborrheic dermatitis causes an imbalance, the hair can shed more quickly as it doesn’t have the best growing conditions,” says Eva Proudman, a consultant trichologist at UK Hair Consultants. She explains that hair washing is more about cleansing the scalp — which is simply an extension of the face — than just the hair. “The scalp has 180,000 oil glands and these can, at different times in our lives, become more active and produce more oil,” says Proudman, hence the propensity for scalp imbalance. She continues, “The scalp is the growing medium of the hair and needs to be balanced for optimum hair growth and hair health.”  Trichologist Anabel Kingsley agrees. She told me previously: “The flaking of the scalp increases daily hair fall and impacts the integrity of the cuticle [the outermost layer of the hair strand], causing the growth of weaker hair.” To Kingsley, the scalp is your hair’s “home” and if it’s in bad condition, it’ll impact how your hair is able to grow.  Of course, how often you wash your hair is down to personal preference but Proudman says that an ideal washing regime is every day or every other day for optimum scalp balance and hair growth conditions. (I opt for the latter.) Those with curly, coily and kinky hair might want to stretch this to once a week. I made my scalp the priority I thought I knew how to wash my hair but I was schooled during a hair spa treatment at Kingsley’s clinic, where an expert scrubbed my scalp for three minutes. They also focused less on my lengths. Since then, I’ve done the same for every wash, and I’m convinced that the exfoliating motion is keeping my flakes at bay. Interestingly, Proudman adds that consistent scalp massage can stimulate blood flow into the hair follicle to support hair growth.  Seeing as I wash my hair more regularly now, I find that one wash is enough. “Double cleansing your hair is generally only needed if you use lots of products or if you have a very oily scalp,” says Proudman. I just use a generous amount of shampoo to create a substantial lather and make sure that my hair is soaking wet first.  While I wash my scalp more regularly now, I avoid putting conditioner and hair oils on my roots. Instead, and as suggested by Kingsley, I concentrate these to my mid-lengths and ends, which need the most moisture. Since doing so, I’ve realized that bombarding my scalp with thick products like these was only making it greasier and likely contributed to my flaky and itchy symptoms. Kingsley confirmed my suspicion. “It’s not necessary to put conditioner on roots,” she told me. “It can weigh the hair down and if it contains oils it could potentially exacerbate seborrheic dermatitis.” Though this worked for me, all hair types are different. Your roots might be particularly dry and require more moisture in the form of conditioner, masks, oils and other treatments of your choice. I discovered the smartest shampoo I’ve always been skeptical about hair growth shampoos. How can something that’s only on your scalp for a few minutes at a time possibly have an impact on your strands? Happily, I was proven wrong when I discovered Typebea. Anna Lahey (founder of supplement brand Vida Glow) and Rita Ora (yes, really) are the brains behind the beauty editor-adored G1 Overnight Boosting Peptide Serum, $52, and G2 Strength \u0026 Length Shampoo, $, and Conditioner, $26. I’m convinced all three have helped my hair grow longer and stronger.  It’s all in the ingredients. First up is baicapil, which Proudman explains is a plant-based ingredient (a combination of wheat sprouts and soybean) and is often used in hair products. Lahey reports that it’s clinically proven to boost growth and reduce hair loss by 60%. There are a small handful of studies that suggest baicapil is an effective hair growth treatment. According to Lahey, baicapil has the power to improve hair density, strengthen follicles and enhance scalp health, resulting in thicker, more resilient lengths over time.  Then there’s salicylic acid. “This gently exfoliates the scalp, removing dead skin cells, product and oil buildup, and balancing oil production,” says Lahey. Proudman adds that salicylic acid keeps the hair follicles clear, which supports healthy hair growth. Lastly, the shampoo and scalp serum boast provitamin B5 aka panthenol to moisturize the hair and keep that moisture under lock and key. Proudman says that provitamin B5 also “smooths the hair to give a good shine and protection from damage”.  All of these ingredients have been studied and can provide benefits to the hair and scalp, continues Proudman, but she adds that it’s important to note that the formulation — and amount of these ingredients — determines how effective a product will be. In my honest opinion as a beauty director who has tried my fair share of hair growth products, Typebea’s are the only ones that have worked for me. When I rinse away the Strength \u0026 Length Shampoo and wring out the water, it’s like it has worked magic to beef up my strands. Not only is my hair longer but it feels twice as thick. I’ve been through a handful of bottles of the shampoo and conditioner in particular — and I’m already stocking up on more.  I used minoxidil — but consistency is key If you’re still skeptical about hair growth shampoos and serums, and you’re experiencing hair loss or thinning in particular, you might want to consider trying minoxidil: a proven treatment for androgenetic alopecia (hair loss caused by a combination of genetics and hormones). “Minoxidil is a vasodilator that pulls blood flow into the hair follicle,” explains Proudman. “It stimulates the hair follicles to enter into the growing phase and remain there for longer.” Minoxidil also increases the diameter of the hair, says Proudman, improving overall hair density on the scalp. For full disclosure, I used Rogaine (an over-the-counter version of minoxidil) every day for three weeks last August, concentrating the product to a sparse patch on my left temple. But consistency is key. “It can take three to six months to see the effects of minoxidil,” says Proudman, “and it needs to be applied to the scalp, not the hair, consistently as advised.”  When I discovered Typebea, I shelved the minoxidil after a few weeks to see if the serum, shampoo and conditioner would do anything. While that sparse patch is more or less unchanged, the length elsewhere is impressive. It’s important to note that while Typebea claims that its four-step system can reduce hair fall — how often your hair falls out on its own naturally — it doesn’t tackle hair loss.  Minoxidil also has a few potential side effects. “The most common can be scalp irritation, slight lowering of blood pressure and an increase in heart rate,” says Proudman. In some cases it can trigger more hair to shed as your hair enters the growing phase, continues Proudman, and this is likely to last for around four to six weeks. I stopped going to sleep with wet hair A dermatologist told me recently that hair is at its weakest point when wet, which encourages breakage. For that reason, I now always whip my hair up after washing into a microfibre towel like Kitsch Microfibre Hair Towel Wrap, $23, which I’m convinced is gentler on my strands, and I rough-dry my hair before bed rather than letting it dry naturally overnight. I like to use a speedy, lightweight hairdryer like Shark SpeedStyle Pro FLEX Professional Performance High-Velocity Hair Dryer System, £299.99. I also learned to brush my hair properly. “Get in the habit of brushing your hair from the ends,” Kingsley told me. She added that if you tend to start at the top or mid-lengths, you’re putting lots of tension on your strands — a fast track to breakage. When my hair is wet, I use a wide-tooth comb like Mane Knot Ur Avg Wide-Tooth Hair Comb, $20.50, and when it’s dry, I use the a paddle brush, which brushes comfortably and doesn’t ever tug.    I avoided pointless supplements Proudman recently told R29 that a poor diet and low levels of vitamins and minerals such as ferritin, vitamin B12, vitamin D and zinc may cause both hair shedding and slow growth. A blood test showed that I was deficient in vitamin D, and now I take a supplement. Besides vitamin D, it’s likely you’ve heard that biotin, or vitamin B7, can encourage better hair growth. But here’s the thing: You might not actually need it. Sally-Anne Tarver, a trichologist at the Cotswold Trichology Centre, previously told R29 that biotin supplements are only likely to work for people who have a deficiency. She said that such a deficiency is very rare in the Western world. “Simply stuffing [in] more biotin if you don’t need it will not result in healthier hair growth,” said Tarver. What it could do, though, is provide incorrect blood test results and even lead to hormonal issues.  This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. From the bob to the bixie, short haircuts have become the style of choice in salons up and down the country. Though they all look incredible, they’re also pretty high maintenance.  For those who aren’t too keen on booking in for a monthly trim, a mid-length cut might be your best bet. Far from mediocre, the in-between length isn’t only much easier to keep sharp – it’s also being touted as one of the biggest hair trends for 2025. “Mid-length cuts don’t have to feel like a long, grown out bob,” says Jordan Jones, stylist and color technician at Taylor Taylor London. “This year we’re being shown that they can be their own style with layers and careful shaping to create volume and movement, or shine and sophistication. If your bob has grown out and your hair has reached that awkward-length stage, or if you’ve got long locks and fancy a change without going super short, a trendy mid-length style is the cut for you.” On Instagram, London’s most sought-after stylists The Hair Bros are also championing medium-length cuts with curtain bangs, concave layers and natural waves. It seems we’ve all got the same idea: Google search for mid-length haircuts has risen by 180% recently and countless TikTokers are dedicating entire videos to mid-length haircut transformations. So which style will suit you best? Ahead, London’s best stylists reveal the biggest mid-length haircut trends that everyone can wear. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mid-Length Drape View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) Curtain bangs are going nowhere fast but according to editorial hairstylist and presenter Neil Moodie, you might want to cancel your fringe trim, because it’s increasingly cool to let it grow out a little. “Grown-out curtain fringes are great and can make mid-length hair look more interesting,” he says. The more grown out the fringe, the easier it is to blend into the rest of your hair, particularly if you’re interested in getting a handful of layers to enhance volume and texture, like this style colored by The Hair Bros’ Francesca on Instagram. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Jagged Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by BLEACH (@bleachlondon) “As the bob and long bobs have been around for a while, I feel like fringes are making a comeback,” says Neil. “The type of fringe I mean almost looks a bit homemade and very individual. It’s slightly jagged on the ends and a little uneven.” Take a cue from this pink style, dyed by Kat Gawel at BLEACH Brixton. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mane View this post on Instagram A post shared by Francesca Inverarity (@frankie_inv) You’ve heard of the wolf cut (a variation on the shag, occupying a space between wild and relaxed) but ‘the mane’ is a lot more voluminous. “This is super edgy with lots of texture and a heavy fringe that needs to be worn long and in the eyes so it has plenty of movement,” explains Jordan Jones, stylist and color technician at Taylor Taylor London. “The face-framing layers of this cut make it perfect for adding texture and volume to the hair while defining the face.” So what should you ask for? “A choppy cut with plenty of layers that frame the face and create soft movement,” says Jordan. “Think Billie Eilish and Miley Cyrus’s shaggy ‘dos.” Jordan says the look works well with any hair texture. “Sea salt products are a must-have to give an effortless, freshly tousled finishing touch.” Take inspiration from this look by Francesca Inverarity. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Mid-Length Afro View this post on Instagram A post shared by Charlotte Mensah (@charlottemensah) “As we move into spring and summer I think we’ll be seeing a lot more natural afro and curly hair in medium lengths,” says celebrity hairdresser Lorraine Dublin, much like this beautiful, fluffed out afro and these bold blonde curls, both created by hair artist Charlotte Mensah. “In the colder months, hair thrives better in protective styles, so as the weather heats up we’ll be seeing afro hair in its natural state — with bold colors, too.” DashDividers_1_500x100 The Half Up, Half Down View this post on Instagram A post shared by dylan bradshaw DUBLIN (@dylanbradshawdublin) “Another trend that will continue to be popular is the half up, half down style,” says Lorraine, “especially with hair extensions.” She continues: “You can add an ombre hair color to the ends and combine this with a natural, soft, body wave.” Gemma Murphy from Dylan Bradshaw Dublin totally nails the cute in-between style here. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Collarbone Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by BLUE TIT – HAIR SALONS (@bluetitlondon) “The collarbone cut is so popular right now,” says Tyler Moore, stylist at Live True London. He prefers a blunt edge and no layering but the look works equally well with a little bit of texture. “This style can be paired with a fringe for an ultra chic look and it works great on both straight and wavy or textured hair.” We love this look created by afro and textured hair educator Sharley Viola. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Flip View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Hair Bros (@thehairbros) “This is a versatile mid-length cut,” said The Hair Bros on Instagram. “When approaching a mid-length haircut there are a few points that we feel make all the difference. 1) Adding a substantial amount of shape around the face. 2) Cutting ‘accidental’, piecey layers throughout the hair.” The Hair Bros say a mid-length cut is its own style and that it’s important not to leave all of the hair one length. “This will end up looking heavy, as if it were a shorter bob. A middy hair cut should be full of texture and life and feel fun and playful. It’s great for anyone that wants to cut their long hair short but isn’t quite ready to brave a bob.” Flip your hair to one side for more of a natural, lived in feel. “As always, just a few products and some air should be enough to style this cut,” added The Hair Bros. Use a little styling cream like Hairstory Hair Balm, $37, and rough-dry with a hairdryer on low or medium heat. DashDividers_1_500x100 The ’90s Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by Mijael Bickei (@studiobickei) The ’90s lob (aka long bob) is going to be everywhere soon, says Tyler. “This is a layered, mid-length long bob à la Rachel from Friends. Think of it as a more retro twist on the wolf cut with slightly longer layers and a sleeker texture.” Dreamed up by Mijael Bickei on Instagram, this lob is both glossy and textured. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Hi-Shine Lob View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝐒 𝐄 𝐕 𝐀 𝐍 𝐀 (@seva_glam_hair) “Embrace modern glamour with a super blunt cut with clean, sharp lines,” says Jordan, like this cut created by Sevana at Salon 26° North. “This style looks best when cut around the collarbone and is perfectly set off with mirror-shine hair.” This is all about the condition of your hair so make sure to use hydrating and nourishing conditioners or oils to create a super sleek style. Kérastase Elixir Ultime L’Original Hair Oil, $62, is a favorite among stylists. “If you are a brunette or darker, ask for a gloss color to add depth and shine,” adds Jordan. “Even opting for a Brazilian blow-dry or straightening treatment will help to put the finishing touches on this look.” DashDividers_1_500x100 Lived-In Lengths View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝑅𝓊𝒷𝓎 𝒯𝓊𝑒𝓈𝒹𝒶𝓎 𝐸𝓋𝑒𝓇𝓈 (@didntcatchthat) “Why is shoulder-length hair commonly perceived to be bad?” wrote The Hair Bros on Instagram. “It’s not!” This modern mid-length cut by hairstylist Liam Russell on Ruby Tuesday Evers has inspired the Bros’ work in-salon over the past few months. The bedhead texture and mussed up fringe give the medium length great shape. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Top-Heavy Cut View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝕰𝖒𝖎𝖑𝖞 𝕶𝖎𝖓𝖌𝖘𝖙𝖔𝖓 (@lemzkingston) The shag, the mullet, the shullet… Whatever you call the ‘00s most popular cut, it always seems to be evolving, as illustrated by Emily Kingston, stylist and colorist at Blue Tit Clapton. Proving the cut looks just as incredible on curly hair, the trick is to emphasize lots of volume around the top of the head and taper the lengths right down to the bottom so that hair sits just below the collarbone. DashDividers_1_500x100 The Side Fringe View this post on Instagram A post shared by James Samuel (@jamesjustnow) The side fringe perfectly accentuates a mid-length cut, says Jordan, like this style on model Julia Campbell-Gillies at Hershesons in London. “Curtain bangs have moved on and side bangs from the early ’00s are back. For fringe lovers who want a bit more excitement this year, this style flatters most face shapes and essentially frames the face with disconnected, slightly longer bangs. It’s not dramatic and easy to tuck behind your ear, pin to one side or sweep across the forehead with a big, bouncy blow-dry.” Jordan says it looks great on wavy, thicker hair in particular, styled as if it’s been casually flipped over. “To keep it on trend it’s best worn loose and tousled. Add spritzes of dry shampoo on the roots for second-day hair to amplify the volume and add a bit of texture.” Like what you see?

    "title": "What Are Those White Spots on Your Nails?",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/What-White-Spots-Nails-7050503",
    "description": "Although you might not be aware of it, the condition of your nails can be an indicator of your general health. Any nail abnormalities, such as sudden color changes or intense breakage, can sometimes suggest a more serious underlying health issue. If you have white spots on your fingernails or toenails, you might be wondering why, and whether or not it's a cause for concern. Healthy fingernails are typically a light, flesh-toned color that's consistent throughout the nail, and they are free of grooves, indentations, and any spots or marks. However, if you have experienced white spots on your nails - as many people do at some point, usually after removing nail polish after long periods of time - the good news is that the condition is generally pretty harmless. We consulted with Anar Mikailov, MD, board-certified dermatologist, to explain everything you need to know about those white spots on your nails. Keep reading to find out what causes white spots on nails, how to treat or prevet them, and more. Experts Featured in This Article Anar Mikailov, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and founder of KP Away, as well as the co-founder of Skintensive. What Are the White Spots on My Nails? Leukonychia, the condition when the nails are all or partially white, can be broken into three main types. \"True leukonychia is where the nail plate itself is white or partially white,\" Mikailov says. \"Apparent leukonychia is when the nail plate appears white due to the change of the nail bed, and Pseudoleukonychia is when the nail plate has white areas due to outside factors.\" What Causes White Spots on Nails? There are many different things that can cause white spots on nails, including certain medicines, such as chemotherapy medications to treat cancer. Occasionally, mineral deficiencies, such as calcium or zinc deficiencies, can cause white spots on nails. Some allergies, such as an allergy to nail polish, can cause white spots, and even some chemicals used during gel or acrylic manicures can cause white spots. True leukonychia and apparent leukonychia can be signs of more serious health issues. True leukonychia is typically due to major changes, such as psoriasis, infection, heart failure, or arsenic poisoning. Apparent leukonychia can be caused by kidney failure, liver failure, diabetes, or anemia. Pseudoleukonychia, however, is more common and usually fairly harmless. It can be caused by a nail fungus, nail polish changes, or damage or injury to the nail bed. Something as simple as an aggressive manicure or hitting your hand on a door can cause trauma to the nail which can lead to white spots. It's always best to check with your doctor if you have any reason to believe these are potential causes. Can You Prevent White Spots on Nails? Because those white spots on nails are most often caused by damage or injury to the nail bed, you could try being more careful with your nails, eliminating nail-biting, and asking nail technicians to be gentle when receiving manicures. Otherwise, you'll want to continue taking care of your general health to avoid developing more serious health issues such as diabetes, liver failure, or kidney failure. If you do that, \"You should not develop leukonychia, but often we will not know that we have one of the above problems until after the white nails are noted,\" Mikailov says. Since sometimes the spots can be a result of calcium deficiencies, be sure to check with your doctor in case you can add a supplement to your daily routine. How to Get Rid of White Spots on Nails Whether or not you can get rid of the white spots on your nails will depend on what caused them in the first place. If you're looking to cover up the white marks caused by pseudoleukonychia on your nails in a pinch, you could try painting over them with polish, otherwise, you'll need to wait for your nails to grow out. If the white spots are caused by a fungal infection, using an anti-fungal product such as Orly Fungus MD Serum ($15) could help. If the white spots are caused by an underlying issue or chronic condition, getting rid of them will be difficult, and you should consult your doctor.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/jennifer-lopez-cherry-mocha-nails-49423556",
    "description": "Since the year started, celebrities haven't been holding back with the beauty inspiration, from pixie cuts at the 2024 Golden Globes to Zendaya's swoon-worthy \"strawberry milk\" nails that accompanied her engagement. The latest celeb to join the party? None other than Jennifer Lopez. The singer recently traded her awards-show-ready nude manicure for a fresh set of \"cherry-mocha\"\" nails that have us simply drooling. Lopez's latest manicure comes just as the color combo has found its way to the top of our FYPs (again), just a few months after making its viral debut last fall. Although other stars like Kate Moss and Kylie Jenner have embraced the trend, Lopez's interpretation is our favorite to date thanks to celebrity manicurist Tom Bachik. But it's far from the pair's first rodeo with the shade, as he created a similar set for the star back in November 2023 with a black-cherry design. And before that, the duo created a bejeweled manicure that also left us speechless. For their more-recent creation, Bachik took to Instagram to share the details behind the set with the caption, \"Chocolate Cherry 4Ever.\" While keeping her signature coffin shape intact with Aprés's Gel-X Natural Coffin Medium Tips ($17), Bachik used the brand's Gel Couleur in Blood Moon ($15), followed by the Non-Wipe Glossy Top Gelcoat ($13). For a non-gel version of the polish, try the Essie Nail Polish in Berry Naughty ($10). Take a closer look at Lopez's nails below.
