    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/native-coconut-and-vanilla-body-wash-review-49325801",
    "description": "I'm a firm believer that having a staple shower routine can make or break your day-to-day regimen, which is why I've curated (at least what I believe to be) one of the best. Sure, I've got all the usual essentials like a great shampoo-conditioner duo, a smoothing body scrub, and loofas galore, but it's my Native Coconut and Vanilla Body Wash, 3 oz ($3) that I'd argue is the real game changer in my regimen. After years of diligently using the brand's deodorant, I was inspired to give one of Native's popular body washes a try and, let's just say my skin has been transformed for the better. Ahead, I break down what makes Native's Coconut and Vanilla Body Wash so great, from its sweet scent and lightweight feel to its abundance of clean ingredients and so much more. About the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash This Native body wash is vegan, cruelty-free, and free of sulfates. The formula features skin-care ingredients like salt, citric acid, and sodium cocoyl isethionate, which is a cleanser derived from coconut oil. Beyond coconut and vanilla, the body wash is also available to shop in other scents like cucumber and mint or lavender and rose, as well as seasonal variations like candy cane and sugar cookie. What I Like About the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash The better question is, what's not to like? First and foremost, I appreciate that the body wash has a sweet aroma that's not too overwhelming, yet it still manages to leave a lasting and clean scent long after I've stepped out of the shower. The formula feels similar to a bubble bath soap because of how much it foams (even with only a little bit of product) and how easily it glides onto my skin when wet. A little goes a long way, and I usually only have to restock it once every few months because of how large the bottle is, which is definitely a win for my monthly shopping budget. Best of all, I've seen a noticeable difference in the softness of my skin. Not only does it look less dull, but the skin on my arms and legs, in particular, feels more hydrated. Historically, I've always felt like I had to pick between a product that smelled good and one that actually worked to nourish and maintain the health of my skin, but this Native body wash has proven to be the exception. It's officially become a staple within my daily shower routine. How to Use the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash As I said, a little bit of this body wash goes a long way. As far as shower routines go, I typically prefer to wash my body toward the end of the whole process. That way, I can ensure any shampoo, conditioner, or even face wash residue that's leftover is cleansed off of my body entirely. Once I'm at that point in my routine, I simply squirt a small amount of the body wash onto my shower pouf, quickly run it under the water until the sponge is lightly wetted, scrunch it together a few times to develop a foam, and then lather my body with it until every inch of my skin (besides my face) is covered. From there, I'll then rinse the body wash off with hot water. Unlike other products I've tried, this Native body wash doesn't leave a sticky or heavy coating on the skin, yet it still manages to thoroughly clean my skin. What to Consider Before Trying the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash While I prefer scented body washes and appreciate the sweet aroma that this particular formula boasts, if you're someone who prefers fragrance-free products, this might not be the best body wash for you. While the infused notes of coconut and vanilla are certainly more subtle and muted than some of the other products I've tried from the brand, they're still incredibly sweet-smelling nonetheless. Where Is the Native Coconut \u0026 Vanilla Body Wash Available? This body wash is available to shop at Amazon and CVS.

    "title": "6 Sneaky Eczema Triggers to Avoid, According to Doctors",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/eczema-triggers-49435979",
    "description": "It's reported that approximately 1 in 10 Americans will deal with eczema in their lifetimes, according to the National Eczema Association. So it's safe to say there are plenty of people out there who may be wondering what's causing these pesky rashes - and looking for tips to treat them. Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is \"characterized as an uncomfortably itchy rash that may affect virtually any – and often multiple – parts of the skin,\" says board-certified dermatologist Serena Mraz, MD. Eczema occurs \"when the skin barrier is weakened, making it more prone to moisture loss and irritation from environmental triggers,\" says board-certified dermatologist Asmi Berry, DO, FAAD. Dr. Mraz notes that the itching can be so intense that it even interferes with sleep and daily functioning in some individuals, making it all the more important to find what could be triggering eczema. Did you know that taking overly hot showers or using fragranced products may be the culprits? \"While genetics play a major role, factors like immune system dysfunction, allergens, irritants, and stress can all contribute to flare-ups,\" Dr. Berry adds. Ahead, six sneaky eczema triggers you may not realize are causing your itchy rashes – plus, how to avoid all of them (it's easier than you might think!). Experts Featured in This Article Serena Mraz, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Solano Dermatology Associates in Northern California, with locations in Vallejo, St. Helena, and Fairfield, CA. Asmi Berry, DO, FAAD, is a board-certified dermatologist in Los Angeles. Janiene Luke, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and clinical professor at the Loma Linda University Department of Dermatology in Loma Linda, CA. Taking Hot Showers Though it may seem surprising, hot showers and overwashing can actually be triggering your eczema flare-ups. \"Hot water strips the skin of its natural oils, making it drier and more prone to irritation,\" says Dr. Berry. \"Frequent washing also disrupts the skin barrier.\" How to avoid it: As tempting as it may be to hop into a steaming-hot shower or bath, stick to lukewarm showers that are 10 to 15 minutes max, says Dr. Berry. When in the shower, \"Use gentle, fragrance-free cleansers, and apply moisturizer immediately after patting the skin dry.\" Using Scented Laundry Detergents, Soaps, and Fabric Softeners Though fragranced laundry products and soaps smell fresh and clean, these enticing scents can actually be secretly aggravating your skin. \"Many detergents contain fragrances, dyes, and harsh surfactants that leave residue on clothes and irritate sensitive skin,\" says Dr. Berry. It's not just detergents, though: Fragrance is a \"common trigger\" that's found in many beauty products, including perfumes, lotions, creams, hair and body products, and more, Dr. Luke adds. The chemicals in these types of products \"can lead to irritation, dryness, and flares of eczema.\" How to avoid it: Switch to a fragrance-free, hypoallergenic detergent, and avoid fabric softeners, Dr. Berry recommends. If that's still not helping, \"you can also double-rinse clothes to remove any leftover residue,\" she says. When shopping for lotions, moisturizers, and other skin and hair products, look at the labels of the products to make sure they are fragrance-free, says Dr. Luke. She recommends formulas specifically created for sensitive skin and that are free of fragrance, dyes, and other chemicals. \"When cleaning, use cotton-lined gloves to protect skin,\" she adds. Skipping Moisturizer Not moisturizing enough or using the wrong moisturizer can be your worst enemy in the fight against eczema. Without proper hydration, \"the skin barrier becomes compromised, allowing allergens and irritants to trigger inflammation,\" says Dr. Berry. How to avoid it: \"Use a thick, fragrance-free moisturizer with ceramides and hyaluronic acid twice a day, especially after bathing,\" says Dr. Berry. For extra dry skin, she recommends adding another layer of protection by applying an ointment like petrolatum over your moisturizer at night. This is referred to as body slugging for eczema, which can be very effective. Cold, Dry Weather Ever feel like your eczema is spiraling out of control in the winter? You're not the only one. \"Eczema can flare in colder, dry temperatures due to decreased moisture and humidity in the air,\" says Dr. Luke. \"In addition, using indoor heaters in colder weather can also strip moisture from the skin.\" How to avoid it: Escaping to a humid, tropical destination sounds divine - you don't have to tell us twice that we should escape to Hawaii to minimize eczema breakouts - but unfortunately, that's not the most realistic solution. Instead, counteract the cold, dry weather by staying extra moisturized. \"During the winter, look for thicker creams or ointments,\" recommends Dr. Luke. \"Moisturizers are classified by the amount of oil and water they contain. Ointments have the highest oil content, followed by creams, followed by lotions.\" You can also increase the moisture in the air within your space using a humidifier. High Stress Levels \"Stress increases cortisol levels, which can disrupt immune function and trigger inflammation,\" says Dr. Berry both of which can lead to eczema flares. A side effect of stress is insomnia or poor sleep patterns. \"Poor sleep also weakens the skin barrier and reduces healing,\" she says. How to avoid it: When possible, prioritize stress management techniques like deep breathing, exercise, or meditation, Dr. Berry advises. Plus, \"create a consistent bedtime routine and keep your bedroom cool and humidified to support skin hydration,\" she says. Eating Certain Foods First, let's get this clear: Dr. Luke notes that foods do not cause eczema - this is a common misconception. However, \"certain foods like milk, eggs, soy, nuts, and wheat can trigger eczema flares,\" she says. How to avoid it: If you notice you have a flare-up when consuming a particular food, try removing it from your diet and seeking an alternative, Dr. Luke recommends. Additionally, doing your best to \"avoid highly processed foods, include fermented foods in the diet, and focus on a plant-forward, whole food-based diet will help keep inflammation down and maintain general skin health,\" says Dr. Mraz. She advises incorporating foods rich in omega-3s, such as ground flax seeds, chia seeds, salmon, sardines, walnuts, seaweed, spirulina, and chlorella.

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. I’ll let you in on something I share with top dermatologists, Hailey Bieber, and Drew Barrymore (to name a few fans): We all love EltaMD’s UV Clear sunscreen. The brand specializes in skin-friendly, elegantly formulated sunscreen. Aside from regularly being name-dropped by celebs and beauty editors, EltaMD is a rather unlikely viral beauty hit. For starters, at $44, it faces stiff competition from drugstore juggernauts that clock in at half the price; and it boasts a prescription-quality packaging – and I say this with love — that doesn’t necessarily scream “luxe.” But perhaps that unique cosmeceutical crunchiness is part of its draw — after all, it’s what’s inside that counts. Ahead, I tried the mystical bottle for myself on my acne-prone skin to see if it could be my sunscreen dreams come true. DashDividers_1_500x100 EltaMD UV Clear Broad-Spectrum SPF 46, $44 First Impressions I’ve tried a ton of sunscreens in my career as a beauty writer, so I have a pretty good idea of whether or not something will break me out, and EltaMD’s UV Clear sunscreen was love at first pump. The texture was lightweight but silky — my oily skin drank it right up and immediately felt hydrated and bouncy. It dispenses as a white lotion, but blended in completely clear on my olive skin. (I also tried the popular tinted version, which is available in two shades and offers sheer coverage.) Wearing It Out After wearing it on and off for years, it still has yet to break me out ever — which for my finicky complexion, is no small feat. I added some foundation and concealer over the sunscreen to see if it could compare to the makeup grippiness of Supergoop’s Unseen Sunscreen. It was pretty good, but I did add some loose powder to set and absorb shine. This step is very optional, but when you’re as oily as I am, there’s a fine line between dewy and greasy. Final Thoughts While $44 ($46 for the tinted versions) is not exactly cheap for a single bottle of sunscreen, EltaMD’s UV Clear is a definite upgrade from the drugstore aisle — it just feels expensive. Plus, while the UV Clear is a fan-fave, the brand has a veritable coterie of SPF; there’s the aforementioned tinted one if you crave light coverage, hydrating formulas spiked with hyaluronic acid, and a just-launched green-tinted one to counteract redness, as well.

As much as we love going all out with our glam and ‘fits (and trust us, we do), music festivals can be tough on even the most well-behaved complexions. “The long hours in the sun, combined with sweat, makeup, and late nights, create the perfect storm for skin stress,” New York-based dermatologist Dr. Shereene Idriss, MD tells Refinery29. “But with a little awareness, you can absolutely have fun while keeping your skin healthy.” A little prep goes a long way to keep your skin happy — so we asked the experts for their best advice on weathering multi-day outdoor festivities and staying just as glowy as day one.  DashDividers_1_500x100 1. Wear Sunscreen (\u0026 Don’t Forget To Reapply!) “First and foremost, wear the damn sunscreen — and I’m talking about broad-spectrum SPF 30 or higher,” says Dr. Idriss. “Apply it generously before you step outside, and don’t forget areas like your ears, neck, and the back of your hands. Be sure to reapply throughout the day in the blazing sun. The Supergoop! powder SPF is great for reapplication.” “I love the Ultra Violette Extreme Screen SPF 50, and then the Vacation Super Spritz for easy reapplication throughout the day,” recommends Sofie Pavitt, licensed esthetician and founder of Sofie Pavitt Face. DashDividers_1_500x100 2. Hydrate From The Inside Out “Hydration is key — not just for your body, but for your skin too,” says Dr. Idriss. “Festivals are often in the heat, and dehydration can lead to dull, tired-looking skin, and even breakouts.” Most festivals won’t permit glass or metal bottles, but you can usually bring empty, refillable, plastic water bottles and refill at designated stations. Hydration packets like Liquid I.V. can also help replenish electrolytes and keep you quenched. DashDividers_1_500x100 — PAID —  3. Start Your Skincare Routine In The Shower Even the most hydrating body lotion can only do so much if your skin is already stripped of moisture. The old adage, “work smarter, not harder,” applies here: Start in the shower to build a hydrating foundation — and maximize efficiency while you’re at it. Look for gentle, creamy, non-stripping formulas that are enriched with deeply moisturizing ingredients, like the eos Cashmere Body Wash, which is not only pH balanced to support your skin barrier but also features a Cashmere Smooth Complex — a blend of shea, argan, and cocoa butters for soothed, optimally hydrated skin. DashDividers_1_500x100 4. Lighten Up “Long, hot days outside are not the time to go heavy [on] layering serums, essences, moisturizers, SPF, and makeup,” says Pavitt. Her suggestion: Keep your festival routine to the basics if your plans involve dancing (and sweating). “Cleanse the skin well in the morning, apply moisturizer and a high factor sunscreen, and then have some fun with your makeup,” she advises.  DashDividers_1_500x100 5. Sun Protection, But Make It Fashion Both experts agree that adding a hat or visor to your festival ‘fit is a smart move (in addition to sunscreen, not as a replacement). “A hat is also a non-negotiable to further protect the face, scalp, and neck throughout the day outside,” says Pavitt. Dr. Idriss loves Bluestone Sunshield’s chic UPF 50+ visors, which come in a variety of chromatic colorways.  DashDividers_1_500x100 6. Mist Opportunity It may seem high maintenance to carry a face spray around, but trust us — your skin will be grateful for it. Dr. Idriss recommends that festival goers use a hydrating mist to keep skin refreshed throughout the day. (It’ll also help cool you down in the sun!) “Hypochlorous acid sprays are great for cleansing the skin,” says Pavitt. We love the Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Spray, which is available in a travel-friendly mini size, and helps refresh skin, ward off breakouts, and calm inflammation. “If you’re using [a mist] throughout the day, remember to reapply your SPF immediately afterward because they essentially wipe away all previously applied skincare,” says Pavitt. Another option: Go down the DIY route with a skin-soothing recipe courtesy of Dr. Idriss: “You can even make your own mist with glycerin, distilled water, and rosewater for anti-inflammatory benefits,” she shares.  DashDividers_1_500x100 7. Wash Away The Day  “Festival makeup is definitely part of the fun, but all that glitter, decals, and heavy glam can be tough on your skin — not to mention the struggle of getting it all off at the end of the night,” says Dr. Idriss. She recommends her eponymous Soft Wash as a one-step cleanser to remove makeup, sunscreen, dirt, and more. But if that sounds ambitious for a long day of dancing, we’ve got you. “This is the only time I would recommend packing makeup wipes as a backup,” she says. An excellent option is the Sofie Pavitt Face Micellar Cleansing Pads. “[These] quickly remove your makeup in one go, with no water needed,” says Pavitt. Like what you see?
