Last weekend, the actor and multi-hyphenate (she owns a production company, published a book of poetry, and is a certified reiki master, NBD) sat down with Refinery29 Global Beauty Director Sara Tan and beauty host and producer Kirbie Johnson on their podcast Gloss Angeles to chat all things beauty — including her recent foray into skincare. Ever since becoming a household name as Betty on Riverdale, Reinhart has publicly shared her personal skin journey and its link to mental health; and now, her decade-plus experience with acne is inspiring her own skincare brand, Personal Day. “I’ve had acne since I was twelve, and a few years ago it sort of clicked in my head that what I was using on a daily basis that was making the biggest difference in my skin and acne,” Reinhart said during her live Gloss Angeles taping. “I realized there wasn’t a skincare line out there that I could fully trust when it came to the ingredients.” “Personal Day is really the definition of ‘me.'”Lili reinhart Lest you dismiss Personal Day as yet another celebrity beauty brand, think again. “I imagined and anticipated the eye rolls that I would get,” she adds. “This is not a brand that I just smacked my face on. I’ve been working on this for three years and [skincare] is something I’ve been super vocal about for ten years.” And while Reinhart has developed this range with acneic skin in mind, she is quick to astutely point out that you don’t need to have acne in order to use — and benefit — from the products. Ingredients like niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and most notably, a relative newcomer called mevalonic acid (which aids skin repair and increases the production of hyaluronic acid and collagen) feature heavily in the range, which includes a rice powder cleanser, acne treatment serum, balancing moisturizer, resurfacing peel, and soothing mask. Every product clocks in at under $40, an accessible price point that Reinhart felt passionately about.

    "title": "I May Never Use Mascara Again Thanks to TikTok’s Invisible Mascara Hack",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/invisible-mascara-hack-editor-experiment-49333491",
    "description": "Anyone who uses TikTok is most likely aware that the platform is home to some pretty wild claims. Whether it's users saying that showering with the toilet open causes acne or people recommending hemorrhoid cream to get rid of under-eye bags, out-of-the-box ideas are never hard to come by. I've made it my personal mission to mythbust as many of them as I possibly can, which usually involves chatting with dermatologists and other beauty experts in the industry. Last year, when I saw a few videos going viral on the platform claiming that Vaseline works better than mascara - with some pretty convincing video evidence to go with it - my first question was whether or not it was safe. After speaking with a handful of ophthalmologists who confirmed that using occlusives like Vaseline, Aquaphor, and petroleum jelly near the eyes was safe as long as they weren't getting directly in the eye, I decided I needed to try it out. @mar.hacks Invisible mascara hack!! #makeup #makeuptutorial #beauty #beautyhack #hacksbymar #makeupartist #makeuphacks #makeuplook #mascara #mascarahacks #eyelashes #beautytips #beautytok #AmazonMusicProudHeroes #MakeNightsEpic #CatchChobaniOatmilk #vaseline #vaselinehacks #beautytutorial ♬ Aesthetic - Tollan Kim I have short, stubby lashes. If you're staring at me head-on, chances are you won't even know my eyelashes exist. When I'm putting on makeup, I typically curl them and layer on mascara like my life depends on it. No matter what kind of product I use - I've even tried waterproof formulas - my lashes fall flat by the end of the day. Not to mention, I'm constantly dealing with fallout, flakes, and clumps from the thick coating I have on. When I first decided to try this hack for myself, I was a little nervous. I wasn't sure if the Aquaphor would be too heavy on my lashes, and to be honest, despite getting approval from a doctor, I was still a little freaked out that I was going to get an eye infection. Luckily, neither of those things happened. I've been using this hack for the last few months and it's completely changed the game for me. The only time I wear mascara is if I'm going out for the night, but otherwise, it's completely replaced my need for the product - especially in my day-to-day life. Doing the hack is easy. I start by taking my tube of Aquaphor ($6) and squeezing a tiny bit onto the back of my hand. (I always make sure to wash my hands first.) Then, I curl the eyelashes on both of my eyes with the Kevyn Aucoin Eyelash Curler ($26). From there, I take a clean spoolie (I use one from an eyebrow product that I've never used), dip it in the Aquaphor, and gently coat my lashes with a tiny bit of the formula. Then, I take a different spoolie to make sure everything is spread out evenly, and I go over my eyelashes with the curler one more time. Not only does this hack curl my lashes better than any other mascara or trick I've tried, but the curl actually lasts all day long - even when I rub my eyes. Honestly, the only thing that gets the curl to fall is when I use a cleanser to wash my face at the end of the night. This is hands down the best hack I've ever learned from TikTok because it's made my life so much easier. I can look put together in a minute flat just by doing this to my eyelashes, and I constantly have people asking me if I got a lash lift. Now, if only Aquaphor would make a version of this product with eyelash-conditioning ingredients, I'd be set for life.

    "title": "\"Expensive Brunette\" Hair Color Will Make You Feel Like a Million Bucks",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/expensive-brunette-hair-color-48678333",
    "description": "\"Expensive brunette\" is not a nickname (although, if the shoe fits) - it's a hair-color trend that has had everyone, including celebrities in Hollywood, flocking to their hairstylists for a winter refresh. Hair-color treatments, in general, are pretty expensive, but this name refers to a specific color that makes you look and feel like a million bucks the second you walk out of the salon. This hair-color trend is more about the finish of the hair than the color itself. \"Expensive brunette is all about a luxe feel, focusing on dimension, shine, and hair health,\" celebrity hairstylist Liam Curran tells PS. The look is ultrashiny and glossy, as if you just got a blowout and color touch-up the day before. It comes on the heels of the liquid hair trend, which is all about creating a smooth, mirror-like appearance in the hair's surface. Want to learn more? Keep reading for expert tips on how to get the look as well as how you can maintain it at home. Experts Featured in This Article Liam Curran is a celebrity hairstylist and Tangle Teezer ambassador. What Is Expensive Brunette Hair? Step one of achieving the expensive-brunette hair color is booking an appointment with a professional. \"Expensive brunette is not an all-over color,\" Curran says. Therefore you won't be able to achieve it with a box of hair dye. Your hairstylist will come up with the best color for you based on a number of factors (skin tone, eye color, lifestyle, etc.). \"If you're interested in trying out expensive brunette, explore dimension, high shine, depth, intermixed tones, and custom blends with your stylist.\" The key to looking \"expensive\" is having a beautiful hair color that complements you perfectly, and then focusing on maintaining its shine and smoothness. How to Maintain Expensive Brunette Hair \"When coloring your hair any color, it's always important to maintain a healthy condition,\" Curran says. That means using hair masks to deep condition regularly and minimizing heat damage as much as possible. Keep scrolling to see our favorite examples of the expensive brunette hair color - plus products to help you get (and maintain) the look at home. Don't worry: it won't cost you nearly as much as it will look like it did. To keep the high-shine finish in your hair, try a hair gloss. The best (and most long-lasting) results come from an in-salon treatment, but you can also DIY the look with at-home options like the L'Oréal Le Color Gloss One Step Toning Gloss ($16) or the Madison Reed Color Reviving Gloss in Glassa ($25). How to Style Expensive Brunette Hair The best way to add that liquid hair-level shine is to use hair oils or shine sprays when styling the hair. Some of our favorites include the Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil ($30) and Amika Top Gloss Hair Shine Spray ($29). Also, don't forget to brush. You've likely heard the old wives tale that brushing your hair 100 times gets it looking better than ever. That's not necessarily true, but a good hairbrush can help smooth frizz (which, in turn, can lead to shinier ends). If you're ready to take the plunge, keep scrolling for some expensive brunette inspiration you can bring with you to your next salon appointment.",
