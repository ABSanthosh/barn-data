    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/tatcha-sunscreen-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Tatcha makes some of the most luxurious skincare in my cabinet, but when it comes to daily essentials, nothing is more important than sunscreen. Mineral formulas are usually my go-to (I’m acne-prone and find they tend to break me out less than their chemical counterparts), and Tatcha’s The Silk Sunscreen is among my latest favorites. My introduction to the brand’s sunscreens came via the Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen SPF 35 — the one in the blue tube — which has a creamier, putty-like texture and chemical filters at play. I liked it, sure, but craved something lighter for year-round wear. Summer’s just around the corner, and my oily complexion struggles with heavier formulas (although to be clear, I’ll take a few zits over UV damage any day). Enter, The Silk Sunscreen. It reminds me of those from my favorite Japanese brands (Tatcha formulates several products in Japan, though this is not one of them), which are fluid-thin in consistency and absorb instantly. In addition to zinc oxide, the formula features silk extract (yes, really — it’s naturally rich in amino acids), niacinamide (my go-to for pore-clarifying and brightening), and squalane for moisture and barrier support. (It recently got a packaging upgrade and now joins Tatcha’s family of Silk Serum, Silk Cream, and Silk Canvas primer. And while the formula itself hasn’t changed, it’s still a popular (if not a little divisive — more on that later) pick among high-end SPF. The Silk Sunscreen SPF 50, $64 A common pain point with mineral sunscreens is that the filters (usually zinc or titanium oxide) often leave a chalky white cast, especially on darker skin tones. I have medium olive skin, and found that the Silk Sunscreen blended in impressively well without a trace. However, it doesn’t work as seamlessly for everyone. Content creator and cosmetic chemist Esther Olu posted a viral review showing the product leaving a ghostly pallor on her skin. (Tatcha, please make a darker tinted version!)  Now for the big, expensive elephant in the room: this stuff is pricey — admittedly, too pricey at $64 for 1.7 fluid ounces. Still, it’s one of the most luxurious sunscreens I’ve ever used, and I can’t lie: I genuinely love it. If you’re a Tatcha stan or have bougie taste in sunscreen, it’s definitely worth trying or gifting. The texture and finish feel incredible, — soft and diffused with oil control — and it layers flawlessly under makeup. (My everyday routine is a sheer skin tint and cream blush, and this sunscreen helps both wear longer.) I legitimately look forward to using it every day, and it’s like experts say: The best sunscreen is the one you’ll actually want to wear. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/biodance-collagen-mask-review-49386172",
    "description": "As someone who spends a lot of time on TikTok (and I mean a lot), I've found myself more than a little susceptible to testing out products and hacks that come across my FYP. For the most part, the things I've decided to try have been winners (like almost every single hair hack), but there have been a few questionable trends I've had to forgo (like using hemorrhoid cream for undereye bags). Recently, I've been seeing an overnight collagen face mask, the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask ($55, originally $76) for 16, all over my social media feeds - both TikTok and Instagram alike. People trying it out would go to bed with what looked like a regular sheet mask on their face, but they'd wake up with what looked like a clear snakeskin on that they needed to peel it off. I really wasn't sure if the mask was legit, and I especially wasn't sure if the results were real because everyone woke up with perfect glass skin. Of course, I had to try it, and I won't lie - the results are just as good as everyone says they are. And if you're one of those people that isn't swayed in the slightest by TikTok, know that the mask has over 10,500 five-star reviews on Amazon as well (and is currently on sale). Keep scrolling to read my full review of the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask and find out why it's an automatic re-purchase for me. About the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask This product is a sheet mask that is meant to be worn overnight. It's formulated for all skin types. The key ingredients include low molecular weight fish collagen, hyaluronic acid, and niacinamide. It's available in two different packaging sizes: a four-count or a 16-count. What I Like About the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Although I've seen this mask used tons of times on social media, I still wasn't entirely sure how it worked. It starts out as an opaque mask that has almost a silicone-like feel to it, but when you wake up in the morning, it's transparent and needs to be peeled off. The first time I tried it, I put it on before bed, popped a melatonin, and went to sleep. When I woke up, I was shocked to see that the mask had, in fact, completely changed. It looked like I was wearing a clear mask instead. I've used it three times since I initially purchased a pack of four. Once when my skin was fairly normal, once when I was experiencing some annoying breakouts, and once when I had a massive sunburn on my face. I'm genuinely not sure how, but the mask seemed to help with all of my skin issues. I find it to be ultra-hydrating, and it hasn't bothered my acne-prone skin or exacerbated any breakouts. I fully plan on continuing to purchase this mask and use it once a week, especially the night before a date or a special event. Just a heads up, however, this collagen face mask won't actually stimulate collagen production because the molecular weight of collagen is too high to be absorbed by the skin. It will, however, help with hydration. How to Use the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask You can use this mask two different ways. The first is as an overnight mask. For that, the brand recommends applying the mask at the end of your skin-care routine, leaving it on overnight, then removing it in the morning. It comes in two pieces - a top half and a bottom half - but it doesn't matter which piece you put on first. If you want to use it during the day, prep your skin with a toner or serum, apply the mask, and leave it on for at least three to four hours - once it becomes transparent, you can remove it. Personally, I've only used the mask overnight. I use a gentle cleanser to wash my face, and then I apply it directly to clean dry skin. In the morning, I peel it off and wash my face with lukewarm water. From there, I apply my moisturizer. What to Consider Before Trying the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Since this mask is most typically applied overnight, it does take a little getting used to. I've been training myself to sleep on my back as of late, so going to bed with a slippery sheet mask on my face wasn't too hard. However, if you put it on and try to do other things - like bend over - just know that the mask could very well come sliding off. If you're a side or a stomach sleeper, I'd recommend trying this mask out during the day because it will probably be too difficult to keep it on your face while you're in bed. Where Is the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Available? You can purchase the Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask from Amazon - it's currently on sale, so it's a great time to try it!

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/menstrual-cycle-impacts-skin-49442366",
    "description": "No, you're not imagining it - your skin looks more glowing and your face more symmetrical during the follicular phase of your menstrual cycle. This phase begins right after your period ends and typically lasts about a week. It's when estrogen rises, energy returns and many people naturally feel their best. Just like we have a circadian rhythm, those who menstruate also have an infradian rhythm: a 28-day hormonal cycle, better known as the menstrual cycle. It's made up of four phases - menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal - each one shifts hormones in ways that can impact mood, energy, metabolism, immune system, stress response, and hair and skin. We've suspected this connection when we routinely break out around our period or feel like eating everything in sight right before our period starts. But it wasn't until TikTok users began posting before-and-afters that we started asking why - and whether it's possible to biohack our way into feeling hot all month long, not just for one week. We spoke to experts for a full breakdown of how the menstrual cycle affects your skin, hair, and even confidence levels. Keep reading to learn how to work with your cycle - and look your best through every phase. Experts Featured in This Article Sara Vaughn, MD, is a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility. Jolene Brighten, MD, is a hormone expert and author. Sahar Wertheimer, MD, is a dermatologist and hormonal skin expert. The Follicular Phase Glow-Up Is Real The follicular phase kicks off on the first day of your period and lasts until ovulation - approximately seven days. It's also when your estrogen is rising - and that hormone is a skin and hair MVP. \"Estrogen enhances skin hydration by binding to receptors on skin cells that produce hyaluronic acid,\" reproductive endocrinologist Sara Vaughn, MD, says. \"It also stimulates collagen production, which improves elasticity and reduces fine lines.\" Hormone expert Jolene Brighten, MD echoes the glow-up effect: \"Estrogen enhances skin hydration, collagen production, and facial vascularization, all of which contribute to the 'glow' effect people report.\" And there may be more than a perceived boost happening. \"Some research indicates women's faces are rated as more attractive in the late follicular phase, near ovulation, when estrogen peaks,\" she adds. Not only does your skin look more radiant, but your hair may also be shinier and fuller thanks to those hormonal shifts. So what does this mean? It means book your dates, shoot your content, and finally, try that bold lip color you've been too shy to try. The Luteal Phase Letdown On the flip side, because nothing good lasts forever, the luteal phase (which begins after ovulation and lasts until your period starts; approximately 10-14 days) is what we jokingly refer to as the evil step-sister of the follicular phase. \"Progesterone levels rise and can lead to increased sebum, which causes oily skin and more acne breakouts,\" says Dr. Vaughn. \"It can also weaken the skin barrier, causing conditions like eczema or irritant dermatitis to flare.\" However, remember that everyone is different, and knowing your skin's needs can make all the difference. \"Not every person will break out with acne in the luteal phase. Everybody is different,\" says dermatologist Sahar Wertheimer, MD. Dr. Brighten adds that this shift often coincides with a drop in confidence. \"Right before your period, hormones are at their lowest, and skin may be drier and more sensitive. Some people experience dullness or breakouts,\" she says. It's not just the breakouts, though. Feeling puffier or emotionally off during this phase isn't your imagination. Dr. Vaughn says, \"Increased progesterone stimulates leptin production, which can contribute to bloating, and also influences neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine, leading to heightened emotional sensitivity.\" In short, your skin, hair, and mood are going through it. But hey - at least now you know why. Should You Be Syncing Your Beauty Routine to Your Cycle? So, if your hormones are shifting your skin and hair's temperament week to week, should your beauty routine change with it? Potentially. While Dr. Vaughn personally prefers the stability of continuous birth control to avoid the cycle-driven ups and downs, she also says timing treatments can be helpful. \"If you have skin that breaks out during the luteal phase, it makes sense to do things like facials or peels during the follicular phase instead,\" she says. \"Aggressive exfoliation, chemical peels, or laser treatments can be risky during breakouts when skin is more reactive.\" Dr. Wertheimer suggests concentrating on deep cleansing and avoiding heavy makeup. \"Moisturize well and focus on oil control with your hair during luteal and menstruation.\" Consider the luteal phase a transition period leading up to your period - it's a sensitive time. Dr. Wertheimer recommends a gentle and \"less is more\" approach in the last couple of weeks of your cycle. \"I would focus on gentle washing and hydrating techniques. For hair, avoid over washing and use strengthening treatments like hair masks.\" With the boost of estrogen during the follicular and ovulatory phase, doctors agree that this is a good time to lean into collagen production and vitamin C serums. Dr. Brighten points to the follicular phase as the prime time for beauty experimentation. \"This is the ideal time to schedule a photo session or go on a new date because you'll also feel more confident,\" she says. And confidence, of course, is the best beauty hack. Understanding the Phases Is Key Your hormones may not come with a user manual, but they do have a rhythm you can learn to drop into. Understanding how they affect your skin and hair can take some of the guesswork out of those good-skin versus bad-skin days. And while you don't need to overhaul your routine every month, paying attention to the subtle shifts might help you work with your cycle instead of against it. Because if we have to ride this hormone rollercoaster anyway, we might as well look good doing it.
