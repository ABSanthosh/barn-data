    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/CO2-Fractional-Laser-Review-44348882",
    "description": "Growing up in South Florida with three brothers, I didn't care for beauty products or treatments. I played a lot of sports, so sweating + cosmetics = skin disaster. In high school, makeup was not in my vocabulary, and in college, I wore very little foundation and mascara (when I remembered to put it on). My skin routine was pretty simple, too: wash face with soap. Dry face. Perform twice daily. So, when I moved to New York City right out of undergrad, the change in climate and the adjustment to wearing makeup to work every day was a bit of a challenge for my face. Breakouts replaced my once-glowing, sun-kissed skin. And then scars followed. And, naturally, I was not happy. About five years ago, I went and had a Fraxel (a brand of fractional CO2 laser) performed - three times (once per month). It changed my skin texture, completely. I was shocked, amazed, and undoubtedly impressed. My acne scars were significantly decreased - most of them: all gone. It was the super problem-solving laser of my dreams! (Despite the recovery being a nightmare - more on that later.) Since then, I've tried other lasers - such as PicoSure, Clear + Brilliant, etc. - to enhance my skin, which gave me minor results. But I always maintained the belief that CO2 was the holy grail. And even though my skin has vastly improved over the past half decade using other methods, I still wanted to fix a few discolorations and the size of my pores. Also, I'm five years older now, and this baby is great for combating signs of aging. So, to reconfirm my thoughts and get a little touch up, I went to facial plastic surgeon Dr. Andrew Jacono for some zapping. Experts Featured in This Article Andrew Jacono M.D., F.A.C.S., is a double board-certified facial plastic and reconstructive surgeon. He is based in New York. What Is CO2 Fractional Laser? \"A fractional CO2 laser is designed to target aging and damaged skin by creating microscopic 'wounds' within the targeted areas well beneath the skin's outermost layer, which in turn, triggers the body's own natural production of new collagen and skin cells,\" Dr. Jacono tells PS. This sounds painful, as it very well can be on a bare face. Before the procedure, a numbing cream was applied to my clean, product-free cheeks for about 30 minutes. The actual process took less time than the prep - maybe 15 minutes at most (but it differs per person and depends on the area being treated, according to Dr. Shah). I could hear the buzzing of the laser. Only every so often - perhaps once every two and a half minutes - a jolt of pain, which felt like an intense rubber band snapping, would make me teary-eyed. My CO2 Fractional Laser Results My initial experience with CO2 left me hiding in my apartment for almost seven days. It was brutal. This time, I would expect nothing less. So I scheduled my appointment during a time of the year where I could hibernate/be antisocial/work was a bit more calm. \"After a fractional CO2 laser treatment, the majority of patients experience a few days of a sunburn,\" explains Dr. Jacono. And yes, I agree with that. A perforated sunburn. When the laser goes over your face, it creates lines and boxes, almost like graph paper. Immediately after my procedure, redness and swelling ensued. For the next week, I was prescribed an antibiotic and instructed to apply an ointment after washing my face twice daily with a gentle cleanser. I also had to avoid aspirin for 48 hours. Easy enough! After the first day, there was no pain, but my face didn't appear that way. Until day four, I was very visibly red. By day five, I could almost wear makeup again (but I didn't because my face was still peeling. On day seven, I was back to normal). Typically, it takes five to 10 days for recovery, according to Dr. Shah. At the end of my CO2 journey, my face looked clearer of discoloration, my pores were less visible, and my friends and I were in awe of my results (my downtime, not so much). According to Dr. Jacono, CO2 not covered by insurance will cost $2,000 to $5,000 per session, depending on severity. Three to six sessions are typically recommended. While it's a pricey procedure and makes you a bit less social for a couple of days, I found it worth it. I might not need five more sessions, but if I do, there's no doubt I would go back again.

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/glossier-you-doux-reve-fragrance-review?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": ".disclaimer{width:90%;margin-bottom:1rem}.disclaimer__lines{width:100%;margin:0 auto;border-bottom:1px solid #999;padding:0;max-width:150px}.disclaimer__copy{width:100%;max-width:355px;font-family:Brown Regular,sans-serif;font-size:.9rem;font-weight:300;line-height:1.3em;color:#333;padding:0 0 .4rem;margin:1rem auto;text-align:center} All linked products are independently selected by our editors. If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. In 2017, Glossier debuted its first fragrance, You. At the time, founder Emily Weiss likened the unique woody-musk blend to “your boyfriend’s neck after he has been wearing cologne for eight hours.” Back then, skin scents were only beginning to take off, and Glossier perfectly captured what the people didn’t even know they wanted: To smell good, but not in a “Hello world, I’m wearing perfume” way.  As such, Glossier You was undoubtedly a hit, garnering both mass and industry acclaim (including a 2018 Fragrance of the Year award). But if there’s one thing we know about Glossier, it’s that it doesn’t launch products according to calendars or trends; it launches them when it feels that the time is right — and expanding its fragrance offering was no exception. After seven long years, the brand is finally serving up not one, but two additions to the You library. Introducing Doux and Rêve (which mean “soft” and “dream” respectively, en français). If you ask me, these are two of Glossier’s best products in years. Both versions have the same thumbprint glass bottle design as OG You, reimagined in creamy ivory (Doux) and juicy berry (Rêve). And while Glossier’s packaging never misses, it’s what’s on the inside that counts.  Glossier You Doux, $78 Let’s start with Doux, which, spoiler alert, has become my new all-time favorite fragrance. (High praise, I know!) I’m not exaggerating when I say I have not stopped wearing it since my testers arrived, and I truly don’t have anything negative to say about it — other than I might need it in a larger size. It’s a warm, woody fragrance, but one that somehow feels light as air. It’s sensual and earthy, but brightened up with invigorating, smoky Palo Santo, frankincense, and myrrh. Like the original You, I can’t really pinpoint specific notes when it’s on my skin, and that’s what I love about it.  Refinery29’s deputy beauty director Jacqueline Kilikita is equally as enamored by it, drawing comparisons to another beloved brew, Le Labo’s Santal 33: “Doux has a sweeter, softer, skinlike edge, which I’d expect from a Glossier You fragrance,” she said recently “They’re meant to be close and cozy.”  She added, “Like the OG Glossier You, the first spritz is intense but it dries down to something really comforting and nostalgic. I predict this will be the most popular of the bunch, especially when you consider that it’s a snip of the price of Santal 33.” Glossier You Rêve, $78 Onto Rêve, which Glossier bills as a “lush, dreamy gourmand.” Unless you’ve been living under a perfume-starved rock, gourmands are having a moment. It began in earnest with the vanilla perfume renaissance, which gave way to the cherry perfume trend we saw earlier this fall. Rêve slightly breaks the mold with notes of plum butter and toasted almond, giving the scent an overall delectable, juicy vibe without being overly saccharine. (It reminded me of Sabrina Carpenter’s Cherry Baby, which IMO, is a very grown-up, sexy take on fruit-forward scents.) Cherry is exactly what Kilikita gets from Rêve, too: “This is probably really niche but if you remember the Baby All Gone doll that was popular in the ‘90s, you’ll know that she came with a little jar of magnetic cherries, which you’d feed her,” she said in a recent review. “Those cherries smelled amazing — like maraschino and marshmallows — and I’ve spent my entire life looking for a fragrance that smells similar,” Kilikita adds. “I think I might’ve found it in Glossier Rêve.”  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Refinery29 UK (@refinery29uk) The question on everyone’s lips is: How long do they last? Doux and Rêve had decent staying power on my skin and clothes, and lingered from morning until my afternoon shower.  Both new You scents retail for $78 apiece for a 50ml bottle, and are available to shop at Sephora and Glossier. (If you need more You, Glossier currently has a rollerball Discovery Kit of You, You Doux, and You Rêve for $82, or a full-size trio for $200 — a saving of 15% off the à la carte price.)  One thing is true: rarely do beauty launches deserve the rabid hype they receive online — but this one most certainly does; if this is what the future of Glossier has in store, then I for one, cannot wait for more. Like what you see? How about some more R29 goodness, right here?",

    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/hair-me-out-coco-gauff?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Coco Gauff is a force. At just 20 years old, the tennis sensation has multiple singles and doubles titles under her belt, including a win at the 2023 US Open. She’s also made a name for herself by speaking out against unfair treatment on the court, advocating for equality and empowerment in sports and inspiring others along the way. Her secret to stepping into her power? Her hair.  “I love to show braids, I love to wear my curls…[when] you look good and you feel good, and you feel good about yourself, it almost makes you perform better,” she tells sports journalist and broadcaster Taylor Rooks in the latest episode of Hair Me Out, brought to you in partnership with Carol’s Daughter. After all, hair is a crucial form of self-expression, especially for Black women, notes Rooks.  When it comes to her own personal hair journey, Gauff embraces a diverse range of looks, a commitment she credits in part to her new role as Carol’s Daughter ambassador, the pioneering natural hair care brand. “I’ve been open to trying new styles to play with.I want to be that representation, especially in my sport of tennis, where there are not a lot of Black girls playing,” she says. By celebrating her natural hair and experimenting with different styles, she’s not only expressing her identity, but also empowering future generations to feel comfortable in their own skin. From the salon chair, the two get candid about mastering their own hair routines, the importance of family, and the time Gauff was completely starstruck meeting her tennis idol.
