As a Korean-American beauty journalist currently living in Seoul, it’s been fascinating to spot the differences in how people do their hair and makeup here vs. in the States. One thing that stood out to me almost immediately upon my arrival is how people wear their lashes.  Whereas in the West, we’ve historically favored bold, voluminous lashes à la American beauty icons like Dolly Parton, Diana Ross, and ‘90s supermodels, in Korea, I’ve noticed more of a minimalist—almost to the point of sparse—approach. The lashes here are not full or fluffy in the slightest; instead, they’re neatly spaced out with distinct, pointed tips that subtly accentuate the eyes. And you heard it here first: World, meet what I’m calling “point lashes.” I wanted to learn more about point lashes from a pro, so I visited Jung Hye Min, a top makeup artist at Jungnam, a hair and makeup hot spot for celebs and chic locals in Cheongdam. Keep reading for everything to know about the trend. DashDividers_1_500x100 What are point lashes? As my moniker suggests, point lashes are characterized by definition, length, and a visibly spaced out placement. (As Min says, it’s all about “length over volume.”);  You may not have noticed it at the time, but you’ve probably already seen point lashes in passing:  The look has been all the rage among K-Pop idols in recent years, with TikTok and Instagram users sometimes referring to the specific style as “idol lashes”. As you can see on singer Jang Won Young from IVE here, the look still makes a statement, despite the lack of volume.  How do I achieve point lashes? There’s more than one way to try point lashes. For starters, you could achieve the look through lash extensions; just make sure to show your technician a few reference photos of what you want beforehand since it isn’t a common style that’s requested in the West yet. If you’re not ready to commit to extensions or simply want a more budget-friendly alternative, you can also achieve the look with some makeup magic: I’ve also seen people use create the look using mascara and tweezers (and surgical precision) to carefully pinch their lashes together, creating the illusion of sharp, almost spiked lashes. which makes them stand out more. (Tip: Make sure to do this right after applying your mascara, before it has a chance to dry. Otherwise, you can end up with a clumpy, flaky mess instead of neatly pointed ends.) If you want maximum impact like Jang Won Young’s lashes above, you can add point cut or smaller strips of faux lashes to your own before pinching them together with mascara. “Many makeup artists actually hand cut strip lashes into smaller individual clusters,” says Jung. “We remove some of the smaller hairs in-between to get that spaced out effect,” she adds. Another tip from Jung: When applying faux lashes, skip the inner corners of your eyes because they can curl inwards, which can be very uncomfortable.  Who are point lashes best suited for? Whereas full strip lashes or voluminous extensions can overwhelm a smaller set of eyes and tend to look unnatural on someone with monolids (like me), point lashes work for anyone and everyone. As Jung tells me, the secret sauce is that point lashes can easily be  “Point lashes can work for everyone, regardless of eye shape. This is because the lashes can easily be customized to fit your eyes’ natural size, shape, and length.” Whereas full strip lashes or voluminous extensions can overwhelm a smaller set of eyes and tend to look unnatural on someone with monolids (like me), point lashes add just enough oomph without weighing down your eyelids.  As a longtime wearer of fluffy lash extensions, I was skeptical about point lashes at first. Could they really make any difference on my heavier set, monolid eyes? However, after trying them out myself, I was surprised to find that the lighter lashes actually have an eye-opening effect and make me look more bright-eyed and awake.  Want to try the look yourself? I’ve corralled more examples of point lashes ahead. DashDividers_1_500x100 Spikey \u0026 Smokey View this post on Instagram A post shared by 🎀Meet Cute 밋큐트 아렴부원장 (@a_ryeomii) Yeji from ITZY pairs her point lashes with smokey eyeshadow along the lower lashline and colored lenses in a similar hue.  Modern-Day Twiggy View this post on Instagram A post shared by 정수연 (@___s_yeon) Why stop with the upper lashes? You can create an even more impactful look by extending your lower lashes, too. The key to making the look modern is to keep the lashes shorter and more spaced out than the original version worn by Twiggy in the 1960s. Pink Tones View this post on Instagram A post shared by 위위아뜰리에 윤소정 (@jrmsgo) Fact: Point lashes and pink-toned eyeshadows are a perfect match. The softer hues balance the defined lash shape, adding a nice contrast that makes your eyes pop. Shorter Points View this post on Instagram A post shared by 위위아뜰리에 윤소정 (@jrmsgo) For a more subtle, everyday version of this look, you can always opt for shorter lashes and maintain the crisp, pointed ends for the same eye-opening effect.  Winged Out View this post on Instagram A post shared by 위위아뜰리에 윤소정 (@jrmsgo) Cat eye lovers will be happy to know that winged liner also goes nicely with point lashes. To get the look just right, extend your eyeliner just past the outer corners of your eyes and keep the wings straighter, as opposed to flicked upwards. Like what you see?

    "title": "The Real Villain in \"The White Lotus\" This Season? Aging",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/fear-aging-white-lotus-49433178",
    "description": "There's something sinister lurking behind the tranquil mountains of Koh Samui, hidden in plain sight among the koi ponds and palm trees surrounding season three's \"The White Lotus\" resort. It's not someone's impending death (too obvious), nor the pig-tailed monkeys peering in from the trees (too cute). No, the real villain to emerge this season seems to be something far more universal: aging. There are thinly veiled references to society's obsession with youth in every episode thus far, although you see it most blatantly among trio of \"friends\" Jaclyn, Kate, and Laurie (played by Michelle Monaghan, Leslie Bibb, and Carrie Coon, respectively). At first, the nods were subtle: the back-and-forth \"You look amazing,\" \"No, you look amazing!\" between Kate and Jaclyn in episode one, which felt more like watching the pointing Spider-Man meme play out in real time than anything particularly harmful - at least not until Laurie added, \"You look like you just got pushed out of a birth canal.\" Then there was Kate's \"Did she sandblast her face or something?\" about Jaclyn after neither refused to divulge what work they've had done in episode two. When Laurie announced her biomarker test results showed numbers of \"women half her age,\" I swear Jaclyn's side eye was one twitch away from blowing a fuse from the shock. The most flagrant display, however, came in episode four, when the suspiciously chiseled wellness resort man Valentin sent the three women to an all-inclusive nearby. Jaclyn, feeling rejected by her hot, younger husband and in pursuit of a good time, happily settled in to her lounge chair . . . and then she looked around. It took her all but 39 seconds to experience a damn-near panic attack at all the fine lines and wrinkles looking back at her. Of course, nothing director Mike White does is an accident. It's clear he wanted Jaclyn sent somewhere that would turn on the proverbial neon sign that she, too, is getting older. That fear - of aging, of being less desirable, of no longer looking like you just emerged from a birth canal - perfectly captures the reality of youth culture we're all living in. It would be hard not to relate: every day, beauty brands introduce products that promise to \"visibly firm\" and \"restore bounce\" and \"smooth facial contours,\" and, wait, they also \"brighten\" and \"lift\" and \"plump\" the skin for a \"younger, more radiant look\" that appears \"well rested\" and \"fresh faced\" and \"glowing.\" Part of it is generational, sure - everyone knows somebody who considers being called \"old\" an insult - but society has stigmatized aging to a point where even 10-year-olds are lining up to buy eye cream. If you're not sandblasting your face, you're most definitely slathering or slugging or snipping. Right? Anything other than simply existing. If you look around at the gaggle of older men on a yacht with their infinitely younger girlfriends, you'll remember that \"The White Lotus\" is all about perception and exposing our innermost fears. When you realize we've grown up being told that our worth is tied to youth and beauty, that a body that presents as half its biological age must mean a healthier or better body, you might be tempted to forget the alternative of getting older: dying. You can drown out that truth in a sensory deprivation tank, or you can accept that aging is inevitable. It's not scary or evil or out to get you. That would be whoever is on the other side of the koi pond. Related: \"The White Lotus\" Season 3 Makeup Is Giving Wellness Woo-Woo on Purpose",

    "description": "A trip to your injector is more commonplace nowadays than seeing your dentist. Plus, you're more likely to look forward to fresh Botox than your bi-annual teeth cleaning. But did you know that if you inject a neuromodulator (like Botox or Daxxify) into one area of the face, facial harmony dictates you may want to inject it in another to maintain overall balance? One part of the face that sometimes disrupts facial harmony is your undereye area. While there are many topical products to treat dark circles, fine lines, or puffiness that just won't go away, your best line of defense might just be something called \"jelly roll Botox.\" A playful name if ever there was one, \"jelly roll\" Botox targets the muscle under the eyes to reduce the bulging or roll that appears when smiling or squinting. \"The bulge is due to muscle contraction rather than fat, and Botox helps relax the muscle for a smoother, more refreshed look,\" says double board-certified dermatologist Saami Khalifian, MD. \"However, since it can diminish the effect of smiling with your eyes, some people don't like it.\" The treatment is mildly controversial: it's off-label (meaning it's not an officially approved use for Botox), the undereye area is super delicate, and incorrect placement and dosing can leave you with an undesired drooping effect. Read on to learn more about jelly roll Botox and if it's the right treatment for you. Experts Featured in This Article Saami Khalifian, MD, is a double board-certified dermatologist, founder of SOM Aesthetics, and medical director of Allergan Medical Institute. Julius Few, MD, is a board-certified plastic surgeon and founder of Dr. Few Skincare. What Is Jelly Roll Botox? Jelly roll Botox treats the difficult undereye area that frustrates many of us, whether due to genetics or the natural aging process. \"The 'jelly roll' area of the lower eyelid is anatomically called the pretarsal orbicularis oculi muscle, which is the area covering four to six mm of skin below the eyelashes. This muscle is just beneath the skin, but on top of the cartilage that gives the eyelids form and shape,\" says Julius Few, MD, a board-certified plastic surgeon. This muscle aids in closure of the eye, and also adds shape to the margin of the lower eyelids. In some people, this area can be thicker, especially if it is hyperactive, such as if you chronically squint, and can cause fat to be more prominent in the lower eyelids, creating bags under the eyes. The injection is placed just beneath the lower lash line, targeting the muscle. \"I usually place one to two units a few millimeters below the lower lash line just lateral to the mid-pupillary line. This softens muscle contraction, reducing undereye wrinkles, fine lines, and creasing when smiling. The eyes can appear brighter, more open, and less tired without looking unnatural,\" says Dr. Khalifian. (It's important to note that the area of injection is performed off-label, meaning that though it is safe in the right hands, it is not FDA-approved.) Jelly Roll Botox Cost The cost of jelly roll Botox depends upon provider, geographic location, and the recommended dosage. Jelly roll Botox generally requires fewer units of Botox, which typically runs between $10 to $20 per unit.

Good candidates for jelly roll Botox are those who notice a prominent undereye bulge when smiling and desire a subtle, smoothing effect without fillers or surgery. \"Those with undereye hollowness, true fat pads, or existing lower eyelid laxity should avoid it, as relaxing the muscle too much can cause the undereye to appear looser,\" says Dr. Khalifian. While Botox is a beloved injectable and part and parcel of an overall anti-aging routine, it's important to understand its limitations: \"Jelly roll Botox won't fix true undereye bags, hollowness, or dark circles. If the issue is fat pads, Botox won't help. If it's hollowness, tear trough filler, lasers, RF microneedling, or PRF are better options. If muscle contraction is the primary cause of puffiness, a small dose can be effective. Jelly roll Botox only helps the subset of patients that get that thin roll of skin immediately under the lash line upon smiling,\" says Dr. Khalifian. It's imperative to recognize that the undereye area is very delicate, and incorrect placement or dosing can cause temporary eyelid drooping, a dead eye smile, or difficulty blinking. \"I use jelly roll Botox selectively based on the patient's anatomy and after the discussion of the risks. I especially recommend being treated by an advanced practitioner, especially because of its off-label usage,\" says Dr. Khalifian. Dr. Few also cautions against getting jelly roll Botox if you lack the ability to completely close your eyes, which can be due to conditions such as Bell's Palsy, or if you've had any previous eye surgeries. How Long Does Jelly Roll Botox Last? You can expect your jelly roll Botox to last around six weeks, which is slightly shorter than Botox in other areas, due to the \"thinness of the muscle and the very low number of units delivered,\" says Dr. Khalifian. Though he says you can increase the dose to lengthen its effects, it will also increase the intensity, which can deliver favorable or unfavorable results depending upon the patient. \"Most patients return every few months when it's time to do the rest of their Botox,\" he says. He also notes that consistent jelly roll Botox treatments over time can weaken the overactive muscle movement, making your results last longer even as the Botox wears off. To help extend and enhance the results of your jelly roll Botox, Dr. Few recommends daily application of undereye SPF, such as Dr. Few's Rejuvenating Eye + SPF 15 ($175) for people with undereye bags or dark circles, to smooth, brighten, and depuff. Additionally, products such as SkinMedica's TNS Eye Repair ($106) and Alastin Restorative Eye Treatment ($118) improve collagen production in the sensitive thin skin under the eyes.
