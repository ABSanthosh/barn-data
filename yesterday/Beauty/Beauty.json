    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/skinvive-editor-experiment-49315450",
    "description": "As somebody with skin that has a predisposition to dryness, I'm always in search of the next great thing that will quench my complexion's never-ending thirst. I'm also sensitive and prone to acne (just call me a triple threat), which makes that hydration trial and error somewhat tricky. \"Slugging\" tends to clog my pores, and consistent HydraFacial treatments just don't fit into the budget these days. So when celebrity injector and skin educator Vanessa Lee, RN, of the Los Angeles med spa The Things We Do began documenting her experience with Skinvive, a hyaluronic acid injectable filler that gives a post-facial glow for up to nine months without volume, I devoured every Instagram Stories development. According to Lee, Skinvive by Juvederm offers a low risk of unintended outcomes when compared to other injectables (see: Botox's \"Spock\" brows), with a wider pool of candidacy - and amazing results. \"If you are 25 and up and have skin, this is for you,\" Lee says. \"With other treatments, it really depends on your needs and aesthetic style that determines whether or not you are a good candidate. But if you want to have hydrated, glowing, and overall healthier skin, Skinvive is a great option for you.\" I obviously wanted all of the above, so I immediately booked an appointment for myself. Keep reading for my full Skinvive review, including information on how much Skinvive costs and photos after the treatment. Experts Featured in This Article Vanessa Lee, RN, is a celebrity injector and skin educator at the Los Angeles med spa The Things We Do. Skinvive Appointment Prep Prior to my Skinvive appointment, I completed a quick virtual medical clearance to chat through any medications I was taking and recent aesthetic treatments. Then, we went over a minimal prep guide for my upcoming treatment. I didn't need to adjust my skin-care routine beforehand, but I was advised that I may want to avoid blood-thinning agents (like fish oil, aspirin, or Advil) for five to seven days beforehand to minimize bruising. It wasn't a requirement, but just a suggestion, because I have a history of easily bruising. The only other thing you'll want to factor into your appointment is timing. \"If you have a big event coming up, then plan to book your appointment three to four weeks out,\" Lee says, adding that \"it takes that amount of time for you to see Skinvive at its true potential.\" During My Skinvive Appointment I sat in a comfy treatment chair while Lee and I discussed my skin goals: hydrated skin that I could feel so comfortable in I wouldn't reach for foundation. Lee then cleaned off my face and began to draw a grid \"guide\" over my cheeks, which is a bit different from the usual injection points that are typically drawn onto skin during filler treatments. \"We draw out grids on the face that help us make half-centimeter to one-centimeter boxes where we will inject one or two little droplets of Skinvive superficially into the skin,\" Lee says. She began working quickly to inject each square on my grid with an extremely fine and precise needle that allows for a more comfortable patient experience. A few areas had a sensitive or \"spicy\" feeling, but the majority of pokes (and there were about 40 of them) were relatively painless. \"It's completely tolerable. I am a total baby when it comes to pain, and this was a three out of 10 on the pain scale for me. Not fun, but not bad at all, and it is quick,\" Lee says. Lee followed the pokes with a light arnica massage (to help with bruising), and after 15 minutes, I was all done. In fact, the appointment was so fast I had plenty of time left on my parking meter to leisurely grab a coffee before heading back to work. However, if you've got more time on your hands, many patients opt to stack treatments like microinfusions and gentle peels. \"We have a combo treatment at The Things We Do called The ReDew that includes a microinfusion cocktail that's microneedled into the skin with skin vitamins and glutathione, a Skinvive injection, and a light chemical peel. It's the ultimate treatment to address dullness, uneven texture, discoloration, and textural issues,\" Lee says. While a combo of treatments wasn't on the docket for me that day, I put it on my bucket list for future treatments. Day 1 After My Skinvive Appointment Immediately after the treatment, I was told to keep my skin clean (no makeup, workouts, or dusty hikes) and avoid touching my face for the remainder of the day. And if I wanted to continue to minimize my risk of bruising, I was told to steer clear of blood thinners for another three to five days. (Considering I reached for a cold brew right after my appointment, I clearly let my caffeine needs usurp my bruising worries.) After a day, two light bruises began to set in (one on each cheek) that lasted for about a week before fading completely. Luckily, the bruises weren't too noticeable and were easily covered up with a touch of concealer for outings. Skinvive Cost Although the cost will vary depending on where you live as well as the provider you choose to visit, Skinvive is typically $650-$750 for two syringes. How many syringes you need to complete your treatment will be determined by your provider. My Skinvive Results It's important to remember that this treatment is a slow build of skin hydration and results are subtle compared to the instant gratification of traditional fillers. Though I was told that results wouldn't appear for at least two weeks, I felt a teensy bit more hydrated almost immediately - which is apparently common. \"My patients have reported that they can already notice a difference within the first few days and that in two weeks, they notice an amplified result. But we tell patients to expect full results in four weeks because there is a degree of neocollagenesis that occurs with this treatment,\" Lee explains. In case you were curious, neocollagenesis is the process of your skin being stimulated to form new collagen. I carried on as usual for the next few weeks and began noticing that I was having \"good skin days\" essentially every day. Makeup was gliding on like butter, the small crepey lines at the tops of my cheeks were plumped, and nary a zit was to be found. But it wasn't until I was on set for a shoot and both the makeup artist and the photographer made comments about my skin that I realized just how much the Skinvive glow had set in. Lee tells me this is another commonly shared sentiment, adding that it's because of the work happening on the cellular level. \"A group of patients that were involved in a Skinvive study had it injected into their forearms, and a biopsy of skin was taken before and after treatment. What was shown was an increase in skin hydration intracellularly and extracellularly, as well as collagen production and increased skin elasticity,\" she says. If you're looking for a minimally invasive, comfortable treatment with basically no downtime that creates compliment-worthy skin, I can't recommend Skinvive enough.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/nikki-glaser-hair-colorist-tips-49429704",
    "description": "Image Source: Amy Sussman/Getty Images If you don't know Jacob Schwartz by name just yet, chances are high that you'll recognize his work. The colorist, who started out working as an apprentice to celebrity colorist Tracey Cunningham, has touched the heads of some pretty famous stars, including Sydney Sweeney, Margot Robbie, and Bella Hadid - just to name a few. He currently works at Mèche Salon in Beverly Hills, Los Angeles, where he mixes up some of the most perfect shades we've ever seen, including the hue you see on comedian Nikki Glaser. Glaser recently hosted the 2025 Golden Globes, and during her hilarious performance, we couldn't stop staring at her sunlit-blond hair color. When we found out Schwartz was responsible, we knew we needed to know more ASAP. So, we sat down with the colorist, who shared all of his behind-the-scenes tips and tricks for achieving Glaser's flawless shade. Ahead, Schwartz shares how to get - and maintain - the perfect blond. Keep scrolling to learn more. Tip 1: Achieving the Perfect Blond Is All About Technique Glaser's hair has been dubbed \"sunlit blond,\" a lived-in shade that blends highlights and lowlights. \"Sunlit blond is a color trend that I've seen popping up over the past couple months, and a trend that I expect to see much more of into summer,\" Schwartz says. \"It's super customizable and gives you that natural sun-kissed hue that so many blonds look for.\" In order to get Glaser's specific shade, Schwartz used both foils, hand-painted highlights, and lowlights for extra dimension. \"The front money pieces, I hand-paint to ensure precision, and I did the same with the extra poppy blond pieces that I layered throughout.\" Glaser has ends that are a bit blonder, and Schwartz says he uses foils on those areas to create an even tone. \"I always work in layers and keep those darker pieces closer to her head to mimic the natural highlights you get from being out in the sun.\" Image Source: Michael Loccisano/Getty Image Tip 2: Expect Frequent Touch-Ups The perfect shade doesn't come without putting in the work. In Glaser's case, her natural color is darker, so Schwartz says she requires frequent touch-ups to ensure she doesn't have visible root growth. Typically, someone with darker roots should expect to be in the salon every four to six weeks, while someone with a lighter natural hair color can stretch to every 10-12 weeks. \"Hair type and texture also determine how often someone should expect to be in the salon,\" Schwartz says. \"A radiant blond hue like this is extremely customizable, especially if you want to blend or cover grays, which many of my clients aim to do in the salon. For clients looking to cover grays, touch-up frequency depends on the amount of gray you want to cover and how comfortable you are with natural gray growth, among other factors like what type of dye is being used, like permanent, demi-permanent, or semi-permanent.\" Tip 3: How Often and How You Wash Your Hair Matters Schwartz recommends only washing your hair one to two times per week if your scalp and hair can maintain that schedule. \"For blonds, I generally recommend a purple shampoo to ensure the warmer tones don't look brassy,\" he says. \"I also love the Schwarzkopf Professional's BlondMe Blonde Wonders Toning Drops ($26), which help eliminate brassy tones from blond hair. You just add the toning drops to your favorite conditioner or mask. If you're looking for a hair mask, Schwartz recommends using a hydrating product, like the Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask ($30). To help stretch the time in between washes, Schwartz loves dry shampoos but cautions that you should always find the right product for your hair type - whether that's a spray or a powder. Another product that makes a huge difference? Filtered shower heads. \"I love the Canopy Filtered Shower Head ($150) because it removes chlorine and other contaminants like heavy metals from your water,\" Schwartz says. \"These can strip the hair of natural oils, not only leaving the hair damaged and dry, but negatively affecting your hair color, as well. A filtered shower head can lead to longer color preservation and less breakage, which is a goal for all my clients.\" Tip 4: Heat Style In Moderation Can't quit your hot tools habit? Don't worry - it's all about doing things in moderation. \"It's OK to pick a few things that are potentially damaging to your hair as long as you are using the right products and color line,\" Schwartz says. \"What you can't do is have platinum blond, chemically treated hair that you blow dry and straighten every day on high heat and expect it to stay healthy. My biggest piece of advice is to pick one or two things that you need to feel good and tailor your approach from there.\" So, if you're big on the platinum-blond look, try air-drying. If you can't quit your daily blow-drying, know you'll have to do less when it comes to coloring. Tip 5: Hair SPF Is A Must We always hear about putting SPF on our faces, but if you want your color to last, you'll want to extend that courtesy to your hair, as well. \"If your hair is heavily colored, I recommend avoiding direct sun exposure, as it can alter your color,\" Schwartz says. \"I always suggest a hair SPF or UV-rated heat protectant to my clients to help protect their strands from drying out and to keep their color looking its best. Many don't realize it, but just like the sun affects your skin, it can also impact your hair.\" Our current favorite is the Sun Bum Protecting Scalp Hair Mist ($17).

If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. Along with the gloomy weather, the transitional period between winter and early spring brings forth myriad skincare challenges. Think dry skin, dullness, and chapped lips, to name a few. Some products just don’t cut it in when the air is cold and dry, as they are either not hydrating enough or too harsh on already-compromised skin. I speak to dermatologists and beauty experts for a living, and one piece of advice I hear time and again is to make subtle tweaks to your skincare routines around different times of year to adapt to your skin’s changing needs. So which products are they phasing out for the season, and which ones are they using instead? I’ve made it my mission to find out. Ahead, I spoke to a handful of dermatologists and skincare experts to find out the formulas they tend to sideline between winter and spring — and more importantly, the replacements they are bringing back into the fold. From swapping out foaming cleansers for gentler alternatives to ditching certain ingredients in favor of others, their recommendations will help keep your skin watered, balanced, and glowing through February and beyond. The following quotes have been edited for clarity and length. DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your foaming cleanser Use instead: Uriage Cleansing Oil, $21.69 “I tend to skip foaming cleansers because they often contain harsher surfactants that can strip the skin of its natural oils — and the colder weather already dries out my skin. During the winter and months leading up to spring, the skin needs extra hydration and protection so I prefer to use more hydrating, gentle cleansers that help maintain my skin’s barrier. Consider an oil-based option like the Uriage Cleansing Oil, $21.69. Oil-based cleansers help remove impurities and maintain the skin’s moisture barrier while being gentle — without stripping essential oils, which is crucial during harsher winter months. Additionally, their nourishing properties help keep my skin soft and hydrated.” — Dr Derrick Phillips, consultant dermatologist Shop our favorite cleansing oils DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your face oil Use instead: Chanel No. 1 De Chanel Revitalizing Serum, $165 “I’ve invested more time in my gua sha routine during the colder months, as it noticeably improves my skin’s firmness. While I used to rely on sunflower seed oil for its emollient benefits, my skin has become more sensitive, leading to breakouts. I’ve since moved on to the No. 1 De Chanel Revitalizing Serum, $165. Its lightweight formula — packed with moisturizing glycerin — lends enough slip for my gua sha tool without tugging and dragging at my skin, or clogging my pores. The star ingredient is red camellia extract, an antioxidant that boosts the skin’s radiance and firmness. I pair it with the No. 1 De Chanel Massage Accessory, $70, a tool that boasts 85% bio-based materials and features a ridged side for gentle exfoliation. Together, they keep my skin glowy and plump. When I finish the routine with a dose of No. 1 De Chanel Red Camellia Cream, $120, my hydration levels are even more enhanced.” — Venus Wong, Refinery29 senior writer Shop our favorite serums DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your exfoliating scrub Use instead: SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore Moisturizer, $155 “The colder weather makes skin dry, and abrasive scrubs with rough, physical exfoliants can irritate or strip away too much of the skin’s natural oils. Instead, look for [milder cleansers] with hydrating ingredients like glycerin, aloe, or ceramides. These ingredients help maintain moisture balance while still effectively cleansing. I’ve found that [such] cleansers leave skin feeling soft, fresh and nourished, without the dry, tight sensation that harsher exfoliants can cause. “This is [also] a time when skin needs extra hydration and protection. [Besides a mild cleanser] I’d recommend a richer, cream-based moisturizer to keep skin hydrated and prevent moisture loss. One of my top picks is SkinCeuticals Triple Lipid Restore, $155. Not only is it hydrating, but it also helps replenish the skin’s natural lipids, which are often depleted in colder weather. It’s rich without being too heavy or greasy, leaving the skin feeling soft and nourished.” — Dr Edel Woods, consultant dermatologist and founder of ORA Skin Clinic Shop our favorite rich moisturizers DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your lightweight body lotion Use instead: La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+M, $17.99 “I tend to skip lightweight body lotions in the colder months, as the formulation feels too light. My legs get particularly dry and wearing tights worsens this. I replace my body lotion with La Roche-Posay Lipikar Baume AP+M, $17.99. I don’t like anything that feels too heavy or sticky, and this one still melts into my skin, which feels better hydrated. It combines humectants (like glycerin, which draws in moisture), with emollients (such as shea butter) to soften the skin. There are also prebiotics to balance the microbiome of the skin barrier [the outermost layer of skin] so that it hydrates my body effectively.” — Dr Ellie Rashid, consultant dermatologist and pro medical director of Klira Shop our favorite moisturizing body balms DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your lip balm Use instead: The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner, $8.70 “My lips always bear the brunt of the changing weather. You might instinctively reach for lip balm, but I need something a little stronger to tackle flaky skin — otherwise, I’ll end up picking at it. Enter: glycolic acid. This potent alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) is an excellent exfoliator, effortlessly sweeping away dry, peeling skin. I recently had the chance to try dermatologist Dr. Idriss’ Barrier Baste Lip Peel, which harnesses the power of glycolic acid. “In the past, I’ve used The Ordinary 7% Glycolic Acid Exfoliating Toner, $8.70, on a cotton swab, followed by a rich moisturizer — something substantial like La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Baume B5, $18.99, — and the results have been impressive. Dr Idriss calls this method “lip basting”, and it’s a simple yet game-changing way to step up your lip care routine during transitional weather.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Refinery29 beauty director Shop our favorite glycolic acid treatments DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your sulphate face wash Use instead: Avène Tolerance Control Extremely Gentle Cleanser, $27 “Foaming cleansers, especially those with sulphates like sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS), can be too harsh in the colder months. While they effectively remove oil and debris, they also strip away essential lipids, leaving the skin dry, tight and more prone to irritation — especially when the skin barrier is already compromised. For my patients with more sensitive skin types, I recommend the Avène Tolerance Control Extremely Gentle Cleanser, $27. This ultra-mild, creamy cleanser is soap-free, fragrance-free and formulated with minimal ingredients to support the skin’s natural barrier. It relies on Avène’s signature thermal spring water and a milky, lotion-like texture to cleanse without disrupting hydration. It’s perfect for winter and early spring, especially for dry, sensitive, or reactive skin.” — Dr Ashley Magovern, consultant dermatologist and Dermstore medical advisory board member Alternatively, use: iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, $49 “I recommend the iS Clinical Cleansing Complex, $49, to patients with oily or acne-prone skin. This gel-based cleanser is gentle but deeply cleans the skin without disrupting its natural moisture balance. It contains antioxidants and mild resurfacing ingredients, such as white willow bark (a natural form of salicylic acid), which help with congestion without overdrying. This cleanser works well for all skin types, including sensitive skin.” — Dr Ashley Magovern, consultant dermatologist and Dermstore medical advisory board member Shop our favorite gentle cleansers DashDividers_1_500x100 Skip: Your petroleum jelly ointment Use instead: A hand cream with ceramides and urea, like Eucerin Urea Repair Plus 5% Hand Cream, $14.99 “I wouldn’t recommend applying just petroleum jelly on the hands, since it’s an occlusive [an ingredient that forms a protective layer on the skin but isn’t particularly moisturising when used on its own]. If your hands are very dry, you ideally need to have a moisturizer with ceramides to hydrate the skin from within. [Ceramides are lipids, or fat molecules, that make up your skin’s natural barrier and help retain moisture, keeping the skin smooth, plump and hydrated.] I’d also suggest looking for a hand cream with urea, which helps remove the dead skin cell build-up and further draws water into the skin for hydration.” — Dr Zainab Laftah, consultant dermatologist \u0026 British Skin Foundation spokesperson Based on Dr Laftah’s advice, we recommend trying Eucerin Urea Repair Plus 5% Hand Cream, $14.99. It’s rich in both urea and ceramides and is adored for its ability to alleviate cracks and flakiness on the hands, especially for people with contact dermatitis. If you really want to lock that moisture in, that’s when sealing your hand cream with a top layer of a petroleum jelly product, like Vaseline, can come in: This technique is also known as ‘hand slugging’.

    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find our editor-approved lineup of the best to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Fashion Month is finally here to save us from the cold, dark winter nights. Just kidding, it’s still going to be cold and dark, but that doesn’t mean we can’t enjoy watching some outrageous beauty and fashion moments while firmly wrapped up inside in our blankets. Of course, we’ve already had a little taste of what’s to come thanks to Men’s Fashion Week and Couture Week taking over Paris, as well as Copenhagen Fashion Week landing in Denmark’s capital. Tyla took on sub-zero temperatures by turning heads in a navy side slit dress at the Jacquemus Spring/Summer 2025 show and Jenna Ortega proved that black is the new black with her ultra-chic goth girl ensemble at Christian Dior. There were plenty of eye-catching looks on the runways, too, with Willy Chavarria making the case for barely there brows and red hot lips and Schiaparelli proving that sometimes it’s about not overtaking the outfit by embracing a minimalistic slick-back bun. Plus, Copenhagen has been serving us all the street style inspo, with colored faux fur jackets, knitted hoods, and office-appropriate neck ties going straight on our mood boards.As we head into the marathon of women’s shows lined up across New York, London, Milan, and Paris we’re still keeping one eye on all of the major fashion and beauty drops happening across February. From a designer luggage collaboration to a new bouncy mascara, click through to discover all the new launches heading your way this month. Beyoncé and Levi’s Launch Chapter 2When Beyoncé dropped “Levi’s Jeans” on her Grammy-winning album, Cowboy Carter, it was all but inevitable that the superstar would team up with the iconic denim brand in some way. After reimagining a 1985 laundromat-set ad last year, Beyoncé is back with Chapter 2 of her Levi’s Campaign, this time reimagining a 1991 ad. Set to the backdrop of the musician’s country-tinged track, the video (directed by Melina Matsoukas) stars Beyoncé clad in a bedazzled denim outfit at a pool hall, where she takes on Justified actor Timothy Olyphant in a game. Highlighted pieces include Levi’s Ribcage Wide Leg Jeans, Braided Vest, and Spade Trench. “There isn’t another wardrobe piece that evokes comfort, modern elegance, classic Americana attire, and nostalgia the way denim does,” Beyoncé said in a press release.  “And when I think of all those things, I think of Levi’s. For the second chapter in our collaboration we had even more fun in reimagining the denim on denim narrative, through the lens of a woman, who can be sexy, bold and a fierce competitor, all at once. We wanted to celebrate the duality of grace and power.” Louis Vuitton Launches LV Biker BagA new luxury handbag style is about to take over this spring, courtesy of Louis Vuitton: the LV Biker. Originally debuting during the fashion house’s SS25 runway show, the leather bag is inspired by biker jackets, featuring side straps and buckles similar to LV’s iconic trunks. Available in three sizes, the bag is also ultra versatile: it can be worn as a clutch, on the elbow, over the shoulders, or as a cross-body, and it boasts a collapsible construction for easy storage, too.  Shop now at Louis Vuitton Louis Vuitton LV Biker PM, $, available at Louis VuittonVictoria's Secret Launches Designer Collaboration With AltuzarraVictoria’s Secret has unveiled a new designer series: Atelier Victoria’s Secret x Alturzarra. The collaboration names New York-based designer Joseph Altuzarra as the lingerie brand’s first-ever designer in residence, a title under which he will create a number of limited-edition collections throughout the year. The debut spring 2025 collection features 11 pieces focused on closet basics, such as a bodysuit in the style of a classic white button-up shirt, a satin trench coat, tailored black trousers, a knit cropped cardigan, and a fitted wool blazer. “With this partnership, I wanted to bring my perspective to a brand known for celebrating femininity and sensuality,” Altuzarra said in a press release. “I focused on pieces that felt effortless and sensual, and imbued them with subtle elements of discovery — classic wardrobe styles, but always with a twist.” Prices range from $95 to $500.Shop now at Victoria’s Secret Atelier Victoria's Secret x Altuzarra Satin Bias-Cut Dress, $, available at Victoria's SecretStarface x Hello KittyStarface stickers are often seen to adorn famous faces including Justin Bieber, PinkPantheress, and Anne Hathaway to name just a few.

That’s how much the duo loves the Paris-based label. So, naturally, when they were ready to launch Casalina’s first fashion collaboration, they wanted it to be with Rowen Rose. Enter the new Rowen Rose x Casalina collection, which was inspired by the Amalfi Coast and the image Mize and McKinley held dear. The limited-edition capsule features five styles — all of which are red — that can be mixed and matched: a one-piece swimsuit with a keyhole cut-out, a bikini, a maxi skirt, and two vacation-ready dresses.

Essentially a type of peptide, or protein, growth factors can stimulate skin cell growth over time, boosting the collagen and elastin which naturally depletes as we age. When used in skincare, they can have promising results for fine lines, with some calling growth factors \"Botox in a bottle\" — hence why they feature in Medik8’s latest serum. Packed with Dual MiniProteins™, the serum aims to combine the \"deep penetration of peptides with the enhanced potency of proteins\" helping to support skin structure and bring back firmness to the face. Further enhanced by moisture-grabbing hyaluronic acid and a skin barrier-saving prebiotic complex, the serum is all about achieving smoother skin.Shop now at Medik8Medik8 Liquid Peptides Advanced Face Serum, $, available at Medik8RIMOWA x Rick Owens It just got even more exciting to travel with a Rimowa suitcase. The high-end suitcase brand has teamed up with the Lord of Darkness himself, aka legendary designer Rick Owens. The collaboration infuses Owens’ minimalist edge with Rimowa’s sleek and minimalist design and sees the Original Cabin Bronze suitcase transformed using a manual pigmentation process. The result is a dark aged effect on the suitcases’ aluminum exterior, with each case having its own distinct finish. Plus, the interior has been upgraded to all-black leather and the suitcase is finished off with a cowhide luggage tag for a subtle touch of texture.Shop now at RIMOWARimowa x Rick Owens Cabin, $, available at RimowaCalvin Klein Returns to New York Fashion WeekCalvin Klein returned to New York Fashion Week for the first time in six and a half years!
