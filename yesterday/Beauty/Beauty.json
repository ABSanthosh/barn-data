    "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.Stepping into a new year can often feel like you’re a bear who’s woken up halfway through hibernation. Thankfully, 2025 has plenty of glamorous occasions to keep us entertained as we shake off the shock, dust off our laptops, and jump back into the grind. The Golden Globes kicked off awards season with a long list of fashion and beauty knockout moments. Our favorites of the night were Ayo Edebiri’s ‘90s Julia Roberts-inspired gray Loewe suit, Zendaya’s burnt orange satin Louis Vuitton gown, and Kylie Jenner’s direct homage to Elizabeth Hurley’s backless Versace number, which really got the people talking. While our gaze is fixed on the red carpet for more amazing looks as the season ramps up, we’re also keeping an eye on the exciting launches happening in the fashion and beauty space this month. From a new Fenty Skin cleanser to a Louis Vuitton collaboration, click through to see all the new goodies heading your way this January.H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring CapsuleDesigned with transitional dressing and warmer days in mind, H\u0026M Studio’s Pre-Spring Capsule collection features tailored wardrobe essentials with flowing fabrics and voluminous silhouettes — think a long collarless coat, an oversized leather jacket, a sleek black trench made with a windbreaker-type fabric, a wrap-around miniskirt and more. Pieces are available in a black and midnight blue color palette, while a yellow and purple crocus — one of the first blooms of spring — print is also available on a pair of leggings and handkerchief-hem maxi dress. Shop at hm.com on January 30Marine Serre x RepettoBalletcore is lingering for a little bit longer, thanks to the  Marine Serre x Repetto collaboration. The partnership between the two French brands infuses the former’s modern aesthetics with the latter’s classic dance style. (Repetto was founded in 1947 as a ballet shoe company.) The result is two shoe styles: the leather Lilouh flat, embossed with Serre’s signature crescent moon on the toe, and the Camille ballerina, which features a 1-inch block heel and is available in denim, black, white, and fire red moon prints. “As a child, I was captivated by the elegant style of Repetto ballerinas,” Serre said, in a press release. “On top of that, they were crafted near my home in Saint Médard d’Excideuil. For my sister and I, it was magical to visit this factory, which introduced us to the world of craftsmanship.”Shop now at repetto.com Repetto x Marine Serre Lilouh Ballet Flats, $, available at RepettoLouis Vuitton x Murakami Re-Edition CollectionWith Zendaya fronting the campaign, Louis Vuitton is straight out of the gate with the collaboration of the year. Twenty years after its first collection with Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, the French luxury house is back with an internet-breaking re-edition. Leaning into Y2K nostalgia in all the right ways (Paris and Britney were both OG fans), the assortment includes the iconic bright monogrammed Speedy Bandoulière 25 bag, slingback mules, patterned silk scarves, and even a skateboard complete with the Superflat Panda — because why not? Shop at Louis Vuitton nowLouis Vuitton x Takashi Murakami Speedy Bandoulière 25, $, available at Louis VuittonConverse Valentine’s Day Collection + Alex Cosani CampaignConverse is celebrating the season of love with Alex Consani. The model stars in the footwear brand’s Valentine’s Day campaign, called “Love Me, Love Me Not,” highlighting the edgy and feminine sides of self-love. It introduces its themed collection, which includes a pair of Chuck 70 high-tops covered in rosettes, black leather Chuck 70 De Luxe platform heels with a heart-studded strap, pink low-tops, patent leather Mary Janes, rose-adorned apparel, and more.  Shop now at converse.com Converse Chuck 70 Valentine's Day, $, available at ConverseConverse Chuck 70 De Luxe Heel Platform Valentine's Day, $, available at ConverseJ.Crew Teams Up With AraksBefore launching her luxury intimates line Araks, Araks Yeramyan was a member of J.Crew’s design team. Now, the two have reunited with a limited-edition collection of lingerie and loungewear. The Araks x J.Crew capsule features a range of underwear and sleepwear featuring bold colors and elegant design details — think ice blue cotton-silk embroidered pajamas, berry-tinted bralettes, and a color-blocked slip dress with scalloped trims. “The pieces are both effortless and considered, chic without trying too hard,” Yeramyan said of the collab. “These are the clothes you’ll reach for without thinking, yet always feel good in. They carry a quiet confidence, the kind of ease that makes them as much a gift to yourself as anyone else.” Shop now at J.Crew Araks x J.Crew Midi Slip Dress, $, available at J.CrewAraks x J.Crew Beatrice Bralette, $, available at J.CrewPHLUR Golden Rule EDPPHLUR, the brand behind the viral Missing Person fragrance, is back with a new hypnotic scent. Enter: Golden Rule. Encased in a shimmering gold bottle, the brand describes the eau de parfum as “sensual,” combining notes of juicy mandarin and pink pepper with smooth coconut milk, vanilla cream, and orange flower. Warm and feminine, the fragrance is perfect for imbuing a sprinkle of summer into cold winter nights.Shop now at PhlurPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $, available at PhlurRixo x Stripe \u0026 StareRixo is known for its playful prints and feminine silhouettes; Stripe \u0026 Stare is recognized for its ultra-comfortable and consciously-made underwear. The only question we have is: How has it taken this long for the two London-based brands to join forces? The Rixo x Stripe \u0026 Stare features must-have essentials (different cuts of underwear, camisoles, bodysuits, and even baby tees) in covetable and cutesy patterns — such as heart- and leopard-prints and florals — and a pair of briefs with the phrase “forget me not” etched across them. Pieces are available in US sizes 2 to 22, and made with 95-percent biodegradable fabric.  Shop at Rixo and Stripe \u0026 Stare on January 16 Fenty Skin Cherry Dub CleanserWhile we start yet another year screaming “Where is the album?!” to the sky, Rihanna remains booked and busy, launching a new lightweight gel cleanser. The product is all about harnessing the Barbados cherry, which is rich in vitamin C. Here the brightening ingredient is combined with niacinamide to improve skin texture and aloe juice for soothing inflammation. Shop now at Fenty BeautyFenty Beauty Cherry Dub Pore Purify'r Gel Cleanser, $, available at Fenty BeautyLoewe x OnSwiss running shoe brand On is one of the fastest growing brands on the market, working with megawatt talent like Zendaya and collaborating with buzzy designers like Jonathan Anderson through Loewe.

Brazilian Bum Bum Cream creators Sol de Janeiro are stepping up to the plate this month with the launch of a lightweight body oil scented with pink dragon fruit and hibiscus. Cacay oil is said to boost collagen and elastin production, while squalane plumps and amaranthus flower seed extract moisturize deeply. Be sure to apply to damp skin for maximum hydration.Shop now at SephoraSol de Janeiro Beija Flor Body Oil, $, available at SephoraLevi's x UNDERCOVERIn honor of its 35th anniversary, Japanese luxury streetwear brand Undercover has once again teamed up with Levi’s. The second collaboration between the two brands fuses their rich heritages. The nine-piece collection includes pieces like a denim trucker jacket with detachable zip detailing (a reference to Undercover’s fall/winter 1998 collection), a pair of 501 jeans with an embroidered zigzag pattern, and apparel with archival Undercover graphics. Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea stars in the campaign to promote the new drop. Shop at Levi’s on January 18 Jenny Bird Love CollectionValentine’s Day is just around the corner, meaning we’re allowed to continue buying gifts for others (and ourselves). Toronto-based jewelry designer Jenny Bird is keeping things classic with an array of heart-shaped accessories including a padlock heart pendant necklace, heart button studs, and a gold ring adorned with a dangling heart charm. Our favorites have to be the subtle heart puff earrings, which appear sculptural from the front and more abstract from the side view — perfect for the lovergirls who like to keep things on the down-low. Shop at Jenny BirdXO, Kitty x Good Light CosmeticsFor the rom-com lovers among us, the return of To All The Boys spinoff XO, Kitty is a welcome distraction from the miserable January weather. Not only is the show coming back to Netflix for a second season (with Peter Kavinsky in tow), it’s also teaming up with Korean beauty brand Good Light to launch a limited-edition lip bundle. The kit’s main gem is the Multi-Peptide Lip Nectar, a non-sticky lip hydrator with ingredients including lychee, vitamin C, glycerin, and yuzu seed peptide. There’s even a collectable keychain included in the backpack-inspired packaging.Shop from 16th January at ULTA Beauty.Like what you see?

There was a point not too long ago where it seemed I couldn’t get away from blindingly bright, dramatically strobed cheekbones and nose bridges all over my feed. Becca Cosmetics’ Champagne Pop Shimmering Skin Perfector (IYKYK) had me in a chokehold between the years of 2014-2016, until one day…it didn’t. Slowly but surely, I asked myself if highlighter was, in fact, dead. (On one hand, if you have to ask…) But the thing is, even if highlighter had fallen out of favor, glowy skin had not — that much was certain. “The strobing and highlighter craze perfectly aligned with the early years of beauty on social media, offering a bold, hyper-glowy complexion,” makeup artist and Sephora Beauty Director David Razzano tells Refinery29. “In truth, most people couldn’t translate these harsh strobed effects into daily life – it looked too intense.” (He’s not wrong, but also I think that may have been the point.) “I think that highlighting has quieted down a bit on social because skincare has taken a front seat,” says MAC Cosmetics Senior Artist Michelle Clark. “It’s more about skin artistry now and seeing your natural skin shine through.” So, just as skincare has become so deeply ingrained into beauty routines and social media discourse, it seems that the consensus is Why fake glowy skin when you can have the real thing? “People will always use highlighter, but now it’s less about on top of the makeup and more about creating well-hydrated, dewy skin that radiates through,” Clark adds. DashDividers_1_500x100 So, what exactly does “highlighter 2.0” look like? “In my opinion, the key to modern highlighting is to ensure that the result resembles natural, glowy skin,” says Razzano. “You want your skin to take center stage, not the makeup.” (Preach!) In lieu of see-it-from-space pops of dazzling shimmer, the 2025 interpretation of a highlighted complexion calls for naturally glowy skin that looks lit from within. “Using the correct formulas and techniques for your skin type will allow you to create a natural-looking finish,” Razzano says. “My favorite way to highlight the skin now is by focusing on skin prep to create a glowy complexion,” explains Clark, who also recommends massaging the face during this step to boost circulation and revive your complexion before a drop of makeup hits your face. “When it comes to modern highlighting, I like to use serums, oils or cream products under and over complexion products to create a seamless highlight,” she says. DashDividers_1_500x100 What products work best for a modern highlight? According to Razzano, the most important thing to keep in mind when highlighting is actually your skin type — and here’s why: “This is often overlooked by many, but it is the key to success: If someone has dry to normal skin, I’ll use a deeply hydrating moisturizer like Tatcha’s Dewy Skin Cream to prep because I want to achieve radiant skin through quality, long-lasting hydration, followed by Saie Glowy Super Gel all over the face to give a beautiful glow and radiance.” For the combination or oily girlies, Razzano suggests a “strategic” approach to highlighting. “This skin type will get a natural glow from oil production, so targeting specific areas is better here, since ‘all over glow’ would likely end up with an excessively shiny T-zone,” he explains. “I would likely use a lightweight moisturizer like Glow Recipe Watermelon Pink Juice to prep the skin with hydration that won’t add additional oil or shine to the face, then create radiance on targeted areas using a soft luminizer like Milk Makeup’s Dewy Cream Highlighter Stick for a beautiful, natural look that melts into the skin.” Clark also leans heavily into skin prep, adding a mist to both prep and set skin. “I never start makeup with dry skin — I use MAC Fix + Magic Radiance to mist the skin with a nourishing dose of Vitamin C and hyaluronic acid,” says Clark. “With it still damp, I will go in with few pumps of MAC Hyper Real Serumizer. These steps work together to create a smooth, glowy canvas for foundation and concealer.” With a dewy base, Clark then recommends “MAC’s glow duo” (the brand’s Studio Radiance Foundation and Studio Radiance Luminous Lift Concealer) to create highlighted skin using not highlighter, but strategically placed foundation and concealer. “I start with a single pump of foundation and create a veil of coverage all over the skin, then I go in specific areas — like the under eyes, around the nose and chin — to give a bit more coverage and luminosity.” Last step? “The final piece to a modern highlighted complexion is to take a pump of Serumizer and tap it on top of the cheekbones, bridge of the nose and cupid’s bow.” And voilà, naturally luminous skin that doesn’t look like a full face of glam — because as it turns out, the best highlighter is the one you don’t even see.

    "description": "Rising pop star Chappell Roan has been turning heads since 2015, not just with her infectious music but with her show-stopping makeup looks that are as much a part of her artistry as her songs. The \"Midwest Princess\" has built a passionate following by keeping it real while serving up feel-good anthems that resonate deeply with the LGBTQIA+ community and beyond. Though she's widely celebrated for her 2024 queer anthem \"Good Luck, Babe,\" there's a unique story behind the signature makeup that's become part of her magnetic stage presence. \"I am in love with makeup, and I've done it for myself my whole life and career,\" Roan says on Hulu's \"Face Of Music\" series. The star takes viewers through the process of re-creating her album cover look, breaking down the meaning behind her white face paint and its connection to her work and lived experiences. \"The white face is very important. There's a reason why I do the white face,\" Roan says. \"I grew up in a place where there wasn't a lot of gay people that were out, proud and safe. There were a few people, mostly boys at my high school, that would call gay people clowns.\" She goes on to explain that the boys at her school would say that gay people are \"loud\" and \"obnoxious,\" further prompting an iconic idea within her: to paint herself as a clown. Instead of letting it hurt her, she decided to take ownership of her identity. In her journey of self-expression and artistic evolution, Roan has transformed potential ridicule into a powerful statement of authenticity and pride. Her makeup choices aren't just aesthetic decisions – they're declarations of identity and resistance against societal constraints. Later in the episode, Roan discusses the inspiration behind her campy pop star persona, drawing from the artistry of iconic performers. She looked to the stunning glamour of drag queens, the avant-garde Lady Gaga, the fierce Nicki Minaj, and the incomparable Dolly Parton - each having an unforgettable presence in their own unique way. What's even more captivating is how Roan connects with Dolly Parton. They share one signature beauty element that still catches everyone's eye: that bold blue eyeshadow. \"Blue eyeshadow is so stigmatized with sex workers, drag makeup, [and] promiscuous behavior. And it's all connected to why I picked it,\" she says. \"Everything I do is a f*ck you to the blocks I was so pressured to be put in.\" What truly sets Roan apart is her incorporation of pop culture references, drawing parallels between her signature white face paint and VMA performance with iconic moments like Madonna's MTV white-face moment. Her artistic choices perfectly embody her broader vision: creating a cultural ecosystem founded on authentic self-expression, queer representation, accessibility, and genuine community building. Through her bold makeup choices and fearless self-expression, Roan has created more than just a stage persona – she's curated a narrative that speaks to the hearts of anyone who has ever felt marginalized or misunderstood. Her artistry serves as both a mirror and a beacon, reflecting the experiences of her audience while lighting the way forward for greater acceptance and celebration of individuality in pop culture.

    "description": "What do red light, microcurrent, peels, microneedling, and laser-hair removal all have in common? To start, they're all treatments you can get under the care of a professional, but they're also available to you in the comfort of your home with the right beauty gadget. We love the convenience of being able to improve our skin with the click of a button while sitting on the couch, but that's not to say that at-home beauty treatments are foolproof. This is top of mind right now because on Jan. 17, TikTok user Amina of @ItsMeMien posted a now-viral video claiming that a popular, celebrity-endorsed skin-care device caused her to experience Bell's palsy, a temporary weakness or paralysis on one side of the face. In the video, she said she only used the device twice on its lowest level before immediately noticing an issue. The device in question is the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro, which has a plethora of different features, including microcurrent, LED, and electromagnetic stimulation. People in the comments were understandably alarmed, but it may not be time to ditch your tool just yet. The brand has released a statement refuting the claims, providing an in-depth response confirming that the Booster Pro does not cause Bell's palsy. Additionally, we spoke to experts who believe it's highly unlikely to be related. (FWIW, one of our PS editors has also used the device herself on multiple occasions without issue.) To get to the bottom of this event, we chatted with three doctors who shared more about Bell's palsy, why it's not necessary to ditch your beauty tools, and the importance of following instructions when using devices at home. Experts Featured in This Article Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, is a double board-certified facial plastic surgeon located in New York City. Kellie Reed, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Westlake Dermatology in Austin, Texas. Kunal Malik, MD, is a board-certified general and cosmetic dermatologist located in New York. What Is Bell's Palsy, and Can Microcurrent Cause It? \"Bell's palsy occurs when the facial nerve, which controls these muscles, becomes inflamed or compressed,\" says Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD, double board-certified facial plastic surgeon. \"While it is often suspected to be linked to viral infections, the condition is classified as idiopathic facial paralysis, meaning its exact cause is unknown.\" One of the features of the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro device is microcurrent, which is not unique to this specific device - there are plenty of other microcurrent devices on the market right now. \"Since the exact cause of Bell's palsy is unknown, we can't definitively say that skin-care devices or treatments cause nerve damage,\" Dr. Vasyukevich says. \"However, it is highly unlikely that anything over-the-counter would cause this condition.\" The (Rare) Risks That Can Come With Beauty Tools That said, you can use this event as a wake-up call to educate yourself on how to properly use your beauty devices. As great (and safe) as most of this tech is, it's still important that you know what you're doing. With microcurrent, \"risks of improper handling or using a damaged device can lead to minor electric shock or worsening of skin conditions such as various inflammatory conditions of the skin like acne or rosacea,\" board-certified dermatologist Kellie Reed, MD, says. \"It is important to know that it can interfere with some medical devices such as pacemakers or metal implants.\" Additionally, board-certified dermatologist Kunal Malik notes that using microcurrent devices without conductive gel can cause skin irritation and compromise treatment effectiveness. However, most of these concerns can be avoided by following proper instructions as listed by the manufacturer. Microcurrent isn't the only type of at-home beauty tech that you should be careful with. Widely beloved LED therapy, which is touted for its ability to fight signs of aging and banish acne, also requires a level of care. \"With LED light therapy, improper use such as excessive treatment duration or incorrect distance from the skin can potentially lead to hyperpigmentation or even burns,\" Dr. Malik says. \"I've seen patients' melasma or hyperpigmentation worsen from overusing red light therapy.\" At-home microneedling is another example of a treatment that requires some caution. Because the needles create micro-tears in the skin, it's imperative to ensure your tool is properly sterilized and that you don't puncture the skin too deep. \"At-home microneedling has the potential for complications including infections, scarring, and hyperpigmentation,\" Dr. Malik says. This doesn't make any of these treatments any less great or mean that you should forgo them all together - you just need to ensure you're following the instructions provided with the tool. How to Safely Use Beauty Tools at Home In addition to familiarizing yourself with a tool before you start using it, the experts have some additional tips to share. Make sure you follow the instructions included with your device, and consult with your physician or dermatologist if you plan on using more than one at the same time. \"Additionally, I recommend my patients start with the lowest setting or shortest treatment time recommended, then gradually increase based on their skin's response,\" Dr. Malik says. \"Consistency with proper use will always give better results than aggressive overuse.\" One other thing to note? Make sure you're cleaning any devices that touch your skin regularly. \"I feel that maintenance and proper cleaning of devices is often overlooked,\" Dr. Malik says. \"Even the safest device can become harmful if not properly sanitized between uses.\" The bottom line? Do your research. At-home beauty tools can be a convenient and safe way to amp up your skin-care routine, but as Dr. Reed puts it, \"It is essential to always read the instructions and use the devices properly to minimize potential side effects, unwanted results, or damage to the skin.\" Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
