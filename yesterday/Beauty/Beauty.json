    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/night-time-beauty-skincare-routine-products?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "I’m a naturally nosy person. I enjoy eavesdropping on conversations in restaurants, stealing glances at WhatsApp messages on the Tube and eyeing up other people’s lunches in the office. But as R29’s deputy beauty director, I’m most intrigued by everyone’s beauty routines, specifically those that take place in the private moments before bed.  Lately, I’ve been drawn to “get unready with me” videos over GRWM. Dermatologists have recently extolled the virtues of evening showers over morning ones, while beauty enthusiasts have popularized the concept of the “morning shed”: removing the skin, hair and other beauty products that they slept in the night before. (Heatless curls need to be unravelled, lip tints peeled off and fake tan rinsed away.) Whether you consider yourself a minimalist or a maximalist, the self-care advantages of a bedtime beauty routine aren’t to be sniffed at. With that in mind, I asked R29 staffers to share theirs with me. From the benefits of an unctuous lip mask to the underrated appeal of a water flosser, here’s everything the team uses before bed.  DashDividers_1_500x100 Karina Hoshikawa, senior writer My nighttime beauty routine starts in the shower. After washing my hair and body, I like to anoint myself with a few drops of Aromatherapy Associates’ De-Stress Muscle Bath \u0026 Shower Oil and breathe in the relaxing notes of lavender, rosemary, and ginger. My skincare routine comes afterwards: I remove my makeup with a cleansing oil — right now I’m using SON\u0026PARK’s Beauty Water Cleansing Oil — then use the Dr. Barbara Sturm Enzyme Cleanser to gently exfoliate. Then, I use Tatcha’s Texture Tonic and Lenox \u0026 Sixteenth’s Laser Serum, which has been my hero serum ever since I interviewed the founder, Amy Peterson. I moisturize with Sofie Pavitt Face’s Omega Rich Moisturizer — another incredible launch from earlier this year that I’m utterly obsessed with. Depending on the time of the year, my skin will get a bit dry even after applying skincare, so I keep a bottle of Nocturnal’s Polar Night Renewal Serum, which helps my skin rejuvenate while I catch some beauty sleep. This is also when I apply lip balm to help hydrate my lips overnight — my favorite is Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm in Sweet Mint. I absolutely swear by silk pillowcases, which make my bed feel like a sanctuary. I recently got married, so right now my husband and I are snoozing on monogrammed ones by Slip. I also got a sleep mask from Drowsy, a British brand, and it’s like a little pillow for your eyes. Bliss. My last sleep essential is my Oura ring, which has really helped me home in on my biometric stressors and encourage better sleep hygiene. The first thing I do every morning is check my Sleep Score, and nothing starts my day better than getting a crown (Oura-speak for above-average performance). What can I say? I’m just a Virgo who loves the satisfaction of a job well done! DashDividers_1_500x100 Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty director I can’t get into bed without washing the day off. In a bid to be more eco-friendly, I shelved my plastic body puff (which should be changed frequently and only ends up in landfill) for a silicone loofah, which can be cleaned and reused time and time again. It’s also replaced my physical exfoliating scrub. When it comes to shower gel, nothing beats Dove Pamper Body Wash With Shea Butter \u0026 Vanilla. The lather is rich and creamy and the smell is so comforting, I’m convinced it helps me fall asleep. When I’m dry, I slather my legs in Vaseline’s Gluta-Hya Flawless Glow Serum In Lotion, which absorbs in seconds, and apply foot cream. If I’m washing my hair, I reach for Typebea’s Strength \u0026 Length Shampoo and Strength \u0026 Length Conditioner, which I’m convinced have significantly boosted my slow hair growth, followed by what is the best hair oil of all time: Kérastase Elixir Ultime. Nothing makes my hair as soft and shiny. For my hair, all I need to do is rough-dry it for a few minutes with the Shark FlexStyle, and it’s smooth and frizz-free. I’m not exaggerating when I say it’s changed both my hair and my life. Gone are the days of painstakingly blow-drying or straightening it before bed. I always double cleanse to remove every single scrap of makeup and sunscreen; I love Dr. Idriss’ Soft Wash Complete Daily Cleanser, which is gentle on my reactive skin but cuts through even waterproof foundation and mascara. The evening is when I ramp up my skincare with retinoids to keep my hormonal skin in check. (I always floss and brush before applying my skincare so as not to rinse it away accidentally.) I’ve been using The Ordinary Retinal 0.2% Emulsion but recently I’ve graduated to tretinoin (a stronger prescription retinoid), recommended by consultant dermatologist Dr Alia Ahmed through Get Harley, an online dermatology service. I practice the sandwich method using a substantial moisturizer (currently Aestura Atobarrier365 Cream), putting one layer of face cream, followed by the retinoid and then another layer of face cream. Lastly, I apply a little cuticle oil to encourage stronger nails (L’Occitane Shea Nail and Cuticle Nourishing Oil) and turn out the light! DashDividers_1_500x100 Venus Wong, senior writer I can only fall asleep knowing that my skin and hair are sparkling clean, pillowy soft, and smell amazing — and I entrust a suite of products, primarily from Japanese and Korean brands, to help me achieve this goal. First, I double cleanse, starting with the Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Moisture Cleansing Oil, which is great at melting off my SPF and makeup without stripping my skin barrier, followed by Innisfree Cherry Blossom Glow Jam Cleanser. The latter leaves my face fresh but not too dry and I love the fruity-floral scent and rich lather. I’m all about heavily perfumed body washes and LUSH’s Sleepy Shower Gel never fails to help me unwind; the rich tonka and lavender scent is so soothing. My hair routine is pretty basic: I gravitate towards products that maintain hydration without weighing my hair down, and Living Proof’s Perfect hair Day (PhD) Hydrating Shampoo and Conditioner is my favorite combo lately. The proprietary ingredient mimics the benefits of silicone (without the buildup on the scalp), leaving my hair bouncy and squeaky clean without weighing it down. The rest of my routine has been drastically pared down lately, as it’s been so hot, and I really can’t be bothered. When I get out of the shower, I spray Curél’s Deep Moisture Spray all over my body. Curél is a Japanese drugstore brand I’ve relied on since my teens and I’m really happy to see it become available everywhere now. Its products are rich in ceramides, which help repair the skin barrier and keep it supple and hydrated. I also like that this product can be sprayed upside down, which helps me reach the dry patches on my back. For the face, I do a “mini mask” by placing Mediheal’s Teatree Facial Toner Pads on my cheeks for several minutes. This was a skincare discovery I wrote about after a trip to Seoul last year; it’s a popular K-beauty hack for calming redness and acne, thanks to the tea tree essence. I follow with a sleeping mask so I can wake up with supple skin without doing tons of work. My nightly staple is Erno Lazlo’s Hydra-Therapy Memory Gel Sleep Mask, which has a fun, jello-like texture and plumps the skin with moisturizing vitamin E and prickly pear extract. On the weekends, I pamper myself with Dr. Barbara Sturm’s Everything Eye Patches as a treat for my under eyes, or use Dr.Jart+ Ceramidin Skin Barrier Moisturizing Mask if my skin has been particularly dry. For fragrance, I love the clean and feminine scent of Elizabeth Arden’s White Tea Eau Florale Eau de Toilette and douse myself in it before climbing into bed. I also spray Gisou’s Honey Infused Hair Perfume onto my ends, which provides me with sweet, comforting whiffs of honey when I toss and turn at night. DashDividers_1_500x100 L’Oréal Blackett, Unbothered editor My evening routine is all about relaxing before bed, scrubbing away the grime of the world, and plucking rogue hairs out of my chin. It’s not pretty, but a very functional routine to help me maintain my zen. I always start by getting my hair out of my face; the method varies depending on whether I have a sew-in or I’m wearing a half-wig or clip-ins. I usually take out my clips and hairpins, then put my hair into messy chunky twists to help prevent tangling, tie them back in a bobble, wrap with a silk scarf and cover with an extra-large bonnet I got at my local Afro beauty store. If my scalp needs it, I will add a hair serum (currently Cécred’s Nourishing Hair Oil) to tide me over until my next wash day or weave takedown. Next up, I double cleanse to remove my makeup. I prefer a balm cleanser, such as Elemis’ Pro Collagen Cleansing Balm, then I go in with my trusty Simple Moisturizing Facial Wash. It’s non-drying, helps remove any lingering makeup and is affordable. I’ve used it since I was 12 — that’s my definition of a holy-grail product! I floss with dental picks, scrub my teeth with an electric brush and gargle with mouthwash — you know the drill. In the shower, I also double cleanse my body; I just don’t feel right without a good, long soak. First, I use a bar of antibacterial soap by Dettol. My grandma introduced me to Dettol baths as a kid, helping to keep acne on my chest and back clean, and it’s still a step I refuse to skip. For a good lather, I go in with Dove’s Deeply Nourishing Body Wash with an African net sponge made from nylon — they are really easy to keep clean and sanitary in your shower. If I’m in the mood, I shave my legs, pits and bits to save me from doing it in the morning. A shower oil comes next. I’ve recently run out of the popular almond shower oil by L’Occitane, so I switched to ESPA’s Restorative Bath and Body Oil and it is perfect for before bed. You either add it directly to your bath or directly to your skin while wet, and the scent mix of essential oils makes me so sleepy. After hopping out of the shower, I speed through my skincare routine. Depending on the last time I dermaplaned, I will go in with my Venus dermaplaner to get rid of some of my peach fuzz (be careful, I’ve sliced my finger open with this thing multiple times). DashDividers_1_500x100 Irina Grechko, senior content director, fashion I often work out at night, so the first step in my nighttime routine is to shower. If I am washing my hair, I use the L’Oréal Paris Elvive Dream Lengths Shampoo and Conditioner, made for those with long, fine hair. I follow it with a nourishing amika Soulfood Nourishing Mask, applied with a detangling wet brush. I leave the mask on as I wash my body with Nivea’s Basil \u0026 White Tea Shower Gel and “floss” my teeth with a waterproof Waterpik because I still haven’t figured out how to use it without getting water all over the floor. After a shower, I use a microfiber-towel turban to let my hair slightly dry, before using a Yves Durif Vented Brush (my hairstylist Olya Iudina got me hooked on it; you can use it on both wet and dry hair). I will then moisturize my body while it’s still damp. I’m in love with the body oil from Officine Universelle Buly, the French brand that has gone viral for its personalized lip balm. It smells divine and is the best body oil I have ever used. It nourishes the skin without leaving it oily. I alternate my skincare routine. Every other day, I start my nighttime prep by washing my face with a Dieux Baptism Gel Cleanser. It foams beautifully, leaves my skin feeling clean, and smells so good. I use the Glossier Milky Oil Makeup Remover to get rid of any eye makeup that may have lingered. The biggest issue that my skin faces is dehydration, so I don’t apply any serums or creams without spraying my face with Mario Badescu’s Facial Spray first to create a base layer of moisture. I will then follow it with Sunday Riley’s A+ High-Dose Retinoid Serum. Because my skin is on the drier side, face oils work best for me at night. Since it’s summer, though, I currently use a lighter Révive Moisturizing Renewal Oil, which leaves my skin plump without feeling too heavy or greasy in the heat. Once a week, I will switch the face oil for the Summer Fridays Jet Lag Mask and leave it on overnight. Less is more when it comes to keeping my skin looking clear, so on alternate days I will strip my skincare routine down to three steps with Vintner’s Daughter’s The Ultimate Set: a gentle cleanser, an essence (which replaces my face spray) and a botanical serum (which I use as a face oil). While not cheap, Vintner’s Daughter is the GOAT; over the years, I’ve come back to its cult serum again and again for the way it makes my skin glow unlike anything else on the market. I also use a red light therapy mask from Solawave three times a week to even out my skin texture and calm any hormonal breakouts or irritation. DashDividers_1_500x100 Esther Newman, affiliate writer I love a good routine, especially when I’m preparing for bed. I like to shower at night so I can wash away the day and flush any unwanted energy down the drain. I like to make this a self-care ritual, so I’ll light a candle and add some soothing essential oils to the bottom of the shower. You can’t beat Neal’s Yard Remedies’ Women’s Balance, which is an intoxicating blend of patchouli, geranium, rose, and frankincense. It instantly soothes my mind and grounds me. I’m typically pretty low-key when it comes to beauty and body care. If I’m wearing makeup, I’ll first cleanse with Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water on a reusable cotton pad. Once in the shower, I’ll double up with La Roche-Posay Toleriane Dermo Cleanser, which is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. For my body, I also like a gentle and moisturizing body wash, and my latest favorite is the Naturium The Booster Hyaluronic Acid Body Wash. My skin doesn’t feel tight or itchy afterwards, and the hydration really lasts. I don’t even feel like I need to double up with a body cream, so that cuts out an extra step. If I’m washing my hair, I like the MONDAY Haircare Moisture Shampoo and Conditioner; my go-to since reviewing them back in 2021. I love the easy-to-use packaging (a must as a glasses wearer who struggles to see in the shower) and the hydrating, lightweight formula that doesn’t weigh my fine hair down. It leaves it bouncy and glossy. Once out of the shower, I’ll throw my hair up in a microfiber towel to minimize frizz. In terms of skincare, I try to keep it simple, too. My hero product is the Tower 28 SOS Daily Rescue Facial Spray, which has transformed my skin, reducing bacteria and eradicating the stubborn texture along my chin and white spots around my nose. Once this dries down, I’ll follow with a hydrating serum (the Medik8 Liquid Peptides), and then slather on my favorite moisturizer, Charlotte Tilbury’s Magic Cream, and a LANEIGE lip mask. Finally, it’s time to brush my teeth. After being told by my dentist that my usual electric toothbrush is adding too much pressure to my teeth, I’ve switched to a SURI Toothbrush, which is powerful but a lot more gentle — and quieter than other models. DashDividers_1_500x100 Tanyel Mustafa, senior writer No matter what time I go to bed — whether it’s 10 p.m. after an evening at home or 4 a.m. after going to a club — I will always wash my face and body. There’s nothing better than climbing into a clean bed, also feeling clean. I go to the bathroom and brush my teeth, cleanse my face, then shower. I use Emma Hardie Moringa Cleansing Balm or Naturium Purple Ginseng Cleansing Balm to remove my makeup. The Emma Hardie one is perfect for my dry skin as it cleanses without stripping moisture or irritating my eyes, but it is definitely a treat due to the price point. The Naturium one is a cheaper option that also works well with my skin. I’m not a double cleanser; I feel if a product can’t do it in one, it’s not a very good cleanser (controversial, I know).  If it’s a Sunday, I’ll apply a mask while in the shower. The two I currently have in rotation are The Outset Purifying Blue Clay Mask if my skin needs a deep cleanse and Tatcha Violet-C Radiance Mask for something a bit more gentle. Weekdays I skip the mask and go straight in with Nécessaire Eucalyptus The Body Wash, which has a relaxing scent and is gentle on skin. I go in with facial skincare immediately after drying off. First, it’ll be a serum of some kind, like The Ordinary Lactic Acid 10% if I want gentle exfoliation, or a high-strength vitamin C. Sometimes I skip this step and go straight to moisturizer. My favorite nourishing one is Charlotte Tilbury Magic Cream in the winter, and The Ordinary Natural Moisturizing Factors + HA for warmer weather. Both give my skin what it needs without feeling heavy, oily or clogging. I’m not an oil fan. Post-shower, I need to moisturize my body, which I thoroughly hate doing as it’s so boring but it’s good for reducing my seasonal eczema flare-ups. Aveeno Daily Moisturising Lotion does the job. Then I slather my lips in Glow Recipe Plum Plump Hyaluronic Gloss Balm. Finally, it’s time for bed with a silk pillowcase, which is a recent investment I’ve made as it’s better for skin and hair! DashDividers_1_500x100 Victoria Montalti, associate fashion writer My nighttime routine always starts with a shower and while none of the steps is particularly out of the norm, I do like to occasionally throw in a lavender shower steamer tablet to help unwind from stressful days. Afterwards, I spray It’s A 10 Miracle Leave-In Lite onto my hair and comb it through with my fingers to serve as a heat protectant before I dry it. But first, while my skin is still moist, I spray Sally Hansen Airbrush Legs Tanning Water all over my body! I’ve just started using Jergen’s Natural Glow Face Moisturizer on my face at night and in the morning, too, so I’m not two completely different shades. Next, I move on to drying my bob-length hair, which actually takes longer than you may think since I section it off for a nice blowdry (or else my hair will be super flat and get oilier quicker).  For my skincare routine, I typically keep it very minimal (a face mist and lip mask), but when I’m going all out, I’ll use Futurewise’s Slugging System (a three-step routine consisting of a hydrating face mist, barrier repair moisturizer, and moisture-locking slug balm). I just keep the slugging balm below my bangs so I don’t make them greasy. I finish off my routine with Laneige’s original Lip Sleeping Mask and Bouncy \u0026 Firm Sleeping Mask, which I use on my neck for some extra hydration. (And on the occasion that I have a stubborn breakout, I like using e.l.f’s Blemish Breakthrough Stick It to Zits Pimple Patches overnight, which is always super pleasing to remove the next morning.) All that’s left to do is turn down for bed. I’ve been sleeping on satin pillowcases for years and I simply can’t turn back. They’re so silky smooth and cooling, and I find that I don’t wake up with crazy creases on my face, like you sometimes do with standard cotton pillowcases. To sweeten the deal, I spray ThisWorks Sleep Plus Pillow Spray onto my pillows, which makes them smell like lavender and chamomile and helps relax me even more for a good night’s rest.

    "description": "Breakups are hard, but what comes after is harder. The heart-in-your-throat sadness, denial in the form of scrolling past their story like you didn’t already watch it three times (six if you count the times you told your friends to stalk their page), and the sporadic bursts of anger looking back at past conversations. Finally, there’s acceptance. And for a lot of Black women, healing often means change, and that usually starts at our roots with a hair transformation.  The breakup hair change is more than a cliché. For Black women, it’s a ritual. A reset. A quiet rebellion. Whether it’s a buzz cut, blonde box braids, a fresh silk press, or a full return to natural kinks and coils, the post-breakup hair transformation says more than any goodbye text ever could. Hair has always been loaded for Black women; it’s political, personal, and oftentimes policed. So it makes sense that in moments of emotional chaos, we turn to it for clarity. Changing our hair isn’t just about aesthetics, it’s about healing.  Unbothered has explored the intimate connections between breakups and hair transformations through the lens of Black womanhood. We hear from Black women about the choices they made after breakups — the drastic cuts, the color changes, the protective styles — and what those choices meant. Some wanted to shed the version of themselves that was in the relationship. Others wanted to feel seen again. For many, it was simply about starting fresh, and there’s something undeniably Black about turning heartache into a beauty statement you have complete ownership of. Because sometimes, the most revolutionary thing a Black woman can do after heartbreak is decide who she wants to be next. DashDividers_1_500x100 Lydia, 27, London: “Dyeing my hair made me feel daring.” Lydia’s breakup had forced her to confront something bigger: how little she had been willing to settle for. “I realized I was waiting to be chosen instead of choosing myself,” she says. That clarity sparked a chain of events. She quit her job, applied for a teaching role abroad, and moved to Thailand—all within weeks. “That hairstyle became symbolic of a whole new chapter.” “I just didn’t want to look at how I was feeling,” says Lydia, reflecting on the moment she walked out of the short but emotionally significant relationship. Instead of spiraling, she booked an appointment and chose something she’d never done before, long, burgundy soft locs. “It was my first time getting that style and going that color,” she says. “It made me feel cute. It made me feel good, like new hair, who this?”. Lydia wanted to feel like herself again because she says she was beginning to look unfamiliar. “I’d been living safely, comfortably. But dyeing my hair that color made me feel daring. I was finally doing something I’d only talked about.” For Lydia, the hair came first, but the woman who emerged after was completely transformed. Tahirah, 34, Brooklyn, New York: “Cutting my hair was the most empowering thing to do.” “I just went balls to the walls, full Britney Spears buzz cut because it was the easiest thing for me to do at the moment,” says Tahirah.  After a painful six-year relationship that was a huge part of her youth, Tahirah found peace in the impulsive decision to cut her hair late at night with a pair of red scissors. “I was feeling really insecure and neglected… cutting my hair was the most empowering thing to do.” For her, the buzz cut was about regaining control over her life. “Cutting my hair and going into that buzz cut moment was allowing me to have visibility,” she explains, highlighting how her identity as a Black woman shaped her relationship with her hair. “My beauty is not defined just by my hair; it’s about my aura, how I choose to show up.” Through her cut, she gained renewed confidence, attracting both new opportunities and compliments. “I felt power. It was a moment of release, but also a power move for me. I didn’t care about the hair because it always grows back,” says Tahirah. This candid reflection highlights how, for most Black women, hair is deeply intertwined with their identity and, in some cases, defines who they are, shaping how they are seen, understood, and received by the world. Remi, 31, Milton Keynes: “Red is loud and signifies a new chapter.” “Red is loud,” says Remi, staring into the camera during our video chat, “but it was also me playing it safe because red was the only color that my hair had ever been when I was younger, other than my natural hair color.” She hadn’t worn the color since her early twenties, a time when she was a freer and more joyful version of herself. After a major breakup in her late twenties, she returned to the familiar deep red to signal a new chapter.  It was more than just color; she opted for a leave-out weave, a drastic shift after years of wearing braids. The color “reminded me of a time in my life where I just enjoyed my experience and the things that I was doing and the way that I was living,” says Remi.  Everyone processes a breakup differently; some burrow into deep, dark depression, and some snap out of it in the blink of an eye, like the relationship never happened. For Remi, it wasn’t only the hair change that helped her move through her emotions, but writing about it was also an unexpected emotional release. She surprised herself by writing and sharing a deeply personal project called Crying Over Breakfast on her Instagram.  Split into three parts —heartbreak, hurting, healing— the series gave her space to reflect on the relationship, her emotions, and her growth. “The heartbreak was very raw and very honest and very unfiltered. And then the hurting was more me settling into where I was at, based on what had happened. Not so much the impulsive like being upset, but  just sorting through the whole relationship and everything that happened, and then the healing part was just focused on, okay, what was I doing to heal myself?” Her hair change was just one piece of healing. She also focused on trying new foods, going out with her friends, and going to art galleries. The weave and red color marked a change, not because they were new, but because she chose them for herself. Ray, 32, London: “My blonde bob has brought a different energy.” Ray had locs for five or six years; they were a part of her identity, but they carried the energy of two major relationships. Following the end of her most recent one, she felt the weight of what hadn’t been processed. “Your hair carries energy,” she explained, “and I knew I needed to do something.” With the help of her mother, Ray spent three daunting days carefully unraveling over a hundred locs. Each strand unwound like a thread from the past, the process becoming both ritual and release. “It was a labour of love,” she said, thinking back on the memory. Funnily enough, this exact process was spoken into existence by her ex-boyfriend’s mother. “She’s been trying to get me to brush out my hair because we broke up,” says Ray. “She’s very spiritual and she’s always like, you need to go into your next stage of life, and this will be great for your mental health.” Locs are a serious commitment; they take time and care, they’re not something you choose to start lightly. So, what does a woman who had them for over five years choose as her next hairstyle post-breakup? A custom blonde bob wig, that’s what. “I’m a Bob girl,” Ray says with a smile. “It commands respect. And I needed to remember I was the planet, not the moon.” This was significant because she had shared that she had made her ex-boyfriend her entire planet, forgetting she could be one herself.  The blonde wig was Monroe-esque and glamorous. “I felt fully in alignment. That blonde bob brought a different type of energy, attention, and confidence.” Ray’s hair transformation mirrored her emotional one. Post-breakup, it wasn’t just about changing her look — it was about a complete return to form. Nuna, 32, London: “Shaving my hair off was like, you can’t tell me anything anymore.” Fresh off a year abroad in Toronto, 22-year-old Nuna returns home to London reeling from her first serious relationship. A toxic on-and-off two-year experience that left her feeling lost. The breakup prompted a dramatic change where she shaved her head completely. “I went down to the skin, it wasn’t even a pixie,” says Nuna. This act wasn’t just about aesthetics; it marked a turning point in how she saw herself. “I grew up in Peterborough, which is predominantly white. I remember going to my friend’s houses after school, and they’d do my hair, and it never looked right.” Nuna often mimicked European beauty standards, straightening her hair excessively and relying on damaging slick-backs. In her relationship, this cycle of trying to fit a specific look persisted due to her partner’s critical comments. “I was constantly trying to look how he wanted me to,” she says. “Shaving it off was like — you can’t tell me anything anymore.” The haircut was a gateway to self-discovery. She began experimenting with wigs and even learned to make her own after a disappointing salon experience. “I was spending £400 on bad wigs. I had to learn to do it myself,” she explains. Over time, this led her back to protective styles like braids and a deeper understanding of her hair. Now in her early 30s, she reflects on the haircut as a pivotal step. “It didn’t solve everything, but it started something,” she says. For her, the big chop was both an act of release and reclamation — a way to cut ties with damaging ideals and step into a more authentic version of herself. Tolu, 32, Walthamstow, UK: “The mullet is a symbol of my freedom.” “I just felt relieved,” says Tolu, remembering how a blonde mullet wig unexpectedly became her post-breakup armour. The relationship had run its course, and while the end wasn’t devastating, the transition still called for change. While many would expect heartbreak to bring on tears, Tolu’s reaction was the opposite. “I really didn’t give a fuck. I was so happy it was over.” The mullet was a symbol of freedom. “It felt like coming back to myself,” says Tolu.  Having always used hair as a form of expression, she wasn’t new to switching up her style, but this was different. The wig was unlike anything she’d worn before. It was short, in your face, blonde, and defied the age-old myth that dark-skinned women “can’t pull off blonde.” She could, and she did. “It just marked the end of something and the beginning of something else,” says Tolu reflectively.  Though she rarely wears the wig now, what it represents still holds weight. “I don’t hate it, but it sits in a weird space of time. It reminds me of the past,” says Tolu. The wig wasn’t about reinvention; it was about alignment. She didn’t need to reclaim agency; she already had it. The mullet simply echoed what she already knew, she was ready to move on — and she did. Liz, 26, Manchester, UK: “I needed to let go.” After ending a toxic relationship, Liz bravely chose to cut off her hair completely. “Hair holds a lot of energy,” she says. “I needed to get rid of it.” The breakup coincided with a move back to Manchester, and the timing felt right to start over. “I’d been neglecting my hair for so long. Letting go of the hair was like letting go of something that no longer felt like me,” says Liz.  She was 22 when she met her ex and 25 when the relationship ended.  Sitting in the barber’s chair, she felt lighter spiritually and emotionally. “It was one less thing to think about while moving on.” We met in the middle of lockdown, and over those two and a half years, I grew up fast. Mentally, I changed so much. Leaving felt like a Phoenix-rising moment,  like I was finally coming back to myself,” says Liz.  As a Black woman, the decision to cut her hair came with extra scrutiny. “People asked what my boyfriend would think. I didn’t have one anymore—wasn’t that the point?” she says. Her hair had always felt like a performance. She relaxed it to fit in, braided it during the natural hair wave, and even wore wigs, though she hated wearing them. Now, for the first time since childhood, she’s growing her hair naturally and learning how to care for it without trends dictating her choices. Her relationship with her hair mirrored her relationship with herself; both had suffered. “I wasn’t eating or sleeping well. My hair was fucked. I wasn’t happy.” Shaving off her hair put the power back into her hands. “Everything felt out of control, but this one thing was mine.” Romana, 30, Birmingham, UK: “Cutting my hair was like a spiritual purge.”  Two weeks after her breakup, Ramona walked into her hairdresser’s salon and asked for the chop. Not a trim, not a bob. A full reset. “I wanted to shave it all off and do a proper Britney Spears,” she says, half-joking, “but I thought that might be a bit too radical.” Instead, she opted for a shaved-back bowl cut. The decision wasn’t spontaneous – she’d been thinking about cutting her hair for over a year. But it took the unraveling of her relationship to make the move. “I didn’t lose myself,” she says. “I betrayed myself.” Cutting her hair felt like “a spiritual purge”, says Ramona. “There was so much trapped in it that I needed to let go of it”.  Watching her hair fall was scary and safe all at once. The terror that settled in while she was in the hairdresser’s chair shifted and made space for newness.   Post-breakup, she looked in the mirror and saw a version of herself that felt powerful. The haircut didn’t give her confidence; it revealed it. “Hair grows back,” she says. “You can start over as many times as you need to. There are no rules.” This article was originally published on Unbothered UK Like what you see?

    "title": "It’s About Time Beauty Brands Recognize the Influence of OnlyFans Stars",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/urban-decay-ari-kytsya-partnership-opinion-49452773",
    "description": "The viral yet polarizing \"clean girl\" era is over - it's time for beauty to get a little dirty again, and Urban Decay tapped OnlyFans star and content creator Ari Kytsya to make it happen. On Thursday, July 17, the makeup brand launched \"Battle the Bland,\" a campaign fronted by the 24-year-old model. Known on social media for her comedic GRWMs, candid takes on plastic surgery, and overt sexuality, Kytsya's casting disrupts traditional ideas of who gets to be a beauty ambassador in 2025 - and it's about time. While often reduced to its adult content, OnlyFans has become a major force in creator culture, giving women, in particular, a direct line to visibility, income, and independence. Kytsya is one of the platform's biggest stars, but her influence extends far beyond it. On TikTok, she's racked up 4.6 million followers, many of them women drawn to her blunt transparency. In GRWMs, she talks openly about the cosmetic procedures she's undergone. \"That's why I try to be real open about the surgeries and everything that I've had done,\" she says in one video. \"Because I don't want anyone to look at me and be like, 'Oh, I wish I looked like that,' because I don't even look like that.\" She's equally honest about the realities of sex work - calling herself a \"bop\" or \"mattress actress\" - and explains how the industry affects her self-image. She doesn't glamorize it, but she doesn't hide it either. That kind of candid energy resonates deeply with her audience, and it's exactly what Urban Decay is tapping into. The brand's rollout began with a series of faux-censored Instagram teasers stamped with mock warnings like \"may contain boring or bland content.\" The following day came the reveal: a series of social videos where Kytsya, clad in a leather bustier, declares, \"Breaking news: we are in a blandemic,\" before asking, \"Wasn't makeup meant to perform on stage, on camera, and yes, on mattresses?\" The message was loud and clear - and so was the reception. Comments poured in: \"First brand to work with a SW model, such a disruptive move,\" one wrote. \"This is honestly groundbreaking.\" It's a return to form for Urban Decay, a brand that built its identity on provocation, with product names like \"Naked,\" \"Get Baked,\" \"Druggie,\" and \"Vice.\" With \"Battle the Bland,\" the brand reclaims its spot as beauty's rebellious older sister, this time choosing a lead not in spite of her sex work, but because of how unapologetically she owns it. \"In a space that often plays it safe - especially when it comes to who gets a seat at the table - this moment feels not only bold, but historic,\" the brand said in a press release. \"While most beauty brands shy away from creators who are 'too much' for mainstream standards, Urban Decay is leaning all the way in - embracing Ari's uncensored main character energy.\" That embrace marks a turning point. Until recently, being a sex worker came with a huge stigma. But the cultural tides are shifting. Platforms like OnlyFans have given sex workers visibility and reach society can no longer ignore. What was once deemed \"too explicit\" is now seen as culturally fluent and commercially valuable. And in many ways, Kytsya's role brings beauty full circle. For centuries, makeup wasn't considered glamorous, but rather taboo. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it was associated with sex work and deception, only later becoming mainstream through actresses and celebrities. Kytsya represents a lineage of women who've always shaped how we see beauty, even when they weren't invited into the room. Now, she's not just in the room, she's the face of the entire campaign. It's not Urban Decay's first time partnering with someone whose background subverts the industry's expectations. In 2022, the brand tapped \"Euphoria\" breakout Chloe Cherry - a former porn actress turned mainstream star - to lead its Vice Lip Bond campaigns. Like Kytsya, Cherry's casting marked another example of Urban Decay recognizing the power of provocative creators who defy traditional industry standards. With Battle the Bland, Urban Decay sets the tone for a new era of beauty marketing; one where creators like Kytsya aren't sidelined but centered. It's a bold campaign, yes, but it's also a long-overdue acknowledgment of sex work's impact on mainstream culture, and of the women who've been shaping beauty all along. And that's something we feel really good about. Olivia Tauber is a freelance writer based in New York, passionate about crafting authentic stories through personal essays and profiles.

    "title": "After Swimming in Chilean Salt Baths, This Product Saved My Dry Skin",
    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/salt-baths-chile-editor-experiment-49452776",
    "description": "Visiting Chile was never on my bucket list - let alone taking a dip in a nature-made salt bath in Chile in the middle of the Atacama Desert. When I got the invite from Dove to travel to the second driest climate on the planet - Antarctica is first - I jumped at the opportunity. As someone who's never been to South America, I couldn't wait to experience all that Chile has to offer, but what awaited me on the other side of the 13-hour journey was beyond my wildest dreams. The itinerary for this special trip had everything: scenic hikes (we even took a trip to a place called the Rainbow Valley, named for its multicolored rocky mountains), local cuisine, stargazing (due to the altitude, the night sky was the clearest I'd ever seen), shopping in the city center, and, of course, a visit to the salt baths. The purpose of this trip? To put Dove's Deep Moisture Body Wash ($9) to the test, seeing how its hydrating claims would stack up against one of the driest climates in the world. And boy, did I need all the hydration I could get after taking a dip in the salt baths. Keep reading to learn more about my full experience. What Are Salt Baths and Why Are We Bathing In Them? Salt baths occur naturally in a handful of places around the world - the Atacama Desert being one of them. Despite thinking I knew what I was getting myself into, nothing could have prepared me for seeing the natural phenomenon in real life. It was about an hour's drive from our hotel, the Our Habitas Atacama, in San Pedro, down winding, bumpy dirt roads and nestled between some mountains. The baths came out of nowhere, placed in the middle of a large, flat stretch of land. The surrounding area was all white (because of the salt), and the bright turquoise pools popped against the beige and brown of the mountains and sand. Salt baths have a myriad of benefits, from relaxing your muscles and soothing aches to potentially minimizing inflammation. They also gently exfoliate the skin, leaving you feeling soft and smooth - after you rinse off all the salty residue and moisturize, but more on that later. My Experience at the Salt Baths Before jumping into the salt baths, some preparation was needed. First and foremost (and most importantly to me as a beauty editor), your hair has to be up. If hair gets in the salty water, it can become tangled and incredibly dry (not to mention, the salt can mess up your dye job). We were also instructed to remove all jewelry, as the salt could potentially damage it as well. Then we were ready to jump in. I'm not going to lie: walking across the salt wasn't very pleasant. Picture huge salt crystals with all of their rough, jagged edges - now picture walking on them with bare feet. After tiptoeing my way to the edge of the pool, I slowly waded into the water. The bottom of the pool wasn't much better in terms of comfort - this is not your fancy bath house in SoHo - but at least the water wasn't cold. The coolest thing about the pools - aside from the fact that nature just made them - is how easy you can just float, thanks to the high sodium content. If you've ever swum in a saltwater pool and noticed how easy it was to swim, picture that with 100 times the salt. I was able to sit in the water practically upright without needing to tread water or make any effort to swim. The experience didn't end when I climbed out of the water and toweled off. Standing under the hot Chilean sun, my skin began to dry and I was left with a white, chalky residue on my skin. It felt prickly and rough under my touch, as if I were buffing a salt scrub into dry skin (not exactly the most pleasant sensation). A shower was in order. There were stalls to rinse off the salt residue, but the trickle of some water wouldn't do. It helped some - I was no longer covered in as much white, salty residue - but I needed soap and a washcloth. When I got back to my hotel, I sprinted for the shower, where I went to town with the Dove Deep Moisture Body Wash. The foamy, rich lather coated my skin, even locking in hydration thanks to the ingredients in the formula. The real test of this body wash's moisture content, however, came after I rinsed off and ventured back out into the high Chilean temperatures again - sans any body lotion. If you had told me before embarking on this trip that I would not apply body lotion for five days, I probably would have shuddered in horror, because my dry skin needs constant hydration. But the body wash kept me feeling good long after I rinsed.
