    "link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/sunscreen-spf-brands-no-white-cast-claims?utm_source=feed\u0026utm_medium=rss",
    "description": "Welcome to Sun Blocked, Refinery29’s global call to action to wake up to the serious dangers of tanning. No lectures or shaming, we promise. Instead, our goal is to arm you with the facts you need to protect your skin to the best of your ability, because there’s no such thing as safe sun.  When cosmetic scientist Dr. Julian Sass first tested Tower 28’s new SOS FaceGuard SPF 30 Sunscreen on camera, his disappointment was obvious. Despite the “no white cast” claim prominently displayed on the PR packaging, the sunscreen left a visible gray tinge on his skin. “Marketing this as a no white cast sunscreen in 2025? It just makes me feel so undervalued as a consumer,” Dr. Sass said in the clip. “What frustrates me is that some Black girl is gonna see the advertising about this product and think, Oh my god, they said it had no white cast. And then they’re going to end up looking like this.” Dr. Sass’s video, now at 54.3K views and climbing, sparked further debate after he highlighted that the marketing materials showed people applying too little sunscreen — a misleading move that compromises both transparency and safety. Tower 28 founder Amy Liu responded on Instagram, acknowledging they “missed the mark” despite extensive testing. As a result, Liu promised to remove the “no white cast” and “universal tint” claims, standardize their testing process, and develop a new version of the sunscreen for deeper skin tones. This was welcome news to Tower 28 fans, but the brand isn’t alone in making contested “no white cast” statements. In addition to Dr. Sass, other skincare experts and beauty content creators have increasingly called out claims of invisibility that don’t match reality.  Entire groups of people are excluded from sun protection options because brands don’t think it’s profitable to include us.Cosmetic chemist Milan Scott Dija Ayodele, an esthetician and founder of the Black Skin Directory, recently tried Merit’s The Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen, which left her looking “dull and gray” despite the brand’s “zero white cast” promise. “When I first received the press release, I asked to see evidence of the product on Black skin,” Ayodele tells Refinery29. She says the PR company sent her a video of a Black employee using the product, along with information about the brand’s formulation process and challenges. Ayodele accepted the PR package based on this response. “But if I’d bought that sunscreen, I would be quite cross,” she continues. Adding, “While it’s not the worst I’ve seen, it didn’t meet my expectation of not having a white cast.” “It’s misleading to use those exact three words: zero white cast.” Beyond Tower 28 and Merit, brands like CeraVe and SkinCeuticals have also been called out for using terms like “no white cast” and “transparent” — claims that some content creators are now challenging. For consumers of color, these misleading claims are not just disappointing, they’re exclusionary. So why, when the beauty industry operates under such strict regulations, do countless sunscreens still fail to deliver on their promises? Why do some sunscreens have a white cast? AJ Addae, chief executive officer and chemist of SULA Labs — which tests skincare for brands developing products for melanin-rich consumers —  explains that when it comes to mineral sunscreens, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only allows cosmetic chemists to use two UV filters: titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Both are white pigments. Addae notes that at the concentrations needed to achieve a broad-spectrum SPF of 30 or higher, it’s difficult — if not impossible — to create a mineral sunscreen that doesn’t reflect visible, white light. As such, Dr. Sass explains that currently, a truly invisible mineral sunscreen doesn’t exist on skincare shelves. So why are brands that use these filters so sure of their invisibility claims?  Cosmetic Chemist Milan Scott says, “What they really mean is that it’s invisible on lighter skin tones.” She adds, “When I see ‘invisible’ claims on a mineral sunscreen that is very clearly not invisible on people that look like me, it makes me wonder who [the brand] tested it on — and who approved these claims.” I think that brands need to do diversity and inclusivity authentically and be brave enough to say, ‘This product isn’t right for everybody because it creates a white cast. However, we do have other products within our offering that are suitable.’Dija Ayodele, esthetician and founder of the Black Skin Directory Dr. Sass explains that when brands make this claim, they typically conduct internal tests on individuals with lighter skin tones and often apply much less than the recommended amount needed to achieve the advertised level of protection. “Sunscreen is tested at 2 mg per square centimeter of skin, which comes out to about 1/4 teaspoon for just the face and about 1/2 teaspoon if you include the ears and neck,” he says — the optimum amount to protect your skin. Esthetician and skincare expert Alicia Lartey — whose Instagram series Sunscreen or SunSCREAM puts the invisibility claims of SPFs to the test — agrees that clinical trials and SPF testing often lack the diversity they should. Frustratingly, Scott notes that there’s no requirement for brands to test on a wide range of skin tones before making such claims. How do brands get away with claiming their sunscreens leave no white cast? Surprisingly, Addae notes that, unlike the term “water resistance,” which requires standardized testing, there are no regulations around the term “white cast.” The same applies to the word “invisible,” says Scott. If a brand deems its sunscreen traceless based on its testing, it can label it as such, even if that’s not true for darker skin tones. You’re right to be outraged — and so are the experts: “It’s a marketing loophole that a lot of us in the industry side-eye hard,” says Scott. Ayodele has a hunch as to why: “Brands are doing this because they want to be seen as inclusive at all costs,” she believes. “They don’t want the backlash of [people] saying that they’re not inclusive. But if these brands tested their mineral sunscreens [on a more diverse range of people], they’d know whether they were invisible or not.” That said, it’s important to acknowledge the limits of science, says Ayodele. “Yes, of course, we want diversity and for brands to be inclusive, but by nature, the mineral filters titanium dioxide and zinc oxide aren’t inclusive,” she says. “That’s not a problem because not everything is going to be,” she adds. “Unless further scientific techniques are brought in to make these white mineral ingredients invisible, that’s just where we’re at.” Still, Scott emphasizes the need for more transparency and testing across shade ranges. Ayodele’s advice to brands is simple: honesty is the best policy: “I think that brands need to do diversity and inclusivity authentically and be brave enough to say, ‘This product isn’t right for everybody because it creates a white cast. However, we do have other products within our offering that are suitable’,” she says.  Frustratingly, Scott notes that there’s no requirement for brands to test on a wide range of skin tones before making such claims Are mineral sunscreens better than chemical ones? TikTok would have you believe that mineral sunscreens are the gold standard. Ayodele acknowledges they have benefits — especially for sensitive skin and conditions like rosacea, melasma, or pigmentation — but stresses that more inclusive options exist. Chemical sunscreens, which use UV filters like avobenzone or oxybenzone, are suitable for everyone. Still, they’ve come under scrutiny, with some convinced that chemical filters are toxic while mineral ones are safe. This simply isn’t true, says Scott: “This fear drives people toward mineral sunscreens, even though many of them leave a visible cast on deeper skin tones and make sunscreens less accessible for folks who already deal with health disparities,” she says. Scott doesn’t mince her words: “This is what medical racism looks like in real time,” she continues. “It’s when fear-based marketing pushes mineral sunscreens as the safer option, even though those same formulas leave people with darker skin out of the conversation entirely.” So who’s to blame? The experts point to the “clean beauty” movement. “Clean beauty has been an axe to scientific innovation,” says Lartey. “Newsflash — everything is a chemical,” she adds, even water. In reality, chemical sunscreens are often more cosmetically elegant than mineral ones, making them a better option for people with darker skin tones seeking to avoid a white cast. R29 favorites include Glossier Invisible Shield SPF50, $32, The Ordinary UV Filters SPF45, $19, and Dr. Jart+ Every Sun Day™ Invisible Korean Sunscreen Stick SPF 40, $30, to name just a few.  Does a truly invisible mineral sunscreen actually exist? For those who prefer mineral sunscreens, is a truly invisible option even possible? Scott believes it is. “For a mineral sunscreen to be invisible on all skin tones, it takes advanced formulation with nano-sized mineral filters,” she explains — a process that’s both expensive and time-consuming for brands. She adds that tinted mineral sunscreens offer another solution, but only a few brands, like Wyn Beauty, are getting it right. “That’s because too many companies still don’t see the financial value in creating that many [products] to be truly inclusive for darker skin tones,” she says. And that’s a real problem: “Entire groups of people are excluded from sun protection options because brands don’t think it’s profitable to include us,” says Scott, who sees it as a public health issue. Ultimately, Lartey believes that brands can easily avoid messy situations like Tower 28’s simply by testing products on a wide variety of skin tones — and actually using the correct amount. “Beyond that, hire a diverse staff, listen to your diverse staff, and make sure there are diverse staff in senior roles,” urges Lartey. “It’s not that hard.” Like what you see?

    "description": "Summer is finally here, and with it comes an inevitable surge of nail inspiration flooding our feeds. From pretty princess nails to playful beach manicures, there’s an abundance of fresh trends emerging already, but there’s always one shade that reappears every summer without fail: white. Timeless, clean, and effortlessly cool, white nails are synonymous with summer and always look impeccable. This season, though, there’s a twist: White nails are enjoying a soft-focus upgrade. Say goodbye to the stark, bright whites of the past; this summer’s take is more about milky, sheer, and chiffon-inspired whites. Think creamy undertones, hints of pink and nude, and cloudy textures. The result is modern, elevated, and made for the sunshine season. Ahead, we’ve got 11 of the best white nails to inspire your next manicure. DashDividers_1_500x100 Soap Shine View this post on Instagram A post shared by Melanie Graves (@overglowedit) At first glance, this practically perfect white manicure by nail content creator Melanie Graves looks clean and simple. But look again, and you’ll spot a subtly pink, pearlescent hue that mirrors the iridescence of a sudsy bubble bath. Recreate it at home with Essie Gel Couture in Pre-Show Jitters, $13. Soft Seafoam View this post on Instagram A post shared by Saskia Fenwick (@saskiafenwick) Manicurist Saskia Fenwick has declared it “seafoam season” with these elegantly pared-back nails. A popular choice among professional nail artists, Bio Sculpture’s Seafoam, $14.50, is a gorgeous milky white that feels fresh and modern. Summer Croc View this post on Instagram A post shared by C H A N E L | The Glow Expert (@buymechanel) Animal print nails have been enjoying a comeback for 2025, and croc print is going to be a huge trend for summer. This look created by nail artist Anh Nguyen for digital creator @buymechanel is so fun. Beach Shimmer View this post on Instagram A post shared by pretty dainty by kristine (@prettydaintybykristine) Beach nails are a huge trend for summer, and while lots of manicurists use an abundance of colors, textures, and embellishments, this pearly shell manicure by @prettydaintybykristine proves it works just as well in monochrome.  Bright White View this post on Instagram A post shared by Julia Diogo (@paintedbyjools) Proving it’s a classic summer nail look for a reason, manicurist Julia Diogo uses a classic, bright white to create this bold colorblock manicure. Try OPI Nail Lacquer in Alpine Snow, $11.99, to recreate it at home. White On White French View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝙎𝙘𝙖𝙧𝙡𝙚𝙩𝙝 (@scaviar.nails) The humble French manicure is always reinventing itself, and this summer sees manicurists like @scaviar.nails switching the classic pink-nude base for a milky white hue. Paired with crisp white tips, it’s an incredibly chic way to wear white nails for the season.  Reverse Iced View this post on Instagram A post shared by Carmelina (@hicarmelina) Flipping her classic iced French manicure on its head, bridal manicurist Carmelina pairs a pearlescent base with a micro strip of bright white color at the base of the nail for an utterly cool manicure. Barely Beige View this post on Instagram A post shared by Paulina Juśkiewicz (@nailsbypaulin) If a stark white manicure isn’t your thing, try seeking out warm beiges and soft chiffons for a more wearable, buttery manicure. Recreate this one by manicurist Paulina Juśkiewicz using Essie Nail Polish in Allure, $15.50. Half Moon View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jaz (@paintbyjaz) Strictly speaking, this pretty half-moon manicure by Jaz does use a soft pink base, but it’s the striking linen-colored accents at the tip and base of the nail that make this a decidedly modern take on a white manicure. Vanilla Chrome View this post on Instagram A post shared by 𝗥𝗛𝗜𝗔𝗡𝗡𝗔 | 𝗡𝗔𝗜𝗟 𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗜𝗦𝗧 (@beautybyrhianna_j) This creamy combination by nail artist Rhianna was created using The Gel Bottle’s delicious off-white, Piña Colada, finished with a white chrome top coat. While you’ll get the best results in a salon for this, Holo Taco Specialty Nail Polish in Milky White Shimmer, $14, captures a similar oyster iridescent sheen. White Blooms View this post on Instagram A post shared by Jadyn | Ontario Nail Tech \u0026 Artist 🌿 (@_thejadeaesthetic) Floral nail art is always a popular choice for spring and summer, and blooming gel in particular has really taken off this year. This design by nail artist Jadyn looks so pretty thanks to the soft white hue and touches of gold shimmer. This story was originally published on Refinery29 UK. Like what you see?

Should the former make you (or your wallet) tremble, planning a trip to the salon is an easy, low-pressure adventure that will still give you something to look forward to. Even better, all the coolest trends you'll see this summer are fittingly low-key. We're talking soft, buttery \"teasy\" highlights; fun blond hues; hybrid hair (but in that pretty, intentional way); and hair color that's easy as hell to maintain. Because at this point, who has the time for all the fuss? Of course, if you're looking to make a bold color change, don't stress: we've got some options for you there, too. \"Summertime always inspires people to go a little lighter with their color,\" celebrity hairstylist Tom Smith says. \"Summer holidays and a more relaxed attitude during these months mean longer between appointments.\" Translation? You can expect the following \"easy\" summer hair colors ahead to trend from now until the foreseeable future - and dammit, if that's not a win the world could use right now, we don't know what is.

    "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/cara-delevingne-beauty-interview-49447664",
    "description": "Cara Delevingne makes it her mission to always keep learning. \"I don't like to be stagnant,\" the model and actor says. In the past, that goal has led her to Malaysia, where she learned about the wild tiger population there. Most recently, it saw her traveling to the Cannes Film Festival, as she has many times before, but this time she was there specifically in support of women in film. This year, Delevingne partnered with L'Oreal Paris for the 5th annual Lights of Women's Worth Award. \"One of my big beliefs is supporting women,\" she says. \"I believe, more than anything, that we need more women's stories, more female voices, more perspectives. Women are more than half of the population and they are 17 percent of the directors. Spotlighting these female visionaries and female filmmakers is a really big deal.\" To fuel her passion for supporting other women, she thinks it's important to prioritize her own self-care. Amid all the travel, she relies on yoga and meditation in particular to stay grounded. \"I have a practice that I do every morning and every night. It changes every day depending on what I need. It's very simple - whether it's yoga positions, chanting, maybe a little prayer to myself,\" Delevingne says. It helps her get ready for the day or unwind, depending on when she can fit it into her schedule. Movement is a top priority for her. She enjoys working out, but quickly clarifies, \"I'm not a huge gym person.\" To her, movement is more about lifestyle choices than reps and sets. \"I just love being active. Whether it's going for a hike with my friends, or I love group sports or activities - any sort of adventure stuff I love.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cara Delevingne (@caradelevingne) This relates back to her desire to always keep learning: \"Curiosity keeps the mind and the body young and moving.\" Delevingne's list of tried-and-true habits that make her feel and look good contains everything from lying on a lacrosse ball to work out any knots in her upper back to drinking a nightly cup of tea, and she's recently incorporated something new that she picked up from another model. \"I just started trying the thing of sticking your face in a bowl of ice water,\" she says. \"Kate Moss told me to do it years ago. I didn't listen, but now I just started listening and it woke me up. I don't know exactly what it does, but it works. Something happened.\" \"People too put too much pressure on how [makeup] looks instead of how it makes you feel.\" While Delevingne sources most of her confidence and self-worth from within, that's not to say that doing a little glam doesn't help. \"Growing up, I wasn't the biggest fan of makeup. I didn't understand the artistry behind it. It wasn't until I got older [that I got it],\" she says. \"I think probably modeling and having makeup put on me a lot made me a bit more resistful of learning and understanding more about it.\" That's shifted, however, as she's gotten older. Now, she looks at the ritual of getting ready similarly to her yoga practice. \"It's always been for myself and I think it does feel like there is a meditative process of getting ready - whether it's you're getting ready for an important meeting or you're going on a first date or it feels like something you are doing for yourself to build yourself up.\" And in the end, that's really the key, she concludes: \"People too put too much pressure on how it looks instead of how it makes you feel.\" Jessica Harrington (she/her) is the senior editor of PS Beauty, where she oversees coverage around makeup, skin care, hair, tattoos, and more.
