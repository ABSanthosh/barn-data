  "description": "In recent years, beauty brands have started catering to a wider range of skin tones, making it possible for me as a Black woman to find a foundation, concealer, or bronzer that enhances my natural complexion without changing it completely. Of all those beauty players, none struck a chord with me the way Ami Colé did. The brainchild of Senegalese founder and CEO Diarrha N'Diaye-Mbaye, Ami Colé catered to melanin-rich skin, a category that has historically been overlooked. From the warm website imagery to its emphasis on diversity, the clean beauty brand put people like me at the center of the narrative - not as a result of giving in to public calls for inclusion but as part of a genuine commitment to uplifting Black beauty. The clean beauty brand put people like me at the center of the narrative - not as a result of giving in to public calls for inclusion but as part of a genuine commitment to uplifting Black beauty. Now, four years after Ami Colé was founded, N'Diaye-Mbaye announced it'll be officially closing in September 2025. In an article for our sister brand, The Cut, she revealed that the brand is shuttering in part due to a lack of support from investors. \"Instead of focusing on the healthy, sustainable future of the company and meeting the needs of our loyal fan base,\" she wrote, \"I rode a temperamental wave of appraising investors - some of whom seemed to have an attitude toward equity and 'betting big on inclusivity' that changed its tune a lot, to my ears, from what it sounded like in 2020.\" Her story echoes that of several Black founders who note that support for Black-owned brands has waned following the racial reckoning in 2020. Still, Ami Colé's impact is long-lasting and immeasurable, and we tapped beauty insiders across the industry to speak to the enduring legacy it leaves behind. Inspired by the beauty of Black women and the way we show up in the world, the collection includes an award-winning skin-enhancing tint, a light-catching highlighter, and a lip treatment oil that our editors raved about - all made from hydrating ingredients such as baobab-seed extract, hibiscus extract, and pumpkin-seed extract that draw on the founder's heritage. These products are still available to shop at Sephora, Amazon, and the brand's site through the end of September 2025. Ahead, read love letters to Ami Colé from several beauty editors.

Any time you've seen me since 2021, I was wearing the lip treatment oil. Bliss, Excellence, Reflection: I gifted one to every woman in my family one Christmas. I swear by the mascara. I never felt more beautiful than when I first put on the skin-enhancing tint and saw my natural face staring back at me, not transformed but simply enhanced with an easy glow. Ami Colé felt like a piece of the effortless beauty, the quiet confidence Diarrha's always had, that she gifted to all of us. It was transformative to see Black beauty through Diarrha's eyes. In her world, we didn't have to contort ourselves to fit a beauty standard that was never designed to include us. We all felt more beautiful, loved, and valued in her reflection. Diarrha, I am so deeply proud of you. To witness this journey from start to finish — to see Ami Colé go from a mere dream to shelves in Sephoras around the world — has truly changed me. It's a testament to your grit and your wonder. That you are not able to sustain this business because of a lack of investors — as less than one percent of venture capital currently goes to Black founders — is a tragedy. But it's a racist society that failed here, not you. Women around the world were inspired by your work and the next great Black beauty brand founder is somewhere playing in makeup just like you were, energized and inspired by your story. Your reach goes far beyond numbers, and your legacy is just being created.\" — Jessica Andrews, senior style director PS Photography | Naomi Parris\"While buying Black became a short-lived fad in 2020, I've made sure to stay committed to supporting these businesses in the long run and Ami Colé was one brand I always admired, not only because of its masterful inclusivity in products but because of its purpose. Seeing how Diarrha birthed something that impacted the world globally inspired by her parents' hair salon was nothing short of beautiful to see. Like a hair salon, Ami Colé is a safe space for us — Black women — to be seen and heard, a place where our beauty is prioritized and further cultivated. The brand's place in the industry extends far beyond loving the shine of my lips when I apply its lip oil. It's a space where we come first, regardless of the society that constantly places us at second and there will never be another like it.\" — Naomi Parris, assistant shopping editor \"Ami Colé wasn't just selling makeup, it was building space for melanin-rich beauty in an industry that still sidelines us. Its closure is a gut punch and a reminder: shelf space at major retailers isn't protection. Visibility doesn't equal viability. Black-owned beauty brands need more than our applause; they need money, momentum, and militant support. If we want these brands to exist, we have to fund them, fight for them, and make noise for them. Our access to beauty that truly sees us depends on it. And we should act like it!\" — Deena Campbell, beauty expert and journalist\"I never met an Ami Cole product I didn't love. I hit pan on everything and happily re-upped every single time. And as a 20+ year beauty vet, read that again — Ami Cole was THAT brand that I wanted for my younger self. Participating felt purposeful, playful, powerful. It was makeup that made sense and made me feel my most prettiest me.\" - Felicia Walker, skincare educator, author, content creator Keep scrolling to shop our favorite products from Ami Colé.amazon.comAmi Colé Lip Treatment OilAmi Colé Lip Treatment Oil ($20) I used to steer clear of lip gloss, but this sheer lip oil has totally changed my mind. With a combination of hydrating oils, plus antioxidant-rich passionfruit-seed oil, it offers lasting hydration and a shiny, subtle, rose-colored finish that is both flattering and good for your lips. One editor raved about the beauty buy in her Ami Colé Lip Treatment Oil review. Editor Quote: \"It has a thick, goopy texture that glides smoothly onto my lips and delivers a deep conditioning feel. At first, it may seem like the product is just sitting on your lips topically, but within minutes, the hydration penetrates, slowly softening the lips for a healthier, nonsticky feel. Because of its thicker texture, the hydration is actually pretty long-lasting — I can go a few hours without reapplying.\" — Anvita Reddy, former assistant shopping editoramazon.comAmi Colé Skin-Enhancing TintAmi Colé Skin-Enhancing Tint ($32) Packed with baobab-seed extract, hibiscus extract, and pumpkin-seed extract, the tint will convey a natural glow while enhancing your complexion. The formula is designed to be breathable with a satin finish that will show your skin at its best.amazon.comAmi Colé Light-Catching HighlighterAmi Colé Light-Catching Highlighter ($22) This highlighter will help you shine bright like a diamond, in the best possible way.
