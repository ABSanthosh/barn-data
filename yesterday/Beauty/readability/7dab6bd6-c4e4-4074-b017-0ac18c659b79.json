If you’re still looking for some holiday gifts I have a few more roundups for you. Many of these discovery sets offer a voucher towards the purchase of a full-size perfume (I’ll note which ones have them below). There are still lots of ways to save on beauty sets this month. Some sales on my radar: Sephora’s Gifts For All Event is happening now – save 20% off your order with code HAVEITALL (one time use) and 30% off Sephora Collection now thru 12/15 Ulta Beauty has lots of sales and promos each week, right up save up to $20 off in store and online – get $10 off $40 qualifying purchase with code CHEER24 or $20 off $100 qualifying purchase with code JOY24, they also have their Big Holiday Beauty Sale going on (my last minute gifts all on sale shared here and here) Saks Fifth Avenue has their Spend More, Earn More event with code WNTRGCSF Bluemercury is offering 20% off purchases $200+ Bloomingdale’s has their Beauty Treats Event to take $25 off every $150 you spend on beauty (some exclusions apply) Onto today’s gift guide! I think Perfume Discovery Sets are such a fun gift idea whether you’re looking for something for yourself or a gift. There are quite a few brands I do not have in-person access to and the sets allow me to try perfumes without having to buy blind. I will admit that some sets have been a total fail in the sense that I didn’t end up liking any of the perfumes or notes, but it was still fun to try. I have a few friends who have completely different tastes in perfumes so I can usually find someone else who will gladly take any of them off my hands! Celine Celine makes some of my favorite scents. Right now they’re only sold online at Celine or in Celine boutiques in the US so they can be a bit hard to find. I bought the Coffret Miniatures a year ago when it had 10 perfumes and absolutely loved trying the scents. You can see my review of each one in this post here. They’ve since updated this Coffret Set to include 12 scents including Zouzou (new) and Bois Dormant (10 ml each). They’ve also increased the price to $445 for 12 minis versus $385 for 10 minis (the older variation). A more affordable option is their Discovery Set with has 11 mini vials each 2 ml for $48. This one comes with spritzers. Guerlain Guerlain Holiday is stunning this year! They have some beautiful discovery sets I’ve reviewed in depth here. I think these are among some of the best high quality perfumes I’ve ever tried. These are quite the splurge but I know some of you are die-hard loyal fans to this perfume line and I think the sets make for the most beautiful luxury gifts. The Iconic Eaux de Parfum Set has three minis ($190, three 10 ml minis) from the L’art and La Matiere Line in Neroli Outrenoir, Angelique Noire, and Musc Outreblanc. They also have two eight-piece Perfumers Sets in the Iconic Harmony and Floral Harmony ($395 each). This year they launched a six-piece discovery Exceptional Set with the Extracts and it is STUNNING ($630). You can view all the Fragrance Gift Set offerings here. Creed Fragrance Creed is another beautiful perfume line and I think their Discovery Sets are stunning. I gift one to Andrew every year and he uses every single scent. Creed has a lot of variations including 3-piece sets ($250 each) or 5-piece sets ($345 each). They have variations for men and different ones for women. Right now at the time of this post Nordstrom is offering a discount on the Creed Sets. Women’s 5-Piece Set includes: Aventus for Her, Love in White, Wind Flowers, Royal Princess Oud and Spring Flower Women’s 3-Piece Set includes: Aventus for Her, Carmina and Wind Flowers Men’s 5-Piece Set includes: Aventus, Green Irish Tweed, Silver Mountain Water, Aventus Cologne and Millesime Imperial Men’s 3-Piece Set includes: Aventus, Green Irish Tweed, Silver Mountain Water The Creed Refillable Atomizer is another beautiful gift option. They have different colors to pick from and both Andrew and I own and love these. Byredo Byredo offers the biggest selection of discovery and travel sets. I love that they have SO many options! This year they’ve launched a stunning 24-piece discovery set called La Grande Decouverte ($250). This set comes with a $225 voucher to use towards any Eau de Parfum and they give you 6 months to redeem it. Each vial is 2 ml. Byredo also offers several smaller 6-piece Discovery Sets ($60) and these also come with a $60 voucher to use towards a perfume. This one has a shorter window to redeem of 4 weeks but I think it’s still a great way to try them. The sets this year include: La Decouverte Boise La Decouverte Florale La Decouverte Sur-Mesure – you can pick your own scents for this one! La Decouverte Nomade The 3-piece Travel Sets ($174 each) are still widely available at multiple retailers like Nordstrom, Saks, etc. I picked up La Selection Boisee with Super Cedar, Mojave Ghost and Black Saffron but there are multiple variations available with different combinations. The Les Miniatures 5-Piece Set ($210) is available at Byredo with mini bottles in a dabber style. Glossier Trio This year Glossier added two new scents to their line and they launched a Glossier You Discovery Kit ($82) for the holiday with travel sizes. At the time of this post there are a few left at Sephora.com but it’s sold out at Glossier. The good news is you can find the Travel Editions (8 ml each) individually now in Glossier You, You Reve and You Doux for $32 each. Glossier is offering 20% off online until 12/15. Parfums de Marly Parfums de Marly is a new-to-me brand this year. I bought the Feminine Discovery Set ($50) from their website (comes with a voucher to use towards a full-size fragrance). The line is more widely available at retailers like Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans etc. and they carry it near me but I really liked having the discovery set to try them at my own pace. I also love their Discovery Collection ($230, Saks) with four 10 ml sizes perfect to try or for your purse. It has Delina, Delina Exclusif, Oriana and Valaya. I’m a huge fan of the Delina line for the prettiest rose scents but my heart still belongs to Creed Spring Flower so I haven’t bought any of the Delina scents. Victoria Beckham Beauty I’ve been a huge fan of Victoria Beckham Beauty for the makeup and was super curious when they launched perfumes. I ordered the Original 3-Piece Discovery Set ($30) when it launched (this comes with a voucher). Out of the three I liked Portofino 97 the best which has notes of Bergamot, Amber and Vetiver (all my favorite notes) but I didn’t like it enough to buy any of the full sizes. It pulls unisex but slightly more on the masculine side on me. They’ve since added a new scent and updated the Discovery Set ($40) to include the new one Reverie which has notes of Vanilla, Cedarwood and Plum. I haven’t tried the perfume but the PR team sent over their Hand Cream Collection Set ($144) which has all four scents in a hand cream and I really love Reverie. It has a similar vibe to MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 which I actually don’t wear anymore. I think the VBB Reverie is a much better variation. If you like vanillas I think it’s definitely worth checking out. The Hand Creams are very smooth in texture without any sticky residue. I think they’re really nice. You can purchase them individually and they also launched a Hand Cream Tube Key ($12) to twist the end of the tube. The Harmonist I discovered The Harmonist line this year and fell head over heels in love with Moon Glory and Yin Transformation. They’re truly unique with exceptionally long lasting power. There is a Discovery Set ($85) I’m working my way through. I think it’s a truly special line. Linking a few more Discovery Sets. There seems to be one for almost every perfume line! SHOP THE POST SHOP THE POST If you’ve been looking for some last minute beauty gifts I hope you found this roundup helpful! If you have any favorite perfume line you’re loyal to please let me know in the comments. I am always looking for more to try.",

The line is more widely available at retailers like Nordstrom, Saks, Neimans etc. and they carry it near me but I really liked having the discovery set to try them at my own pace.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI also love their \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3OQzkAB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eDiscovery Collection\u003c/a\u003e ($230, \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3OQzkAB\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eSaks\u003c/a\u003e) with four 10 ml sizes perfect to try or for your purse. It has Delina, Delina Exclusif, Oriana and Valaya. I’m a huge fan of the Delina line for the prettiest rose scents but my heart still belongs to Creed Spring Flower so I haven’t bought any of the Delina scents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eVictoria Beckham Beauty\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Victoria-Beckham-Beauty-Fragrance-Hand-Cream-Sets.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Victoria-Beckham-Beauty-Fragrance-Hand-Cream-Sets-1440x2160.jpg\" alt=\"Victoria Beckham Beauty Hand Cream Set and Discovery Perfume Set\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1620\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"Gift Ideas for the Fragrance Lover.

I ordered the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/49xzfv7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eOriginal 3-Piece Discovery Set\u003c/a\u003e ($30) when it launched (this comes with a voucher). Out of the three I liked Portofino 97 the best which has notes of Bergamot, Amber and Vetiver (all my favorite notes) but I didn’t like it enough to buy any of the full sizes. It pulls unisex but slightly more on the masculine side on me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThey’ve since added a new scent and updated the \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3PbV2zr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eDiscovery Set\u003c/a\u003e ($40) to include the new one Reverie which has notes of Vanilla, Cedarwood and Plum. I haven’t tried the perfume but the PR team sent over their \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3BsmJAx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHand Cream Collection Set\u003c/a\u003e ($144) which has all four scents in a hand cream and I really love Reverie. It has a similar vibe to MFK Baccarat Rouge 540 which I actually don’t wear anymore. I think the VBB Reverie is a much better variation. If you like vanillas I think it’s definitely worth checking out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Hand Creams are very smooth in texture without any sticky residue. I think they’re really nice. You can purchase them individually and they also launched a \u003ca href=\"https://bit.ly/3ZzW78C\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"\u003eHand Cream Tube Key\u003c/a\u003e ($12) to twist the end of the tube.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThe Harmonist\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Harmonist-Perfume-Discovery-Set.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://thebeautylookbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Harmonist-Perfume-Discovery-Set-1440x2160.jpg\" alt=\"The Harmonist Discovery Perfume Set\" width=\"1080\" height=\"1620\" data-jpibfi-post-excerpt=\"Gift Ideas for the Fragrance Lover.
