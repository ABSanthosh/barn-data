  "description": "From polka-dot manicures and “Italian Summer”-inspired nail art to sorbet shades and beach nails, there has been no shortage of incredible nail inspiration for our summer manicures this year. And our latest collective obsession with fruity nails has given rise to an emerging trend to watch for the season ahead: guava nails. While your first thought might be that guava nails are just a new way to describe bubblegum pink, think again. This manicure is actually a shimmering fusion of green and pink that’s as juicy as the fruit itself. Teamed with a multidimensional finish (think chrome or jelly), the result is a playful manicure that feels fresh and fun. So as our social feeds start to fill with hot takes on this sweet summer nail trend, here’s everything you need to know about it — inspiration included. View this post on Instagram A post shared by 📍PEABODY MA, your nail plug (@polishedbycarrissa) What are guava nails? Some people might refer to a bright pink manicure as “guava”, but this summer’s iteration of guava nails is more complex than just paying homage to the flesh of this tropical fruit. “This year’s trend is inspired by all of the tropical tones of the guava fruit and blends juicy pinks with corals and soft greens to mimic the fruit’s natural appearance,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. Yes, guava nails 2.0 are all about contrast and depth rather than a flat colorblock manicure. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Zola Ganzorigt (@nailsbyzola) The most popular iteration is a cat-eye finish: “The colors are layered using ombré techniques, jelly finishes, or magnetic cat-eye effects to mimic the fruit’s juicy texture and natural glow,” says Streets. Rather than leaning overly neon and bright, this version of guava nails feels undeniably cooler, and there are so many ways to wear it, too. “Rather than having the cat-eye all over the nails, you can scale it down and apply it just to the middle of the nail or go for a guava nail tip or half moon,” suggests London-based nail technician Metta Francis.

If you’re heading to the salon for this look, it’s all about layering different colors and finishes for that multidimensional effect. “Layer on a soft green magnetic shimmer gel and use a magnet to manipulate the pigment for a cat-eye effect, then apply a pink or coral, sheer jelly formula to the center of the nail for that juicy, fruit-inspired finish,” explains Streets. Manicurists are also known to add the centre pop of color by softly dabbing a powder pink pigment or eyeshadow into the nail using a sponge or fluffy brush. “This creates a diffused, blurred effect,” says Streets. Finish with an ultra-glossy top coat to seal it all in and create that mirror-glass shine.  @polishedbygabbi Guava nail tutorial for summer!
