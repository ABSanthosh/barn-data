  "description": "TikTok's domineering power in the trend cycle is undeniable, especially on the beauty front. The platform has become a trusted source that informs everything from our product purchases to what hair color we try next. But of all the fads that have taken over our FYP, the latest is unlike anything we've seen before. Allow us to introduce you to \"fluffy nails.\" Since \"fluffy nail\" routines surfaced on the app, searches for the trend are up 60 percent on Google. The textured nail trend, which resembles the feel of your favorite cashmere sweater, feels perfectly on theme for the cold winter months - but this nail trend comes with a catch. Due to their variation in texture, many nail lovers are concerned with the logistics of a manicure like this - namely, wondering: Do fluffy nails smell? And honestly, we have our eyebrows raised too. Ahead, we tapped two nail experts to give us a breakdown of all there is to know about fluffy nails, including how to maintain them and if the trend is worth trying for yourself. Experts Featured in This Article Priscilla Nguyen is an educator at Aprés Nail. What Are Fluffy Nails? The trend is a textured look that can be used with almost any design you want. \"Fluffy nails are a type of design using flocking powder to create a 'fluffy' 3D texture,\" nail educator Priscilla Nguyen says. \"It's like the sweater nails look but using a different texture.\" If you're ready to take a risk with \"fluffy nails,\" Nguyen emphasizes that you shouldn't cure your nails after applying a layer of gel polish or topcoat like the Aprés Gel Couleur ($15) and Aprés Non-Wipe Glossy Top Gelcoat ($13). Instead, she suggests adding the flocking powder (which you can get at any nail supply store) to your wet layer and allowing a second for it to soak into the gel. \"Cure for 30-60 seconds (depending on the brand of gel you use) in a nail lamp like the brand's Beta LED Nail Lamp ($100), and wipe off any excess, and you have your fluffy nail,\" she says. Fluffy nails can also be achieved by using a nail lacquer where the same rules apply. How to Maintain Fluffy Nails As fun as they are, fluffy nails aren't the most practical to maintain. Nguyen advises that it's easier to keep fluffy nails clean with gel polish rather than regular lacquer because of the gel's durability. \"Nails are jewels, not tools,\" is a cardinal rule she also stresses. \"Fluffy nails don't last as long, so be mindful of not using your nails as much as possible and keeping them away from anything that could make them dirty.\" Believe it or not, the aftercare process for \"fluffy nails\" is extremely similar to a regular manicure. Care for them with your normal hand-washing routine, but it's important to note that some of the fluffy texture might fall off over time. Nguyen also suggests adding a cuticle oil or hand cream after washing your hands to keep your nails moisturized and looking their best. If you're in the mood for high-maintenance nails, keep scrolling for some inspiration.",
