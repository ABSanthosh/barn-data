  "description": "While testing a new mascara or lipstick will never get old, I get especially giddy when I get my hands on a new beauty tool. From microcurrent devices to smart hairdryers, there are a lot of innovative gadgets out there that bring with them professional-quality results - and I want to trial them all. The latest high-tech tool to make its way across my desk - and into my routine permanently - is the new Shark Beauty CryoGlow LED Face Mask ($350). How do I love thee? Let me count the ways. While I'm a long-time user of LED therapy and have a few at-home red light masks in my possession already, this new device from Shark Beauty also includes cryotherapy benefits, a combination I've never seen before in my many years as a beauty editor. After trying it for over three weeks, it really knocked my socks off. Allow me to explain. About the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask This LED face mask contains high-energy, tri-wick LEDs in blue, red, and deep-penetrating infrared light. It features cryo technology in the undereye area that can be used during every LED treatment or on its own. It's cordless, allowing you to move freely during your treatment. The mask comes with a rechargeable smart remote that allows you to select your program and view your progress. It contains four treatment settings: Better Aging for collagen and wrinkles, Skin Clearing for acne, Skin Sustain to maintain your results, and Undereye Revive for depuffing. It was developed with dermatologists, is backed by clinical testing, and is FDA-cleared. What I Like About the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask I've used my fair share of LED masks over the years, so when I first heard Shark Beauty was releasing its own version, I figured it'd be more of the same. This is not to say it wouldn't be great, but I didn't expect it to be very different from its competitors. Boy, was I wrong. Shark's CryoGlow is the smartest LED mask I've tried thus far. Humor me while I nerd out a little: The mask contains high-energy, tri-wick LEDs in blue, red, and deep-penetrating infrared light. What that means is each bulb has the capability to produce red, blue, or infrared light, allowing for full-face coverage no matter what treatment you choose. Many other masks on the market have different bulbs for different light settings, which means, for example, you could be getting red light from half of the bulbs in the mask and blue light from the other half, allowing for more gaps between treatment areas. The fit of the mask is also worth applauding. The hard shell features padding and an adjustable head strap meant to mimic the fit of snow goggles, which is to say it's super comfortable and secure. While some masks are flexible and sit flush with the face, this one is designed to hover at the perfect distance from your face to allow for better light coverage. Now, onto the super advanced remote that comes attached to the mask. The small controller features a wheel-style button that allows you to power on/off the device and toggle through the treatments. There's a small screen that displays each one, along with the key benefits and length of treatment. There's also an option to view your progress and see how many days you've used the mask. Being the impatient girl I am, I love that the remote shows you how much time is left while you're using it. The four treatments have you covered no matter what your skin goals are. Better Aging, which lasts six minutes and uses red and infrared light, promotes collagen and minimizes wrinkles; Skin Clearing is eight minutes long using blue, red, and infrared, to kill acne-causing bacteria; the four-minute Skin Sustain option uses red, blue, and infrared light and is designed to be used after you complete eight weeks of one of the other treatments to keep up the benefits you'll have seen. Lastly, you have Undereye Revive, which is a 5- to 15-minute treatment to depuff the undereye area; it has three temperature settings and can be used alone or coupled with any of the other LED treatments. I like to use the antiaging treatment for overall skin maintenance every day, while I reserve the acne treatment for whenever I'm breaking out. No matter what treatment I'm doing, though, I turn on the undereye cooling treatment, which helps with inflammation and puffiness. It feels heavenly and leaves me looking refreshed when I'm done. How to Use the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Using the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is simple. First, you'll want to ensure the head straps are properly fitted so the mask stays on while you walk around, should you choose to do so. From there, power on the device by long-pressing the button on the remote and scrolling to toggle to your desired treatment. The mask will instantly light up, and you'll hear a low fan running to ensure it doesn't overheat (don't worry, it's not too loud; you'll still be able to hear the TV or TikTok). You should only use it on clean, dry skin sans any skin-care products. Because of this, I usually reach for it either first thing in the morning or at the end of the day, after washing my face but before I do the rest of my routine. I'll use it while I'm scrolling on TikTok or cleaning my apartment. What to Consider Before Trying the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Though you may notice a subtle glow to your skin after using the mask just once, it's important to keep in mind that real results take time. Consistency is key with LED therapy, and the more you use it, the better your skin will get. Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Worth the Splurge? LED masks are expensive, and the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is no different. However, the brand did manage to make its device cheaper than many other options on the market. At $350, it's still a splurge, but it's well worth the price tag, in my opinion. It allows you to get a medspa-quality treatment (which can run a couple of hundred dollars for a single facial) from the comfort of your home, and if you use the mask regularly, it'll eventually pay for itself. Where Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask Available? The Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026 LED Face Mask is available on the brand's website. Rating:",

Lastly, you have Undereye Revive, which is a 5- to 15-minute treatment to depuff the undereye area; it has three temperature settings and can be used alone or coupled with any of the other LED treatments.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eI like to use the antiaging treatment for overall skin maintenance every day, while I reserve the acne treatment for whenever I\u0026#39;m breaking out. No matter what treatment I\u0026#39;m doing, though, I turn on the undereye cooling treatment, which helps with inflammation and puffiness. It feels heavenly and leaves me looking refreshed when I\u0026#39;m done. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow to Use the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask \u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eUsing the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask is simple. First, you\u0026#39;ll want to ensure the head straps are properly fitted so the mask stays on while you walk around, should you choose to do so. From there, power on the device by long-pressing the button on the remote and scrolling to toggle to your desired treatment. The mask will instantly light up, and you\u0026#39;ll hear a low fan running to ensure it doesn\u0026#39;t overheat (don\u0026#39;t worry, it\u0026#39;s not too loud; you\u0026#39;ll still be able to hear the TV or TikTok). \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eYou should only use it on clean, dry skin sans any skin-care products. Because of this, I usually reach for it either first thing in the morning or at the end of the day, after washing my face but before I do the rest of my routine. I\u0026#39;ll use it while I\u0026#39;m scrolling on TikTok or cleaning my apartment. \u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/uFG6UFZ06N9wj-IEOi5w8mdVNg0=/fit-in/792x1039/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/07/896/n/1922153/tmp_yHq4tQ_9af6a3cf33b2a6d4_IMG_4207.jpg\" alt=\"Shark Beauty LED Mask Review\" width=\"792\" height=\"1039\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/uFG6UFZ06N9wj-IEOi5w8mdVNg0=/fit-in/792x1039/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/07/896/n/1922153/tmp_yHq4tQ_9af6a3cf33b2a6d4_IMG_4207.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/oQjdWtuwZboX9yBSXjFv-R6fxCY=/fit-in/1584x2078/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/02/07/896/n/1922153/tmp_yHq4tQ_9af6a3cf33b2a6d4_IMG_4207.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Jessica Harrington\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat to Consider Before Trying the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eThough you may notice a subtle glow to your skin after using the mask just once, it\u0026#39;s important to keep in mind that real results take time. Consistency is key with LED therapy, and the more you use it, the better your skin will get.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask Worth the Splurge?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eLED masks are expensive, and the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask is no different. However, the brand did manage to make its device cheaper than many other options on the market. At $350, it\u0026#39;s still a splurge, but it\u0026#39;s well worth the price tag, in my opinion. It allows you to get a medspa-quality treatment (which can run a couple of hundred dollars for a single facial) from the comfort of your home, and if you use the mask regularly, it\u0026#39;ll eventually pay for itself. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere Is the Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask Available?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eThe Shark CryoGlow Cooling \u0026amp; LED Face Mask is available on the \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sharkclean.com%2Fpage%2Fface-masks\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49427220__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003ebrand\u0026#39;s website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e★★★★★\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
