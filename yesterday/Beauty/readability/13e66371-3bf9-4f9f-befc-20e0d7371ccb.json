  "description": "I won’t pretend sorbet nails are a brand-new trend for summer 2025. Let’s be real — they look a lot like the pastel manicures that pop up every year at this time. But while they’re not exactly groundbreaking, there’s no denying that the biggest nail artists are obsessed with them right now. From Iram Shelton’s shimmering strawberry manicure to Harriet Westmoreland’s mint sorbet French tips, sorbet nails provide a cool pop of color among the wave of neutral princess nails and milky manicures.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Victoria | Nail Artist (@nailsxgoldenhour) What are sorbet nails? For the skeptics amongst us, there is a subtle difference between this year’s sorbet nails and more traditional pastels: “Though they’re in the same family of soft tones, sorbet shades are slightly more vibrant versions of pastel colors,” explains session manicurist Ami Streets. “Inspired by their namesake edible summer treat, they’re even brighter and juicier, often with a sheer or jelly-like finish that gives a gorgeously glossy and playful vibe.” Think of fruity hues inspired by your favorite ice cream flavors, such as banana, peach, strawberry, or pistachio, if you’re unsure where to start. View this post on Instagram A post shared by faye louise dennis (@fayelouisedennis) How do you wear sorbet nails? Streets points out that sorbet shades lend themselves beautifully to summer nail art looks. “Soft ombré gradients in sorbet colors are a dreamy nail look for summer. Effortlessly blending shades like pinks and peaches, for example, creates a sun-kissed effect that feels light, airy, and totally on-trend,” says Streets. Additionally, for minimalists, French tips, half-moon manis, and simple, dainty dot designs are a great way to wear sorbet hues more subtly.
