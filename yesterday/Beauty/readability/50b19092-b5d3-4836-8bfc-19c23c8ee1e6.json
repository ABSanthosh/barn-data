  "description": "When it comes to beauty products, I'd describe myself as hard to impress. Occasionally, I'll find a hair product I love that will work its way into my routine, and every few months, a new makeup product will find itself on my vanity. When it comes to skin-care products, though? Good freaking luck. I have dry, acne-prone skin, and I rarely add new things into my rotation unless they are practically life-changing. The fact is, with skin like mine, too many things can go wrong - and fast. I can wind up with a face full of zits overnight, a case of dermatitis that doesn't go away for weeks, or a gnarly rash that covers me in red patches. Even when it comes to brands created by my favorite celebrities - yes, I'm once again waxing poetic about my favorite celebrity ever, Hailey Bieber - I'm still overly cautious. However, when I heard the news about the Rhode Barrier Butter ($38), my interest was piqued. Keep scrolling to find out how testing the product went for me and whether or not it's worked its way into my routine permanently. About the Rhode Barrier Butter This product is a hydrating balm that helps seal in moisture. It comes in two sizes: 5oz and 1.35oz. The key ingredients include hyaluronic acid complex for moisture, polyglutamic acid and murumuru butter to lock in hydration, and ceramides to help reinforce the skin barrier. It is cruelty-free, gluten-free, noncomedogenic, fragrance-free, and vegan. What I Like About the Rhode Barrier Butter As someone with dry, acne-prone skin, the brand's barrier butter has been a total lifesaver ever since I got it. In the winter months, my skin starts to flake, and I always turn to an occlusive to help lock in moisture. This product does that, but it doesn't leave my face feeling sticky or like there's a gross layer of residue on top. Plus, I experienced absolutely zero issues with breakouts, rashes, or dermatitis. It's worked itself perfectly into my nighttime routine - I layer it on super dry areas or all over if I'm slugging. I've also become obsessed with using this product prior to putting on makeup. It makes my skin look super glossy, but it doesn't pill underneath my products. In fact, I feel like it does the opposite - it helps my makeup stay glued to my face. When I'm having a no-makeup day, this product is great for giving me a lit-from-within glow that even strangers comment on. (OK, it was once in line at Trader Joe's, but still - it counts.) How to Use the Rhode Barrier Butter The brand recommends incorporating Barrier Butter into your nighttime routine since it's a moisture-heavy product. First, it suggests starting with a cleanser, following up with any serums, and then adding a layer of the Barrier Butter. If you do opt to wear it during the day, they suggest following it with SPF. I have very dry skin, so I love products that are ultra-hydrating. However, I'm also acne-prone. Although this product didn't make me break out, I only use it over my entire face when I'm feeling extra dry or in need of a serious moisture boost - like when I opt to slug, for example. Otherwise, I usually use a more lightweight, everyday moisturizer, and then I put the Barrier Butter on places I would normally use an occlusive, like Aquaphor. Typically, it's around my nose and under my eyes. If I know I'm going to be wearing makeup for hours at a time, I usually start out with the brand's Peptide Glazing Fluid, and then layer on the Barrier Butter, which gives me glass skin - the perfect base for foundation. What to Consider Before Trying the Rhode Barrier Butter This product is on the thick side, so if your skin type is oily, I'd suggest using something more lightweight, like the brand's Barrier Restore Cream, as a daily moisturizer. Where Is the Rhode Barrier Butter Available? The Rhode Barrier Butter is available directly on the brand's website. Rating: Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
