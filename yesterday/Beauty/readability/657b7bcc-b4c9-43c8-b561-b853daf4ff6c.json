  "description": "Getty / WWD; Ulta. Every time I log into TikTok, I'm met with a new beauty product or hack that inevitably changes my life (and everyday look) for the better; a hidden hair-tie technique for a sleeker ponytail, a deodorant layering hack for all-day freshness, and most recently, a Billie Eilish-approved lip-stain trick that the star swears by for a plumper-looking pout - with video evidence to prove it. ICYMI: back in December of last year, the musician took to TikTok to give fans a glimpse of her concert makeup routine, where Eilish filmed herself getting ready for a show using a range of long-lasting beauty products, all designed to withstand even her sweatiest sets. There were the usual suspects - like a thick brow gel and a Maybelline eye liner that the star uses to create her signature, smoky eye look. But it's Eilish's lip regimen that's managed to garner the most attention online; her GRWM video now has more than 74 millions views and counting (casual). @billieeilish leave me alone i barely know what im doing but heres what works for me \u0026 what i do before every show on tour üíãüéÇüíåüéâüëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüéÑüôâ‚òïÔ∏è love you guys ‚ô¨ ilomilo - Billie Eilish In her TikTok video, Eilish focused on her lips for the final portion of her makeup routine, using the viral Sacheu Peel Off Lip Liner Stay-N ($12) to outline the edges of her pout before going back in with the Tower 28 OneLiner Lip Liner and Cheek Pencil ($15) to create a more exaggerated look. She then used a cotton pad to blot her lips, giving the illusion of a blurred, more muted coloring. The result was a fuller, plumper-looking pout that (presumably) lasts all night long; if the singer trusts this lip stain for a two-hour show, then you can definitely feel good using it in your everyday makeup routine or as a smudge-proof solution on your next date night.
