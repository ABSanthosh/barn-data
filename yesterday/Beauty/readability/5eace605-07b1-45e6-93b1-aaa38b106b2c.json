  "description": "It's safe to say that I've tested my fair share of beauty products. As someone who writes about different hacks, trends, and products on a daily basis, it comes with the territory. I'm usually more than happy to try out makeup and hair care, but when it comes to skin care, things get a little dicey. I have dry, acne-prone skin, and it's also reactive. If my face or body doesn't like something, it'll tell me within a few minutes of slathering it on - usually in the form of an angry red rash or something equally as jarring. The good news? Once I wash whatever product I've been testing off, the rash goes away, but it's still a little scary to experience in the moment. For this reason, I usually stick with products like moisturizers, sunscreens, and cleansers for years after I've found one I like. So, you can bet that if I move a new product into my everyday rotation, it's for a good reason. The latest addition to my routine? The Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream ($20). Keep scrolling to read my full review of the product and find out why it's landed a permanent spot in my medicine cabinet. About the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream This product is a lightweight moisturizer made for morning and nighttime use. It's best for acne-prone, combination, or oily skin. However, it's suitable for all skin types. The key ingredients include magnesium PCA and sodium PCA to hydrate and offer barrier protection, as well as zinc PCA to help calm skin. It's fragrance-free, cruelty-free, and vegan. What I Like About the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream I've been testing this moisturizer for almost a month, and I'm happy to say that, for starters, it didn't break me out or cause any irritation. On top of that, it goes on silky smooth, it isn't sticky, and it's great at calming redness (especially after a night of picking at my zits). I find that it's great to wear under makeup, and I haven't noticed any issues with pilling or weird patchy areas when layering foundation on top. Also, the packaging definitely needs an honorable mention. There's nothing I hate more than a moisturizer that comes in a tub because it requires me to dip my fingers into it, thereby spreading germs all over the place. This moisturizer comes in a pump form, which makes it super easy to dispense directly onto my fingers and then rub onto my face. I also like that it's fragrance-free, because occasionally my skin reacts poorly to fragranced products. How to Use the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream The brand recommends using this moisturizer in the morning or at night and massaging it into clean skin. I like to use this product in two ways. The first is in the morning after cleansing and patting my skin dry. I typically will apply a few serums, let them dry down, and then layer on this moisturizer. I then follow with sunscreen and makeup. I've found that this product is a little light for overnight use, especially on my dry skin, but I do like using it after I've picked at my skin. (I know, I know - I shouldn't be picking at my skin regardless, but there are quite a few nights where I find myself sitting in my bathroom sink and going ham on my pimples and blackheads.) I've found that if I wash my face and then slather on this moisturizer when I wake up in the morning, the damage isn't nearly as bad as I think it's going to be - most likely because of the zinc PCA that helps to reduce redness. What to Consider Before Trying the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream One thing to note is that this is a lightweight moisturizer. If you have extremely dry skin, the brand recommends opting for a product like the Cocokind Resurrection polypeptide Cream ($27), which is more suitable for anyone looking to seriously boost their skin's moisture levels. Where the Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream Is Available The Cocokind Electrolyte Water Cream is available directly on the brand's website.
