  "description": "A few weeks ago, it was brought to my attention that the one and only Hailey Bieber was possibly launching a lip liner. I was working, minding my own business, when one of my girlfriends sent me a screenshot of her Instagram Story holding what looked to be a Rhode lip pencil. If you know me personally, then you know I practically peed my pants with excitement because I have been waiting for this day for what feels like forever. Bieber (Hailey, not Justin - sorry, but I don't care about him) is my style icon, my makeup inspiration, and my hair goddess. I've loved (almost) every product she's launched, and I was hoping that this one would be no exception. When I got the official word about the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape ($24), I couldn't wait to get my hands on the product. I was counting down the days until it finally landed in my mailbox. And yes, I know I sound like I simp for Hailey, and truth be told, I kinda do - but I was ready to judge this product just like any other lippie in my rotation. Which is to say harshly, if need be. So, here we are. Keep scrolling to read my full review and find out if the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is worth the hype. About the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape This product is a contouring lip shaper with a creamy formula and easy-to-use twist-up applicator. It enhances the appearance and fullness of lips. The key ingredients include peptides to soften lips and fenugreek extract to enhance lip volume and firmness. It comes in 11 shades. It's fragrance-free, cruelty-free, gluten-free, and vegan. What I Like About the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape I tested three shades: Lift, Press, and Twist. Lift (a soft natural pink) and Press (a warm pinky mauve) are both similar to my natural lip color. Twist, on the other hand, is described as a warm taupe, and it looked fairly brown on my lips. All in all, I felt like all three shades that I tested were very natural and looked great. The actual product is a bit larger and has a more rounded shape than a traditional lip pencil. The texture is also a little creamier and thicker, which made applying it to my lips extremely easy. It reminded me more of a lip crayon than a pencil, but it still had great definition. It's a twist-up applicator, so you don't have to deal with sharpening it - a major bonus, in my opinion. How to Use the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape The brand recommends gliding the product along the outline of your lips and then taking the silicone smudger (built-in on the other end of the tube) to diffuse the shade or clean up the edges. I'm not a huge fan of over-lining my lips, so when I use this product, I opt to line my lips and then smudge it out with my finger. (I don't love the silicone smudger for blending because I think it removes too much product.) I like to follow it up with a little Aquaphor if I'm going for a more low-key look. Otherwise, I'll use a shiny gloss or my Rhode Peptide Lip Treatment directly on top. What to Consider Before Trying the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape The Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is one of the creamiest lip liner products I've tested. I love how smooth it goes on and how easy it is to blend. However, because it's so creamy, I do find that it doesn't last as long as I would like. My hack for fixing this is to make sure my lips are completely clean and free of product prior to applying, and then I like to take a tiny bit of translucent powder and dab it onto my mouth with a powder puff. From there, I apply my lip liner and then go over it with a lip gloss. Where the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape Is Available The Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is available directly on a brand's website.

From there, I apply my lip liner and then go over it with a lip gloss.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhere the Rhode Peptide Lip Shape Is Available\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eThe Rhode Peptide Lip Shape is available directly on a \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701743\u0026amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rhodeskin.com%2Fproducts%2Fpeptide-lip-shape-balance%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOop89hd0xBqBluCRIZt-B_WzuZEf2tMtj50M-pOjd8IRvdsfPr_k\u0026amp;xcust=___psv__p_49424828__t_w_\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer sponsored\"\u003ebrand\u0026#39;s website\u003c/a\u003e.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e ★★★★☆ \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.popsugar.com/author/renee-rodriguez\"\u003eRenee Rodriguez\u003c/a\u003e (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
