  "description": "I've been doing my makeup the same way for years - at least when it comes to concealer, bronzer, and blush - but even I started to second-guess my technique after every video (and I mean every video) on TikTok was telling me I was doing it the \"outdated\" way. According to the younger (read: cooler) crowd on the app, you're supposed to apply concealer only to the outer and inner corners of your eyes to give yourself an \"instant facelift.\" But it doesn't stop there - you're also supposed to apply your contour and blush on your cheekbones (as opposed to the hollows of your cheeks for bronzer and the apples for blush).
