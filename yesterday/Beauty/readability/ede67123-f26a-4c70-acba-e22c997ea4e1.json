  "description": "Europa Press via Getty Images/Ricardo Rubio Jennifer Lopez kicked off her return to touring by embracing \"castlecore\" nails - a maximalist, medieval-inspired manicure trend that's been gaining traction all year. The look, created by her longtime nail artist Tom Bachik for the opening night of her summer European tour Up All Night: Live in 2025, debuted on July 8 in Pontevedra, Spain. A few days later, Bachik shared close-up photos of the design on Instagram, calling them \"Hot Girl Nails for a #HotGirlSummer\" and listing the exact tools, charms, polish brands, and gel shades used to bring the set to life. Image Source: Instagram user tombachik The ornate manicure features burgundy and champagne tones with 3D crosses, sacred heart charms, synthetic ruby gemstones, an interlocking \"C\" detail (likely a nod to Chanel), and a New York Yankees logo in tribute to Lopez's home borough of the Bronx. \"One last look,\" Bachik wrote in a follow-up Instagram story, teasing the style just before Lopez took the stage. The design aligns with the growing castlecore-nail trend, which was named one of the top aesthetic movements in the Pinterest Predicts 2025 report. Interest in \"medieval core\" has risen by 110 percent, with gothic-inspired beauty looks - including nail art - gaining momentum across platforms like Instagram and TikTok. \"Castlecore nails are a new nail aesthetic inspired by one of Pinterest's biggest trends for 2025,\" nail technician Lyssa Moss previously said. The style often includes \"gothic motifs, antique designs, and regal gemstones.\" Olivia Aguirre, lead nail artist at C√¥te Beauty, emphasized the romantic aesthetic of the trend. \"Think muted, dreamy shades reminiscent of stone walls, antique tapestries, and candlelit halls,\" she said. \"These nails often feature delicate detailing, such as soft shimmer, matte finishes, or even subtle gold accents.\" Lopez joins a growing list of celebrities putting their own spin on the trend.

Cynthia Erivo has also been spotted in castlecore-inspired looks. From Instagram to center stage, castlecore nails are clearly having a moment, and Lopez's latest set makes a strong case for keeping them on your summer mood board.
