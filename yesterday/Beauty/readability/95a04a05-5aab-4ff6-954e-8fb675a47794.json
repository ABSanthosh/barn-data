  "description": "If scrunchies, banana eyeliner, and blush draping have taught us anything, it's that old things become new again in the beauty space - you just have to give them time. That's why we're not surprised the flipped hairstyle is making a huge comeback. Flipped hair has been around for decades - Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Priscilla Presley both wore the style back in the day - but the new hairstyle trend puts a modern spin on it. Instead of lots of volume at the crown of the head, this version features sleek, pin-straight hair with the ends curled up into a sharp C shape. \"Whether it's paired with a ponytail, half-up half-down, [or] all down with a side or middle part, I think it's such a fun way to spice up a sleek, straight look this spring,\" celebrity hairstylist Hayley Heckmann says. \"The style is super flattering on everyone and totally elevates a look.\" Experts Featured in This Article Hayley Heckmann is a celebrity hairstylist and Unite Hair Care brand partner. Devin Toth is a NYC-based hairstylist at Salon SCK. The Comeback of '60s Hairstyles: Flipped Hair We've seen the flipped hairstyle pop up a few times over the last couple of years, but it's gotten even more popular recently, thanks to celebrities and beauty-lovers on TikTok. Ariana Grande, Cardi B, Keke Palmer, Zendaya, and Jennifer Lopez have all rocked the retro look on more than one occasion, with each putting their own spin on it. If you need any further convincing, see Kim Kardashian's look for the 2025 Fifteen Percent Pledge Gala. \"The hair flip - where it's a bob haircut or long hair in a pony - gives a cooler-than-school, '60s retro vibe,\" hairstylist Devin Toth previously told PS. \"And who wouldn't want that?\" The retro look is fun and flirty for spring, and we're predicting there will be even more celebrities embracing the trend in the coming weeks as the weather warms up more.
