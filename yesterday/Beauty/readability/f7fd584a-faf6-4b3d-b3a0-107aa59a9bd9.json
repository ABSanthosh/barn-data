  "text": "Want to know if a product really works? Welcome to Slow Beauty. Since it can take up to six weeks to see results from using a new formula, we have testers try the best and buzziest in hair and skin care for double that amount of time to determine what actually makes a difference.My relationship to my hair didn’t used to be a complicated one. Growing up, my mane was my calling card: straight-ish brown strands, plentiful but thin in nature, that reached past my waist and were almost always tied into a low ponytail or, on special days, two low pigtails. During my preschool and kindergarten years, my dad was the one who would get me ready in the morning, and low ponytails were his speciality (read: the only hairstyle he could crank out consistently), and I continued the tradition into elementary school. I got my hair cut for the first time when I was 11 years old, a result of my general ambivalence about the whole thing. Of course, I went through periods of being in love with my hair straightener (tragic in retrospect) or my hair gel (tragic but make it crunchy), but it wasn’t until my 20s, and now 30s, that I started to become concerned. Did my hairline always look like that? And by that, I mean, dominated by a slightly off-center widow’s peak and lean patches on either side of said peak. According to my childhood photos, yes, this had always been the case. But, then again, had it? Had it gotten worse? More sparse over the years? Were the supposed changes due to stress? Hormones? The plight of getting older?Combine this, let’s say, unfortunately common thought spiral with our culture’s recent “outsize[d] focus on our scalps,” and it’s no wonder so many women are fixated on whether or not they’re losing their hair. I, personally, have found myself thinking about it quite often, feeling self-conscious to wear my hair in certain styles that might highlight my lack, and obsessing over whether this is something about myself I could conceivably change.So when I was offered the opportunity to try Vegamour’s GRO+ Advanced Hair Serum for 12 weeks, I was excited to give it a shot. According to my beauty editor comrades, Vegamour is a well-respected brand, and the serum in question purports to use plant-based phytoactives and peptides to boost scalp hydration; strengthen roots; target shedding and thinning; and improve hair density. In essence, Vegamour’s ingredients are meant to create a healthy environment, so that with long-term use, hair might grow—and also not fall out as easily. According to Vegamour’s website, I was to apply the product daily (“consistency is key”) and wait three months to start seeing results. Here’s what happened.Courtesy of VegamourCourtesy of VegamourCourtesy of VegamourDesign Courtesy of Leah RomeroThe author before and after using the serum for 12 weeks.Final ThoughtsDespite it being 12 weeks later, I’m still definitely in the early stages of my relationship with the Vegamour serum. Per the product’s website, you’re supposed to start seeing results around three to four months, and I’ve just recently hit the three-month mark. But to use the same metaphor, I’m happy to report that I’d like to keep dating this little guy. I found the serum quite easy to use; I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how the quick-drying formula doesn’t leave my hair greasy at all, meaning I can use it whenever it fits in my schedule best, and not the other way around.Personally, I’ve found assessing hair growth to be a challenging task. After staring at something every day, it can be easy to feel like your mind is playing tricks on you, similar to how it’s difficult to recognize a change in a loved one because you’re seeing them so often. My current read, and what I think these photos show, is that I’m seeing some growth and density, including new short baby hairs coming in. It’s not a shocking amount, but such things take time, so I’m more than willing to keep the experiment going.The serum is an investment at $78 a bottle, so if you’re also hoping to try, and you have the coin to spend, I would suggest going for the three-pack, which brings the price down to $66 a pop; after all, to hit three months, you’ll have to use a few bottles anyway. And if you see me on the street this summer, let’s compare hairlines.Vegamour GRO+ Advanced Hair Serum",
