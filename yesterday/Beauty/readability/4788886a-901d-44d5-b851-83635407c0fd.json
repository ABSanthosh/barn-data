  "description": "Now that season six of \"Glow Up\" on Netflix has come and gone, it has us reminiscing about the contestants from seasons one, two, three, four, and five who sent us into binge-watching mode in the first place and served tons of makeup inspiration along the way. Each individual brought their artistry to the next level during the show, but now that it's been a few years since we've seen them, we have some questions. Past \"Glow Up\" contestants: where are they now? What are they doing? Have any of them made it big? Many of us were completely captivated by the makeup masterpieces that we witnessed on season one of the show, and we've been blessed with five more rounds of contestants since. Each MUA - as Val Garland, judge and L'Oréal Paris global makeup director, calls them - was so talented that we can't help but wonder what they're up to now. Each season, we watch 10 artists face off and get eliminated one by one until one is dubbed the winner. The makeup artists on the show come from all different experience levels and backgrounds - some are retail assistants by day and makeup artists by night, others are students, and a few work professionally as MUAs for smaller brands and companies. What they all have in common is their deep passion for beauty and dream to make it big - but does it end up working out for them? We researched all the contestants from past \"Glow Up\" seasons (including the most recent) to see where they are now. Keep reading to find out for yourself.",
