  "description": "There's no gift that keeps on giving quite like a beauty Advent calendar. Instead of only getting the thrill of opening a present once on the day of the holiday, an Advent calendar allows you to experience that excitement over and over again for 12 to 31 days straight, depending on how big it is. If you're still unsure what to get the beauty lover in your life for the upcoming holiday season, an Advent calendar from one of their favorite brands will be a surefire win. Being able to count down to the holidays with different surprise products every day will remind them of when they were a kid. Brands like Kiehl's, MAC, Lush Cosmetics, E.l.f. Cosmetics, Charlotte Tilbury, and many more drop holiday collections every year, and the special calendars for 2024 are even better than last year. Not to mention, some of your favorite beauty retailers like Sephora, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bloomingdale's, and more have come out with their own Advent calendars filled with goodies from a variety of the brands they carry. Those are the best bet if you're not sure exactly what product assortment your loved one would like best. There are beauty Advent calendars filled with skin-care, makeup, hair, body-care, and nail goodies - or a combination of all of the above - to dive into. No matter what your price range is, you have options. Some luxury options can go for more than $500, while affordable drugstore sets have a more modest price tag. Ahead, we rounded up a few of the best beauty Advent calendars of 2024 to shop for this year. Related: Our 2024 Holiday Gift Guide Has Arrived! Shop Gifting Ideas From PS Editors",
