  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes I think it's safe to say that Hailey Bieber has made a serious name for herself in the beauty space. After Rhode was acquired by E.l.f. for a whopping $1 billion, she's truly become the queen of glowing skin - a billion-dollar queen. And yes, our editors stand behind Rhode. I mean, have you tried the Barrier Butter? And let's not even talk about our obsession with the Peptide Lip Treatment. Knowing her skincare brand is top-tier and her recommendations are usually spot on (this eye mask is supposed to be amazing), I decided to take a cue from her rec book. Bieber recently posted on her Instagram Stories about her love for the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil ($38), mixed with the Naturium Glow Getter Multi-Oil Body Butter, calling it her \"go-to body combo.\" So consider me influenced. I'm a Belieber . . . when it comes to anything Hailey recommends. And after testing this body oil for a solid few weeks, you guessed it: I'm sold. Actually, more than sold - I'll definitely be repurchasing. About the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil This product is a skincare-infused body oil, crafted with oil-soluble Vitamin C, ectoin, squalane, and antioxidant-rich oils. It promises to deliver luminous, even-toned skin without any greasy residue. Bieber uses the Vanilla Verve scent, but it's also available in Naked Neroli and Sacred Santal. What I Like About the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes As someone who loves the sun, keeping my skin hydrated is a non-negotiable. I'm outside constantly - whether I'm working (yes, I wrote this article under the sun), going for a run, or walking to my favorite restaurant or sunset spot, the outdoors gets a lot of face time with me. That's why I take my skincare seriously - not just for my face, but for my whole body. I look for nourishing, hydrating products that actually improve texture, not just sit on the surface. Enter: this body oil. I've tried my fair share of body oils over the years, but this one? It's become a staple. What sets it apart? For starters, it's not greasy like so many others. It sinks in beautifully and is packed with ingredients that truly support the skin. Think: multiple plant oils for deep hydration, Vitamin C for brightness, and Ectoin to help protect against environmental stressors. Oh, and the Vanilla Verve scent? It's divine - warm, subtle, and sweet without being overpowering. I get compliments on it every single time I wear it. And if that's not enough, Hailey Bieber herself says she's been using it since she was pregnant. Consider me fully convinced. How to Use the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil Image Source: PS Photography | Haley Lyndes When it comes to using this oil, it couldn't be easier. Just pump out as much as you need to cover your body. If I'm showing my legs, I'll apply a bit there to enhance texture and add a dewy glow. But if I'm just lounging in pants, I'll stick to a light layer on my arms and chest. According to Cyklar's website, the best results come from applying it right after a shower, while your skin is still damp. So if you're in the mood for a post-shower lather that leaves your skin soft and radiant, this is one of your best bets. I've tried it both ways and honestly think it works great either way - even when I'm rushing out the door last minute. What to Consider Before Trying the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil While it definitely leaves your skin with a lit-from-within radiant glow, there's no shimmer or visibly glowy ingredient in the formula. The finish is very natural - almost subtly so. I love it for that reason, but if you're looking for something that noticeably enhances the look of your skin with visible shine or sparkle, you might want to opt for a different product (like this Summer Friday's one). Where to Buy the Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil The Cyklar Vitamin C Body Oil is available directly on the brand's website or on Amazon.
