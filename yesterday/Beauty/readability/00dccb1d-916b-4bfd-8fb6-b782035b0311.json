  "description": "I always try to pack minimally, and I can attribute this to one thing: a fateful (maybe traumatic?) pass through Heathrow security. I - plus a full-sized foundation and mini body lotion - fell victim to the airport's strictly enforced one clear-bag policy. And since that day, I've kept my eyes peeled for new ways to cut down on the number of liquids in my carry-on and declutter my makeup bag. One makeup product I came across that could seemingly address both of those concerns is Subtl Beauty's portable makeup Subtl Staks ($36). The makeup kit comes with almost everything you'd need to apply makeup on the go - a mirror flip-top, makeup compacts of your choice, and a brush base. Plus, all the makeup products are available in a cream or powder formula that can bypass that dreaded liquids policy. It seemed like the perfect way to keep my makeup routine in one place no matter where I was going - on a trip, to the gym, or just a night out. So, of course, when given the opportunity, I had to try it out. Check out my review of a Subtl Beauty Stak ahead and see why it's become one of my favorite products. About the Subtl Beauty Stak Subtl Beauty's custom and premade makeup Staks feature a variety of products and shades. Products include: cream concealers, lip and cheek duos, shine control pressed powders, cream highlighters, eyeshadow duos, bronzers, powder blushes, powder highlighters, and lip balms. Staks come in individually packaged, stackable layers. To assemble the tower, screw the mirror layer, makeup layers, and brush layers together. The makeup products are cruelty-free, vegan, gluten-free, fragrance-free, and paraben-free. What I Like About the Subtl Beauty Stak First and foremost, I was impressed by how pigmented the products in my Stak were. My premade Subtl Stak was part of the brand's Road Trip collection, which featured a powder highlighter in Golden Gimlet (a shimmery golden nude), a lip and cheek duo in Guava Getaway (a rosy brown), and powder blush in Apricot Avenue (a soft peachy pink) - and all the shades appeared on my skin with just a few light swipes from a brush or my fingertips. A little went a long way with each of these products, but especially that lip and cheek duo, which I layered under the powdered blush. This color combination made for a very glowy but naturally sunkissed look that I'd sport even in the winter. The quality of the makeup definitely stood up to my full-sized favorites, but what I loved most was how easy it was to throw in my carry-on, gym bag, or even a small shoulder bag. With my fingertips and the brush that came in the little tower, I felt like I could touch up or apply my makeup just about anywhere. I also went from toting eight separate products in my toiletry bag to five - which left only three liquid makeup products in my bag (a tinted moisturizer, mascara, and brow gel) and freed up space for other important liquids like SPF or body lotion. Overall, the Stak was the convenient, space-saving, and travel-friendly solution I was looking for. (Note: The Road Trip collection is sold out, but the individual shades listed above are still available to include in personalized Staks.) What to Consider Before Trying a Subtl Beauty Stak I went for a premade Stak, but personally found myself wanting to order more layers after using it a few times. For that reason, I recommend taking the quiz on Subtl Beauty's site to figure out what stack configuration makes the most sense for you. However, you can always add more products to your Stak later. I had a blush, highlighter, and cheek and lip duo in my original premade tower, but later decided to add a bronzer layer to better complete my face makeup routine. It's also worth noting that not every product can make it into your Stak. If you're like me, you'll probably find yourself packing a tinted moisturizer, brow gel, mascara, and an eyelash curler to complement it. But that's OK with me because the Stak helps to declutter my makeup bag considerably anyway. Who a Subtl Beauty Stak Is Best For Subtl Beauty's makeup Staks are great for anyone doing their makeup on the go. Instead of toting multiple products around, you can keep most everything in one little tower. It's also great for travelers, especially those who prefer to travel with a carry-on and need to cut down the number of liquids in their bag. Where Is the Subtl Beauty Stak Available? You can create a personalized Stak on the brand's site or shop premade staks on Amazon.
