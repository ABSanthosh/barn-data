  "description": "The sardine trend has exploded on social media in the past few weeks. The aesthetic captures a unique summer vibe that's reminiscent of an Amalfi Coast vacation. It transports you to a yacht in Italy, Aperol Spritz in hand, taking you away from where you actually are. We've seen clothing and accessories littered with fish iconography, but now, the trend has made its way to our fingertips with \"fishing lure\" nails. According to Molly Runty, a nail artist who recently crafted a set like this for her clients, this trend is \"inspired by real fishing lures, featuring colorful, shiny, iridescent finishes to create an eye-catching appeal.\" The trend is the perfect summer accessory and a great way to get in on the fun if you don't feel like stocking up on bags and tank tops with sardines on them (though we're big supporters of doing both). Ahead, get inspiration for your own fishing lure nails for summer, with options ranging from short natural sets to extra-long extensions. Plus, you'll find expert tips from Runty on how to achieve this look.",
