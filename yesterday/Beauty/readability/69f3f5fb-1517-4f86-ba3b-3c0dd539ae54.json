  "text": "Simone Ashley has had an eventful few years. Since her breakout role as Kate Sharma in season 2 of Bridgerton in 2022, the actress’s career has exploded. This past March, Ashley starred alongside Hero Fiennes Tiffin in the romantic comedy Picture This, where she played a struggling photographer trying to balance her career and her love life. Now, she is switching gears—pun intended—as she prepares for the highly anticipated release of F1, a sports action movie about two Formula 1 drivers, set to release this summer. Even with such a busy schedule, Ashley manages to show up on every red carpet looking flawless. This year’s Cannes Film Festival was no different. She arrived, styled in a white Vivienne Westwood gown, for the premiere of The Mastermind. At the festival, Ashley also acted as a spokesperson for L’Oréal Paris’s Lights on Women’s Worth Awards, her second year as an ambassador for the program. Below, ELLE caught up with Ashley for a few minutes after her red carpet appearances to talk skin care, Cannes glam, and her go-to beauty rituals.JB Lacroix//Getty ImagesSimone Ashley at the 2025 Cannes Film Festival closing ceremonyWhat is your current skin care and beauty routine?I exfoliate a few times a week, hydrate, drink lots of water, moisturize, and try not to stress.Name one product that you couldn’t live without.A moisturizer!When you aren’t on set, what is your go-to beauty look?Actually, I don’t really make much of an effort when I’m not working. I can’t really be bothered. I just put my sunglasses on.Do you have any beauty rituals that you swear by?Exfoliating. That works for me, though. I think everything is personal and subjective for different people. For me personally, it’s [exfoliating] and rest.What was it like getting ready for Cannes?I am so lucky to have my team here with me. Alex Babsky, my makeup artist, always makes me feel so confident in myself. Stephane [Lancien], who’s been doing my hair—he’s just amazing. You’re in the upcoming F1 movie. What was filming like?That was crazy. I have a very small part, but I’m grateful to be in that movie. I got to experience many Grands Prix. I don’t think I’ll ever do anything like that again. As a woman of color in the film industry, how does it feel to be working with L’Oréal and their Lights on Women’s Worth Awards? Why do you think programs like this are so important and impactful?It’s an honor. I feel very proud. At the awards dinner, Viola [Davis] did a speech. I’m so grateful that she’s an ambassador for this brand. Though I’m inspired by everyone, seeing Viola made me feel so seen, like I am capable of doing it.This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.",
