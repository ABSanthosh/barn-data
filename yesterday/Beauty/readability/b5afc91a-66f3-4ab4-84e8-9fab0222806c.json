  "description": "Ever since making a memorable cameo in the Disney sitcom \"The Suite Life on Deck\" in 2010, Zoey Deutch has been steadily building a robust résumé that showcases her versatility as an actor. The year 2024, in particular, was a big one for the star thanks to her Broadway debut in \"Our Town,\" which she says has been a long-time dream for years. But that's not all, the actor also celebrated her 30th birthday this year, meaning it's time for Deutch's tattoo collection to grow, yet again. In 2022 during an appearance on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live,\" Deutch shared that she got her first piece of ink at the age of 20 and has since added more designs to her collection every year. She also offered the reasoning behind most of her tattoo placements, which are all located below the knee. \"Every year for my birthday, I like to get a tattoo; that's my present to myself, but I do it ankle down,\" she said. \"It's ankle down, so that, you know, when I'm working and on set, I don't have to spend a lot of time covering them up.\" In an appearance on the talk show \"Today With Hoda \u0026 Jenna, Deutch revealed the next design she plans on getting for her milestone birthday, which was on Nov. 10. \"It's a big symbol in 'Our Town' for Emily Webb, and I'm going to get a sunflower.\" From her zodiac symbol tattoo to the designs that solidify her proud pet parent status, keep reading for a breakdown of all of Deutch's eight known tattoos so far, along with the inspiration behind them.",
