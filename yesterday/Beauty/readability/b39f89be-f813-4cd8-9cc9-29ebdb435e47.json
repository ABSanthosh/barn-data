  "text": "Before Brittani Frederick, a 39-year-old realtor from Sioux Falls, South Dakota, booked her first appointment with Milan Laser Hair Removal, she had been shaving her legs and underarms every day for the past 25-plus years—with less than ideal results. “I would shave in the morning, and by the end of the day, you could see my dark stubble again,” she says. Never achieving truly smooth skin made her feel self-conscious, especially during the summer. Then she heard about Milan Laser Hair Removal.“I had a friend who had gone, and she raved about it,” she says. After going in for a free consultation, Frederick ended up booking both underarm and Brazilian treatments. The first session alone decreased her hair significantly, she says: “A few months later, I barely had to shave at all. As someone with really thick hair, it’s been life-changing.”The ProcessAccording to Amy Ringgenberg, the manager of the Sioux Falls clinic, Milan Laser Hair Removal education is a key pillar of the company. “When clients come in for a consultation, we want to build a rapport and find out what’s really bringing them in,” she says. “For some it might be because they’re sick of shaving, but others may have folliculitis or a hormonal condition like PCOS, or be experiencing skin irritation from razor burn and ingrown hairs that can make it painful to walk. We want to make them feel comfortable and tailor an experience and package for them.”At her consultation, Frederick learned about hair growth cycles, how long she would have to wait between each laser session (five to seven weeks), and how many sessions it would take for her hair to disappear completely (between 5 and 12). She ended up completing six sessions total over a year.One thing that surprised her was how quick the sessions were: Her underarms took about five minutes, while the Brazilian took 10. She was also happy to find both were painless. “It feels like being snapped by a small rubber band,” she says. According to Ringgenberg, the laser technology the company uses is safe and effective for all skin tones and types. Frederick’s providers used cooling air technology as they administered the laser to calm her skin during the process, and they offered her stress balls to squeeze if she needed them. “There’s no pain afterward either, so you could even go over a lunch break,” she adds.The Results“My skin is now dolphin-level smooth,” Frederick says. “My confidence is so much better, and getting ready for work every day isn’t as exhausting—not having to shave has helped me cut down my routine immensely.” And her reaction is typical: Ringgenberg says most clients tell her their only regret is not having invested in laser hair removal sooner. The MaintenanceIt’s been four years since her initial treatments, and only now is Frederick going back for small touch-ups on her underarms. Ringgenberg notes that factors like age and hormones can cause hair to grow back in some cases—but Milan Laser Hair Removal’s Unlimited Package, which covers any number of treatments forever, makes booking these appointments less of a financial strain. “At other clinics, you can purchase packages that get you, like, five treatments,” she says. “At Milan, you get to use the service for a lifetime.” Next UpThis winter, Frederick plans to finally get laser hair removal on her legs. “My legs take the most time to shave,” she says. “As a mom of young children, I don’t have much free time—I’m always trying to get everyone else ready. So it will be fantastic to not have to worry about yet another task. I cannot wait.”",
