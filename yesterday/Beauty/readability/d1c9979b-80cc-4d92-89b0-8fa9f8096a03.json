  "description": "Welcome to Refinery29 Loves, the monthly news bulletin where you’ll find the best things to shop and see in fashion and beauty right now.With our Halloween outfits and vampy makeup locked away for another year, our heads are now firmly turning towards the practical parts of our wardrobe that work for all weather eventualities. Think striped sweaters, blanket scarves, and heavy-duty boots. But staying warm doesn’t mean dressing like you’re about to climb a mountain.This season, plenty of It Girls are inspiring our freezing fashion looks for the winter months ahead. For those seeking a chic and refined look, the Olsen twins remain superior thanks to their arsenal of tailored coats, turtlenecks, and classic loafers. If you want a cozier option, Katie Holmes is an ideal reference point for slouchy cardigans, well-fitting jeans, and low-heeled leather boots. A more elevated approach would be Taylor Russell, our inspo for all-out cold-girl glamor with caramel-colored coats, faux fur scarves, and gold statement jewelry. Then there’s makeup, and it’s safe to say that we’re embracing all things warm and glossy. Hailey Bieber is leading the mood board with a pumpkin spice-inspired lip and glowy peach cheeks. And for hair makeovers, we can’t take our eyes off Rihanna’s curls, dyed a very seasonal shade of autumn leaf. To uncover all the new fashion and beauty launches that are giving us even more inspiration this November, click through the slideshow ahead…Disney x Lululemon Good vibes await courtesy of the new Disney x Lululemon collab, which finds your favorite comfy pieces from the activewear brand adorned with playful Mickey Mouse motifs.

For the collection, the Noah team dug into Barbour’s archives and reimagined popular styles from the ’80s. There’s the unisex Wool Bedale Jacket, which features a corduroy collar and is made with Casentino wool (a fuzzy fabric dating back to the 14th century); the Cotton Bedale, with the same silhouette but in a salt-washed cotton canvas; and the Border Jacket, a longer tweed style. “For this season’s Barbour collection, we stuck to the classic jacket shapes we’ve always loved from them,” Noah founder Brendon Babenzien said in a press release. “Barbour jackets, more than any other, have a timeless quality that allows them to get passed down from one generation to the next.” The Noah x Barbour collab is available to shop now.Shop now at Noah and BarbourNoah x Barbour Wool Teddy Bedale Jacket, $, available at NoahMerit Retrospect Extrait de ParfumMerit is well loved for its beautifully crafted makeup products and now the brand is expanding into the fragrance space with a vanilla and crisp pear perfume.

Formulated as a highly concentrated extrait de parfum (with almost 30% fragrance oil), the scent promises a long wear of over 12 hours.Shop now at Merit BeautyMerit Retrospect L’Extrait de Parfum, $, available at MeritRouje x MissomaIn a romantic collaboration of Paris and London design, the new Rouje x Missoma jewelry collection is a color-lover’s dream.
