  "description": "For many, the start of a new year signifies a clean slate, a fresh start, and an overall opportunity to reset, both personally and professionally. However, for the beauty enthusiast, the new year is a time to establish new skin-care objectives and glow up. With this fresh start, it's not uncommon to want to redefine your current beauty routines and take the time to explore new products, techniques, tips, and trends in hopes of achieving the best skin possible. In the world of beauty in 2024, many of us fell in love with the \"no volume\" filler Sculptra (it was like getting eight hours of sleep injected into your face), opted to put some bizarre stuff on our faces in the name of beauty (we're looking at you, salmon sperm facials), and got creative with how we used fan-favorite treatments (don't even get us started on the genius that is scalp Botox injections). Curious about what 2025 has in store for our beauty routines? We've chatted with a few beauty pros to get the scoop on the skin-care trends that'll be all over your social media feeds next year. Experts Featured in This Article Alec Batis is the CEO and chemist cofounder of Sweet Chemistry. Lucy Goff is the founder of LYMA. Shani Darden is a celebrity aesthetician and founder of the brand Shani Darden Skin Care. Howard Sobel, MD, is a clinical attending dermatologic surgeon at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and the founder of Sobel Skin. Upcycled Ingredients As environmental consciousness grows, there's a rising trend in repurposing what was once considered waste into valuable ingredients that offer multiple benefits while helping consumers reduce their environmental impact. \"Upcycled ingredients have been gaining significant traction and will continue to evolve through 2025 and beyond, especially as processing technologies advance,\" Alec Batis, CEO and chemist cofounder of Sweet Chemistry, says. \"The next generation's perception of waste reduction as a form of 'prestige' will be a key driver in this movement.\" Continued Peptide Growth Peptides emerged as the holy grail skin-care ingredient in 2023 and maintained their prominence throughout 2024. Prestigious brands, from Lancôme to Glow Recipe, capitalized on this trend. According to Batis, \"Peptides are having an evolution. The industry had previously been using the same peptide supplier offerings for over two decades, but now there is a focus on developing new ones that can help boost collagen and elastin production and improve skin elasticity, pliability, and firmness.\" Epigenetic Skin Care Our skin, in its infinite wisdom and connection to our DNA, is quite the chatty Cathy when it comes to telling us about our skin-care issues, particularly as we age. The skin-care industry is riding the wave of this chatter, with brands popping up left, right, and center to address those surface-level concerns of epigenetic aging. But remember folks, beauty isn't just a surface sport - it's truly skin-deep. Lucy Goff, founder of LYMA, has developed ground-breaking epigenetic skin science that is able to treat the root causes of aging, not just the superficial signs. \"Our skin care has the highest concentration of active ingredients, hand-picked for their ability to reverse or slow down the causes of skin aging,\" Goff says. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sakura | 青木さくら (@shitskinchat) LED Light Therapy It's no secret that LED masks have been a big deal these last few years, and they will continue to reign supreme in 2025. If you're looking to treat hyperpigmentation, moderate acne, or target fine lines and wrinkles, celebrity aesthetician and brand founder Shani Darden agrees that LED light therapy is for you. \"The initial investment can be a little expensive, but over time, it will save money because of the results it produces in keeping skin youthful and glowing,\" Darden says. \"An LED mask is the perfect device to get pro-level anti-aging and skin-clearing benefits at home.\" LED Light Therapy is still keeping its momentum as we approach the new year, particularly in the field of hair growth solutions. Many brands that are trusted for face masks have created helmet or hat versions of their science to allow customers to reap the benefits of red light therapy for the scalp, too. Preventive Botox The trend of getting Botox or a type of neurotoxin before you actually need it is seemingly here to stay in the name of prevention or prejuvenation. According to dermatologist and brand founder Howard Sobel, MD, there is a \"tremendous demand for preventative skin care and Botox among Gen Z patients.\" Gen Z is embracing all types of skin-care treatments and advances that help prevent wrinkles and pigmentation, keeping their skin looking bright and clear.
