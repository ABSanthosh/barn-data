  "description": "I've only applied magnetic lashes once because eyeliner and I don't usually go together - at least not yet. Every time I try, my hands seem to have a mind of their own, and I end up getting frustrated and giving up. And let's not even talk about using glue to apply lashes. All my friends keep telling me that practice makes perfect, but the perfectionist in me wants to get it right on the first try, and that hasn't been the case. When I had the opportunity to review Glamnetic's viral magnetic lashes, I knew this was the push I needed to finally learn how to apply eyeliner. I tested four magnetic lashes - Glamnetic's Virgo Lashes ($30), VIP Lashes ($30), Venus Lashes ($30), Baby Girl Lashes ($30) - and I also used the brand's Magnetic Eyeliner Pen ($38) in black. I did try applying the eyeliner and lashes on my own, and while my application was messy, the lashes held up pretty well and they looked better than I expected. So, for all the girlies who struggle with applying lashes or eyeliner, this one's for you. Keep scrolling to read my full review of Glamnetic's Magnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Pen. About Glamnetic's Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen The lashes are made from a vegan-friendly synthetic fiber. The lashes come with a special magnetic case for safe-keeping. The magnetic liner is sold separately. There are a range of lashes to choose from, depending on if you like a more natural everyday lash or if you want a more dramatic look. There are two magnetic liners to choose from: black and brown. What I Like About Glamnetic's Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen First and foremost, even though they're magnetic, the lashes slide into place after a little maneuvering to get them exactly where you want them. I didn't expect them to feel as secure as they did. I also appreciated that with some of the lashes I received, there was a small eyelash anchor included for added security. It's a small cluster lash that you can place on the underside of your magnetic lashes to secure them even more. Although I didn't try it because the lashes felt secure enough to me, I appreciated the thoughtfulness behind that addition. I also liked how natural all the lashes looked. Once they were on, I couldn't tell they were magnetic - and that's the beauty of the product. Honestly, that's what sold me! It was such a seamless process, despite my being a beginner at eyeliner. I also loved how you could easily switch out the lashes if you wanted to try a new set. In the past, when I've worn lashes with glue, I dreaded removing them. But with magnetic lashes, you literally just pull them off, and there's no damage done to your natural lashes. How To Use the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen First, shake the magnetic eyeliner pen to ensure the tip is saturated with product. Then, apply the liner to your upper lash line. I didn't do a winged eyeliner, but that's up to you on whatever your personal preference is. Next, grab the magnetic lash of your choice and place it along the area where you applied the eyeliner. Position it as close to your natural lashes as possible to ensure a seamless look. If you notice a gap between your natural lashes and the magnetic lash, pull them down and adjust to your liking. What To Consider Before Trying the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen Honestly, the only reservations I had about trying the magnetic lashes and eyeliner was the eyeliner. Because I'm very much a beginner, I assumed that it would be hard to get the lashes to attach to my shoddy liner job after I tried them on my own - but that wasn't the case at all. Who Is the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen Best For I think I've proven that it's best for anyone looking to try out magnetic lashes, no matter your skill level! If you're someone who loves a 10- or 15-minute makeup routine and thinks applying lashes the traditional way (using glue) would take up too much of your time, then Glamnetic lashes are definitely for you. And if you're a seasoned pro, they'll be a breeze to put on. Rating:",

while my application was messy, the lashes held up pretty well and they looked better than I expected. So, for all the girlies who struggle with applying lashes or eyeliner, this one\u0026#39;s for you.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\"\u003eKeep scrolling to read my full review of Glamnetic\u0026#39;s Magnetic Eyelashes and Magnetic Eyeliner Pen. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eAbout Glamnetic\u0026#39;s Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"false\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe lashes are made from a vegan-friendly synthetic fiber. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe lashes come with a special magnetic case for safe-keeping.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe magnetic liner is sold separately.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are a range of lashes to choose from, depending on if you like a more natural everyday lash or if you want a more dramatic look.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThere are two magnetic liners to choose from: black and brown. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat I Like About Glamnetic\u0026#39;s Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eFirst and foremost, even though they\u0026#39;re magnetic, the lashes slide into place after a little maneuvering to get them exactly where you want them. I didn\u0026#39;t expect them to feel as secure as they did. I also appreciated that with some of the lashes I received, there was a small eyelash anchor included for added security. It\u0026#39;s a small cluster lash that you can place on the underside of your magnetic lashes to secure them even more. Although I didn\u0026#39;t try it because the lashes felt secure enough to me, I appreciated the thoughtfulness behind that addition.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"7\"\u003eI also liked how natural all the lashes looked. Once they were on, I couldn\u0026#39;t tell they were magnetic — and that\u0026#39;s the beauty of the product. Honestly, that\u0026#39;s what sold me! It was such a seamless process, despite my being a beginner at eyeliner. I also loved how you could easily switch out the lashes if you wanted to try a new set.  In the past, when I\u0026#39;ve worn lashes with glue, I dreaded removing them. But with magnetic lashes, you literally just pull them off, and there\u0026#39;s no damage done to your natural lashes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"4\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/mI3yHas97-OJRecjcHax6q_uxN4=/fit-in/792x1056/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/10/15/879/n/1922153/tmp_oMreyB_a9992918067b165a_VIRGOLASHES_V2_1_.jpg\" width=\"792\" height=\"1056\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/mI3yHas97-OJRecjcHax6q_uxN4=/fit-in/792x1056/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/10/15/879/n/1922153/tmp_oMreyB_a9992918067b165a_VIRGOLASHES_V2_1_.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/_6K6zsYFi0GMq4G17sOWZempBYE=/fit-in/1584x2112/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2024/10/15/879/n/1922153/tmp_oMreyB_a9992918067b165a_VIRGOLASHES_V2_1_.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePS Photography | Shari Straker\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"5\" data-element-has-beginning-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow To Use the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"1\"\u003eFirst, shake the magnetic eyeliner pen to ensure the tip is saturated with product. Then, apply the liner to your upper lash line. I didn\u0026#39;t do a winged eyeliner, but that\u0026#39;s up to you on whatever your personal preference is. Next, grab the magnetic lash of your choice and place it along the area where you applied the eyeliner. Position it as close to your natural lashes as possible to ensure a seamless look. If you notice a gap between your natural lashes and the magnetic lash, pull them down and adjust to your liking.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"2\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat To Consider Before Trying the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"3\"\u003eHonestly, the only reservations I had about trying the magnetic lashes and eyeliner was the eyeliner. Because I\u0026#39;m very much a beginner, I assumed that it would be hard to get the lashes to attach to my shoddy liner job after I tried them on my own — but that wasn\u0026#39;t the case at all. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWho Is the Glamnetic Magnetic Eyelashes + Magnetic Eyeliner Pen Best For\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\"\u003eI think I\u0026#39;ve proven that it\u0026#39;s best for anyone looking to try out magnetic lashes, no matter your skill level! If you\u0026#39;re someone who loves a 10- or 15-minute makeup routine and thinks applying lashes the traditional way (using glue) would take up too much of your time, then Glamnetic lashes are definitely for you. And if you\u0026#39;re a seasoned pro, they\u0026#39;ll be a breeze to put on.   \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRating:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"7\"\u003e★★★★☆\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/article\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
