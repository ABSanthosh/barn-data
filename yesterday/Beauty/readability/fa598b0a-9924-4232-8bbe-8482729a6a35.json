  "description": "About once a month, I look in the mirror and have a meltdown about my hair. Whether it's because of the grays that seem to pop up overnight, the damage that happens from using too many hot tools, or the fact that it seems thinner than ever, I'm usually pretty stressed about my hair. I've been trying to take better care of it, but as I've gotten older, I've definitely noticed some changes. I've tried supplements but I haven't found one that works yet, and I'm still in the process of testing hair oiling routines and other topical solutions. I've always been a fan of LED therapy, especially in the form of LED face masks, so when I learned that you can use similar tech for hair growth, I immediately wanted to try it. The one I kept seeing all over my social media? The CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet ($859). It's clinically proven to increase your hair growth rate by 128 percent in 12 weeks, as well as increase hair count by 33 percent in 16 weeks. That was enough to get me to use it almost every day for the last few months. Keep scrolling to learn more about the device and hear my honest thoughts. About the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet This product is a helmet-shaped LED device that promises to increase hair's growth rate. It comes in two sizes: small-medium (21.3in-23.2in) and medium-large (23.3in-25in). It's hands-free and meant to be worn for 10 minutes daily. It emits red light at 620 to 660nm and is FDA cleared. The device comes with a USB charging cord, as well as a base that it can rest on when not in use. The helmet has built-in speakers that connect to Bluetooth and can be used to play music or listen to a podcast while you sit through your treatment. What I Like About the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet My favorite thing about this product is how easy it is to work into my daily routine. It doesn't need to be charged very often, and it's easy to grab at any point during the day and wear while I'm doing other activities. Since I sit at a computer all day, it's easy to wear while I'm working - I usually skip it if I'm on video, though (for obvious reasons). I've been using the helmet fairly consistently for the last few months, and while I haven't noticed much hair growth just yet, I am experiencing less shedding. Because it's so simple, I plan on continuing to use this product paired with other hair growth treatments. How to Use the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet Prior to using the device for the first time, the brand recommends that you charge it for two and a half to three hours until it is fully charged. It also recommends doing a light sensitivity test by placing the device on your head for three minutes and then checking the area to make sure you don't have any reactions. Other than that, using it is fairly simple. All you need to do is slip it on over your head, turn on the device, and wear it for 10 minutes a day. I find that it's easy to wear around the house while I'm doing activities as long as I don't need to lie back or tilt my head too far forward. I typically wear it in the morning while I'm working from home, or I'll put it on at night when I'm watching TV or reading before bed. I also use it when my scalp is clean and dry without any product. What to Consider Before Trying the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet The brand states that you should start to see results (dependent on your hair growth cycle) in six to eight weeks. If you don't, they offer a four-month money-back guarantee. One thing I've noticed when using this device is that occasionally, the suction cups that are built into the helmet get stuck in my hair when I go to remove it from my head. It's not a huge deal - it just means I have to be patient when removing it to ensure I don't pull any of my hair out. Is the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet Worth the Splurge? This LED helmet is pricey, but in my opinion it's worth the splurge specifically because of the four-month money-back guarantee. If you find that it doesn't work for you or fit into your lifestyle for some reason, you're able to return it and get your money back. Where Is the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet Available? The CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet is available directly on the brand's website. Rating: Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.

If you don\u0026#39;t, they offer a four-month money-back guarantee.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"4\"\u003eOne thing I\u0026#39;ve noticed when using this device is that occasionally, the suction cups that are built into the helmet get stuck in my hair when I go to remove it from my head. It\u0026#39;s not a huge deal — it just means I have to be patient when removing it to ensure I don\u0026#39;t pull any of my hair out.  \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"5\" data-element-has-ending-title=\"true\"\u003e\u003ch2\u003eIs the CurrentBody LED Hair Growth Helmet Worth the Splurge?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"6\"\u003eThis LED helmet is pricey, but in my opinion it\u0026#39;s worth the splurge specifically because of the four-month money-back guarantee.
