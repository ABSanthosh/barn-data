  "description": "Image Source: Getty/ROBYN BECK/AFP There is but one lingering question that comes to mind post-Taylor Swift's many appearances (whether Eras Tour or NFL-related), and that is about her red lipstick. Google searches for the exact hue she wears reportedly jumped 669 percent after she was first spotted at the Kansas City Chiefs game at the start of the season 2023 - and fan tweets are alive and well today, from the \"not me wearing red lipstick again\" to the \"TAYLOR IF YOU DON'T RELEASE A RED LIPSTICK LINE IN MY LIFETIME ILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU\" - which can only confirm one thing: the people want answers. It's a happy coincidence that the Chiefs's signature color is red, supplying Swift with ample opportunities to wear the shade while cheering alongside Donna Kelce and friends, as she did for the AFC Championship on Jan. 26. The more complicated reality is that Swift has been wearing red lipstick since the moment she hit the music scene - the one constant in this ever-changing world, if you will - meaning she's had a number of favorites on rotation over the years. There's MAC Ruby Woo ($23), the classic shade she confirmed she loved to People in 2015. There's also the Nars Matte Lip Pencil in Dragon Girl ($30), which has been a staple for the star for years. Image Source: Getty/David Eulitt/Stringer These days, according to her most recent makeup artist, the one and only Pat McGrath, the star has been wearing the LiquiLust Legendary Wear Matte Lipstick ($34) in Elson 4 from McGrath's eponymous brand, Pat McGrath Labs. The formula is also editor-approved and promises to be smudgeproof, which, if you've been watching video footage of that \"Tayvis\" kiss in Argentina on repeat (and let's be real: who isn't?) you'll know this fact is of the utmost importance. While the LiquiLust Matte Lipstick tends to be out of stock - hello, \"Swiftie effect\" - we've tested the brand's Dramatique Mega Lip Pencil ($29) in Elson 6, which is a solid alternative with a similar color payoff. (You can read our full review here, and it was also awarded a PS Beauty Award.) Otherwise, in the past Swift's longtime makeup artist Lorrie Turk has also shared a handful of red lipstick favorites that could be a good indicator of what she uses on a regular basis, including, but not limited to: Patrick Ta Major Beauty Headlines Lipstick ($32) in That's Why She's Late, Fenty Beauty Stunna Lip Paint Longwear Fluid Lip Color ($29) in Uncensored, and Lisa Eldridge True Velvet Lipstick ($36) in Velvet Ribbon. As with most things the singer touches, there's also plenty of online fodder and speculation from fans on whether her lipstick of choice gives a nod to her best friend Selena Gomez's beauty line, Rare Beauty. The punchy, cool-toned red and matte finish of the Rare Beauty Lip Soufflé Matte Cream Lipstick ($20) in Inspire looks like it could be a spot-on match, so it's certainly a contender. Only time will tell which of the above lipstick(s) was used during her date nights with Blake Lively and, ahem, others. In the meantime, we'll be sipping our caramel nonfat latte from Starbucks in a black turtleneck, patiently waiting.
