  "description": "We can't explain our fascination with celebrity tattoos - it's just a thing we care very deeply about. It's always fun to discover a hidden meaning behind a piece of artwork, like Halsey's match tattoo that she got with three of her fans (get it?) or Selena Gomez's Roman-numeral tattoo that she got for a family member. But for every celebrity who likes to put their body art on display, there are a handful who are a bit more secretive about that sort of thing. If you've ever found yourself searching \"Does Taylor Swift have tattoos?\" you're not alone. \"The Tortured Poets Department\" singer has never blatantly shown off any ink, but fans are still curious if that means she doesn't have any or if she's just hiding it really, really well. But in a 2012 interview with Taste of Country, Swift said she couldn't get a tattoo simply because she couldn't commit to anything. \"People are always asking, 'Would you get a tattoo?' And I just . . . I don't think I could ever commit,\" she said. \"I don't think I could ever commit to something permanent.\" She then explained that if she were to get something, it would be of her lucky number 13, before declaring once more, \"I just don't want to get a tattoo.\" Swift could have changed her mind since that interview in 2012, but it's not likely that she's gotten any ink in the last few years without her eagle-eyed fans noticing. Her boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs player Travis Kecle's opinions on tattoos are seemingly similar. Meanwhile, plenty of her fans have gotten Taylor Swift-inspired tattoos over the years, ranging from cowboy boots as a nod to her early years to snakes in honor of \"Reputation.\" Jessica Harrington (she/her) is the senior beauty editor at PS, where she writes about hair, makeup, skin care, piercings, tattoos, and more. As a New York City-based writer and editor with a degree in journalism and over eight years of industry experience, she loves to interview industry experts, keep up with the latest trends, and test new products.",
