  "description": "It seems like every other day I find myself learning about a new skin-care ingredient, product, or treatment that promises to better my life in some way, shape, or form. I've tried plenty of the options with a lot of mixed results. The latest? Exosomes. If you haven't heard of them just yet, I promise it's only a matter of time. \"Exosomes are nanosized small membrane vesicles that are secreted by many cells in the body and can carry information from one cell to another,\" dermatologist Dustin Portela, DO, FAAD, previously told PS. They're typically derived from human stem cells, which are found in bone marrow. Research is still ongoing, but so far, things look promising, and exosomes are believed to help repair skin, as well as slow down the signs of aging. They can be applied topically and via injections. Injections are typically used for those experiencing hair loss. When used topically, exosomes work best when they're applied after a treatment like microneedling or a facial that involves lots of exfoliation, like dermaplaning. The good news is if you have a face, you're a good candidate for topical exosomes. The not-so-great news? There aren't too many formulas on the market, so the options that are currently out there are pretty pricey. The first time I tested them out, I did so after an in-office treatment, and then I kept up my regimen for over a month. Keep scrolling to read more about my exosome facial and how it impacted my skin. I visited SkinSpirit in Beverly Hills, where I had a Diamond Glow facial. I'm no stranger to Diamond Glow - in fact, I absolutely love them, but we started out the treatment with dermaplaning, which was a new step for me. I do my own version of the treatment at home - oil planing, but I had never had it done in-office before. The facial utilizes a wand with a diamond-encrusted tip paired with medical-grade serums to target specific skin concerns. We started out by cleansing the skin, then going over it with the diamond tip while a serum was dispersed and the wand was moved over my entire face and neck, which also gave me somewhat of a lymphatic drainage massage. From there, we switched over to a smooth tip, which dispersed a hyaluronic acid serum. Once we were finished, she layered on the Plated Intense Serum ($258), which contains exosomes. I know - it seems a little lackluster to just have the product applied topically - I felt a little disappointed that there wasn't any special application process - but what my face looked like in the hours, days, and weeks after was genuinely great. While I typically experience a lot of redness after in-office treatments, especially ones that involve exfoliation like the Diamond Glow, my face simply looked glowy. I also tend to have one or two breakouts after any type of facial, but my skin stayed pristine without a single zit. I've continued to use the Plated Serum in the time since my appointment, and I'm impressed with the results. I haven't had Botox in over a year, and I'm convinced this serum is what's keeping my forehead wrinkles at bay. Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
