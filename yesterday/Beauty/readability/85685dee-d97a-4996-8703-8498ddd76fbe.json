  "description": "If you left the theater after \"Materialists\" starring Dakota Johnson thinking to yourself, 'I want bangs.' You don't want just any type of bangs, you want \"Birkin\" bangs. And you're not alone. Bangs of all varieties - curtain, blunt, micro, curly, surfer - are having a moment right now. With the return of '70s-inspired shags and even Y2K side-bangs, you can customize your haircut and add even more personality to your look with the fringe of your choice. \"Birkin\" bangs - not to be confused with equally famous Birkin bags - are named after Jane Birkin's iconic fringe. As a model and actress in the 1960s and '70s, Birkin's bangs became a key component of her signature look. Now, with the increased interest in retro haircuts, they're gaining a new wave of fans. Keep scrolling to learn everything you need to know about the trending style. Experts Featured in This Article Devin Toth is a hairstylist at Salon SCK. What Are Birkin Bangs? Birkin bangs are characterized by their wispy, piecey look. Traditionally, they're a bit longer and hit in that space between your eyebrows and your eyelashes, without being so long that they'd be considered curtain bangs (which typically stretch to midcheek to chin-length). \"They're not heavy bangs at all and are, in fact, sparse enough to expose the eyebrows despite being long enough to cover them,\" Devin Toth, hairstylist at Salon SCK, says. \"The bang section of hair doesn't originate that far away from your hairline - only an inch or so - and then extends in sparse gaps to the lowest arc of the brows.\" The vibe of Birkin bangs is effortless and airy thanks to their wispy nature. They look just as great with your hair down as they do when you have it pulled up into an updo, like a ponytail or messy bun. As previously mentioned, a handful of celebrities have tried the look on for size, including Zendaya and Megan Fox. Birkin bangs look particularly good paired with long, straight, layered haircuts, but the style can work on all hair types. \"Any hair type, texture, and style can be inspired by them and pull them off as long as the rest of the face-framing layers are well below the chin and don't connect to the bangs,\" says Toth. How to Style Birkin Bangs How you style bangs largely depends on your starting hair type. \"Birkin bangs are paired with a center part and are usually styled with a subtle effortless bounce - not a full-blown bump, but just picture soft and straight with a bend,\" says Toth. \"They're almost clumpy and flow with the cowlicks of the hair.\" To style them, he recommends you rough-dry your hair, then take a round brush to your ends and do a quick pass of a flat iron to your bangs. \"Less is more.\" Ahead, see more inspiration shots of the Birkin bangs haircut trend to save for your fall hair appointment.",
