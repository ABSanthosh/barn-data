  "description": "It's so easy to make the connection between oranges and good skin; it's intuitive: oranges are naturally high in vitamin C, and vitamin C is a brightening antioxidant deemed by many dermatologists as the gold standard of skin care. You probably have a vitamin C serum hanging out in your medicine cabinet. . . and it probably comes with an orange label. But this year, another type of fruit is captivating the skincare industry: the humble apple. Any doctor will tell you that tossing apples into your Trader Joe's cart is a good idea. Rich in natural fiber and antioxidants, apples ease digestion and inflammation, which is great for skin and overall health. Though less talked-about, apples (specifically, their enzymes and extracts) are also employed in topical skin-care products - from serums and sunscreens to peels and moisturizers - and according to skin experts, apple skin-care ingredients are ripe for growth this year. Experts Featured in This Article Teresa Song, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist at Marmur Medical. Elizabeth Starr is the executive director of product development for Origins. The Skin-Care Benefits of Apple Apples offer immediate and preventative skin-care benefits including protection from UV damage, hydration, barrier support, and gentle exfoliation. \"Instant benefits include hydration and skin-plumping effects, as well as a brighter complexion from gentle exfoliation,\" says board-certified dermatologist Teresa Song, MD. \"Long-term benefits include improved skin elasticity and firmness, plus enhanced skin regeneration.\" Like oranges (and all fruits), apples boast a high level of antioxidants, which effectively bubble wrap the skin and protect it from cellular damage. \"Primarily, the apple peel is an ingredient known for its powerful antioxidant properties, which provide tremendous age-prevention benefits,\" says Elizabeth Starr from Origins. Additionally, apple seeds hydrate and support the skin barrier. \"Apple seeds contain omega fatty acids and polyphenols to nourish the skin barrier,\" says Song. Apple enzymes are alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs) that can be used for gentle skin exfoliation. \"Like malic acid, [they] act as gentle exfoliants to remove dead skin cells, brightening and smoothing the skin's appearance,\" Song says. How Skin Care Is Formulated With Apples No apples need to be harmed for the production of skin-care serums. Apples are often upcycled, saved from waste, and then harnessed for skin care. In the case of Origins, a brand featuring apple-derived ingredients in its Youthtopia collection, the process also involves natural fermentation to make the skin-care products more efficacious. \"We modify the apple peel ingredient through fermentation,\" says Starr. \"This process enhances its antioxidant power, effectively doubling its potency.\" The Best Apple Skin-Care Products The smartest way to introduce apple extracts into your skin-care routine is with a gentle, gateway skin-care product. \"Start with a gentle hydrating serum to layer underneath moisturizer, or a moisturizer containing apple extracts,\" Song recommends. For example, the Dr. Dennis Gross C+ Collagen Brighten \u0026 Firm Vitamin C Serum ($87) is brimming apple extract, vitamin C, and other antioxidant-rich ingredients to brighten, firm, and protect the skin. For a moisturizer, consider the Origins Peptide Plumping Apple Cream ($54), which plumps the skin with apple stem cell extract, apple peel ferment, and apple seed oil. Alternatively, consider a peel or mask that wields apple enzymes for exfoliation. \"Add a once-weekly exfoliating mask with apple-derived gentle acids,\" Song says. For example, the Origins Liquid Exfoliating Apple Peel ($44), is a great option. \"Peels are popular because they help jump-start the skin's cell turnover, but many peels on the market can be too aggressive,\" Starr says. \"Our challenge as formulators was to create something gentle enough for daily use, yet effective enough to deliver real benefits, and that's where the apple stem cell comes in.\" According to Song, we'll notice more apples and fruit extracts in skin care moving forward. \"There is likely to be an increase in plant-based skin-care ingredients, as the demand for natural products grows alongside the rising popularity of clean beauty trends,\" she says. Starr sees the rise in skin-care products using apple extracts as less of a passing trend, and more of a health choice. \"As skin-care professionals, we've always looked to nutrition and food for their functional value and explored how that translates to benefits for the skin,\" Starr says. \"The apple is such a simple yet highly functional ingredient.\" Megan Decker is a freelance writer and editor based in New York City.
