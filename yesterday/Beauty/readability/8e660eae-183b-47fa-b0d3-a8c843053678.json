  "description": "Wouldn't it be great if we didn't have to wonder if the formulas we spend time slathering on our skin will actually do anything? In a world of youth-preserving skin care, firming products rank high on the \"do they work?\" list. These magical potions come with the promise of tighter-looking skin, but is it all a marketing ploy or do they come with real, tangible benefits? To get to the bottom of things, we tapped a dermatologist and a plastic surgeon to answer our questions. Keep reading for their firm opinions on firming products. Experts Featured in This Article Daniel Gould, MD, is a board-certified plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills. Geeta Yadav, MD, is a board-certified dermatologist and founder of Facet Dermatology. Do Firming Body Products Actually Work? To understand how body-firming products work, it's important to first understand how the skin on the body changes over time. Two important proteins in our bodies are responsible for keeping the skin resilient and tight (collagen and elastin), but as we age, the production of both decline. \"Collagen is an important building block of the skin that acts like rebar, diffusing tension and compression and really improving the strength of the skin,\" says plastic surgeon Daniel Gould, MD. \"When skin on the body loses collagen, that skin becomes thinner and loses its tensile strength.\" Then there's elastin, which, as its name implies, refers to the elastic component of the skin. \"Where collagen is the support and the underlying mesh of the skin, elastin is the rubber band that allows the skin to spring back into place,\" says Dr. Gould. \"Skin that's lost its elasticity becomes stretchy, which can lead to jowl formation, laxity in the neck, and generally more hanging, loose skin on the body.\" Body-firming products are skin-care products formulated to address saggy, crepey, or stretchy skin. According to dermatologist Geeta Yadav, MD, firming skin-care products for the body can work - if you manage your expectations. \"By the time most people are seeking out products to firm the appearance of their skin, the loss of collagen and elastin is too significant, and they would benefit more from an in-office procedure or even plastic surgery. They will be very disappointed by any benefits provided by a topical formula,\" says Dr. Yadav. That's why it's best to start using topical firming treatments as a preventative measure or, at the very least, when you first start noticing the early signs of skin aging. While firming body products can work for improving collagen and elastin turnover, formulas marketed to eliminate cellulite are a different story. As Dr. Yadav explains, these products tend to improve the appearance of cellulite temporarily, and you're better off doing an in-office procedure to treat it. Ingredients to Look For If You Want to Firm Skin When shopping for firming body products, there are a few key ingredients to keep in mind. You'll want to look for peptides, which signal to your skin cells to up the ante on the collagen production. \"More collagen translates into firmer and more resilient skin; just note that these benefits take consistency and time to see,\" says Dr. Yadav. Retinol, the skin-care industry's golden child, is another beneficial ingredient for firmer skin. \"Retinol is the most frequently studied anti-aging ingredient in the skin-care arsenal and is clinically proven to address all signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles, and skin laxity,\" says Dr. Yadav. \"Retinol triggers cellular turnover from the bottom up, stimulating new collagen production and exfoliation - this results in smoother, brighter, firmer, and more even skin in texture and tone.\" If you're looking for a quick fix, look for caffeine on an ingredient list - it stimulates circulation, which has a temporary plumping effect on the skin. When it comes to collagen-firming body products, it's best to spend your money elsewhere. \"Collagen can't pass through the barrier of the skin to enter into the body and improve its quality,\" says Dr. Gould. That being said, the ingredient can offer some hydration to skin that needs it. Another hydrating ingredient to seek out is hyaluronic acid, which can increase the skin's water content and make crepey skin look less crepey, notes Dr. Gould. Effective Treatment Options For Firmer Skin If topical treatments just aren't cutting it, radiofrequency can be a solid option. \"Radiofrequency treatments work by delivering controlled heat to the skin, stimulating skin's natural repair processes and cellular turnover as well as the production of new collagen and elastin,\" says Dr. Yadav. These treatments can penetrate the skin deeper than a topical, though bear in mind you may need multiple treatments depending on your skin goals. Plastic surgery treatments that target excess skin are another option. While treatments like arm lifts, thigh lifts, and abdominoplasty involve an incision, recovery time, and a hefty price tag, Dr. Gould says that removing excess skin is the most powerful and reliable way to give the skin a tighter-looking appearance.
