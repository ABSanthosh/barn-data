  "description": "Right off the heels of Bath \u0026 Body Works's sold-out Halloween collection, the brand announced it wants to help you get in the festive spirit yet again - this time, with a holiday collection that features a ton of new home fragrances, body-care products, and accessories. It never ceases to amaze us how the company continues to surprise each season, but it does it year after year. The 2023 Bath \u0026 Body Works Christmas scents, for example, included never-before-sniffed options like To All a Good Night, Jolly Gingerbread Village, Cookie Butter Truffle, White Birch \u0026 Vetiver, Pink Sparkling Spritz, Golden Berry Mistletoe, Raspberry Thumbprint, Silver Snowfall, Feliz Navid Champurrado, and Happy Hanukkah. For the 2024 Bath \u0026 Body Works Christmas Collection, the brand is introducing Pretty in Pink with notes of pink camellia flower, whipped almond créme, and cherries; Platinum, a bergamot and patchouli musk blend; Calming Skies with lavender and peppermint; and an entire \"Emily in Paris\" collection in collaboration with Netflix. All of those items, plus traditional yearly favorites like Vanilla Bean Noel, Champagne Toast, and Winter Candy Apple, are hitting shelves in stores and online for you to enjoy as part of the Bath \u0026 Body Works holiday drop. From cozy candles to delicious-smelling hand soaps, adorable hand sanitizers, and magical Wallflower Plugins, Bath \u0026 Body Works's website has been flooded with colors of red, white, green, and glitter and transformed into a winter wonderland. Even though the holidays are still a short time away, the brand's special-edition products always sell out fast. If you see something that would make the perfect gift for someone on your list (or yourself), we suggest grabbing it ASAP. The entire Bath \u0026 Body Works Christmas collection is available online and in stores, but you can get a peek at a few of our favorite items ahead. Don't forget to sign up for Bath \u0026 Body Works's loyalty program to start collecting points as you shop.",
