  "description": "Image Source: Coutesy of Parivie and Paris Hilton It's the first sunny afternoon in New York after days of foggy rain, and Paris Hilton is launching her skin-care line, Parívie, with a rooftop party at Zero Bond, a celebrity hotspot in New York City. It seems almost too perfect. Hours before the party, Hilton walks into our interview in an all-pink ensemble, as if she personally banished the grey weather herself. She enters with a team of people, but they aren't pulling out chairs for her or fluffing her hair. Instead, they look at me and ask Hilton and me to pose for a Polaroid. Someone on her team asks her to sign it for me and she doesn't struggle to remember my name - she asks me how I spell my version of Brittany: \"N-E-Y or A-N-Y?\" making sure to get it right. She's intimidatingly beautiful, but within the first moments of our conversation, I feel myself relax. She's almost unimaginably approachable. She's not speaking in her \"Simple Life\"-era character voice; she's just another beauty-obsessed girl eager to gab about skin care. And, like Hilton, that's something I could go on about all day. Although Hilton has over 19 product lines, ranging from fragrances to cookware, Parívie is the first one in which she's the majority stakeholder. To make it all happen, she partnered with Alexandra Marsh, a startup and beauty brand veteran who was the former vice president of acquisition at Gunthy Renker. \"I've been in the product industry for a very long time now,\" says Hilton. \"I just celebrated my 20-year anniversary, my 30th fragrance, Iconic, and it's just all perfect timing. I've traveled the world, tried all of the best products, work at the best. I knew exactly what I wanted when I was creating this line.\" Image Source: Parvie/Paris Hilton Hilton's main goal was to create something that actually works. For this, the brand is banking on its bioactive complex (which they're calling inPHinite Youth Technology), found in products like the That's Tight Plumping Vitality Serum ($125) and the That's Quenched Barrier Support Crème ($64). \"It has this Benjamin Button effect,\" says Hilton, alluding to its ability to help you age in reverse. The complex is made up of next-generation peptides (including a peptide that was discovered by AI), potent antioxidants, and probiotic-fermented extracts that boost ingredient efficacy, help repair the skin barrier, and counteract visible signs of stress and screen time, according to the brand. With this line, \"I'm thinking about the health from the inside out,\" says Hilton. If she had to choose a favorite in the product lineup, it would be the That's Tight Plumping Vitality Serum that she called \"the ultimate multitasker, just like me.\" Famously, Hilton claims she's never gotten Botox or filler (it's hard to imagine an average NYC girl rejecting Botox, let alone a celebrity), but that doesn't mean she shies away from aesthetic treatments altogether. \"I feel that if you are preventative - plus I'm obsessed with beauty tech - there are just other ways,\" says Hilton. \"I'm really proud that I listened to my mom [and have had] a skin-care routine since I was 8 years old. I've been obsessed with it. [My mom] said to stay out of the sun and I'm such an undercover nerd and find out everything to do with the new tech gadgets that actually work.\" Hilton has built an entire at-home spa called the Sliving Spa that allows her to pamper herself 24/7. One of her favorite treatments that she has access to in her spa is the Hydrafacial, which is editor-loved. But it doesn't end there. \"I love the cryo chamber, which I go in every morning - four people can fit in it,\" Hilton says. \"And then the four-person hyperbaric chamber, which is an oxygen chamber.\" She also loves her Neo Light, which is a red light bed. Most recently, she added a Geneo X facial machine to the mix. The list goes on. As fun as it is to metaphorically step inside the Sliving Spa, as someone who grew up in the 2000s, I'd be remiss if I didn't ask Hilton about the iconic era, known for flip phones, body glitter, and haphazard makeup looks. It was an era when skin care wasn't nearly as advanced, and Sephora hadn't yet taken off. \"It was horrible,\" she says, reminiscing on the beauty sins she committed when she didn't know any better (which may have included a certain apricot scrub that we know too well). \"It's amazing how far science has come,\" Hilton says. Image Source: Getty/VALERY HACHE/AFP It wasn't all bad, though. \"I invented Y2K, I'm the blueprint,\" says Hilton. \"It's so fun seeing so many people recreating my looks - I just feel like I was always very ahead of my time in so many ways. Especially with fashion and now just to see so many people inspired by it just makes me feel really happy.\" But there's one Y2K look, in particular, that still makes many of us shudder - the fully lined black smoky liner that surrounded the entire eye. Surely she regretted that look, right? \"No, not at all,\" says Hilton. \"I love that trend. I would literally just be on my way to the club in the back of the car, not even looking in the mirror, and it looks so hot.\" She does have a way of making it sound fun. I'm instantly transported back to a time pre-social media of \"going out tops\" and grainy selfies taken on Blackberry phones. And suddenly, I'm reaching for my black smoky eye pencil again.

It was an era when skin care wasn\u0026#39;t nearly as advanced, and Sephora hadn\u0026#39;t yet taken off. \u0026#34;It was horrible,\u0026#34; she says, reminiscing on the beauty sins she committed when she didn\u0026#39;t know any better (which may have included a certain apricot scrub that we know too well). \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s amazing how far science has come,\u0026#34; Hilton says.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cfigure data-element-type=\"ParagraphImage\" data-element-index=\"6\"\u003e\u003cpicture data-testid=\"picture-tag\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/jxo1QcsoBnjOGKrOgyTDF7eLh_U=/fit-in/792x1151/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/05/08/781/n/1922153/tmp_4CNoOl_b968b488c2fb7242_paris_hilton_smokey_eye.jpg\" alt=\"Paris Hilton smokey eye\" width=\"792\" height=\"1151\" srcset=\"https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/jxo1QcsoBnjOGKrOgyTDF7eLh_U=/fit-in/792x1151/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/05/08/781/n/1922153/tmp_4CNoOl_b968b488c2fb7242_paris_hilton_smokey_eye.jpg 1000w, https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4dv-ZhvZCh8jL8lkHOdeDb1gsQY=/fit-in/1584x2302/filters:format_auto():upscale()/2025/05/08/781/n/1922153/tmp_4CNoOl_b968b488c2fb7242_paris_hilton_smokey_eye.jpg 2000w\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com\" data-vars-href=\"http://www.gettyimages.com\" data-vars-ga-action=\"click\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eGetty | VALERY HACHE/AFP\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cdiv data-element-type=\"ParagraphBodyText\" data-element-index=\"7\"\u003e\u003cp data-element-index=\"0\"\u003eIt wasn\u0026#39;t all bad, though. \u0026#34;I invented Y2K, I\u0026#39;m the blueprint,\u0026#34; says Hilton. \u0026#34;It\u0026#39;s so fun seeing so many people recreating my looks — I just feel like I was always very ahead of my time in so many ways.
