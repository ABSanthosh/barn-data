  "description": "Longer days and warmer weather call for new wardrobes and accessories, including fresh nails - and with Easter around the corner, it's time to think about Easter nail art ideas. Some people like to plan ahead on what they're going to wear to Easter dinner, while others like to put all of the focus on the designs they'll sport on their fingertips. If the latter statement resonates best with you, you're probably on the hunt for Easter nail designs. The most festive manicures feature traditional Easter colors like pinks, blues, yellows, purples, and greens - especially of the pastel variety - but that's only the beginning. Some of our favorite options include intricate egg patterns, little chicks, and cute bunnies. However, if your style is more minimal, you can still have Easter nails that feel festive without overdoing it. Your everyday spring manicure can double as simple Easter nail art with some minor tweaks. For a modern manicure, we like pastel colors, glazed finishes, and Easter french tip nails. If you go this route, you'll be able to wear the design for days (or weeks if you gel nails) after the holiday has passed. You don't have to rely on your own creativity to come up with cool Easter nail designs. We rounded up a ton of Easter nail art ideas for you to sort through. Depending on what style you want, there's a mix of show-stopping manicures that will earn you lots of attention, along with more subtle, minimalist nail designs for those with a low-key beauty vibe. Keep scrolling to see the best Easter nail ideas to consider for yourself.",
