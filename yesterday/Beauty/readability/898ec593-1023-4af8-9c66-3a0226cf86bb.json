  "description": "For most people, one of the best things about the holidays is dressing up in a fancy outfit. However, for beauty enthusiasts, the star of the show is either the holiday-themed makeup or the accompanying nail art. But just because you're partial to festive holiday nails doesn't necessarily mean you prefer tinsel designs, an ugly-sweater-inspired manicure, or Christmas tree nails. In fact, we're here to prove that holiday nail art doesn't have to be cheesy to be cute. (Although, for the record, we'd call Christmas tree nails anything but cheesy.) We're in a new age of creativity led by stellar nail technicians. Holiday nail designs can range anywhere from chic candy-cane swirls to Santa-hat nail-art designs, ombré polish with mistletoe, and even subtle snowflake nails. No matter where you decide to take it, there's an option for you. If you want to keep it classy, graphic lines and glitter finishes are the way to go. If you're looking to step it up a notch, cashmere and crystal nails are as stylish as they are cool. Winter nail art is beyond any specific holiday, so don't be afraid to experiment with the entire cozy aesthetic of the season.

In fact, we're here to prove that holiday nail art doesn't have to be cheesy to be cute. (Although, for the record, we'd call Christmas tree nails anything but cheesy.) We're in a new age of creativity led by stellar nail technicians. Holiday nail designs can range anywhere from chic candy-cane swirls to Santa-hat nail-art designs, ombré polish with mistletoe, and even subtle snowflake nails. No matter where you decide to take it, there's an option for you. If you want to keep it classy, graphic lines and glitter finishes are the way to go. If you're looking to step it up a notch, cashmere and crystal nails are as stylish as they are cool. Winter nail art is beyond any specific holiday, so don't be afraid to experiment with the entire cozy aesthetic of the season. Ahead, we've rounded up the chicest holiday nail ideas that will have you celebrating tastefully. Gray Sweater Holiday NailsNothing is cozier than sweater nails, which feature 3D details on an accent finger that match the texture of a knit sweater. Read more about the trend.Pink Snowflake Holiday NailsJust because it's the holiday season doesn't mean you need to stick to the same traditional colors you see everywhere. Case in point? This snowflake nail art painted on top of a bright-pink polish.Black and Gold Abstract Holiday NailsSwitch up your standard holiday nail art by implementing varying designs within a singular theme, like this look that incorporates a different gold glitter look on each finger. Silver Snowflake Holiday NailsGive your nails the winter-wonderland touch with a silver-glitter-meets-white-snowflake design. This one requires a steady hand, but makes for the perfect holiday nail art. Red and White Sweater Holiday NailsYou can also opt to add the white sweater detail to a singular accent nail and paint the rest of your fingers a bright cherry red or another fun holiday-themed color. Vintage Snowflake Holiday NailsWe're obsessed with this vintage snowflake holiday nail design for two reasons. One, it's a fun twist on a classic piece of holiday art, and two, the colors are so unexpected. Abstract Holiday Nail ArtHoliday nail art doesn't have to be as straightforward as a snowflake on a green and red background. Take this look, for example. The blue, white, and silver shades still give the holiday nail vibe, but it's a vibe you could wear all year long. Red and Gold Star Holiday NailsWe love a classic burgundy manicure in winter, and these gold-star additions (created with a metallic polish and thin nail brush) take the holiday nail art up a notch. This manicure will also work perfectly for New Year's Eve. Blue and Gold Abstract Holiday NailsV-cut french manicures are simple, understated, and chic as hell, but you can give them a holiday twist by incorporating classic colors like deep blue and metallic gold.Mistletoe Ombré Holiday NailsMistletoe nail art doesn't have to be obvious or in your face; instead, try adding the design to the tips of every other nail and paint on a cool ombré design leading up to them for dramatic effect. Negative-Space Gold Snowflake Holiday NailsNegative-space nails — which feature a design on bare or clear nails — are the ultimate minimalist manicure idea. We especially like this seasonal addition of gold snowflake decals.Winter Berry NailsAdding subtle holiday details — like the winter berries design here — to a solid nail-polish color like dark blue or green gives your holiday nail art a touch of whimsy without being too over the top. Reverse Sparkle Ombré Holiday NailsThe most festive twist on the inverted french manicure is this sparkly nail design, which features flecks of silver glitter along the cuticle. The perfect example of chic holiday nail art. Burgundy Stencil Holiday NailsMatte burgundy nails look especially chic with a singular stenciled detail in a classic wrapping-paper design. You can opt for an accent nail or do it on every single one, the choice is up to you.Rose Gold and Burgundy Holiday NailsThe easiest holiday nail art design idea: change up your polish finishes. Take this burgundy and rose-gold manicure, for example, which plays with matte and glitter.Abstract Red Holiday NailsThe color red will be everywhere this festive season, but painting on the color in an abstract shape — like just the tip of each nail as shown here — makes this holiday nail art feel fresh.Glitter French Manicure Holiday NailsFrench manicures look a lot more festive when you incorporate a glitter polish. Bonus points if you add other elements, like a snowflake here and there, to each nail.Olive Green and Gold Sparkle Holiday NailsAn olive-green polish that matches your Christmas tree or wreath is a perfect choice on its own, but adding in a few flecks of scattered gold glitter to a nail or two makes it an extra festive holiday nail art look. Beige Sweater Holiday NailsIf you want to try the cashmere-sweater nails trend but still want to keep it cozy and simple, we suggest a neutral base color like the beige worn here. These nails can take you through all of the holiday months, and they'll match with every single outfit.Beige and Gold Glitter Holiday NailsSubtle nail art details on a clean, neutral-colored polish will pair well with any holiday outfit and make great holiday nail art. This example features two different accent nails and a mix of black and gold polish. Icy Blue With Gold Flake Holiday NailsMetallic foil finishes are the perfect topper to any opaque holiday polish. We suggest adding it to one or two accent nails for fun but subtle holiday nail art.Red and Green Sparkle Holiday NailsThere's always something fun about opting for any of the classic holiday colors. Try mixing things up by featuring a different color on each fingernail — but give it a festive upgrade with greens and reds that double as glitter polishes.Black French Tip With Gold Snowflake Holiday NailsWhy not give your \"french moon\" manicure a holiday nail art touch by adding a singular snowflake decal on a single finger? If you're DIY-ing, you can even opt for a nail art sticker instead of drawing the snowflake yourself. Red, White, and Gold Swirl Holiday NailsSwirl nails are a fun trend on their own, but you can level it up by drawing inspiration for your next design from classic wrapping-paper colors, like red, white, and gold to make it a holiday nail art design.Rudolph and Red Plaid Holiday NailsGive Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer a subtle nod by adding the cartoon to an accent finger. Paint the rest of your nails either a single polish or an equally simple look.Icy Blue and Silver Tip Holiday NailsJack Frost provides the ultimate icy nail inspiration — just take this blue, silver, and white design. You could pick one design from this example and do it on every single nail, or opt to mix and match. Candy-Cane Swirl Holiday NailsThe classic holiday candy gets a nail-art upgrade with this swirl design. Our favorite is the twist on the french manicure, but honestly, we love how all of the designs work together. Patchwork Santa Hat Holiday NailsThis manicure manages to capture all the best parts of Christmas. It includes a Santa-hat nail-art design, snowmen, gingerbread men, and more. Santa Claus and Tree Holiday NailsWith Christmas trees and a Santa-hat nail-art design, you can't go wrong with this festive manicure. White Sweater French Manicure Holiday NailsGive your french manicure the 3D touch with this embossed cashmere-sweater detail on the tips. You can opt for a matte look or something shiny.
