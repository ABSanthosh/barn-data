  "text": "“I’ve been a slow burner. I’ve always made music, but my professional career only started taking off in the last four years when I released my first album, Honey for Wounds, and Fieldnotes: Complete. I appreciate the time it’s taken because it’s made my successes that much more special. And really, you release the music and everything else is just a bonus. That’s how I feel anyway. One of those bonuses for me is that I’ve been lucky enough to have my music—which I would describe as a mix of R\u0026B, soul, and jazz with an alternative twist—in shows like Insecure and Sex Education. I was a big fan of both of those shows, but with Insecure especially, it felt even more special because I remember hearing the fifth season would be the final one and I was so determined to make sure one of my songs made it into an episode. When it comes to beauty, my everyday look is very clean and minimal. When I’m on stage or have a photoshoot, that’s when I can allow myself to go a bit crazy because I have my makeup artist, Min Sandhu, and she knows what she’s doing. [Laughs] If it’s just me though, the look is simple—and so is my skincare. I’ve definitely had breakouts before, but I think that’s mostly been when I was using too much skincare. It’s fun trying new products, but I had to accept that my skin can’t take a lot. And honestly? It’s fine. I don’t know what I’m doing anyway. [Laughs] That said, I love La Roche-Posay’s Toleriane Dermo cleanser. I love the milky texture—it’s sort of similar to Glossier’s Milky Jelly. A dermatologist recommended it when my skin went a little crazy. Not only did it calm down my skin, but it also got rid of my hyperpigmentation. Before I had an actual cleanser, I used to use a body wash all over, my face included. Then I follow it up with Glossier’s Super Bounce serum and moisturize with Byoma’s gel cream. I picked that one up from my partner. It’s got green tea and leaves my face very lovely and dewy. And I used to use a sunscreen from La-Roche Posay, but now I like Glossier’s Invisible Shield because it’s lighter, like you’re not really wearing anything. Min and I have become inseparable since we started working together seven years ago. She’s given me tutorials on how to do my makeup when she’s unable to attend a shoot, so I have some skills now, though I’m nowhere near as good as her. If I just want a little something on my face, I use Anastasia's Brow Freeze and follow it up with Glossier Boy Brow and Brow Flick. Maybelline’s Lash Lift mascara makes me look like I’ve got false eyelashes without the clumps. It’s so good. I love the Nars foundation and concealer for live shows because they give me a lot of coverage, but if I’m doing an everyday look, I use the Glossier Stretch concealer in Deep 3 without any foundation. The look is less dramatic that way—and I always want my makeup to look like actual skin. For setting powder, I used to go for Laura Mercier’s in Medium Deep but the shade wasn’t quite right for me, so I switched to Glossier’s Wowder in G1. It’s super light and never gets cake-y. Oh, and I love Merit’s Flush blush in Mood, a sort of deep purple. It’s very subtle and doesn’t make me look crazy. The only accent I ever really wear is on my lips. MAC’s Devoted to Chili, this nice, brown-y, nude-y color, is my favorite. I’m frugal. I usually do my hair on my own because sometimes I just wake up and want to switch my hairstyle—and I’m not about to start booking appointments because I’m impatient. [Laughs] I watch a lot of tutorials on YouTube on how to braid or do different styles. But I get regular trims at First Glance in London. And I wash it once a week with the Shea Moisture Jamaican black castor oil shampoo. I just started using Curlsmith’s Bond Curl Rehab Salve as a pre-poo. And I love Mielle’s babassu oil and mint deep conditioner. I got a Steampod 3 recently, too, and I love it because it makes my hair so slick. Then I just follow it up with the Olaplex bonding oil, which leaves my hair so nice and shiny. I do my own nails, too. I have a nail lamp and everything. I love going on Pinterest and looking up nail art ideas—I could spend all day scrolling and trying to replicate them. And as for colors, I love Ada Bloom and Melarich from Télle Moi and I’m Not Really a Waitress from OPI. My go-to fragrance used to be Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet—my ex-boyfriend bought it for me—but I swear by Glossier You now. Well, I like it during the day. At night, I love wearing You Rêve. It smells rich and fancy. Every time I wear it, I get compliments, and who doesn’t love that?” —As told to Daise Bedolla Photographed by Anete Hiie in London on December 6, 2024",
