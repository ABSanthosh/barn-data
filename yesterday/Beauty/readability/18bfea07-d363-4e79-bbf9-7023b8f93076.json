  "description": "\"Expensive brunette\" is not a nickname (although, if the shoe fits) - it's a hair-color trend that has had everyone, including celebrities in Hollywood, flocking to their hairstylists for a winter refresh. Hair-color treatments, in general, are pretty expensive, but this name refers to a specific color that makes you look and feel like a million bucks the second you walk out of the salon. This hair-color trend is more about the finish of the hair than the color itself. \"Expensive brunette is all about a luxe feel, focusing on dimension, shine, and hair health,\" celebrity hairstylist Liam Curran tells PS. The look is ultrashiny and glossy, as if you just got a blowout and color touch-up the day before. It comes on the heels of the liquid hair trend, which is all about creating a smooth, mirror-like appearance in the hair's surface. Want to learn more? Keep reading for expert tips on how to get the look as well as how you can maintain it at home. Experts Featured in This Article Liam Curran is a celebrity hairstylist and Tangle Teezer ambassador. What Is Expensive Brunette Hair? Step one of achieving the expensive-brunette hair color is booking an appointment with a professional. \"Expensive brunette is not an all-over color,\" Curran says. Therefore you won't be able to achieve it with a box of hair dye. Your hairstylist will come up with the best color for you based on a number of factors (skin tone, eye color, lifestyle, etc.). \"If you're interested in trying out expensive brunette, explore dimension, high shine, depth, intermixed tones, and custom blends with your stylist.\" The key to looking \"expensive\" is having a beautiful hair color that complements you perfectly, and then focusing on maintaining its shine and smoothness. How to Maintain Expensive Brunette Hair \"When coloring your hair any color, it's always important to maintain a healthy condition,\" Curran says. That means using hair masks to deep condition regularly and minimizing heat damage as much as possible. Keep scrolling to see our favorite examples of the expensive brunette hair color - plus products to help you get (and maintain) the look at home. Don't worry: it won't cost you nearly as much as it will look like it did. To keep the high-shine finish in your hair, try a hair gloss. The best (and most long-lasting) results come from an in-salon treatment, but you can also DIY the look with at-home options like the L'Oréal Le Color Gloss One Step Toning Gloss ($16) or the Madison Reed Color Reviving Gloss in Glassa ($25). How to Style Expensive Brunette Hair The best way to add that liquid hair-level shine is to use hair oils or shine sprays when styling the hair. Some of our favorites include the Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil ($30) and Amika Top Gloss Hair Shine Spray ($29). Also, don't forget to brush. You've likely heard the old wives tale that brushing your hair 100 times gets it looking better than ever. That's not necessarily true, but a good hairbrush can help smooth frizz (which, in turn, can lead to shinier ends). If you're ready to take the plunge, keep scrolling for some expensive brunette inspiration you can bring with you to your next salon appointment.",
