  "description": "If you've ever had a reflective manicure √† la chrome nails and you thought you were the epitome of bright and shiny - trust us when we say what you had going on was nothing compared to Jennifer Lopez's latest set. The star recently sported a manicure that makes us want to start a petition to have her change her name from J. Lo to \"J. Glow,\" because saying they \"shine bright like a diamond\" is an understatement. The star recently performed at the Elie Saab show in Saudi Arabia wearing a turquoise feathered sequined number, which was polished off with one of the most perfect manicures we've ever seen. The look, which was done by celebrity nail artist Tom Bachik, features over 250 crystals. Bachik is responsible for some of our favorite celebrity manicures ever, and he frequently works with stars like Margot Robbie and Selena Gomez. In fact, he worked on a similar look for Lopez's Super Bowl nails, but this recent iteration might be even better. \"The nails had between 25 to 50 crystals per nail,\" Bachik tells PS. \"I actually removed crystals from the sides to keep nails slender and to make key crystal placements the focus and more impactful.\" Keep scrolling to take a closer look at the manicure and to get the full breakdown of how Bachik created the set. View this post on Instagram A post shared by ùôèùô§ùô¢ ùòΩùôñùôòùôùùôûùô† Nails (@tombachik) Bachik shared in an Instagram post that he started by prepping the nails using the Tweezerman x Tom Bachik Tools ($59). From there, he applied the Apr√©s Gel-X Sculpted Coffin Tips ($17) in clear. Next, he used the Kokoist Platinum Filler Base ($25), which he followed with the Mia Secret Chrome Silver Gel Paint ($9). Bachik used a chrome powder that isn't available for purchase yet, and then covered the nails with Swarovski crystals. To top everything off, he added Mia Secret Metallic Flakes ($10).
