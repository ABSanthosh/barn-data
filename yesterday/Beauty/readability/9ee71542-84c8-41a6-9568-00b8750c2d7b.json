French Bob HaircutSofia Richie Grainge recently chopped off her medium-length hair into a \"French bob,\" and that solidified its place as one of the top haircuts of the summer. \"The French bob is a chic cut with a short blunt length at the chin or above with no layers and a bang,\" says hairstylist Amy Abramite. \" It's best for finer textures that are straight or wavy. The shorter length on the French bob will make hair look denser, which is desired for those who want their hair to look thicker and blunter on the ends.\"\"I'm seeing so many rocking a short bob. Whether you're going for the Parisian blunt bob or a more layered bob,\" says celebrity hairstylist Hayley Heckmann. \"I love it because I think it's so chic and effortless. You can wear it air-dried for a euro look or more styled. Either way, with confidence you can rock anything.\"Shag HaircutIf bobs aren't your thing, have no fear — layered shags are also hot for summer. Even Selena Gomez is giving the look her stamp of approval. \"I'm seeing a lot of people wear this haircut with more of a mid-length haircut, which is so cute,\" says Heckmann. \"This look also looks amazing with an air-dried texture, which I think works well in the summer when people want to use less heat styling.\"Hairstylist Pedro Felix agrees, adding, \"The shag and 'wolf cut' brings a fresh face with bangs and shorter layers with texture.\"Getty | Pascal Le SegretainPrincess Bob HaircutThere's a new bob in town and it's fit for royalty — literally. The \"princess bob\" is the latest iteration of the short hairstyle, inspired by Princess Olympia of Greece, seen here. \"The bob is always a good haircut for the summer to refresh the energy and give confidence,\" says Felix. \"Recently I've been loving the return of structured but flowy voluminous bobs,\" says hairstylist Anya Martin of the trendy princess cut. \"They are effortlessly elegant and softly authoritative. This cut expresses a more refined palette but relaxes and becomes more playful with saltwater and sun.\"Getty | Edward BerthelotLong Lengths and Face-Framing LayersIf long hair flowing in the breeze is what comes to mind when you think of summer, you're not alone. \"This reflects the summer's carefree and active spirit, letting hair do what it wants without excessive styling or perfectionism,\" says Martin. But \"this doesn't mean your hair should be neglected just because your goal is to grow it out.\" He recommends a long layered cut with some type of bang, whether it's bottleneck bangs or curtain bangs, so you \"feel like you still have a definitive style.\" Face-framing layers are a great way to add shape to your look without having to go full bangs. \"By fulfilling the wish of keeping the length and adding a sultry face frame, we can embrace the summer weather and still look hot,\" says hairstylist Rachel Lee. \"Whether your hair is up or down, in its natural texture or styled, this is the look for summer.\"Italian Bob Haircut\"The 'Italian bob' has a length at the chin or longer with minimal layers that create movement for a fuller effect and expansion of volume,\" says Abramite, describing the popular summer look. \"It's best for thicker straight or wavy textures looking for a longer bob that swings near the shoulders.\" It's a great wash-and-go look for many people, which is key in the summer. Reinvented Chelsea HaircutThis one is for the out-of-the-box thinkers looking to majorly turn some heads. \"After the popularity of the Hime cut, I'm excited to see it shift into new and more approachable interpretations of the 'Chelsea cut,' says Martin. \"This summer, freedom of self expression and to experiment feels relevant to everyone. Feathery pieces by exposed ears, soft and long petals of hair framing a homage to punk and non-conformity.\" GettyJessica Harrington (she/her) is the senior editor of PS Beauty, where she oversees coverage around makeup, skin care, hair, tattoos, and more.
