  "description": "If you're ready to leave hibernation behind and fully dive into spring, you've come to the right place. What better way to come out of hiding than with a fresh cut? This winter, we saw a rise in shorter haircuts like the pixie and Prada bob because they're incredibly chic yet easy to style. The good news is, that won't be changing any time soon - now that spring has arrived, shorter cuts are still set to be one of the season's hottest trends, according to stylists. But what else is in store? Sleek, modern takes on classic favorites and low-maintenance, effortless styles that speak to the lazy girl in all of us. \"As hairstylists, we're always predicting what's next while appreciating what never goes out of style,\" hairstylist Stewart Vann says. \"For spring 2025, we're seeing a balance between modern structure and effortless movement - a nod to both vintage influences and contemporary styling.\" It isn't a mystery why styles like this always come back around, but Vann and celebrity hairstylist Dimitris Giannetos gave us the full report on what's going to be everywhere this season and how you can get in on the action. For every trending spring haircut, keep scrolling. Experts Featured in This Article Dimitris Giannetos is a celebrity hairstylist and colorist who has worked with stars like Gigi Hadid, Demi Moore, Joey King, and Alessandro Ambrosio, to name a few. Stewart Vann is a master hairstylist, colorist, educator, and Unite ambassador based in Jacksonville, Florida.",
