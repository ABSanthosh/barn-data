  "description": "Winter lingers for months after the holiday season wraps, which feels like a cruel twist of fate. After all, there is such an emphasis on the glam of holiday hairstyles that we forget that life continues after the ball drops. But this post-holiday stretch, according to hair experts, is when the real haircut transformations begin - and this winter, we're chopping it all off. \"Shorter styles are a big trend this winter because they're easy to style and take less time to blowout,\" says hairstylist Donavin Maxwell. And if Emma Stone's Golden Globes pixie debut was any indicator, the shorter, the better. Not ready for a dramatic chop? Test the waters with a change in your fringe. \"Many of my clients are asking for soft, wispy curtain bangs,\" Maxwell says, noting the new year uptick in requests for bangs. Or, use this bundle-up time to prioritize hair growth and opt for long layers that can withstand minimal maintenance. Ahead, celebrity hairstylists are dishing out the best winter haircut trends, from chic bobs to mermaid cuts, to help inspire your fresh start. Experts Featured in This Story Donavin Maxwell is an NYC-based hairstylist and FEKKAI ambassador. Dimitris Giannetos is a celebrity hairstylist and colorist. His clients include Megan Fox, Amal Clooney, Camila Cabello, and many more",
