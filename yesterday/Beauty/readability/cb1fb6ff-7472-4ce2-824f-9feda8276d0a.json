  "description": "In the years since Drake entered the music scene, the Canadian rapper has built a chart-topping discography and an equally impressive ink collection featuring a unique variety of pieces. Starting with his very first tattoo of the OVO owl - the emblem of his official store, October's Very Own - on his back in 2011, the \"Rich Flex\" rapper has accumulated well over 56 designs. Drake's tattoos range from small script additions to massive ink portraits of his loved ones, with his latest being a block-letter design of his son Adonis's name. It's safe to assume that perhaps Drake's love language is getting permanent body artwork. From his parents to his musical idols and favorite characters from pop culture (he is a die-hard Potterhead, FYI), Drake has undoubtedly one of the most interesting and eclectic collections out there. In fact, when Celine Dion caught wind of Drake's imminent plan to immortalize her face on his torso, she hilariously implored her fellow Canadian musician not to, suggesting a list of alternative ways to express his admiration instead. While his ink is scattered prominently across his arms and back, he sent his fans into a frenzy when he debuted his first-ever face tattoo back in August 2022 and again, with another addition, in November 2023. He first got the letters \"sg\" etched near his left eye - a sentimental piece of body art dedicated to his mother, Sandra Gale. More recently, he got the word \"miskeen,\" which is an Arabic term that means \"poor\" or \"hopeless,\" on the right side of his face. The rapper also owns some beautiful designs that pay homage to his hometown of Toronto. If you're looking for an ultimate guide to Drake's tattoos, we rounded up all of them ahead. Keep scrolling to check out his entire collection and learn what each piece means.",

  "text": "Though he typically only shows them off when he is on vacation, Drake has a plethora of portraits and script designs on his back. Drake's Mother's Portrait TattooDrake dedicated another piece of ink to his mother with a portrait of her on the right side of his back.Drake's Uncle and Grandma's Portrait TattoosOn the upper central part of his back, Drake got the portraits of his late uncle and maternal grandmother. They gleefully posed for the picture while hugging. The heartfelt family portrait was done by Nikko Hurtado in 2012. Drake's Harry Potter Portrait TattooDrake is a huge self-proclaimed Potterhead, and to solidify his love for the universally beloved wizarding world, he got a portrait of Harry Potter and his pet owl, Hedwig, on the lower right side of his back.Drake's Songbird Tattoo Drake's tattoo collection mostly features black and gray pieces, except for a couple of colorful exceptions. The eye-catching songbird design that sits on his left shoulder blade is one of the few colored-ink designs. The red, brown, black, and white bird is in flight, flapping its wings open, with \"XO20\" written in black and red beneath it. The letters \"XO\" might be a reference to The Weeknd (Abel Tesfaye), whose record label's name is XO. They also mention this in the duo's 2012 collaboration, \"Crew Love,\" with the lyrics reading, \"That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know.\" The same song also features the lyric \"Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty,\" likely referencing Drake's number of close friends, which might explain the \"20\" in the tattoo. Drake's Aaliyah Portrait Tattoo A portrait of the late R\u0026B singer Aaliyah is situated directly below the songbird tattoo on his back. Drake has never shied away from expressing his admiration for Aaliyah and her inspiring artistry, which translated into this ink tribute in 2011.Drake's Noah \"40\" Shebib Portrait Tattoo Drake has another portrait dedicated to his longtime music-producing collaborator and close friend Noah \"40\" Shebib, which sits on the lower left side of his back.Drake's \"I Love You\" Tattoo On the left of Aaliyah's portrait, he has the words \"I Love You,\" followed by another unknown word, which is hard to read. The script tattoo is prefaced with a peace sign and ends with the female gender symbol. The script tattoo runs vertically down the length of his back. The inspiration behind it remains unspecified.",
