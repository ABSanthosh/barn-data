  "description": "Sephora’s Spring Savings Event ends tonight, and if you haven’t gotten a chance to stock up (or even if you have, and you’re coming back for more), now’s your last chance. If you’re not familiar with the ins and outs, here’s the lowdown: Depending on your Beauty Insider tier, you can score up to 20% off every purchase during the sale period. It’s the perfect chance to snag those pricey, rarely discounted products or try something new without paying full price. The sale is now open to all Beauty Insider tiers, meaning VIBs and Insiders can get 15% off and 10% off, respectively, until the sale ends. (Rouge members got first dibs on April 4 with a generous 20% off.) Plus, the retailer’s in-house label is getting some extra love with 30% off all Sephora Collection products, no matter your tier. Just use promo code SAVEMORE at checkout. Maybe the biggest note of all: There are no brand exclusions during this year’s sale, so gird your loins, prep your wishlists, and be prepared to go wild with your haul before the sale wraps on April 14. Since Sephora can sometimes feel like a dazzling maze of beauty treasures, we asked our savvy R29 editors to share the must-buys they’re adding to their carts during the event. Keep scrolling to shop them all. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Multi-Styler, $349 “Ever since I first reviewed the Shark FlexFusion, it’s been my ultimate hair tool obsession. It’s astonishingly user-friendly, delivers salon-quality blowouts, and dries hair in single-digit minutes. The brush attachment boosts natural bounce and volume, while the curling barrels effortlessly create soft waves (I sometimes brush through to loosen the curl a bit). There’s no better time to invest in one with a 10% discount that saves you over $30 is on the table.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Glossier You Doux Eau de Parfum, $78 “Glossier didn’t hold back with its expansion of the You cinematic universe, and I’m endlessly grateful for that bold move. This warm, woody scent has skyrocketed to the front of my fragrance collection, and I even have it in rollerball form to refresh during the day. It has subtle floral notes of violet, with sultry palo santo and ambrox (the hero ingredient in every You scent). Glossier rarely does discounts, so this Sephora sale is a rare, sneaky chance to knock a few bucks off.” — Karina Hoshikawa, Senior Writer Fara Homidi Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil, $36 “I’m not typically a lipstick or gloss girl, but I’m always on the hunt for the perfect everyday lip pencil to pair with a basic balm. Fara Homidi’s Smudge \u0026 Contour Lip Pencil in minky nails that natural pinky-brown nude that’s balanced and never too warm. The formula is soft, blendable, and comes in packaging that feels utterly luxe.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Ilia Limitless Lash Lengthening Clean Mascara, $29 “ILIA’s mascara has always been a favorite of mine because it delivers a natural look without irritating my sensitive eyes. Now, with a newly-released brown shade in the mix, I’m using the Sephora sale as the perfect excuse to add it to cart.” — Kate Spencer, Senior Affiliate Partnerships Manager Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm, $24 “Every purse of mine is a graveyard for balms and glosses I’ve loved, used, and, sadly, forgotten about — except one. Summer Fridays’ Lip Butter Balm — it’s  the only product I’ve finished down to the last drop, and I keep coming back for more. I love the Iced Coffee and Hot Cocoa shades, both of which lend a wash of juicy nude that’s perfect for everyday wear. Cherry is the next hue on my list. It’s giving juicy, just-bitten glossy lips while nourishing with shea and murumuru seed butter — unbeatable!” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush, $27 “Rare Beauty’s Soft Pinch Luminous Powder Blush brings a radiant, backlit glow to my complexion (it’s so convincingly natural, people always ask what’s my secret). It blends seamlessly (unlike most powders) and doesn’t budge until I’m ready to call it a day. I’m so smitten that I even gifted various shades to my mum and grandma. The airbrushed finish serves major smooth and plump. Plus, I love using a touch on my eyelids for a subtle, effortless glint.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, Beauty Director Amika Reset Cleansing Oil, $30 “I’ve tried my fair share of clarifying hair products, but Amika’s Reset Range remains the gold standard for me. I started using this cleansing oil in college as a pre-shampoo treatment, and it still works wonders for banishing buildup and that greasy scalp feeling. The charcoal-infused formula transforms into oil and foams up beautifully. I go through it fast, so I’ve got my calendar marked for a discounted restock.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Milk Makeup Hydro Grip + Glow Illuminating Primer, $30 “I’m already an OG Milk Makeup Hydro Grip Primer stan — it locks in makeup all day, hydrates without greasiness, and creates a flawless base (sans pilling). For summer, I’m excited to give the Illuminating Grip + Glow Primer a go, which promises to prime, prep, and give my skin that lit-from-within glow.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, $24 “I swear by this lip sleeping mask! I keep two pots close by my side— one as the final step of my nighttime routine (waking up to baby-soft lips), and one on my desk for an on-the-go boost of softness and sticky-free shine. The Sephora Spring Sale is the time to stock up.” — Esther Newman, Affiliate Writer Chunks Medium Box Hair Claw Clip in Olive Check, $22 “If you’re hunting for a hair claw that won’t snap after a few uses, look no further — Chunks clips are elite. The AAPI-founded brand cracked the indestructible code with its FSC-certified cellulose acetate, a plant-based bio-plastic. I’m almost always rocking an updo, and these never hurt my head – this olive checkerboard print is calling my name for spring.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Ultra Violette Supreme Screen SPF Facial Sunscreen, $36 “Our beauty editors introduced me to this Australian sunscreen brand Ultra Violette, and I’ve been eager to test the Supreme Screen SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Moisturizer and Primer for my daily SPF protection. With sun season fast approaching, I’m thrilled to add this non-greasy, no-pilling formula to my daily routine.” — Lisa Dionisio, Newsletter Director Merit Signature Lip Sheer Lip Liner, $24 “Lip liners are the moment, and I’m loving MERIT’s latest fleet of buttery-smooth, beginner-friendly blurring liners. They add just the right dimension without looking overdone. I’ve been defaulting to Brownstone to match my coffee-hued lip gloss for a ‘90s-inspired look, but I’m excited to get my hands on Coupé —  a soft pink that’s quite difficult to find in a shade.” — Venus Wong, Senior Writer Like what you see?
