  "description": "It's no secret that I'm a huge fan of hair hacks, especially of the heatless variety. I've been on a healthy hair journey for the last few months, and any activity that promises to make my hair look good with minimal damage is at the top of my list to test. One thing I've noticed about overnight hair hacks, however, is that they tend to be really freaking uncomfortable to sleep in. I'm not a great sleeper in general (despite my meticulous nighttime routine, which includes melatonin, a white noise machine, and red lights - just to name a few), so adding a funky contraption on my head really doesn't help matters. I get annoyed even sleeping with a silk bonnet, and sometimes I have to make a decision between getting a full eight hours and waking up with a frizzy mess. Recently, I came across a viral heatless curl hack on TikTok that users on the platform have confidently deemed \"extremely comfortable to sleep in.\" Rather than using a heatless hair rod, it made use of a silk scarf. Keep reading to hear how my experience went. Testing this hack came at the perfect time - I had a date the night before, so I washed and dried my hair. However, I needed my blowout to last me the next day until it was time to go out on a second date (I'm really trying to cram things in before the end of the year) because I didn't want to style my hair two days in a row. Once I got home from said first date, I quickly took a body shower, hopped out, grabbed the scarf I had on hand, and got to work. I won't lie - getting my hair set up with this method took a little finagling. Most people started out with damp hair, but mine was completely dry. I wrapped my scarf so it looked like a little taquito and placed it around the back of my head before securing it with a claw clip. I divided my hair into two sections split down the middle, and I started braiding the left side of my hair but subbed in the scarf as the third piece of hair. Once I finished braiding the first half, I secured it with a silk hair tie and I moved onto the other side. When both were finished, I twisted them up together and tied them using the ends of the scarf. A few tutorials showed people spritzing their hair with hairspray, but I opted to skip that step because I didn't want to add any product to my hair. Then, I headed to bed. I popped 10 mg of melatonin as I usually do and I only woke up once in the middle of the night to use the bathroom. The heatless hair method wasn't uncomfortable to sleep on whatsoever, and I could actually switch from lying on my back to my side easily without hesitation. The real test, though, was seeing how everything looked in the morning. When I got up and unwrapped my hair, I was shocked to see how much volume I had at the roots compared to other overnight heatless curls. The curls were the tiniest bit tighter than I wanted them to be, however, once I brushed them out, they looked amazing. It's safe to say this is going to be my new go-to hair hack.
