  "description": "What do butterflies, wolves, manta rays, and jellyfish all have in common? Besides the fact that they're all animals, they're all also the names of trending haircuts. We might even go so far as to label 2024 the year everyone went crazy for dramatic, animal-themed chops. And if you thought the weird animal-inspired haircuts were behind us, you thought wrong. The latest, called the \"alpaca haircut,\" is gearing up to be the cut of the summer. The name stems from the fact that those who wear it look kind of look like . . . well, an alpaca. It's sheared short on the sides but fluffier on top than a cloud. Similar to the broccoli haircut, this look is a short hairstyle primarily seen on men (think some of your favorite TikTok-ers, like Noah Beck), but it really has the versatility to work on anyone. Ahead, we're breaking down everything you need to know about the trending look, like what hair type and texture it works best on, how to ask your hairstylist for the cut, and how to style it at home. Keep scrolling to learn more. Experts Featured in This Article Brendnetta Ashley is the professional digital artistic ambassador for Schwarzkopf. What Is the Alpaca Haircut? When it comes to the alpaca haircut, the motto is the fluffier, the better. \"The alpaca haircut is a short, layered cut known for its soft, fluffy texture and rounded silhouette - reminiscent of an alpaca's plush coat,\" says Brendnetta Ashley, professional digital artistic ambassador for Schwarzkopf. The look typically features a rounded shape around the crown of the head, very full face-framing bangs, volume at the roots, and tapering on the sides or the back. \"This cut really shines with those who have curly or wavy hair,\" Ashley says. \"If your hair is straight, it's suggested you get a perm to achieve the look.\" How to Achieve an Alpaca Haircut The best way to ensure that you and your hairstylist are on the same page at your appointment is to show up with inspiration photos in hand. Try to look for someone with a similar hair type and texture to your own. \"Ask for a short, layered haircut with a rounded silhouette,\" Ashley says. \"It should be shorter on the sides than it is at the crown of the head.\" One thing to note: if you want to keep up with the look, you will find yourself in the salon chair at least once a month. \"With a cut this structured, maintenance is key,\" Ashley adds. \"I would recommend getting a trim every three to four weeks to maintain the shape of the cut.\" How to Style an Alpaca Haircut \"[When] styling a cut like the alpaca, it's important to control frizz while maintaining volume,\" Ashley says. She recommends using the Schwarzkopf OSiS+ Upload Volume Cream ($22) on the top of the head to add lift and body. \"For the shorter sides of the cut, I would recommend using a wax, like the Schwarzkopf OSiS+ Flexwax [$22], to keep hair in place without the traditional wax stiffness,\" Ashley adds. Pro tip: if your hair type is naturally curly, Ashley recommends diffusing the hair prior to applying product, which she says will help define your hair's natural shape.
