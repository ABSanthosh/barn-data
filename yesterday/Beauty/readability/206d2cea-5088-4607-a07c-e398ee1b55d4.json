  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic For some people, having a partner get a tattoo of you would be jarring, but for Nicola Peltz Beckham, it always felt right. \"I was just so obsessed with him,\" she says of her now husband, Brooklyn Peltz Beckham. \"If I wasn't, then I would be like, wait. . . what?\" Clearly, the feeling was mutual, as Brooklyn has amassed over 70 tattoos just for her to date. With so many options to choose from, you'd think it'd be hard to pick a favorite, but not for her. \"The one of me that I love is my eyes on the back of his neck. But I love when he surprises me and does tattoos for my family,\" she says. \"It really means a lot to me.\" Other notable designs in Nicola's honor include a quote from her grandmother in her handwriting, her mother's rosary on his hands, a bunny in honor of her other grandmother by that name, and something even more permanent than a ring to tell the world he's taken - a tattoo of the word \"married\" on his hand. The couple's synergy doesn't end there - they're also known for matching on date nights and red carpets, and getting twinning skin-care treatments. \"I'll bet getting a facial - I've gone to Lena at Carasoin Salon since I was 17 - and Brooklyn will just walk in and hang as I'm getting my pimples popped,\" Nicola says. \"But there was one time we got two facials and they connected our beds, and [Brooklyn] was like, 'That was so fun.'\" But that's not a regular occurrence. \"He literally washes his face with body wash.\" If you think Nicola's perfect skin comes just from facials alone, think again. She credits her mother, who encouraged sunscreen from an early age. \"She would dunk me in it as a toddler,\" Nicola says. Her go-to formula now is the Isdin Fusion Water Magic SPF 40 Sunscreen ($38). \"It's tricky to find the perfect sunblock,\" which is why she's partnered with the brand. \"It lays perfectly under makeup. I even put it with my makeup - I'll put a squirt in my hand and put a squirt of foundation in my hand and I'll just mix both of them,\" she says. \"It just goes on really, really nicely, and I feel like that's hard to find.\" Image Source: Nicola Peltz Beckham Her other beauty must-haves include the Benefit Cosmetics Benetint Liquid Lip + Cheek Blush Stain ($26) and the Dior Rosy Glow Blush ($40). \"I feel like blush changes my face. I feel naked without it.\" When it comes to hair, Nicola made a dramatic shift from the bright blond she had at her wedding to her natural brunette shade in 2022, and she's stuck with it ever since. She loves it so much she's been contemplating if she should have made the change sooner. \"I asked my mom, 'Wait, should I have been brunette for my wedding?' And she's like, 'You're fine, get over it.'\" There's a new hair color that's calling her name, however, so don't be surprised if the brown hue doesn't stick around. \"Brooklyn is always like, 'I want you to go ginger.' He's randomly been telling me that,\" she says. \"That would be so fun.\" Changing up her look doesn't intimidate her; she welcomes it. \"I love any excuse to change and morph into something. That's why I love acting so much. If there's a role that came around and I had to change the way I look, I would love that.\" That role may be on the horizon. With the release of \"Lola\" in 2024 marking her writing and directorial debut, Nicola is just getting started, and she revealed that she's currently working on a new show and new film for 2025.
