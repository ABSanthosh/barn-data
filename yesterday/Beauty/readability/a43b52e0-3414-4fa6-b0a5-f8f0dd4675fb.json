  "text": "Maddie Ziegler has never really been out of the spotlight. She made her reality television debut on \"Dance Moms\" as a 7-year-old in 2011, quickly becoming known as the star of the show (oftentimes to the dismay of her fellow young castmates). Her popularity grew when recording artist Sia tapped Ziegler to perform modern dance routines as her official mini-me on many of the world's largest stages.Ziegler only continued to solidify her \"It\" girl status among Gen Z and Gen Alpha with guest appearances on Zoomer-beloved shows like \"Pretty Little Liars\" and \"Austin and Ally.\" Her online following surged, now reaching 13.3 million on Instagram. Young girls look to the 22-year-old's profile for her \"clean girl\" beauty inspiration, minimalist style and many front-row fashion week appearances.With all this influence on the younger generation in mind, it makes perfect sense that Maison Margiela's fragrance brand Replica selected her to be its latest ambassador — specifically as the face of its new fragrance, Never-ending Summer. (The brand describes it as a \"fresh citrus fragrance that captures the feeling of eternal summer.\") In the campaign, Ziegler can be seen dreamily dancing around a \"memory box\" that takes her back to remembrances of time spent on Italian beaches. Ziegler says that the new partnership is a full-circle moment for her (and not just as someone who is already very immersed in the beauty influencing space).\"I have always really cared about the feelings that scents evoke. It's very personal to me,\" she tells Fashionista. \"I love when people walk past someone and they're like, 'That smells like Maddie.'\"Like many people, Ziegler's introduction to the brand was as a consumer of its best-selling scent By The Fireplace. \"I'm honestly such a fan. I love walking by people and feeling like, 'I know that smell.' So it's such a dream come true for me to work with Replica and Margiela. It really aligns so well with my personal life.\"Ahead, Ziegler tells us more about her full beauty routine, the nostalgic smells of orange popsicles and s'mores in the summer, the makeup preferences she's left behind from her \"Dance Moms\" days and much more.Photo: Courtesy of Maison Margiela FragrancesWhat types of scents are you typically drawn to?I love a more sweet, sort of effortless, cool-girl scent. For spring and summer, I love a more citrusy, light scent. It just makes me feel like my most carefree self and a lot more energized.What about this new Margiela fragrance attracts you?I really connect with this fragrance because there's orange, there's Italian spritz and vetiver, which is such a nice combination, and really makes for this summery, fresh smell. I love everything about it. I also really love Afternoon Delight — anything vanilla or with white musk. Those are two notes I always come back to. I've been alternating between Never-ending Summer and Afternoon Delight year-round.Do you have any favorite summer memories associated with smell?I do have vivid memories of going on summer vacations with my family and always getting a mocktail version of a spritz. But even simple things like when I've spent summers in New York — it's so fun to go out with friends and get an orange drink. The Italian spritz note is so unique and something that I've truly never smelled before, but it still takes me directly to those memories.Where's your favorite place to get a spritz?In New York, one of my closest family friends, Grace, lives in the West Village. There's a place just around the corner from her apartment that is just so fun.I haven't done the full European vacation yet, and that is my dream. My sister did it a year ago and went with six of her girlfriends and said it was the most incredible thing she'd ever done. So I'm really looking forward to hopefully doing that this summer if I have time. Everyone says when you do the Italian summer, you never forget it. I feel like now is the perfect age — early 20s — to just go and have fun and enjoy. When I go to Italy and wear Never-ending Summer it's going to be like, literally, I am Italy.What are your favorite non-perfume smells?Anything dessert, for sure. Fresh cookies are so amazing. But I'm also a clean freak so I love the smell of when my house is freshly cleaned. Fresh linens, clean floors — it's literally my favorite thing ever. This might be weird, but I also love the smell of my dog after they have a fresh bath. But I also love his little Fritos toes. I also love to have flowers throughout my house. Anything that feels fresh and keeps me energized and happy. That's why I love desserts — they're the ultimate mood booster. You can't be sad around them.What's the most romantic scent you can smell on another person?Scroll to ContinueRecommended ArticlesI have two answers: Afternoon Delight, because it's a nice mixture of feminine and masculine with the vanilla and musk. It feels very romantic and warm. If I smell that on someone, I always want to be around them. Other than that, my answer is the first fragrance I ever smelled from Replica — By The Fireplace. It's classic and it's so cozy. It feels like a very intimate sort of smell because of how warm and inviting it is.Is there a smell that feels nostalgic to you?Growing up in Pittsburgh, my friends and my sister and I would go late-night swimming. And we had a little fire in our backyard, so making s'mores by the campfire is the most nostalgic thing for both of us. Also, waking up during the summertime as a kid, I'd just want to wake up early, get in the pool immediately and then sit in the sun with an orange popsicle. My mom would always give us those when it was really hot out. I love how scents like that can take you back in time and make you feel so connected to your younger self.Walk us through your daytime skin-care routine.I have acne-prone skin, so in the morning, I start with a very gentle cleanser. Then I go in with a hyaluronic acid and vitamin C serum. That's followed by a light moisturizer and lots of sunscreen. When I was younger — like everyone — I didn't feel like I needed sunscreen or I would just forget about it. But now I know how important it is. Even my facialist was like, 'You have a sunspot.' So I load up on the sunscreen and do a lip balm or tint. For my makeup, I always keep it simple. I usually match my cheek to my lip, use a skin tint, use some brow gel and curl my lashes.I try to keep my routine as clean as possible, as someone with sensitive skin. I'm learning that the less ingredients there are, the better the product is for me.How does your makeup routine change for performances or red carpet appearances?It's crazy how I wear way less makeup now than I did when I was 8 years old. I was wearing full fake eyelashes and a red lip when I was 6 for competitions. I think because I wore so much makeup when I was younger, I almost grew out of it — it's just not me anymore. I definitely feel a lot more confident in my skin now too, so less is more for me. Sometimes I feel like my makeup artist, Tonya [Brewer], gets so sick of me being like, 'I just want a natural, fresh face!' But it ultimately does make me feel the most confident. Maddie Ziegler attends the Miu Miu Fall 2024 show.Photo: Marc Piasecki/WireImageHow does your skin-care routine change at night?Sometimes I'll add an acne gel and put that on any spots. I also love to do either red light or blue light therapy masks. I have a really big one that makes me look like a robot. I also do the castor oil packs on my stomach, which I think really helps with digestion and bloating. You see things on TikTok like that and it feels questionable, but it really does work. I also love to an ice cube on my face to help with any inflammation. I use pimple patches if needed. And I also use a high-frequency wand sometimes.Depending on if I had makeup on during the day, I'll double cleanse and sometimes do a detoxifying or purifying mask. I just really try to listen to my skin. If it's looking good, I try not to disrupt it.What is your hair routine like?That's something I need to work on more. I am so grateful to have been blessed with very, very thick hair — and too much of it, really. Sometimes after a shower, I'll do a mask. But my best friend is a leave-in conditioner. Again, I feel like less is more with my hair. I usually feel good about how it is naturally. I had to go blonde last year for a film I was doing and all I could think was, 'I should've worn a wig,' because the texture of my hair completely changed. I'm very glad to be back on my regular routine and have my dark hair again. But for a second there I was a little worried.Do you have any beauty secrets that people might not know about?I know it's cliché, but it's just that I feel like less is more. I love anything timeless and am always thinking about how things are going to age. I know being on-trend is so hot and great, but I love longevity and things that can last and stand the test of time. Even just from six years ago, I'll look back and be like, 'Ooh, this is not cute girl. What were you thinking?'In fashion, I like to find classic pieces so that I'll always like the result in a few years. This isn't really a tip, but other than that, I'd say just do what makes you feel good. For beauty and fashion especially, I do it intuitively. If it feels good to you in the moment and it speaks to you, you should do that.This interview has been edited for clarity.Please note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.

Sometimes I feel like my makeup artist, \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thetonyabrewer/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\" onclick=\"return phoenixTrackClickEvent(this, event);\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTonya [Brewer]\u003c/a\u003e, gets so sick of me being like, \u0026#39;I just want a natural, fresh face!\u0026#39; But it ultimately does make me feel the most confident. \u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"\u003e\u003cphoenix-picture\u003e\u003ca\u003e\u003cpicture\u003e\u003csource type=\"image/webp\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.webp 380w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.webp 620w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.webp 700w\"/\u003e\u003csource sizes=\"(min-width: 1240px) 700px, (min-width: 675px) 620px, calc(100vw - 40px)\" data-srcset=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_380/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.jpg 380w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.jpg 620w, https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.jpg 700w\"/\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Maddie Ziegler attends the Miu Miu Fall 2024 show.\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.jpg\" data-src=\"https://fashionista.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_700/MjEzNjI3MjgwODkzNjgzNTQ5/maddie-ziegler.jpg\" height=\"7244\" width=\"4831\" srcset=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7\" itemprop=\"contentUrl url\"/\u003e\u003c/picture\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/phoenix-picture\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"caption\"\u003eMaddie Ziegler attends the Miu Miu Fall 2024 show.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp itemprop=\"author\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Marc Piasecki/WireImage\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does your skin-care routine change at night?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes I\u0026#39;ll add an acne gel and put that on any spots. I also love to do either red light or blue light therapy masks. I have a really big one that makes me look like a robot. I also do the castor oil packs on my stomach, which I think really helps with digestion and bloating. You see things on TikTok like that and it feels questionable, but it really does work. I also love to an ice cube on my face to help with any inflammation. I use pimple patches if needed. And I also use a high-frequency wand sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDepending on if I had makeup on during the day, I\u0026#39;ll double cleanse and sometimes do a detoxifying or purifying mask. I just really try to listen to my skin. If it\u0026#39;s looking good, I try not to disrupt it.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your hair routine like?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026#39;s something I need to work on more. I am so grateful to have been blessed with very, very thick hair — and too much of it, really. Sometimes after a shower, I\u0026#39;ll do a mask. But my best friend is a leave-in conditioner. Again, I feel like less is more with my hair. I usually feel good about how it is naturally. I had to go blonde last year for a film I was doing and all I could think was, \u0026#39;I should\u0026#39;ve worn a wig,\u0026#39; because the texture of my hair completely changed. I\u0026#39;m very glad to be back on my regular routine and have my dark hair again. But for a second there I was a little worried.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you have any beauty secrets that people might not know about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI know it\u0026#39;s cliché, but it\u0026#39;s just that I feel like less is more. I love anything timeless and am always thinking about how things are going to age. I know being on-trend is so hot and great, but I love longevity and things that can last and stand the test of time. Even just from six years ago, I\u0026#39;ll look back and be like, \u0026#39;Ooh, this is not cute girl. What were you thinking?\u0026#39;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn fashion, I like to find classic pieces so that I\u0026#39;ll always like the result in a few years. This isn\u0026#39;t really a tip, but other than that, I\u0026#39;d say just do what makes you feel good. For beauty and fashion especially, I do it intuitively. If it feels good to you in the moment and it speaks to you, you should do that.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis interview has been edited for clarity.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003ePlease note: Occasionally, we use affiliate links on our site.
