  "description": "Image Source: Getty As a social content producer, I love testing out new products and sharing my honest two cents about them. That being said, I'm not really a subscription girl. I find them impersonal, and I often feel like I'm paying way too much for things I don't want or necessarily need. Most of the time, they're not tailored to my specific needs - whether that's skin care, hair care, or makeup. So I've often felt like, \"What's the point?\" OK, rant over. I cautiously tried Dabble - PS's free beauty product membership. It isn't a subscription service, which put me at ease, and, best of all - saying it again for dramatic effect - it's free. In this economy? Unheard of. If you want to learn more about Dabble and my personal experience with it, keep reading. Image Source: Courtesy of Dabble How Dabble Works To sign up for Dabble, you first need to create an account on the website. It'll ask for basic information, such as your name, email address, the gender you identify as, and your ethnic background (the latter two are optional). Next, you'll enter your mailing address. Then, the fun begins. You'll be asked questions about your preference for each category. In skin care, you'll provide details about your skin type, skin tone, sensitivity, and concerns, like dark circles and discoloration. For makeup, questions include your foundation coverage preference, how often you wear makeup, lip finish preference, and whether you prefer dewy, matte, or natural finishes. In the hair department, it'll ask about your hair type, volume, color, whether it's dyed, and any concerns, such as dryness and breakage. Lastly, for fragrance, you'll select your preferred notes, how often you wear perfume, and your ideal fragrance strength. Image Source: Courtesy of Dabble Once you complete the questionnaire, you'll verify your email and mailing address to start receiving products. After completing the sign-up steps, your Dabble profile will populate with products that are available to you. There will also be a section for you to review the items you've received. In the \"available products\" section, curated items tailored to your preferences will appear when they become available. Since Dabble isn't a subscription service, it's worth noting that it may take a while to receive a product, as selections are customized to your specific needs. Image Source: Courtesy of Dabble What I Like About Dabble It took a few months for me to receive my first product, which was frustrating at first. However, as I thought about it more, I realized this delay is intentional: Dabble isn't a subscription service. It's focused on tailoring the experience to your preferences based on the products you've expressed interest in and your concerns. You won't receive a slew of random products that ultimately collect dust in the corners of your vanity; it feels more personal and intimate. In my opinion, this is the best approach for a free service - you won't be inundated with products on a monthly basis. If you're someone who's mindful about overconsumption, Dabble is definitely for you. It's like an unexpected little treat that shows up at your doorstep every once in a while. Who doesn't love that? What's Worth Noting About Dabble For a free service, I was pleasantly surprised by the generous sample sizes. My first delivery was a couple of skin-care products, and as someone who believes it takes at least a month to see real results, I think the sample size I received could easily last that long - maybe even a bit longer. Image Source: Ps Photography / Shari Straker The Bottom Line: Is Dabble Worth It? I got a sample of the Avène Cleanance Medicated Clearing Gel Cleanser ($19) and the Avène Cleanance Medicated Clearing Treatment ($32) based on my preferences - two products I had never tried before. So far, I've been liking them a lot. A free membership that sends you a generously sized product to test before committing to a full-size purchase? It's a big yes for me.
