  "description": "If it's not Sof√≠a Vergara's sultry ensembles that constantly leave us reeling, it's her makeup. The former \"Modern Family\" star is notorious for her red carpet glam that features subtle yet powerful details like bold eyeshadow, providing edge in combination with her sleek, bronzy hair. While it's easy to gawk at her beauty as a whole, there's one element that's especially noteworthy: her foundation. Vergara is never seen without a flawless base, and we have Anastasia Beverly Hills to thank for it. The Emmy-nominated actress wears the cult-favorite brand that's well within arm's reach. At the 2025 Golden Globes, she dominated the red carpet in a black body-hugging strapless mermaid gown by Georges Chakra (one of her signature silhouettes), Lorraine Schwartz jewelry, and of course, the most seamless-looking makeup crafted by her go-to makeup artist, Sabrina Bedrani. All products used were from California-based brand Anastasia Beverly Hills, with the Anastasia Beverly Hills Impeccable Blurring Second-Skin Matte Foundation ($46) being the main character (the product made its debut on Vergara first, then launched days later worldwide). In an Instagram post, Bedrani revealed that she used the shade \"3N,\" along with the brand's concealer, bronzer, blush, and highlighter to achieve Vergara's stellar glam. The foundation, which is credited as market research company Circana's No. 1 beauty launch of the year, according to Hollywood Reporter, boasts medium to full coverage that can last up to 12 hours, and Vergara's makeup is undeniable proof. It's also formulated with ingredients like hyaluronic acid, bixa orellana, and phytoglycogen, which all work to hydrate the skin, blur imperfections and pores, and boost collagen production for that vibrant, youthful glow, according to the brand. @tymarz Trying the New Anastasia Beverly Hills Impeccable Blurring Second Skin Matte Foundation in shades 00N \u0026 0CR.

Many users have praised the product for its hydrating capabilities, despite its matte finish and shade range. BeautyTok aficionados have also noted the product does indeed live up to its name, with the foundation bestowing a second-skin look that truly blurs pores, and also works for various skin types: dry, oily, and combination included. Whether you're a makeup lover on the hunt for an everyday-worthy foundation or a self-proclaimed novice still learning the ropes, be sure to add this foundation to your Sephora cart. If Vergara's makeup is any indicator, this is a purchase you won't regret.",
