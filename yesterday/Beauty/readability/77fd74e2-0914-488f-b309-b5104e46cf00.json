  "description": "If there's one thing to know about me, it's that I love my treatments. I try the newest and most innovative skin care targeting everything from aging to melasma. I'm also never one to turn down a visit to my favorite aesthetician for a relaxing facial. But during the chilly months of the year, I like to treat myself to at-home facials and peels to save myself a trip in the cold. So, when I received the U Beauty Resurfacing Flash Peel ($188), I was extremely excited to try it. I believe in the brand's high-tech formulas and charity component* and heard that this peel delivers near-professional results. A chemical peel in a bottle that transforms your skin in the comfort of your own home? I couldn't pass up the chance to test it out. About U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel It's a first-of-its-kind rapid chemical exfoliator that delivers clinical-grade results after a few minutes of use. It removes dead surface skin quickly and gently without jeopardizing the skin's moisture barrier. There's minimal to no discomfort with usage. It visibly resurfaces the skin and restores moisture to the skin barrier, diminishing the look of pores, fine lines, and wrinkles. You can expect a brighter and smoother-looking complexion after just one use. It contains a form of retinol (retinyl palmitate) to promote cellular turnover. What I Like About U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel This peel's selling point is its pioneering chemical exfoliator that promises clinical-grade results in minutes. Intended to penetrate deep into the epidermis for extensive exfoliation, it aims to surpass a typical at-home peel. With most at-home chemical exfoliants that I have used, I've felt my skin stinging during application and for a few minutes after. I'm accustomed to post-use dry, red, and irritated skin. U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel, on the other hand, tingles for about a second on first contact (which means it's working!) but then quickly tapers off. It feels undetectable on your face and almost - dare I say it - soothing, which is strange considering it is an intense chemical exfoliant. After applying a chemical exfoliant, I usually follow with a barrier-boosting moisturizer, but with U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel, there was no need: My skin felt balanced, glowing, and refreshed. This effect can be attributed to the brand's sophisticated formula, which boasts capsules that deliver key vitamins (stabilized vitamins C and E) and nutrients into the skin, while AHAs, BHAs, and fruit acids gently slough away dead skin cells without compromising the skin's moisture barrier. It also helps to visibly boost the skin's restorative response, which is what gives it that healthy-looking glow. The addition of pro-vitamin B, aloe, and purified oat extract balances out the skin while protecting the skin from environmental stressors and transepidermal water loss (aka dehydration). How to Use U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel The peel is incredibly easy to use: Before use, cleanse your face with a gentle cleanser, avoiding any cleansers or exfoliants with active ingredients. Once your face is completely dry, take a masking brush to apply the peel evenly all over your face and neck. Avoid direct eye contact and placing the peel on any areas of the skin that are overly sensitive, dry, or flaky. The brand recommends wearing the peel for 510 minutes, depending on how much your skin can handle it. With regular once-a-week usage, the peel can be applied for up to 20 minutes. After you wash it off with lukewarm water, follow with your usual skin care - minus any actives - to ensure you won't experience irritation. It's still a chemical peel, after all. What to Consider Before Trying U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel If you have extremely sensitive skin, proceed with caution. Try a patch test of the product on your forearm or neck before you apply the peel. Also, consider the cost of the product and whether or not you will be a dedicated weekly user. Regular usage yields the most benefit for your money and the best possible results. Additionally, because the peel contains a form of retinol, if you are pregnant or nursing, consult your doctor before using. Is U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel Worth the Splurge? U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel is absolutely worth the splurge because of the unmatched at-home results. Though the product is pricey, with my experience of using the product consistently for the past four weeks, I believe it delivers similar results to those from a light, professional-grade chemical peel treatment, which is typically more expensive. With multiple uses, you can feasibly end up saving yourself not only a trip to your aesthetician or provider but money in the long run. Where Is U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel Available? U Beauty's Resurfacing Flash Peel is available at UBEAUTY.com, Dermstore.com, Nordstrom.com, and VioletGrey.com.
