The latest manicure trend to emerge is just as sophisticated, but there’s a little more edge to it. Enter: “Angel” chrome nails. View this post on Instagram A post shared by San Sung Kim | 김산성 (@sansungnails) What are angel chrome nails? Coined by nail artist San Sung Kim, angel chrome typically consists of a nude base — similar to that of soap nails. It then enlists a cat eye gel polish with magnetic particles to create a glassy finish and is topped with a dusting of chrome in the centre. Kim’s viral creation isn’t the only iteration. Clara Clarissa Rianto‘s version boasts silver cat eye polish with a slick of chrome at the very tip of the nail. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Clara Clarissa Rianto (@cclaracr) “Angel chrome nails are a soft, ethereal take on chrome nails, featuring a dreamy, pearlescent glow with a delicate, almost angelic sheen,” explains pro nail artist Jessica White. Created by layering a few different polishes, angel chrome nails tend to use a soft color palette with a hint of shimmer. “They usually have an opalescent or milky white base with a reflective, iridescent chrome powder layered on top, giving them a luminous, otherworldly effect,” says White. Some nail artists are also referring to the trend as “aurora” nails because the finish often resembles the glimmering Aurora Borealis. Just like the other subtle nail art that’s proving popular right now, angel chrome nails are all about embracing a color palette of pretty neutrals and soft pastels. The difference between a finish like this and something like a nail tint is the finish: ultra-shiny, slightly metallic and deliciously glossy, almost as though your natural nails have been dipped in pearls. @lostcherrybunny @✧˖° ally🐰ྀི i love cat eye sm 😭 #chromenails #cateyenails #gelx #nailart #nailtutorial ♬ ABCD – NAYEON How do you create angel chrome nails? Much of the inspiration that I’ve spotted online has been gel manicures, and White points out that this is because a professional chrome powder application over gel lends the most intense effect. Plus, magnetic cat eye polish is usually a gel. Happily, it is also possible to recreate a similar look at home. “Start with a sheer, milky white or soft pink base coat, then apply a pearlescent or iridescent top coat to create that signature glow,” White explains. She recommends OPI Funny Bunny, $11.99, a soft milky white, with OPI Kyoto Pearl, $11.99, a shimmery shade, layered on top to create “the classic angel chrome look with a pure, heavenly glow” at home. To enhance that glassy, three-dimensional look and to help the iridescent colors beneath pop, finish with a high-shine glossy top coat like Essie Gel Couture Gel Top Coat, $13. Alternatively, if you want a speedy alternative to layering up polishes then White suggests using one of the brilliant chrome-effect nail polishes on the market instead. Nails Inc. Better On Top, $9, and Sally Hansen Miracle Gel Nail Polish in Let’s Get Digital, $12.99, are two great options. @itsalifestylenails Replying to @bannabrii I hope this tutorial makes you want to try out this cat eye look!
