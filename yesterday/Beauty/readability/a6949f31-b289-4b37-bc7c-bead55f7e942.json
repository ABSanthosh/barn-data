  "description": "Keke Palmer is not only known for being a multi-hyphenate in Hollywood, but she's a mainstay trendsetter in the fashion and beauty space to boot. Earlier this year, she turned heads with her trending cowboy copper hair color, and over the weekend, she dropped her new manicure set on Instagram - a fiery Aries-season take on aura nails. ICYMI, aura nails refers to the nail design trend that began in 2021, but has taken off as of late, thanks to both the fun energy they portray, and the easy way you can customize the colors to match your personality and overall vibe. They look just like the spread of color that comes out of an aura photograph, but when they're on a nail design, they don't have to predict your aura. They're more of an energetic aura representation that you can choose for yourself as a sort of manifestation. To recreate aura nails at home or the salon, they require a base color and a bright, opposing color that seeps out from the middle of the nail and bleeds over to the base color. Longer nails work best since you can feature the two colors more prominently. Palmer's aura nails debut were documented on her Instagram as she donned a quintessentially nostalgic Y2K look that included smoky eyeshadow, a graphic tee, and bright red lipstick. After all, her Insta bio does read \"Millennial Diva,\" so if we're going to refer to anyone on how to do early aughts throwbacks, it's going to be Palmer. Although she didn't tag a nail artist in her photo, Palmer has worked with artist Bria Monae in the past, who has tons of aura-inspired nail looks on her page. Palmer's set features a black base color and a fiery red color at the center. And although Aries season is still a few days away (don't come for us, Pisces!), it's a great nod to the fiery, bold energy that the Aries sign represents. What Does a Red Aura Mean? In addition to the nail look being perfect for Aries season, a red aura in general embodies a lot of the traits that Aries represents in the zodiac. According to Healthline, red auras are indicative of being energetic, strong willed, and grounded. As the first sign in the zodiac, Aries are known for being fearless leaders who show others the way by going first. Magic Jewelry, one of New York City's premiere aura photograph locations, notes that if you see a red color in your aura reading photograph, it represents having power, strong leadership skills, and vitality, motivation, and courage, which Palmer certainly checks all the boxes for. Whether your aura reads fiery red or not, getting Palmer's red aura-inspired mani can be a great way to manifest those qualities in yourself and in your interactions with those around you. Take Palmer's nail pic with you to the salon as inspo, or choose your own mix of red, pink, and orange colors.
