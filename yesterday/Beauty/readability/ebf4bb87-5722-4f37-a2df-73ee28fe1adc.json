  "description": "If you're a beauty aficionado, chances are you've heard of Mario Dedivanovic. You know, Kim Kardashian's makeup artist? Not only is he the man behind some of the star's most iconic beauty looks to date, but he's also the founder and CEO of Makeup by Mario, the brand responsible for creating some of our favorite products. (Truly, we can't live without the Master Mattes Eyeshadow Palette or its contour sticks.) So, when we found out the brand was launching its first-ever mascara, we obviously had to put it to the test. Launching March 27, 2025, this volumizing mascara aims to give lashes a fuller lift with just a few swipes. The brand promises no clumping or smudging in this long-wear, sweat- and humidity-proof, flake-resistant formula. It comes equipped with a conical-shaped brush that helps give eyelashes definition. The key ingredients include castor oil and provitamin B5 to condition eyelashes, as well as high-performance polymer and a vegan wax blend for volume. It's also clean, vegan, ophthalmologist-tested, and cruelty-free. It's available in one shade - super black. Ahead, three editors with different eyelash types try the new Makeup by Mario Master Mascara ($28, launching March 27). Keep scrolling to read their honest thoughts.",

I had high hopes with this one from Makeup by Mario (after all, it's Mario), but it definitely surpassed my expectations. I loved how much volume it gave my lashes with one swipe and how lightweight it felt. It didn't clump my lashes together like my other mascaras tend to do, making my eyes pop instantly. I'll be using this product until further notice.\" — Naomi Parris, part-time assistant shopping editor Rating: ★★★★☆PS Photography | Renee Rodriguez\"I'm picky when it comes to mascaras — I have short, stubby lashes that stick straight out, and if I don't have any product on them, you honestly wouldn't know they were there. In a perfect world, my mascara would separate my lashes, lengthen them, add curl, not smudge or have fallout, but also be easy to take off at the end of the day. While this new product doesn't check all of my boxes, it does hit most of them. It's totally transfer-proof but still easy to remove when the time comes, I never have to deal with clumps or flaking, and it lifts my lashes to high heaven. I do have to curl my lashes prior to use, but that's no biggie. The brush's conical shape might be my favorite feature — it makes it easy to coat every single lash.\" — Renee Rodriguez, staff writer and social producer Rating: ★★★★☆PS Photography | Jessica Harrington\"As soon as I pulled the Makeup by Mario Master Mascara wand out of the tube I knew I was in for a treat. It has that cone-shaped soft bristle brush that I love because it really grabs your lashes. The formula itself gives you ultra long and wispy lashes that have a dramatic, tapered end — it's not thick or goopy by any means. I applied quite a few coats to get my desired look, and looking back, I feel like I could have gone for a few more. I found that some of my lashes stuck together a little bit, but running an eyelash comb through them quickly fixed the issue. I tested it for the first time on a rainy day in New York where I was running around for 14 hours straight, and I didn't experience any fallout or smudging, which is a major win.\" — Jessica Harrington, senior beauty editor Rating: ★★★★☆PS Photography | Renee Rodriguez Jessica Harrington Naomi ParrisRenee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
