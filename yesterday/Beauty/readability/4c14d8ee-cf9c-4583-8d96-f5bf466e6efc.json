  "description": "There are countless online sales to keep up with around the Fourth of July, but the annual Ulta Big Summer Beauty Sale occupies a special place in our hearts (and browser tabs). The three-week event, running from June 29 to July 19, is the perfect opportunity to score both summer beauty essentials and investment purchases at deeply discounted prices. What we love about this sale is how it encompasses a wide array of brands across almost every product category, including makeup, skincare, fragrance, hair care, and various beauty tools. There are a handful of offers running throughout the sale period, as well as limited-time deals unveiled week-to-week, to keep our shopping senses tingling. Everything from your favorite cleanser to your go-to sunscreen — even viral K-beauty finds that have recently landed stateside — is now discounted at up to 40% off. The timing can’t be more ideal to strategically restock your beauty cabinet ahead of the peak summer season. But with thousands of deals on Ulta’s sale page, there are a lot of products to sort through. Fear not: we have done the legwork for you and consolidated all the best products to cart up. Read ahead to find out what goes on sale when, plus our editor-approved lineup of on-sale products. DashDividers_1_500x100 Skincare, Body Care \u0026 Suncare: Buy One Get One 40% off Mediheal Madecassoside Blemish Pad, $24 $14.40 When: June 29 to July 19 Ulta is offering buy one, get one 40% off across its sun care, skincare, and body care sections, and it’s definitely worth a scroll. Some of our most-loved affordable skincare brands like Naturium, RoC, and CeraVe are included, making it the perfect time to restock your favorite cleansers and body lotions. At the top of our list? Mediheal’s toner pads, a viral K-beauty staple packed with skin-soothing tea tree essence. They help keep redness and summer breakouts at bay. $100 Off Shark Beauty Shark Beauty FlexStyle Air Styling \u0026 Drying System, $349.99 $249.99 When: June 29 to July 19 Shark’s FlexStyle is an absolute haircare hero in our book. Its powerful air-flow technology and comprehensive family of attachments can style your hair straight or curly in no time, without causing any heat damage. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to hit “add to cart”, we have great news: you can now knock $100 off this beloved blow-dry tool. Up To 40% Off Select Fragrance Marc Jacobs Perfect Eau de Toilette, $137 $82.20 When: July 6 to July 12 It’s pretty rare to see a big chunk knocked off the price of this classic Marc Jacobs scent outside of Black Friday or Cyber Monday. The invigorating blend of peppercorn, cedarwood, and white daffodil never fails to lift our mood and makes for a refreshing summer perfume. You can enjoy 40% off select products from Ulta’s fragrance section until July 12. 30% Off Skincare Tools Solawave 4-in-1 Radiant Renewal Skincare Wand, $169 $118.30 When: June 29 to July 5 If you’ve been thinking about investing in a skincare tool, keep your eyes peeled as the retailer has expanded this year’s sale lineup. Solawave’s skincare wand is one to watch, given its ability to boost collagen production and leave the skin brighter, clearer, and firmer. Given how pricey this gadget is, getting over a quarter off the price is a dream. If you’re looking for something that can help you achieve more radiant skin, the brand’s red light therapy eye mask will also be 30% off. Up to 40% Off Jumbo Haircare Olaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Hair Shampoo, $56 $28 When: June 29 to July 19 Jumbo-sized hair care from the likes of Redken, OUAI, and Pureology will be marked down by 40%. Summer activities can do a number on the hair, which is why we’re eyeing Olaplex’s No.4 Shampoo, which gently cleanses while making hair stronger, shinier, and easier to manage with every wash. With such a hefty discount, now’s the moment to snag a bottle (or two). 40% Off Mascaras Fenty Beauty Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara, $20 $12 When: July 13 to July 19 For the final week of the sale, Ulta will be slashing 40% off a bunch of top-selling mascaras. Our eyes are firmly on Fenty’s Hella Thicc Volumizing Mascara, which impressed us with its moisturizing yet weightless formula and lasting power. We will be stocking up on 40%-off mascara across several other brands, too, including Tarte, IT Cosmetics, and Smashbox. DashDividers_1_500x100 Buy One Get One 50% Off Curl Products PATTERN Deep Scalp Detox, $29 $14.50 When: June 29 to July 19 Ulta’s BOGO sale is a great way to stock up on your everyday beauty essentials, since you can purchase multiple units of the same product and receive half off. We have spotted a few cult-favorites from the retailer’s curl products lineup, such as Pattern’s Deep Scalp Detox, a detoxifying pre-shampoo serum rich in tea tree oil, pink clay, and lemon peel oil. It’s a winner for refreshing your scalp between wash days. Like what you see?
