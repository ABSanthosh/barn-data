  "text": "Hey everyone! Today is the first day for the broadest tier that Nordstrom cardholders can shop the annual Anniversary Sale for 2020. This is honestly one of the top times I go all out and do my clothing shopping for the year since this is one of the few sales that have pre-season items that are marked down, then after the sale is over the items will go back up to full price. I usually stock up on pricier basics that rarely go on sale such as boots or leather jackets, or things that I typically need like beauty care items I use frequently.  Today - any cardholders can shopAug 19 - full public access beginsI placed my order and am waiting for it to ship (I'll post a try-on haul video soon!) But for now I wanted to share a few of my favorites that are still available. Since one of the most difficult issues that arises with the #Nsale is that things quicky run out of stock, I hope this will prove useful! I also made all the graphics clickable so if you like something, just click on the image of that item and it will take you to the page to shop.;)BP Lace Trim Camisole | Naturalizer Callie Boot Chelsea28 Leather Moto Jacket I love slim sleeves on a leather jacket for a sleeker look and this one has really great reviews on the soft leather quality. Dalby Leather Moto Jacket I was keeping an eye out for any classic shades of All Saints jackets (which are great quality pieces) to come in stock and this one popped up recently!On Gossamer Bump It Up Bra This comes in a range of sizes all the way down to 30AAG Farrah Jean These are a great staple light denim skinny. It's an ankle length but the raw hem makes for easy at-home length alterationsColby Boot I own the very similar Callie boot (also available on sale here) and they are such a versatile lace-up boot, especially in this rich brown color. So comfortable and easy to wear with dresses, shorts, and skinny jeans and the rubber sole gives a little platform so it's easier to walk in. Also, the side zipper makes them so easy to take them on and off which is not the case for many similar boots I've seenBP. Open Stitch Cardigan It's actually pretty rare to find a 100% cotton cardigan but this one looks great and comes in multiple colors including black, ivory, grey, olive, and rust   Barefoot Dreams Circle Cardigan This is one of my favorite pieces that keeps coming back each year and is even lower-priced than last year at $68! I've gifted these super soft cardis to my mom and sister and they both rave about itMoonlight Dream Long PajamaI own this in black and it's the softest pajama set ever!BlankNYC Suede Jacket I have a past-season version in blue but this tan is so pretty and timelessTopshop Jamie High Waist Jeans I love and have owned many pairs of the Jamie jeans. They have a super high waist and run a size or two small so I usually pick up a 24 or 25 (versus my usual 23) depending on how roomy I want the fit to beMoonlight Dream Short Pajama I also own this set and wear it during the summer months. Buttons are particularly nice when you are breastfeeding as wellSPANX Faux-Leather Leggings (Petite)These are a great step-up from regular leggings and come in petite sizing as well as regular length and plus-sized versions Hourglass Veil Mineral Primer \u0026 Setting Powder Duo I've used this primer for several years and continue to adore it since it keeps liquid foundation looking fresh in a noticeable way. The setting powder is also nice and airy and I'm glad to see the two available this yearYSL Rouge Volupte Shine Lipstick Set This is one of my holy grail lipsticks! If you like your lips to feel plush and hydrated, this lipstick feels balmy and looks juicy while packaged in a luxe bullet  Beauty Blender \u0026 Cleansing Solid Set It's a good time to stock up on your basic beauty blender, plus the cleansing bar is the BEST for easily cleaning not just sponges but all brushes too L'Occitane Hand Cream I love this hand cream! So necessary to keep on hand especially during these times of frequent hand washing Deborah Lippmann Nail Polish Remover Set I've been doing my nails at home so much more often and having a good polish remover is a game changer Paula's Choice 2% BHA Exfoliant This is a great chemical exfoliant that is a better alternative to use than physical exfoliants, plus salicylic acid is fantastic if you are acne-proneI'll do a full try-on haul so make sure notifications are turned on to my Youtube Channel and follow me on Instagram @frmheadtotoe for mini-reviews on stories! :)",
