  "description": "The Met Gala is back for another year of fundraising and festivities, and some of our favorite celebrities have been bringing the heat nonstop tonight. The 2025 theme is \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" with a dress code of \"Tailored for You.\" Standout moments of the night have brought us everything from \"dollop\" bangs and rhinestone eyebrows to micro bangs on French bobs, but our favorite trend has to be the many different twists on the classic french manicure. The nail look, first popularized in the early '00s, has seen such a resurgence in recent years that it practically deserves its own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. It has become synonymous with formal red carpet events thanks to its versatility, but that same aspect also makes it a perfect manicure for day-to-day wear. Just tonight alone, the trend has been spotted on Sydney Sweeney, Sabrina Carpenter, Tracee Ellis Ross, and more. Even better? No two looks are the same, proving once again how adaptable the trend can be. Ahead, keep scrolling to see some of the best french manicures of the night so far. Between Lizzo's black and white set with 3D detailing, and Carpenter's custom threaded Louis Vuitton look, you'll have nail inspiration to pull from for years to come.",
