Ryan Pearl is a celebrity hairstylist and colorist based between Miami and New York City. He's also the creative director of Tangle Teezer.Brenda Lee Intignano is Cliphair's trends expert. Boho Waves\"With fashion house Chlo√© making a trendsetting return to the runways, boho chic is back in full force,\" says hairstylist Jacob Sirianno. But these aren't the boho styles of the 2010s. \"This time, the waves are all about effortless texture. The beach wave is out, replaced by boho chic waves that feature subtle bends, natural texture, and a bit of frizz for that perfectly undone look.\" To get the look, you'll want to skip the traditional salt sprays in favor of a texture spray, like the Bumble \u0026 Bumble Thickening Dryspun Texture Spray Light ($37). Sirianno also recommends finishing with the Lolavie Sculpting Paste ($29) because it \"creates the most perfect boho wave.\"Bouncy BlowoutBouncy blowouts are everywhere, from the heads of celebrities and influencers to our TikTok feeds. Whether you visit the salon for this look or learn to master it with a round brush and some Velcro rollers, it's a classic look to keep in your back pocket. \"While the '90s blowout remains a favorite, 2025 will see it evolve into a more timeless and effortless style,\" says Sirianno. \"Dramatic body and volume but softer curls and movement will bring this look into all of 2025. Using a flexible product like the Biotera Styling Mousse ($12) will be essential to creating this timeless look.\"\"To enhance your curls with a bit more volume and smoothness, the Tangle Teezer The Ultimate Blow-Dry Hairbrush ($17) will give you that soft, blowout texture that keeps your curls looking polished but effortless,\" says hairstylist Ryan Pearl. \"Think of Kendall Jenner's perfectly styled curls with that loose, bouncy finish.\" Oversized Hair AccessoriesThe return of the oversized hair accessory trend has been a slow burn. It started with the popularization of claw clips and bows, and it's not slowing down any time soon. \"Whether it's a messy french twist or a ponytail, adding oversized hardware can instantly elevate your look,\" says Sirianno. \"In 2025, we'll see chunky hairpins, pony cuffs, and embellished bobby pins as key accessories that bring a bold, chic touch to any hairstyle.\"Pearl seconds this, adding that hair accessories are a way to take any look to the next level. \"Add a statement clip or a vibrant scarf to accentuate your bouncy curls,\" he says. \"Whether you choose a vintage-inspired claw clip, a cute headband, or even a fabric scrunchie, accessories can transform your simple curls into a full-on statement look.\"To get the look, we love the RPZL Women's glossy Arch Pony Morgan Stacked Cuff ($40), Emi Jay Rosette Scrunchie ($10, originally $16), or the Jennifer Behr Agatha Jaw Claw Clip ($125, originally $178). Big CurlsIf messy boho curls aren't your thing, big, bouncy curls may be more your speed. Stars Jennifer Lopez, Zendaya, and Blake Lively have made a case for big, voluminous curls that feel polished yet effortless. \"At the same time, people are turning to hair accessories like oversized clips, scrunchies, and headbands to bring attention to their curls while also making the look unique and stylish,\" says Pearl. Deep Side PartsDespite being shunned by Gen Zers just a few years ago, side parts are getting another chance in 2025. The trend has begun making its way back onto red carpets and magazine covers, depicting its promising return. \"Side partings are not just fashionable but incredibly flattering,\" trend expert Brenda Lee Intignano says. They are flattering on everyone and give your look a touch of instant glamour.
