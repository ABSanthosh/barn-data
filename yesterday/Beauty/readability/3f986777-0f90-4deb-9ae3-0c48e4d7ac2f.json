  "description": "No, you're not imagining it - your skin looks more glowing and your face more symmetrical during the follicular phase of your menstrual cycle. This phase begins right after your period ends and typically lasts about a week. It's when estrogen rises, energy returns and many people naturally feel their best. Just like we have a circadian rhythm, those who menstruate also have an infradian rhythm: a 28-day hormonal cycle, better known as the menstrual cycle. It's made up of four phases - menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal - each one shifts hormones in ways that can impact mood, energy, metabolism, immune system, stress response, and hair and skin. We've suspected this connection when we routinely break out around our period or feel like eating everything in sight right before our period starts. But it wasn't until TikTok users began posting before-and-afters that we started asking why - and whether it's possible to biohack our way into feeling hot all month long, not just for one week. We spoke to experts for a full breakdown of how the menstrual cycle affects your skin, hair, and even confidence levels. Keep reading to learn how to work with your cycle - and look your best through every phase. Experts Featured in This Article Sara Vaughn, MD, is a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist at HRC Fertility. Jolene Brighten, MD, is a hormone expert and author. Sahar Wertheimer, MD, is a dermatologist and hormonal skin expert. The Follicular Phase Glow-Up Is Real The follicular phase kicks off on the first day of your period and lasts until ovulation - approximately seven days. It's also when your estrogen is rising - and that hormone is a skin and hair MVP. \"Estrogen enhances skin hydration by binding to receptors on skin cells that produce hyaluronic acid,\" reproductive endocrinologist Sara Vaughn, MD, says. \"It also stimulates collagen production, which improves elasticity and reduces fine lines.\" Hormone expert Jolene Brighten, MD echoes the glow-up effect: \"Estrogen enhances skin hydration, collagen production, and facial vascularization, all of which contribute to the 'glow' effect people report.\" And there may be more than a perceived boost happening. \"Some research indicates women's faces are rated as more attractive in the late follicular phase, near ovulation, when estrogen peaks,\" she adds. Not only does your skin look more radiant, but your hair may also be shinier and fuller thanks to those hormonal shifts. So what does this mean? It means book your dates, shoot your content, and finally, try that bold lip color you've been too shy to try. The Luteal Phase Letdown On the flip side, because nothing good lasts forever, the luteal phase (which begins after ovulation and lasts until your period starts; approximately 10-14 days) is what we jokingly refer to as the evil step-sister of the follicular phase. \"Progesterone levels rise and can lead to increased sebum, which causes oily skin and more acne breakouts,\" says Dr. Vaughn. \"It can also weaken the skin barrier, causing conditions like eczema or irritant dermatitis to flare.\" However, remember that everyone is different, and knowing your skin's needs can make all the difference. \"Not every person will break out with acne in the luteal phase. Everybody is different,\" says dermatologist Sahar Wertheimer, MD. Dr. Brighten adds that this shift often coincides with a drop in confidence. \"Right before your period, hormones are at their lowest, and skin may be drier and more sensitive. Some people experience dullness or breakouts,\" she says. It's not just the breakouts, though. Feeling puffier or emotionally off during this phase isn't your imagination. Dr. Vaughn says, \"Increased progesterone stimulates leptin production, which can contribute to bloating, and also influences neurotransmitters like GABA and dopamine, leading to heightened emotional sensitivity.\" In short, your skin, hair, and mood are going through it. But hey - at least now you know why. Should You Be Syncing Your Beauty Routine to Your Cycle? So, if your hormones are shifting your skin and hair's temperament week to week, should your beauty routine change with it? Potentially. While Dr. Vaughn personally prefers the stability of continuous birth control to avoid the cycle-driven ups and downs, she also says timing treatments can be helpful. \"If you have skin that breaks out during the luteal phase, it makes sense to do things like facials or peels during the follicular phase instead,\" she says. \"Aggressive exfoliation, chemical peels, or laser treatments can be risky during breakouts when skin is more reactive.\" Dr. Wertheimer suggests concentrating on deep cleansing and avoiding heavy makeup. \"Moisturize well and focus on oil control with your hair during luteal and menstruation.\" Consider the luteal phase a transition period leading up to your period - it's a sensitive time. Dr. Wertheimer recommends a gentle and \"less is more\" approach in the last couple of weeks of your cycle. \"I would focus on gentle washing and hydrating techniques. For hair, avoid over washing and use strengthening treatments like hair masks.\" With the boost of estrogen during the follicular and ovulatory phase, doctors agree that this is a good time to lean into collagen production and vitamin C serums. Dr. Brighten points to the follicular phase as the prime time for beauty experimentation. \"This is the ideal time to schedule a photo session or go on a new date because you'll also feel more confident,\" she says. And confidence, of course, is the best beauty hack. Understanding the Phases Is Key Your hormones may not come with a user manual, but they do have a rhythm you can learn to drop into. Understanding how they affect your skin and hair can take some of the guesswork out of those good-skin versus bad-skin days. And while you don't need to overhaul your routine every month, paying attention to the subtle shifts might help you work with your cycle instead of against it. Because if we have to ride this hormone rollercoaster anyway, we might as well look good doing it.
