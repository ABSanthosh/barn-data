  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Hailey Bieber hit the desert for Coachella weekend one and the theme was fire - literally. We're not just talking about the scorching temperatures that peaked above 100 - we're talking about Bieber's lava nails that included a flame-trimmed top and nails to match. Bieber's nail artist Britney Tokyo posted the look to her Instagram page, captioning them \"textured nails,\" but we couldn't help but notice they are reminiscent of the lava trend that consists of 3D sculpting gel to create a flowy, flame effect on the nails. Tokyo used metallic hot pink polish that reflected the sun, which is a deviation from Bieber's usual minimal and clean aesthetic. She is, after all, the woman who gave us glazed-doughnut nails, aka the trend known for having a classic pink or nude base with just the subtlest hint of shimmer glossed on top. Although many celebrities at Coachella this year opted for subtle makeup looks (and who can blame them when temperatures were so high?), most festival goers chose to express themselves through fun nail art, hairstyles, and, of course, fashion. In Bieber's case, it seems her outfit choice could have inspired her nail design. She rocked a vintage Mugler leather bustier that featured lava-esque flame details along the neckline and paired the top with casual black pants and sneakers. Our nail queen has done it again, and we hope there are more experimental designs from her in our future. In the meantime, check out Bieber's lava nails as inspiration for your own festival manicure.
