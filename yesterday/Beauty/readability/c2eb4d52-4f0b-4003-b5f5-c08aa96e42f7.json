If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. When I was an eager intern, drafted in to clean out a magazine’s burgeoning beauty cupboard, my then manager gave me a piece of advice that would stay with me: “If nothing else, look after your hands and feet.” She was convinced that 12-step skincare routines were overrated (a simple cleanser, moisturizer and sunscreen will often suffice). But considering how much we put our hands and feet through on a daily basis, she always drove home how important it is to show them a little extra TLC when possible.  Since then, I’ve tried my best to follow her example, though it’s difficult for someone with perpetually parched hands — further exacerbated by cold weather and heating. Over the years, I’ve also learned that not all hand creams are created equal. Most are sticky and don’t bode well for phone screens; others sting (a no-go for chapped knuckles), and some are so thin they don’t do much at all.  Keen to find the “Goldilocks” of hand creams — essentially the one that ticks all of my boxes — I made it my mission to try as many products down to the very last drop over the winter. Some of these hand creams have been recommended by top dermatologists, while others have gone so viral on TikTok I couldn’t resist trying them out. Fast forward to this month and I think I might’ve found the cream of the crop.  Without further ado, read ahead for my honest thoughts on $195 worth of hand creams. DashDividers_1_500x100 La Roche-Posay Cicaplast Soothing Hand Cream, $11.99 Last year, I was lucky enough to go skincare shopping in Paris with dermatologist Dr. Justine Hextall. There were probably a hundred hand creams lining the shelves of the French pharmacies we visited, but she picked out this fragrance-free version for my very dry skin. Dr. Hextall encouraged me to slather on a generous amount before bed and to pull on a pair of cotton gloves (you could also use a pair of socks!), kind of like a makeshift overnight hand mask. I saw the best results when I used this consistently. It’s all down to hydrating niacinamide, skin-smoothing shea butter, and a whopping 30% glycerin, a humectant, which draws moisture into the skin. Thanks to dimethicone, a type of silicone, it makes hands feel silky rather than sticky, but it’s quite thick in texture and takes a moment to absorb fully. I ran out of the 50ml version too quickly, so I’d recommend spending a little bit more on the 100ml tube.   Rare Beauty Find Comfort Hydrating Hand Cream, $25 I have to get one gripe out of the way first: The packaging might be “spillproof” but it isn’t user-friendly. You have to give this a good squeeze to release the lotion, and even then it’s pretty difficult to get much out. I’m not the only one. Countless reviewers say the same, and when your hands are feeling sore, that’s the last thing you need. Packaging aside, I love the chic scent (that’ll be creamy jasmine, zippy lemon, and comforting cashmere wood), and the cream softens tight, dry hands without a hint of slipperiness. Aesop Eleos Aromatique Hand Balm, $33 This is a hand cream first and an aromatherapy treatment second — it smells incredible. A few essential oils are behind the soothing scent, so it’s not something I’d recommend for those with very sore or chapped hands in case of irritation, but it’s still high up on my list. That’s because it boasts moisturizing glycerin, softening shea butter, and nourishing castor oil — three ingredients which breathe life into my dry, ashy hands. Don’t let that fool you into thinking it’ll leave you with greasy fingertips, though. My hands drink it up quickly, and it’s become my favorite hand cream for on-the-go top-ups. As you can probably tell by the state of this tube, it’s a purse staple. CeraVe Reparative Hand Cream, $13.49 I’ve been through multiple tubs of CeraVe’s Moisturizing Cream over the years but it’s too big to carry around with me. Enter: Reparative Hand Cream. It features the same skin-strengthening ceramides, which act like glue in between skin cells to keep the skin barrier intact and moisture under lock and key. It sinks in fast, too. I looked to this when my hands were cracked and sore, and it helped to heal them quickly, but I found that I needed to layer up throughout the day. Still, it’s more or less traceless — and fragrance-free — so that didn’t bother me. I just need it to come in a bigger tube.  L’Occitane Shea Butter Hand Cream, $43 In the past couple of months, I’ve been through two 150ml tubes of this hand cream; nothing else has eradicated my dry skin quite like it. The star ingredients are 20% shea butter, which moisturizes deeply, and beta-glucan, which experts are championing as the new, more hydrating hyaluronic acid. Not only does this ingredient soothe and soften skin instantly, but it’s known to repair and heal over time. L’Occitane promises eight hours of intense hydration — and I believe it. I apply this before bed and when I wake up, my hands look brand new. Even when I wash my hands after using it, they’re still unbelievably soft. Seeing as it’s substantially quenching, it takes a minute or so for my hands to soak it up properly, but it works a treat. Dry skin? Don’t know her. This is my number one.  Nécessaire The Hand Cream Barrier Treatment, $38 This absorbs easily and is packed with skin-repairing ceramides, moisturizing glycerin, and quenching shea butter — but it’s pricier than other hand creams on this list with very similar properties. For me, the main selling point is that I can use my phone or laptop almost immediately, and because it’s formulated without perfume, it doesn’t tingle or sting when applied to broken skin. I also like that you can squeeze every last drop out of the aluminum tube. It’s certainly chic, so if you have more to spend, why not?  Aveeno Daily Moisturising Hand Cream, $15 If it’s instant relief you’re after, Aveeno has got you covered. This takes all of 30 seconds to disappear into dry hands (I counted), doesn’t leave behind any greasy residue, and makes rough skin feel much softer thanks to moisturizing glycerin and cushiony dimethicone. While it does the job, my dry hands require regular applications throughout the day, especially after washing. All in all, it makes a great desk hand cream for frequent typers.  Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Touch Hand Cream, $16 I thought this hand cream would be all smell, no substance, but I’m very happy to be proven wrong. With coconut oil, squalane, and sodium hyaluronate (a type of hyaluronic acid), it’s considerably moisturizing and melted into my dry hands almost instantly. For those familiar with the brand’s viral Cheirosa ’62 fragrance, this hand cream is equally as beachy and sunscreen-y in smell, and the perfume lingered on my skin for a good while — even after I washed my hands. I keep this on my desk at home for a mid-afternoon pick me up. (It might be a little too potent for the office…) Like what you see?
