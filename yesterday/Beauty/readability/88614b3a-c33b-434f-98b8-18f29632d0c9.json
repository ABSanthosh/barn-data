  "link": "https://www.popsugar.com/beauty/got2b-glued-brow-edge-gel-review-49038005",
  "description": "Throughout the years, my eyebrow routine has taken no more than five minutes. I've always had naturally thick brows, so I've never felt the need to manipulate them. And even during eras like 2000s skinny brows and or laminated brows, I was the girl who rocked natural brows (not even threading or waxing). As I got more acquainted with doing my makeup, I started trying brow pencils, but still, my glams looked best with them au naturel. Now as much as I've appreciated their thickness, they tend to get a little wild at a times, but I quickly found the perfect product to tame them while maintaining that authentic look I love: brow gel. It was only five years ago that I started wearing makeup, so I've only used one brow gel. I've never really had problems with it, but it would flake at times, especially in extreme temperatures. Fortunately, I came across göt2b's Brows \u0026 Edges 2 in 1 Wand Gel ($8) - thanks to TikTok - and it's the only brow gel I use now. Not only does it have impressive staying power (even during a New Orleans heat wave), but it's highly affordable, allowing you to get that polished beauty look without breaking the bank. Keep reading for my full review along with another editor who used it on her edges, and find out why it's so good even Kylie Jenner wears it. About the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel It promises up to 72-hour hold for brows and edges without flaking. It has a two-sided fiber brush for easy application. It's made of a vegan and silicone-free formula. What I Like About the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel What I love most about this gel is that's easy to control, while keeping your brows in place. I'd usually have to dip my old brow gel in its tube multiple times to get my desired look, and with this gel, I got the perfect, tamed thick brows with just one use. I used it during a recent trip to New Orleans for the annual Essence Festival, and my brows stayed in place for hours, even in 109 degrees. And if it can survive that level of heat, I know my brows are in good hands. How to Use the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel While this gel is a 2-in-1 product, it's super simple to use. It comes in a durable plastic tube that you can unscrew to reveal a spoolie applicator. With just one dip, the gel dispenses the perfect amount of product onto the wand; ideal enough if you happen to be in a hurry when your Uber is downstairs and your friends are yelling at you to hurry up. What to Consider Before Using the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel Because it also claims to be perfect for edges, another editor tried it on her type-four hair. She applied it on her hairline since she often rocks slicked back styles, rather than using it for baby hairs. She notes that the spoolie does deliver a good amount of product, but the brush's size isn't ideal for thicker hair textures, so that's something to consider before purchasing. Review: \"At first, the spoolie glided through my hair, but toward the end, it started getting caught on the brush, making it look a bit frizzy. It's a bit too small to really comb through your edges like a normal brush would. At $19, you realistically could continue to use a spoolie with the normal Göt2b styling gel and get similar results.\" - Ariel Baker, former assistant editor, Beauty Image Source: PS Photography / Ariel Baker Where Is the göt2b Glued 2-in-1 Brows \u0026 Edges Hair Gel Available?
