  "description": "When it comes to beauty products, we know one thing to be true: there is no shortage of options, especially when it comes to makeup. Take eyeshadow, for instance. There are so many eyeshadow palettes on the market and new, limited-edition products are launching all the time. This can make it hard to decide which are actually worth investing your money in. As editors, we try out so many new launches and put them through vigorous rounds of testing to determine the ones truly worth adding to your collection. With eyeshadow palettes, we consider everything: how easy the shadows are to blend, how wearable (or exciting) the colors are, how long the pigment lasts, and whether they really are crease-proof. So if you're looking for something new, you've come to the right place. Whether you're an avid eyeshadow wearer who plans to use every shade in your eyeshadow palette or someone who's only looking for a small, pocket-size palette to wear on special occasions, there's something on this list for you. There are eyeshadow palettes of all sizes that fit into every budget available at your local drugstore or beauty retailer. Ahead, you'll find the best eyeshadow palettes from luxurious brands like Anastasia Beverly Hills and affordable gems like NYX Professional Makeup. Keep scrolling to check out our picks for the best eyeshadow palettes of all time.",
