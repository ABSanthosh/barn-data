  "text": "Courtesy of Sofie Pavitt, Meredith JenksA few years ago, after a decade of dealing with acne, I shrank my overactive oil glands into submission with Accutane. I was desperate for results, having spent countless hours trying to burn, scrub, and pick at my breakouts at home. I’m convinced the compromised skin barrier I have now is the result of layering active after active on my face without rhyme or reason, hoping they would somehow magically melt away all of the whiteheads. Spoiler alert: They didn’t, but Accutane provided the respite my skin needed.I’m incredibly happy with my skin now, but I still wish my teenage and early-twenties self had the guidance and wisdom of Sofie Pavitt. The aesthetician holds the title of “New York City’s acne whisperer,” thanks to her gentle, simple, and holistic approach, and she counts Lorde, Zendaya, and veteran beauty editors among her clients. Perhaps if I’d met Pavitt sooner, I might’ve been able to skip the harsh acne medication. Nevertheless, her products and skin philosophy seem to work for mostly everyone, whether they’re dealing with active breakouts or not—especially her latest launch, the Sofie Pavitt Face Omega Rich Moisturizer. Sofie Pavitt Face Omega Rich MoisturizerAppalled by the dearth of rich moisturizers for acne-prone skin, Pavitt developed the formula with non-comedogenic oils like argan and jojoba. She also added squalane for extra hydration and vitamin F to balance sebum production. The result is a product rich in moisturizing, skin-fortifying omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids that won’t surprise you with clogged pores and new pimples after a few days of use.The moisturizer is fragrance-free and has a viscous yet slightly runny quality that reminds me of honey that was taken out of the fridge a few minutes ago. In other words, it may not be as thick as the typical barrier creams you’re used to. The unique texture, however, melts like butter upon contact and thins once applied, which is probably a huge plus for anyone paranoid about clogging their skin. As someone whose skin has been especially dry this winter, I’m used to piling on a dollop of thick, gooey face cream each night before bed. I was nervous that the Omega Rich Moisturizer wouldn’t be able to truly keep my dry patches at bay, but I should’ve trusted Pavitt; even just one healthy layer of the formula leaves my skin charged with hydration and the right level of dewy. I almost feel like it also creates a breathable film on top of my face that locks in moisture for hours. My rosacea (likely due to my weakened skin barrier) also responds well; the redness tends to diminish a few minutes after applying the moisturizer. In the past month, Pavitt’s moisturizer has deposed all of the other excellent barrier-supporting creams I keep in rotation. My hand automatically reaches for the blue jar each night, and I actively enjoy smoothing it on and feeling my thirsty skin drink it up. I’m happy to recommend it to everyone, regardless of skin type. Even if you have extremely oily skin, you’ll probably benefit from the rich formula, as dehydration can be a culprit behind excess sebum production. If I could go back in time and gift one to pre-Accutane me, I 100 percent would, but I’m grateful to at least have it now.",
