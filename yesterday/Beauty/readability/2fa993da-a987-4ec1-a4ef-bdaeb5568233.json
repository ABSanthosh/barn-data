  "description": "Image Source: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images Kristen Stewart has been our hair muse for some time now. Between the change-up of cuts, styles, and colors, she always looks fresh. Most recently, she was our \"mixie\" haircut inspiration, and now, just in time for summer, she's bringing back a major trend: dip-dye hair. If you were on Tumblr at any time in the early 2010s, you probably remember this hair color taking over your feed. One reason that this look was so popular was its DIY level of ease. Instead of mastering how to do perfect, even highlights all over your head, you essentially just had to bleach the bottom half of your hair (if it wasn't already blond/lightened), and then add color to just those last few inches of hair. Who cared if it wasn't perfectly even? The haphazard effect was part of its charm. Even better? Once you decided you were over the color or didn't want it anymore, you could easily just chop off the ends for a total reset. Ah, those were the days. Image Source: Getty/Doug Peters/PA Images But it seems we're ready to relive the glory of the aughts all over again with Stewart leading the way. Her new look features a platinum-blond base with choppy, textured layers. The bottom few inches of her hair were dip-dyed a rosy-pink color to add some bold contrast with the blond. Of course, since we're older and wiser than we were during our Tumblr days, we recommend going to a professional for a color change; Stewart's hair was done by celebrity stylist Bridget Brager, who has worked with the star for years. What's so fun about this look is that, yes, it looks effortlessly cool when hair is down and resting on your shoulders, but it also adds a whole new level of cool when hair is twisted up into a top knot, allowing the pop of color to become the focal point, amps up any boring bun. Image Source: Getty/Rocco Spaziani/Archivio Spaziani/Mondadori Portfolio If you're brave enough to try this look at home, we recommend first bleaching the bottom two-to-four inches of your hair where you want to add color with something like like Overtone's The Bleach 30 Volume Hair Lightening Kit ($20). Then, you can add an Overtone Color ($32) of your choice to the lightened ends, or you can really take it back to the early 2010s and reach for a Manic Panic Shade ($14). Either way, we know your hair is going to be thrown up during the upcoming warm months, so adding a pop of color is a great way to keep this look feeling fresh.
