  "description": "What do \"Twilight,\" \"Stranger Things,\" and \"Pokemon\" all have in common? Besides the fact that we were completely obsessed with each of the franchises at one point in time, they're also a few of the lucky brands who have collaborated with ColourPop to create some pretty exciting makeup collections. As any beauty lover knows, ColourPop's collabs are always swoon-worthy, and their latest is no exception: ColourPop x Bratz. There's no better way to put the cap on a summer that was brat-themed than by tipping our hats to the OG brat girls. Whether you were obsessed with the original Bratz dolls, the TV series, the web series, or you just can't get enough of \"the girls with a passion for fashion,\" trust us when we say, this collection is worth browsing. It will feature a fun eyeshadow palette, lip kits, body glitter, and more. Plus, you can buy items individually or you can opt to bundle the entire collection (we know which option we're choosing). ColourPop x Bratz officially launched on October 10, and you can shop the entire collection here now that it's available. Keep scrolling to check it out.",
