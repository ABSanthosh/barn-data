  "description": "Choosing a signature scent is a deeply personal decision, but our purchases can be so easily swayed by social media trends. A single viral TikTok can often be the reason behind a fragrance's overnight fame, turning a once-niche scent into a sold-out cult favorite everyone suddenly needs in their collection. Case in point: Baccarat Rouge 540, which was first introduced back in 2016 but enjoyed a massive spike in popularity many years later thanks to PerfumeTok.Instead of waiting for the algorithm to decide what’s next, we’ve decided to go straight to the experts — fragrance industry specialists, experienced beauty editors, and rising content creators — to find out which trending perfumes will be the next breakout hits. With their sixth sense for predicting trends, these pros are nominating their favorite up-and-comers before they sell out. These picks range from sultry ouds to aromatic tea blends, proving that 2025 will be yet another interesting year in fragrance. Some of these perfumes are already bubbling under the surface, while others are fresh launches poised to take over your FYP any minute now.All linked products are independently selected by our editors.

Its main notes are vanilla and tonka bean, but unlike most vanilla-forward perfumes, it’s not too saccharine. Tobacco leaves, cedarwood, and plum ground the sensual blend with some depth. As someone who gravitates towards more floral fragrances, I didn't expect to love it so much, but from the first spritz, I was addicted. It was apparently inspired by a memorable date night Victoria had with David Beckham on the island of Java, so it's no surprise this fragrance feels like sex appeal in a bottle. Be prepared to feel like the most confident person in the room when you wear this.” — Kristina Rodulfo, beauty editor and content creatorShop Victoria Beckham BeautyVictoria Beckham Beauty 21:50 Rêverie Eau de Parfum, $, available at Victoria Beckham BeautyBy Rosie Jane Dulce Eau de Parfum“Dulce is the perfect balance of what people loved about the gourmand boom of 2024: creamy, cozy vanilla, married with an airy softness that feels like a second skin. It doesn’t overwhelm; instead, it envelops you in this understated, intimate scent bubble. Vanilla is undeniably beloved, but the musky, skin-like finish of Dulce makes it feel modern and endlessly wearable, almost like an invisible cashmere sweater. It’s indulgent yet effortless, which is the vibe I think people are craving right now.“I’ve seen complaints that Dulce fades too quickly, but I also believe 2025 will be the year we move away from obsessing over a 12-hour performance in fragrance. Dulce is a perfect example of why: It’s a scent you want to reapply, not because it disappears too quickly, but because the act of wearing it feels luxurious. It fits the evolving mindset around fragrance as something more intimate and personal and lingers softly on the skin; less about projection and more about enhancing your own experience.” — Caroline Stern, perfume content creatorShop Sephoraby rose jane Dulce Eau de Parfum, $, available at SephoraPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum“Phlur can do no wrong in my eyes. The brand releases banger after banger, often going viral in the process. (Vanilla Skin Eau de Parfum, which just nabbed a R29 MVP Award for fragrance, comes to mind.) The secret, in my opinion, is that the brand makes each scent appeal to all. But despite this widespread allure, each scent somehow makes the wearer feel unique and special. Golden Rule is my next pick for soon-to-be-viral status. Upon first sniff I’m drenched in sunny, juicy notes of mandarin that lure me right in. Rather than smelling sickly sweet, the scent is fresh and fruity, drying down to a smooth base of coconut milk and vanilla cream. This is juxtaposed with a hit of sandalwood to keep it from falling into the gourmand category, which I’m not a huge fan of. If you don’t like foodie scents but don’t mind a fun injection of sweetness, this one’s for you.” — Humeara Mohamed, contributing writerShop SephoraPhlur Golden Rule Eau de Parfum, $, available at Phlur\u0026 Other Stories Blank Pages Eau de Toilette“In 2025, I’m choosing to support mid-to-low-priced fragrances that are credible, well-made, and sit nicely on the skin — and most importantly, don't pretend to be anything other than an easy-going scent to top up every few hours. I recently tried the new perfumes from \u0026 Other Stories and think they will do well throughout the year. Blank Pages is the clean skin, pillowy scent that seems to be catnip these days, and has a silky profile that reminds me of warm pajamas just pulled out of the dryer. The woods and white musks remind me of cracking open a fresh new paperback novel. It’s so subtle and lightweight, but that’s the type of scent I want to be wearing to brace myself for another chaotic day. The best part? It's only $45.” — Alice du Parcq, fragrance presenter, expert, and hostShop \u0026 Other Stories\u0026 Other Stories Blank Pages Eau de Toilette, $, available at \u0026 Other StoriesLoewe Solo Vulcan Eau de Parfum“Resinoids have had everyone in a chokehold lately and I see this continuing in 2025. This plant extract produces a syrupy balsamic note that notably made Lush’s Sticky Dates collection a TikTok sensation. Solo Vulcan takes this to the next level, featuring a signature Loewe accord — an ambery, resinous note drawn from Iberian rockrose wildflowers — layered with lavender, thyme, and orange flower absolute. Herbaceous scents are more often a miss for me, as they remind me of dried seasoning from the grocery store, but this one feels so much more elevated thanks to a hint of balsamic tickling the nose. The overall profile is very fresh and ‘wet’ in a sense, like strolling through a herb garden right after a rain shower. It dries down to a gorgeous sweet floral that makes me want to sniff my wrists again and again. Even though Solo Vulcan is marketed as a pour homme spray, I predict it will really take off as a genderless fragrance.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop Net-A-PorterLoewe Solo Vulcan Eau de Parfum, $, available at Net-A-PorterD.S. \u0026 Durga Pistachio Eau de Parfum“Pistachio fragrances are big right now. D.S. \u0026 Durga’s Pistachio is the first pistachio perfume I’ve ever tried, and is almost certainly the last, as it’s pretty much perfect. The initial impression is light and subtly sweet like a scoop of pistachio gelato, but is beautifully balanced with notes of warm, earthy cardamom and patchouli. The nuttiness definitely shines through thanks to the titular ingredient in the heart, mid, and base, but it also has a marzipan-like sweetness thanks to almond and vanilla crème. I love wearing it alone or layered with one of my woodier scents (I think pistachio and sandalwood are utterly gorgeous together) to switch things up.” — Karina Hoshikawa, senior writerShop NordstromD.S. \u0026 Durga Pistachio Eau de Parfum 50ml, $, available at NordstromPrada Infusion de Rhubarbe Eau De Parfum“All of Prada’s fragrances are a cut above the rest. They’re so unique and interesting — and Rhubarbe is no different. With tart rhubarb accord, zingy green mandarin and lush rose, it’s equal parts grassy and syrupy, and I just can’t get enough of it on my skin. Once it dries down, it develops into a soapy and clean scent that’s really comforting; something about it reminds me of the ‘90s. It’s nostalgic in the best way. What’s more, the bottle is absolutely beautiful.” — Jacqueline Kilikita, beauty directorShop SephoraPrada Infusion de Rhubarbe Eau De Parfum, $, available at SephoraSidia Soaked Solid Perfume“Fragrance boomed in 2024, and I don't see the category slowing any time soon. In fact, I've noticed a spike in other formats through which to experience scent, such as solid perfume. Sidia Soaked Solid Perfume is one of my recent favorites. The tiny but weighty compact is home to a balm version of the brand's signature blend of jasmine, cypress, and musk, which is somehow both comforting and invigorating. Since it’s solid, I can dab the scent exactly where I want it — like on my inner wrists or behind my ears. I find the fragrance lasts for several hours, but if I want to top up, I love that I can do so at my desk without accidentally spritzing my coworkers.” — Dianna Singh, features director, AllureShop SidiaSidia Soaked Solid Perfume, $, available at SidiaCreed Fragaria Eau de Parfum“Fruit-forward perfumes, particularly ones with citrus and berry notes, are making a comeback. No, I’m not talking about the body mists that were staples during our teenage years. The trending assortment of fruity scents are way more complex and grown-up, with far higher concentrations of perfume oil — and therefore longevity. Creed’s Fragaria is the perfect example. It opens with a sharp and punchy blend of mandarin and bergamot that almost smells like fresh mangos, before the succulent strawberry heart notes break through. This all sounds similar to eating sorbet, but thanks to spiky pink pepper and powdery violet, the actual olfactory experience is vibrant yet sensual. Patchouli, vetiver, and cedarwood ground the strawberry note and help it linger on my skin for hours. Fruit notes normally don’t last very long, so I’m rather impressed that I still smell like a walking strawberry field hours after application.” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop SelfridgesSelfridges Fragaria Eau de Parfum, $, available at SelfridgesZara Elegantly Tokyo Eau de Parfum “Even though Elegantly Tokyo came out back in 2021, I truly believe it’s poised to have its time in the sun this year. Created by perfume legend Jo Malone, it encapsulates the best qualities of a woody floral — an enduringly popular scent category — while offering unbelievable value for money. The luscious cocktail of lily and jasmine envelops you in a luxurious-smelling cloud that refuses to evaporate; I’ve sprayed this on my sweatshirt and can still smell traces of it the next day. It has a musky, almost incense-like dry down, thanks to akigalawood at the base. Fans have compared it to Mugler Alien, another jasmine-heavy perfume, but I prefer Elegantly Tokyo’s sparkling initial blast. I’ve been carrying the travel size in my handbag everywhere, asking my friends to smell it and guess how much it costs. I love watching their jaws drop when I tell them that it’s only $23. Zara, please never discontinue this scent!” — Venus Wong, senior writerShop ZaraZara Elegantly Tokyo Eau de Parfum, $, available at ZaraMaison Crivelli x Jordi Fernandez Oud Cadenza Extrait de Parfum“Oud Cadenza begins its journey with an explosion of hot spices, the sweetness of sugar cane and caramelized dates wrapped in an oud accord. But it’s not an overly sweet gourmand, which is one of the reasons why I love it and think it will be a big hit this year. The deepness of oud, leather, and patchouli coupled with the spices and smokiness of incense seamlessly balances and prevents it from becoming too sweet. It also lends a mature character to the gourmand notes, while maintaining its seductive and addictive quality. As the fragrance makes its way to the base, it reveals a rich, warm, resinous creaminess that makes you want to constantly sniff yourself. This one needs to be added to the collection for winter date nights or if you want to be the center of attention in any room you walk into.” — Eudora Nwasike, certified fragrance specialist by the Fragrance FoundationShop HarrodsMaison Crivelli x Jordi Fernandez Oud Cadenza Extrait de Parfum, $, available at Harrodsd’Annam Matcha Soft Serve Eau de Parfum“I’ve been seeing lots of buzz for Matcha Soft Serve, a creation by Vietnamese fine fragrance house d’Annam. While I don’t think vanillic, sugary gourmands are going anywhere just yet, I’m noticing a marked shift towards photorealistic scents [perfumes that smell like a real-world thing]. All the cool girls are swapping their daily flat white for an iced matcha latte, and the ingredient is sweeping into the fragrance space, with this matcha-forward scent selling out a few times over. Think earthy ceremonial grade matcha, soft milky vanilla, and the sweetness of a traditional waffle cone all blended together smoothly. It’s simply delicious: not too sweet and not too grassy.” — Sade Akinsanya, perfume enthusiast and content creatorShop d’Annamd’Annam Matcha Soft Serve Eau de Parfum, $, available at d’AnnamLike what you see?

This is juxtaposed with a hit of sandalwood to keep it from falling into the gourmand category, which I’m not a huge fan of.

The nuttiness definitely shines through thanks to the titular ingredient in the heart, mid, and base, but it also has a marzipan-like sweetness thanks to almond and vanilla crème.

It opens with a sharp and punchy blend of mandarin and bergamot that almost smells like fresh mangos, before the succulent strawberry heart notes break through. This all sounds similar to eating sorbet, but thanks to spiky pink pepper and powdery violet, the actual olfactory experience is vibrant yet sensual.

It has a musky, almost incense-like dry down, thanks to akigalawood at the base.
