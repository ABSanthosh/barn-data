  "description": "It's time to get started on your holiday shopping. Figuring out where to begin can feel a little overwhelming, especially when searching for the perfect nail polish gift set. It seems like every year, people start their hunt earlier and earlier. While we're all for getting things crossed off our to-do lists in a timely manner, as soon as people shift into holiday gear, the good gifts have a tendency to sell out faster than you can say present. That's why it's always a good idea to get ahead of things. This year, there are new nail polish shades, tools, and Advent calendars to discover. This means there are pages and pages of scrolling to be done before you can finally find the perfect gifts for nail lovers. Fortunately for you, we've made it our mission to make your holiday shopping as easy as possible. We tapped some of our most trusted nail experts to weigh in on their top choices, so you know these picks are good. On top of that, we also polled all of our editors, and they clued us in on some pretty special picks. Whether you're looking for something simple like a starter set for a friend who is just getting into DIY manicures or something more involved like a Gel-X extension kit for a seasoned pro, there's an item for every manicure-obsessed person on your list. Ahead, keep scrolling to find the best nail polish gift sets and more.
