  "description": "For the past few weeks, Selena Gomez has been serving up nothing but sleek back styles over on her Instagram page. We get it; temperatures are rising, and it's one of the easiest hairstyles to look put together while keeping your hair out of your face. But it seems like Gomez is finally letting her hair down and she doesn't want to hear what you think about it. The Rare Beauty mogul posted a new shaggy cut complete with tousled fringe. She captioned the post, \"I would, but I'd regret it, then get it redone so I simply won't.\" Seems to us like she's had bangs before, gotten rid of them, and then quickly missed them. Sounds like the most relatable thing she's ever posted. What is it about bangs that makes everyone in our lives think they can have an opinion on them? Gomez set the record straight by letting everyone know she wasn't going to regret her choice - no matter how hot it's about to get in the upcoming months.",

We get it; temperatures are rising, and it's one of the easiest hairstyles to look put together while keeping your hair out of your face. But it seems like Gomez is finally letting her hair down and she doesn't want to hear what you think about it. The Rare Beauty mogul posted a new shaggy cut complete with tousled fringe. She captioned the post, \"I would, but I'd regret it, then get it redone so I simply won't.\" Seems to us like she's had bangs before, gotten rid of them, and then quickly missed them. Sounds like the most relatable thing she's ever posted. What is it about bangs that makes everyone in our lives think they can have an opinion on them? Gomez set the record straight by letting everyone know she wasn't going to regret her choice — no matter how hot it's about to get in the upcoming months. Selena Gomez's Perfectly Imperfect Shag HaircutGomez debuted her new shag style on her Instagram. The cut features her signature chestnut brown hair color, but instead of her usual straightened style, adds texture that showcases her new layers. Hairstylist at Salon SCK in NYC, Devin Toth, says the key to a shaggy cut is letting go of conventional hairstyling techniques. So that means put away your barrel curler that crafts identical curls all around your head. Instead, the key to a shag style is prominent bangs, volume at the root, and straight ends, according to hairstylist Rebekah Forecast — all of which Gomez nailed perfectly. You can use a straightener to create waves (make sure you're alternating them in different directions) and then leave out the ends to create a straight-end effect quickly. Another key to styling a shag is texturizing spray, like the Living Proof Full Dry Volume and Texture Spray ($36)Selena Gomez's Shaggy BangsMost prominent in her new style is Gomez's bangs, which the actress hasn't rocked in a while. Her stylist Orlando Pita commented \"Looking flawless,\" on her haircut debut Instagram photo, and in his profile, he added a selfie with Gomez that shows more of her new style. Selena Gomez Before Shaggy HairGomez has been rocking sleek styles before this so the shaggy style with bangs is a big departure from her usual. But of course, she'd could look good in any style. It's fun to see celebrities make major hair changes so we can contemplate if we want to follow suit. Plus, it never hurts to have an inspiration pic to take with you to the salon.Brittany Leitner (she/her) is a New York-based contributing beauty writer at PS.
