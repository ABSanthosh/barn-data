  "description": "Beauty lovers, it's your time to shop: the Sephora Savings Event is in full swing. Only available to those enrolled in the retailer's Beauty Insiders loyalty program, the annual sale makes it easy to shop for all your beauty needs and wants at a discount. Whether you're looking to restock your favorite products or try a new launch, we're here to give you the rundown on what's worth buying during the big sale. We're talking all things beauty - including skin-care, hair care, makeup, body care, and more. The Sephora Savings Event started on April 4 and runs through Monday April 14. Depending on your Sephora Beauty Insider membership status, you can get up to 30 percent off your purchase. The higher the tier you are, the better the discount, so yes, now is the time to buy your Rouge membership friends a cup of coffee and get to shopping. Here's the breakdown. How to Shop the 2025 Sephora Savings Event The savings event is available for Sephora Beauty Insiders only and is based on your membership status. It's never too late to join the Beauty Insider Program if you want to get in on the savings (we recommend you do; it's free). To reap the savings, use code SAVEMORE at checkout. Here are the dates each tier of Beauty Insiders can shop and the percentage off they get: Sephora Rouge members get 20 percent off the entirety of the sale online and in stores from April 4 through April 14. Sephora VIB members receive 15 percent off and gain access to the sale online and in stores starting April 8 through April 14. Sephora Insiders receive 10 percent off and gain access to the sale online and in stores April 8 through April 14. All tiers get 30 percent off Sephora Collection items from April 4 to April 14. All tiers will also get free shipping with no mininum spend. Fun Fact: all tiers will have access to participating brand events in-store, with exclusive Gifts With Purchase (stackable with the Savings Event promotion) for the duration of the sale. You can check out this events page to see what's happening near you. Can the Sephora Savings Event Discount Be Used More Than Once? Yes, you can use the code multiple times throughout the sale. However, Rouge members get to share their 20 percent off discount one time only to a non-Rouge friend from April 4 to April 7. Best Deals From the 2025 Sephora Savings Event The Sephora Beauty Insiders Savings Event is a great opportunity to save on top-tier beauty products you've been eyeing. And we've cracked the code on how to shop the sale to get the most bang for your buck and shop smart (spoiler alert: it's girl math). To rack in the most amount of savings, we recommend shopping value sets and gift sets. More often than not, you end up saving money replenishing products and sometimes get to enjoy extra products, essentially for free. It's also the ideal time to shop for splurge-worthy beauty tools and products, like an LED face mask, new drops from Fenty Skin (for Rouge members), the coveted Libre parfum from Yves Saint Laurent, or the Haus Labs foundation you've been seeing all over TikTok. That way, you can splurge on something you've been eyeing or give into that urge to purchase something you've been influenced to buy with a price cut. If you're a member who's looking for great items to shop, you've come to the right place. We curated our favorite beauty products from Sephora ahead, including several editor-vetted picks. Hurry and stock up on your beauty favorites and splurges before it's too late. Take a look at our top picks ahead.",
