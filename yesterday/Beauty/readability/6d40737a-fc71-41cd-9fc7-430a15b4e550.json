  "description": "Maybe you've never even thought about removing your pubic hair. I don't know your life! But in the event that you - like me at age 13, during the delightful stage known by endocrinologists as puberty - are plagued with the question of how to shave your vagina (or, to be anatomically correct, your vulva, since the vagina is all internal), there are a few things to keep in mind. First, don't do what I did and drag your razor across the skin in a back-and-forth direction until it's all smooth, like my decidedly cooler ninth-grade friend told me to. This, I can attest, leads only to unsightly ingrown hairs and tiny red bumps that will make you feel like a plucked chicken. Instead, you'll want to treat this delicate area, well, delicately, because shaving your pubic hair isn't the same as shaving anywhere else on your body. \"The hair in the pubic area is different from leg hair,\" Caitlin Orszulak, a senior scientist for P\u0026G, says. \"On average, pubic hair is about twice as thick as leg hair, tends to be curly, and can grow in multiple directions. On top of that, the hair in the pubic area tends to be much denser, meaning there's more hair per square cm versus on a leg.\" She adds that your skin down yonder is also thinner, meaning it's more permeable to moisture loss. \"Finally, the deeper layer of skin in the pubic area has more nerve endings and higher blood flow than the legs, making this area particularly sensitive.\" This is all to say, there are a quite few things to know on how to shave pubic hair safely, and that is precisely why we tapped a handful of grooming experts to help. Keep scrolling for some pro tips on shaving your nether regions below. Experts Featured in This Article Caitlin Orszulak is a senior scientist and product researcher for P\u0026G's grooming category. CC Sofronas is the co-founder of Pacific Shaving Co, a grooming and personal care brand. Katelyn Liston is a scientist for P\u0026G's grooming category.",

  "text": "Take Extra Care Around the LabiaEven more so than the top of your pubic bone, the skin on your labia or lips is a coarser texture, \"so you want to be extra careful,\" Sofronas says. \"This is when you just really want to take your time.\" Because you might have a harder time getting visibility here, she recommends you lift your leg on a dry, flat, elevated surface to ensure easier access to the area. \"It's tricky, but try your best to pull that skin taut so there's no bump, that's going to make for a safer shaving experience.\" Liston agrees, adding that whatever position floats your boat works, whether it's putting a foot up on the side of the tub or laying down a mirror on the floor of your shower. \"If employing either of these methods, try to use your other hand — the one that's not holding the razor or trimmer — to hold the shaving surface taut.\" Apply a Moisturizer AfterwardSo, you successfully (and safely) shaved your vagina — congrats are in order — but that's only half the battle. To minimize the likelihood of razor bumps and ingrowns, keep the area soothed and moisturized. \"The thin skin is permeable and allows moisture to escape more than in other areas of the body,\" says Orszulak. \"Keeping skin hydrated helps to ensure your skin and hair are in good condition for next time.\" (We like the Fur Ingrown Concentrate ($26) or the Flamingo Ingrown Spot Treatment ($10) for these purposes.) \"When you get an ingrown, that means the hair isn't able to pop through the skin, so that's why it's important to use a noncomedogenic post-shave moisturizer, whether it's an oil or something else,\" says Sofronas. \"You also want to avoid clogging your pores, so exfoliating can help remove that top layer of dead skin.\" Kelsey Castañon (she/her) is an ASME Award-nominated writer, editor, and content strategist with enough years of experience to warrant a retinol prescription.
