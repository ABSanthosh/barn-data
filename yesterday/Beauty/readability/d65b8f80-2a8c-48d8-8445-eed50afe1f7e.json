Whether it's something tiny or an elaborate piece of art that takes up your whole arm, there's no shortage of memorial tattoo ideas out there. Getting an \"in loving memory\" tattoo inked in honor of someone you love and admire can also be a therapeutic part of the grieving process. For many, it's a permanent way to keep a loved one close when they physically can't be there anymore, as well as a permanent reminder of the memories and love you will always carry. Since it's a permanent symbol of remembrance, you want to be 100 percent sure about the design and tattoo you choose. If you're struggling to think of some inspiration, we recommend brainstorming about something that has always stuck with you, a symbolic reminder that represents what they mean to you, or a vivid memory you have of them. Whether you're searching for simple memorial tattoos or just general tattoos for lost loved ones, we've got some ideas. Here are some real-life examples of memorial tattoos to get you thinking.",
