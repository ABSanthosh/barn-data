  "description": "Has the reign of the slick-back bun finally come to an end? After spending multiple years as the It style of cool girls everywhere, it seems the tides have shifted. Celebrities are flocking to the ever-effortless and unfussy messy bun. At the Saint Laurent Womenswear Fall/Winter 2025-2026 show on March 11, 2025, not one, not two, but five A-listers put down their boar bristle brushes and hair gel and opted for a laidback, unpolished bun - including Hailey Bieber and Zoë Kravitz. The looks were complete with face-framing wisps and loose ends for that casually chic vibe. The allure and magic of the messy bun is nothing new; in fact, it's a downright classic and if you need any further convincing to add it to your updo style rotation, consider this it. It works for all hair types (including fine), is perfect for concealing dirty hair, has a place in all seasons (in the summer, it'll keep your hair off your neck; in the winter, it'll keep your hair from getting mangled by your turtleneck or scarf), and doesn't require a cosmetology degree to pull off. And really, if it's good enough for a royal like Meghan Markle and Pamela Anderson's iconic look, it's good enough for us. To get inspired for your own perfectly imperfect messy bun, keep scrolling.",
