  "description": "Image Source: Getty/Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Florence Pugh is the definition of a trendsetter. If you needed any further proof, she recently stepped out in a hairstyle that resembles both a mullet and a pixie cut, aka a \"mixie\" haircut - and she looked so effortlessly chic. Pugh has proven time and time again that she can pull off anything, but this new look isn't exactly new. Upon closer inspection, you might realize that the style makes you feel weirdly nostalgic, and we have a sneaky suspicion as to why. Growing up, if you watched \"The Brady Bunch\" reruns on Nick at Nite, you likely marveled at Florence Henderson's (played by Carol Brady) retro haircut. It was very distinctly shorter at the top with piecey ends, while the bottom portion fell around shoulder length and flipped outward. It was a total vibe and the \"Thunderbolts\" star put a fresh spin on that fun, playful look. Image Source: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images While we're tempted to call Pugh's look \"The Florence Henderson,\" it's true to a mixie through and through. It's not exactly a full, super-cropped pixie, but it's not dramatic enough to be labeled a mullet. Pugh's version of the style, which was crafted by celebrity hairstylist Hyungsun Ju, got its debut at a taping of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live\" on April 29. Since the top pieces of her hair appear to be shorter than the bottom, this cut offers tons of range when it comes to styling. Pugh can go for a slicked-back look, or opt for a fun, wavy coif that veers to one side, like we see here. The loose waves and multi-directional styling give her look a modern spin while still appearing edgy thanks to the texture and layers. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Alex Babsky Makeup Artist (@babskymakeup) Getting the Look Is Easy If you're thinking about getting this cut for yourself, make sure to go to an experienced hairstylist who specializes in edgy looks and the razor-haircut technique needed to achieve the feathering. From there, the styling options are truly endless. Pick up a texture balm and dry texturing spray to have fun with a slightly undone look, or try blowing out the top pieces to add volume.
