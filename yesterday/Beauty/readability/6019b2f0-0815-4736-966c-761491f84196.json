If you purchase any of these products, we may earn a commission. The holidays have arrived early at Sephora, and by that, we mean that the retailer’s highly-anticipated savings event is back for 2024. Whether you’re eyeing the bevy of sparkly gift sets or looking to repurchase your favorite luxe moisturizer, the Sephora’s Holiday Savings Event is the time to do just that. Anyone who’s shopped Sephora’s sales before knows the rules, but if you’re new here, this is the run-down: Depending on your Beauty Insider membership tier (which goes from Insider, VIB, and Rouge depending on how much you spend annually), you can get 10, 15, or 20% off, respectively. Rouge members can start shopping on November 1, and both VIBs and Insiders on November 5. All tiers have until November 11 to use the promo code SAVINGS at checkout, which automatically applies the discount according to your membership tier. (Regardless of tier, all Beauty Insider levels can take 30% off all Sephora Collection products from November 1 to November 11, no code needed.) As with previous years, there is some fine print to keep in mind as you plan your Sephora haul: Shoppers are limited to one Dyson item (choose wisely), one Shark Beauty item, and three Nutrafol items per transaction. The Ordinary products, MAC Cosmetics VIVA GLAM products, in-store services, previous purchases, and gift cards are also not eligible for a discount.  Now that you have the rules of the road, onto the fun part: Keep scrolling for the most worth-it items to snag during the sale. DashDividers_1_500x100 Shark FlexFusion™ Luxury Air \u0026 Ceramic Styling Hair Dryer System  We recently reviewed Shark’s latest hair tool launch, and it surpassed our expectations with flying colors. Sephora also stocks both the straightener and diffuser systems, but this version comes with several attachments — curling barrels, smoothing brush, finishing tool, and a concentrator nozzle — to achieve a variety of looks. Make Up For Ever Artist Color Pencil Longwear Lip Liner Anywhere Caffeine, Wherever Walnut, Endless Cacao…the list of beloved shades of this Make Up For Ever pencil goes on and on. From makeup artists to beauty tastemakers like Hailey Bieber and Suni Lee, these beautifully pigmented, long-lasting pencils are always a good idea to stock up on — especially if you can nab them at a discount. Patrick Ta Major Dimension Eye Illusion Eyeshadow Duos Celebrity makeup artist Patrick Ta only recently launched these shimmering eyeshadow duos, and they’ve already begun to make waves online. If we had a beauty crystal ball, we would forecast that these will be quite the hot commodity for holiday makeup looks this season. Sol de Janiero Cheirosa Perfume Travel Minis Set Can’t choose a favorite Sol de Janeiro fragrance? With this set, you don’t need to. Featuring the brand’s most popular Cheirosa scents, this quartet of mists is already a steal at $34 — and that’s at full price. Olehenriksen Pout Preserve Hydrating Peptide Lip Treatment There is stiff competition in the world of tinted lip butters, balms, and treatments — but this Ole Henriksen one continues to stand out from its competition time and time again. From luminous pinks to decadent cocoa, there’s a shade (including crystal clear) for everyone to stock up on this sale. Glow Recipe Blackberry Retinol Blemish Serum Another recent editor-favorite launch comes in the form of Glow Recipe’s new Blackberry Retinol Blemish Serum, which gently yet effectively sloughs off dead skin cells before they get a chance to cause breakouts and dullness. Don’t miss out on trying it for yourself, and at a discount! Sephora Collection Best Skin Ever Full Coverage Multi-Use Hydrating Concealer If you’ve been sleeping on Sephora’s in-house range of products, now’s the time to wake up. One of our choice picks is the Best Skin Ever concealer, which has been lauded as a dupe for high-end brands. It’s creamy, blendable, and provides full coverage with a natural finish — and at only $11 and change during the sale. K18 Biomimetic Hairscience Molecular Repair Hair Oil K18 launched its hair oil in 2023, and it’s been a staple in my routine ever since. I’ve yet to find a more concentrated, hydrating formula that makes my hair smooth and super shiny. A little goes a long way, but this sale is a great time to stretch your savings by knocking dollars off the $65 price tag. Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush, $23 Rare Beauty’s liquid blush is intensely pigmented, available in gorgeous shades for every skin tone, and is utterly giftable as a perfect stocking stuffer.
