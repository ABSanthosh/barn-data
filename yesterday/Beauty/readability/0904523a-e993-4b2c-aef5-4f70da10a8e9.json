  "description": "Some stories are hard to explain, but allow us to tell you about the mysterious case of Jamie Foxx's head tattoo. Heavily inked celebrities such as Travis Barker and Machine Gun Kelly have essentially become synonymous with their extensive body artwork. On the other hand, there are public figures who garner just as much buzz due to the mysterious nature of their ink collection - or the lack thereof. Take Foxx, for instance. The beloved actor, comedian, and singer, who is slowly making his way back into the spotlight after a medical scare in April 2023, has one known tattoo. For years, he's been sporting a widely known head tattoo that features a tribal design wrapping around the back of his head from ear to ear. The multi-hyphenate got the ink in 2007 to commemorate his 40th birthday and has been pictured rocking it on multiple occasions over the years. That is, up until recently. Then, in a public outing, Foxx's head tattoo wasn't visible, leading fans to do a double take and some to even jump on board a wild conspiracy theory that the \"Ray\" actor had been cloned (yep, really). If you're just as stumped by these seemingly hyperbolic suppositions regarding Foxx's now-mysterious head tattoo, or have found yourself Googling, \"Jamie Foxx tattoos\" in order to attempt to to solve the mystery, you're not alone. Allow us to connect the dots for you. The speculations began swirling on the internet when the Oscar-winning actor was spotted on a September outing to McDonald's in Los Angeles, where an onlooker in the food joint filmed Foxx from behind. In the video, the actor is seen exchanging pleasantries with the cashier. However, his years-old head tattoo is notably absent.",

  "text": "The now-deleted video was shared on TikTok by user @thedivinemasculine. It's since accumulated close to a staggering 155,000 likes on the video-sharing platform. The viral footage initially fueled theories that the actor's head tattoo is nowhere to be seen because the person in the clip might not be Foxx but a clone of the actor going out and about. To some of you, that might seem like an absurd stretch, but the speculation is actually rooted in one of Foxx's latest projects. The comedian recently starred in Netflix's sci-fi comedy \"They Cloned Tyrone,\" which led many to jokingly attribute Foxx's sudden tattoo disappearance to a real-life clone. However, what started as a harmless joke soon devolved into a full-blown pop culture conspiracy theory. Of course, the most logical explanation for the ink's absence is that the actor underwent a tattoo-removal treatment. However, many are reluctant to accept that possibility, as Foxx was hospitalized in April 2023 following an undisclosed health complication. While the clone conspiracies have reached a wider audience due in part to the internet frenzy, this wasn't Foxx's first sighting without his head tattoo. In July 2023, TMZ obtained the first post-hospitalization footage of Foxx. In it, he smiles and waves to fans from a boat on the Chicago River. He also updated his followers on social media about his recovery process in an Instagram video on July 22 2023, thanking fans, family, and friends for supporting him through the difficult time. \"I went through something that I thought I would never, ever go through,\" he says in the video. \"I know a lot of people were waiting and, you know, wanting to hear updates, but to be honest with you, I just didn't want you to see me like that, man.\" The buzz regarding the clone conspiracies didn't skip Foxx's attention either. In the same video message, the star pokes fun at the widespread rumors as he indirectly addresses the theories. \"And you know, some people talking about I'm cloned. Well, check this out,\" he says as he proceeds to pretend to peel his face mask off. \"Just kidding you. Not cloned, man. But I'm here on Earth because of some great people. I'm here on Earth because of God, man.\" So, there you have it. While Foxx has yet to comment on the status of his head tattoo, he certainly dispelled the clone theories in his own way. For now, we'll just have to wait and see if or when the actor updates fans on the disappearance of his head tattoo.Ina Bansal is a contributor at PS, where she writes for the Beauty vertical.Renee Rodriguez (she/her) is a staff writer and social producer for PS.
