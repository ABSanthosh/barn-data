  "description": "Image Source: PS Photography / Larry Stansbury Let's be honest: we've all had those nights where sleep just doesn't happen. Whether it's a late-night Netflix binge, a looming deadline, or endless tossing and turning, the morning aftermath is always the same: puffy undereye bags, dark circles, and a vibe that screams, 'I didn't get enough sleep!' Thankfully, I've tackled them in my morning routine with Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches ($17, originally $26). And the patches are currently 35 percent off right now thanks to Amazon's Big Spring Sale. As someone with a busy schedule, I love a product that can work its magic while I get ready in the morning. After testing Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches, within 15 minutes, I looked more awake than usual. Keep reading for my full review of the undereye patches. About the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches The patches are made of hyaluronic acid, retinol, glycerin, sea moss, allantoin, and ceramide to deeply hydrate and plump your skin. They're dermatologist-tested and unscented that works for all skin types. They provide hydration, reduce puffiness, and diminish dark circles. You typically see results in 15 to 20 minutes. The eye patches come in 6-count, 24-count, and 48-count packs. What I Like About the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches What I love most about Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches is how effortlessly they elevate my skincare routine while delivering real results. From the moment I apply them, the cooling sensation feels like a mini spa treatment, instantly soothing and de-puffing my tired eyes. The patches stay perfectly in place, allowing me to multitask without worrying about them slipping. After just 15 minutes, my undereye area looks visibly brighter, more hydrated, and refreshed - like I actually got eight hours of sleep! Plus, the patches make me feel luxurious thanks to their vibrant color. They're vegan, cruelty-free, and free of harsh chemicals, which makes me feel even more confident about incorporating them into my routine. After applying the patches, I was preparing to go to a dinner party and needed to put on makeup. I barely had to use concealer to cover my undereyes, just tinted moisturizer. Image Source: PS Photography / Larry Stansbury How to Use the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches Using Grace \u0026 Stella's Under Eye Patches is simple and perfect for a quick self-care boost. Start with a clean and dry face, making sure your undereye area is free from any makeup or oils. Carefully peel the patches from their protective backing and place one under each eye, ensuring the thicker part of the patch is positioned toward the outer corner of your eye. Press gently to secure them in place. Leave the patches on for 15 to 20 minutes while you relax or multitask - they stay put without sliding. Once time is up, remove the patches and gently pat any remaining essence into the skin for maximum hydration and glow. No rinsing needed. What to Consider Before Trying the Grace \u0026 Stella Under Eye Patches If you've got sensitive skin or tend to get allergies, it's a good idea to do a patch test first. The essence has powerful ingredients like hyaluronic acid and botanical extracts, so it's better to play it safe.
