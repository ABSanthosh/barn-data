  "description": "I'm not going to lie - I really put my hair through the ringer. I have been coloring it blond for the last 15 years, I use heat to style it, and I've never once taken a lukewarm shower to protect my hair follicles. Oops, I guess. So that means I really rely on quality, hard-working products to keep my hair from losing its luster. Hair masks, in particular, are my holy grail. I use them both in the shower and overnight in a treatment bun a couple of times a week to really squeeze in all of the hydration I can. I currently swear by the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask ($135). Every time I use it, my hair looks like spun gold and feels absurdly silky. Read on to learn how the Sisley formula gets it done. About the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask It adds softness and shine to hair in just five minutes. The formula contains five oils (coconut oil, meadowfoam oil, moringa oil, macadamia oil, and shea oil) and Kokum butter to hydrate hair. Ceramides and Baobab proteins surround hair in a protective barrier to prevent split ends. The ingredients are all plant-based. The hair mask has a subtle, fresh, floral fragrance. The mask is best suited to people with dry to very dry hair. What I Like About the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask Just like I'm a fan of ultra-thick moisturizers for my face, I'm partial to thick, concentrated masks for my hair - and this Sisley mask delivers. The texture is slightly sticky and creamy, which really makes it feel like it's clinging to every strand of my hair. Despite that, it distributes over my length easily without having to use a comb to move it through to the ends. I also like that this is a relatively fast-acting mask; it only requires five minutes in the shower. When I am in the mood for an overnight treatment, this one works well on damp hair wrapped in a bun or braid. When I wash it out in my morning shower, my hair feels truly changed; it's always super lustrous and soft. The subtle scent is also a favorite of mine - it doesn't overpower my senses or skew too sweet. How to Use the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask The brand recommends using the mask on damp hair for five minutes and then rinsing it out. I follow this method, but as I mentioned, I also like to leave it on overnight. If I'm using it in the shower, I'll shampoo my hair like normal and then use this treatment in place of my conditioner. I'll wring out as much water as I possibly can from my ends, apply the mask from mid-length down (never on my roots), and use a claw clip to keep it wrapped up and out of the water while I finish the rest of my shower. What to Consider Before Trying the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask Everyone's hair texture is different, so you should consider your personal hair-care needs before trying this mask. If your scalp is on the oily side or your hair is super fine, this mask may be too heavy for you. TL;DR, this mask won't harm your hair - it might just be too rich. Where Is the Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask Available? The Sisley Paris Intense Nutrition Hair Care Mask is available at sisley-paris.com and at retailers such as Saks 5th Avenue, Neiman Marcus, Dermstore, Bloomingdales, and Bergdorf Goodman.
