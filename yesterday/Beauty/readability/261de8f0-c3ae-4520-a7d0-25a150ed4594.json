  "description": "Cara Delevingne makes it her mission to always keep learning. \"I don't like to be stagnant,\" the model and actor says. In the past, that goal has led her to Malaysia, where she learned about the wild tiger population there. Most recently, it saw her traveling to the Cannes Film Festival, as she has many times before, but this time she was there specifically in support of women in film. This year, Delevingne partnered with L'Oreal Paris for the 5th annual Lights of Women's Worth Award. \"One of my big beliefs is supporting women,\" she says. \"I believe, more than anything, that we need more women's stories, more female voices, more perspectives. Women are more than half of the population and they are 17 percent of the directors. Spotlighting these female visionaries and female filmmakers is a really big deal.\" To fuel her passion for supporting other women, she thinks it's important to prioritize her own self-care. Amid all the travel, she relies on yoga and meditation in particular to stay grounded. \"I have a practice that I do every morning and every night. It changes every day depending on what I need. It's very simple - whether it's yoga positions, chanting, maybe a little prayer to myself,\" Delevingne says. It helps her get ready for the day or unwind, depending on when she can fit it into her schedule. Movement is a top priority for her. She enjoys working out, but quickly clarifies, \"I'm not a huge gym person.\" To her, movement is more about lifestyle choices than reps and sets. \"I just love being active. Whether it's going for a hike with my friends, or I love group sports or activities - any sort of adventure stuff I love.\" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Cara Delevingne (@caradelevingne) This relates back to her desire to always keep learning: \"Curiosity keeps the mind and the body young and moving.\" Delevingne's list of tried-and-true habits that make her feel and look good contains everything from lying on a lacrosse ball to work out any knots in her upper back to drinking a nightly cup of tea, and she's recently incorporated something new that she picked up from another model. \"I just started trying the thing of sticking your face in a bowl of ice water,\" she says. \"Kate Moss told me to do it years ago. I didn't listen, but now I just started listening and it woke me up. I don't know exactly what it does, but it works. Something happened.\" \"People too put too much pressure on how [makeup] looks instead of how it makes you feel.\" While Delevingne sources most of her confidence and self-worth from within, that's not to say that doing a little glam doesn't help. \"Growing up, I wasn't the biggest fan of makeup. I didn't understand the artistry behind it. It wasn't until I got older [that I got it],\" she says. \"I think probably modeling and having makeup put on me a lot made me a bit more resistful of learning and understanding more about it.\" That's shifted, however, as she's gotten older. Now, she looks at the ritual of getting ready similarly to her yoga practice. \"It's always been for myself and I think it does feel like there is a meditative process of getting ready - whether it's you're getting ready for an important meeting or you're going on a first date or it feels like something you are doing for yourself to build yourself up.\" And in the end, that's really the key, she concludes: \"People too put too much pressure on how it looks instead of how it makes you feel.\" Jessica Harrington (she/her) is the senior editor of PS Beauty, where she oversees coverage around makeup, skin care, hair, tattoos, and more.
