  "description": "When it comes to choosing the tattoo placement for your next design, there are some areas that are naturally sexier than others. Your sternum, for example, can feel more sultry than your right bicep. Still, of all the locations, the best place has to be on your booty. That's right, sexy butt tattoos are back. So if you've been considering getting butt tattoos, you've come to the right place. You wouldn't be the only one interested in this particular tattoo trend: Halsey, Cardi B, and Teyana Taylor are among the many celebrities who've decided to embellish their bums with cheeky designs (yes, pun intended) - and it's easy to see why. For one, it's in a relatively hidden spot that not everyone will get to see. This makes the tattoo your (and anyone else you choose to show) little secret. Not to mention, the sex appeal of a tattoo is generally in its placement; the right design may end up being the best permanent reminder of just how hot you truly are. Whether you're thinking of adorning your backside with a subtle and tiny design or turning your entire butt into a hyperrealistic work of art, we've rounded up a ton of inspiration that proves a butt tattoo can also be tasteful.
