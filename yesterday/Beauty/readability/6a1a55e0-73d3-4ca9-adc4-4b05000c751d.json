  "description": "Curly hair comes with a unique experience than with any other hair type. Beyond the styles you can create, each curl and coil seemingly has a personality of its own, and regardless of what's been said in the past, even how you color your curls requires special care. Still, as much fun as curly hair can be, it hasn't always been as celebrated as it is today, so it's not uncommon to hear someone say that they're not exactly sure how to care for their natural texture. Like the rest of the hair-care space, there are curly hair rules that you should abide by for optimal results. The best shampoo to use based on your hair's porosity, how to properly detangle, and even what towels can disrupt your curl pattern are secrets that only a select few are privy to. Not to mention, the beauty commandments vary by curl type, too. Wavy hair is very different from coily textures. Thankfully, the landscape has started to change with the rise of natural-hair influencers and more curly-haired representation in the beauty industry. It's time for the veil of mystery to be completely lifted. We called in hair expert Eladia Lebron to create a beginner's guide of the best curly hair tips out there. Ahead, she shares how to take care of each curly hair type and explains everything from how to apply conditioner properly to how to plop your curls - no curling iron required. To learn how to style your hair once and for all, keep reading for all the best curly hair tips and tricks. - Additional reporting by Jessica Harrington Experts Featured in This Article Eladia Lebron is a master stylist and educator at Rëzo Salon in New York City.",

Here's everything you need to know. How to Wash Wavy HairWhen shampooing this hair type, it's tempting to rake conditioner from root to tip, but the right way to do so is with the press-and-smooth strategy. Squeeze the conditioner from mid-shaft to ends, then run your fingers through to detangle. \"The cuticle for curly hair isn't a smooth cuticle, so you have to smooth it in yourself,\" says Lebron. Once the product is distributed, rinse with cool water to close the hair cuticle completely and lock in the moisture. How to Define WavesIt can be hard for waves to take shape, but it's all in the twirl. When they are dripping wet (before you blot dry), coax hair into waves by twisting sections away from the face or giving them a gentle shake. Add a product like the Ouidad Advanced Climate Control Stronger Hold Heat \u0026 Humidity Gel ($26) to cut down on frizz and help with definition. You've likely also heard of the scrunching technique for curl definition, but you may have been doing it all wrong. Here's the right way: cup the ends of your hair and push the curls upward. Squeeze just around the ears, release, then slowly move your hands away. Go section by section so that every area gets equal attention. This technique helps each curl separate. How to Dry Wavy HairRubbing your head with a terry towel is the quickest way to ruin any natural curl definition. The Aquis Hair Wrap ($30) hair-drying towel is a better solution, but don't put it in the dryer. \"The ridges open up more and create frizz when you put it in the dryer,\" Lebron says. Since the fibers are smooth, a T-shirt is also a great alternative to blotting your hair dry. That bowl-like contraption that comes with your blow dryer is a diffuser, and it's one way to dry your curly hair fast. First, spritz wet hair with a hair spray like the Amika Fluxus Touchable Hairspray ($26) to keep frizz at bay. When you use a diffuser, such as the Drybar The Bouncer Diffuser ($34), cup your curls between the attachment and your hand so you can feel when your hair gets too hot. Once your hair is completely dry, hit it with a cool blast to add even more shine. How to Style Wavy hairWhile those with coily hair have the Afro pick, wavy and curly textured folks can use a chopstick to tease hair. Just push the hair from mid-shaft to roots to get more volume (never tease the ends, where you want to preserve the curl pattern). You can also use this unusual tool to separate ringlets without frizzing the hair up. Waves tend to get crushed after eight hours of rolling around in the sheets. You can save your waves by wearing a ballerina bun to bed. Don't run your fingers through the hair — just gather it into one hand, twist, and pin up with bobby pins or a satin hairband. In the morning, you can refresh the ends with water and a shine serum.",
