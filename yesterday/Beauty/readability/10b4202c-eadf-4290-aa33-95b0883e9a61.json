  "description": "Parched skin and summer often go hand-in-hand. Whether it's a long flight, sun-bathing, or cocktails by the pool, this season is full of dehydration culprits. For dewy skin, we're turning to one of Kourtney Kardashian Barker's favorite skincare brands, Peach \u0026 Lily. The Korean beauty line is currently offering a 40 percent discount on their Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Discovery Kit ($39, originally $65), and we're ready to stock our carry-ons. The kit offers travel sizes of their popular four-step skincare routine which cleanses, hydrates, calms, and brightens skin while protecting from skin radicals. It's created for all skin types, so whether you're battling acne or dryness, key ingredients like hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, chammomile flower extract, matcha, and peach extract will help you get your glow back. So what exactly is included? You'll get the Peach \u0026 Lily Power Calm Hydrating Cleanser ($29) (Kardashian Barker's go-to!), the Peach \u0026 Lily Wild Dew Treatment Essence ($39), the Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Refining Serum ($39), and the Peach \u0026 Lily Matcha Pudding Anti-Oxidant Cream ($72). In true Kardashian Barker form, the products feature clean ingredients that are cruelty-free and vegan. Even our editors are fans (just read our Peach \u0026 Lily Glass Skin Collagen Mask review). Make sure to get your hands on a kit while supplies (and the sale!) last.
