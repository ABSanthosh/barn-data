There was quite a bit that I had on my list to try and the sale came at the perfect time! Skincare Haul Picks My skin has been going through some changes the last month so I’ve been on the search for new moisturizers and serums to try. Here’s what I picked up: Dr. Dennis Gross Vitamin C Lactic Acid Serum – I haven’t had a chance to try this yet but I’ve heard so many good things, I might pick up the moisturizer version too, if you have a favorite Vitamin C Serum let me know in the comments! Alpyn Super Peptide and Ghostberry Moisturizer – This was the most recommended moisturizer from all of you! I asked for recommendations on my Instagram Stories and this hands down was everyone’s favorite, I’ve tried it and really like it. Once my skin rebalances or goes back to normal I think this will be one I reach for a lot. Right now my skin is super dehydrated so I’m in need of something heavier. iNNBeauty Project Extreme Cream and Firming Eye Cream – I’ve been so curious about this brand. I’ve seen it pop up everywhere on my feed too! After some debating and feedback from you I decided to try it and I am 100% in love with both. 100% worth trying even though they are richer formulas. Quite a few of you mentioned you live in hot climates and still love this. I am going to buy the full size of the moisturizer before the sale ends tonight. Biodance Bio Collagen Mask Set – Another viral skincare product I’ve been curious about. I have yet to try this since they recommend you apply for several hours. I can’t wait to try it. I restocked the Kiehl’s Ultra Facial Cleanser (my favorite) and Andrew picked up another Drunk Elephant Protini Polypeptide Cream even though I have my own stock pile at home that I share with him, he really likes this one. Sunscreen Buys Andrew and I are on a mission to try as many sunscreens as possible. Now that we’re in Miami where it’s hot and very sunny we’re being more diligent about applying sunscreen every single day and re-applying. Also since it’s hotter here we are trying to find the best sweat-proof one that doesn’t slide off immediately with sweat but that also won’t clog our pores or feel greasy. This has been a challenge since Andrew does not like mineral formulas and doesn’t want to wear anything that feels greasy. Shiseido Ultimate Sun Protector Lotion Mineral SPF60 – This is a new formula and I tried this for the body. Although it’s mineral it blends out nicely. Still has a bit of a white cast but I like that it isn’t thick. I have to test it at the pool or beach to give my full thoughts but so far I’m giving it a thumbs up. I don’t know that I will be able to convince Andrew to try it though. Ultra Violette is a brand I’ve been so curious about. I bought the Vibrant Screen SPF 50 (for the body) and like it but it is pretty emollient and doesn’t really have a dry down. That said it’s not too heavy. I also picked up the Ultra Violette Mini SPF Mates to try for the face along with the Sheen Screen SPF 50 Hydrating Lip Balm. I haven’t had a chance to try but a lot of you like these! ISDIN is another line I’ve had on my radar but I’ve been hesitant because the two most popular ones are mineral. I tried the Fusion Water Magic SPF 40 and am not really a fan of the texture. I’m going to test a few more times though. The two mineral formulas are incredible and I think these are the first mineral sunscreens I’ve actually liked. Eryfotona Actinica Ultralight Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 does have a tiny bit of white cast but they also have a tinted option called the Eryfotona Ageless Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 50 which I really love. Both are very fluid and lightweight. They’ve layered well over my moisturizer so far and I haven’t had any irritation. Dr. Jart Every Sun Day Face Sunscreen SPF 50 – This is a formula Andrew picked to try. He says he likes it and it’s not too greasy. Hair Care + Fragrance Picks I bought a few new things to try for the hair. I had high hopes for the Gisou Mini Wildflower Honey Infused Hair Perfume. It’s so cute and perfect for the purse but I’m undecided on the scent. The Ouai Team sent over their Leave In Conditioner in the St Barts scent and it’s perfect for summer. I was planning to pick one up but thrilled they sent one over! Verb Ghost Weightless Oil – I used to use this years ago and am not sure why I stopped. I picked this up to try again and LOVE it! I think it’s better than the new Kerastase Oil. A quick shout out for the Oribe Serene Scalp Densifying Shampoo, Conditioner and Treatment Spray. For me this is the best thickening line I’ve tried. I received these in PR a month ago and while it’s not a daily treatment for me, I do love this anytime I want more thickening on the hair without it feeling weighed down. Kerastase launched a new Gloss Absolu Line and I was 100% convinced this would be holy grail material. I like it but it’s not one I can use daily as the formula is too rich for my hair. I bought the entire line including the Anti-Frizz Shampoo, Conditioner, Hair Oil and Anti-Frizz Spray. I did not like the Anti-Frizz spray (it’s too thick/heavy) but I do love the oil. I bought the minis of both the Glossier You Fleur Eau de Parfum and Jo Malone Beach Blossom Cologne to try out first. I decided to go for the full size of the Glossier You Fleur which has a unique floral and salty blend. I’m not usually into osmanthus notes but this one is really nice. I had the highest of hopes for the Jo Malone Beach Blossom. I loved the list of all the notes and the packaging looks so beautiful. This one unfortunately didn’t go well with my skin chemistry and had zero lasting power. I think the best beachy scent to this day is still Creed Virgin Island Water which is quite the splurge (and unfortunately not available at Sephora) but nothing else compares. Makeup Picks I went a little overboard with the makeup haul. I with I could have been able to review everything before the sale ends, but I do have some videos with swatches that might help. Merit launched a new Shade Slick Lip Oil and Signature Sheer Lip Liner. You can see them in action here. Overall vibe of both is that they are very sheer for a minimalist look. The Lip Liners are sheer and glossy which I think are so interesting. They glide on the lips beautifully but are very subtle. The Lip Oil is also subtle but they layer nicely on top of the liner. I don’t know that I would call them must-haves for my makeup preference. I prefer something with more pigment. New shades of the Fenty Gloss Bomb Oils dropped and as a Fenty gloss addict I hauled all the shades. The only one I didn’t like is Rose Amber (it pulled too cool/grey on me). You can see them in action here and swatched here. I love the smooth texture, they feel thinner than the original Fenty Gloss Bomb. The sparkle looks intimidating but on the lips it’s not as sparkly as they look in the tube. The best ones are Fu$$y and Fenty Glow. Frosted Bunz is a repromoted which I also really like. Gisou launched new shades of their Honey Infused Lip Oils. They’re fun and I love the formula but the colors are super sheer. See them in action here. I picked up three powders to try and was able to try two of them. I really love the YSL All Hours Hyper Blur Loose Setting Powder (I bought 02 Fair Medium). I had high hopes for the Kosas Cloud Set Loose Powder but it settled into fine lines and seems to emphasize them. I think perhaps my skin is too dry for it now. I might keep this for when my skin goes back to normal (right now it’s too dry). I picked up the Givenchy Prisme Libre Matte Pressed Powder in 03 Voile Rose. I haven’t had a chance to try it yet but I am very curious about how it will perform. Quick tip for things that are sold out online. I highly recommend doing the Buy Online Pick Up In Store option. A lot of stores still have stock even if things are sold out online and you can search stores near you by zip code. If you use that option and purchase it online (to pick up in store) they will hold your purchase for a few days in case you can’t make it in right away. I picked up some Haus Labs. I swatched the Bio-Radiant Glassy Balm Highlighter Stick and they have the prettiest glassy shine. I’m not usually into a glossy/glassy look on the face but these were so pretty I had to try a few shades. For my bronzer haul picks, I reviewed the Dior Forever Nude Bronzer Jumbo sizes in yesterday’s post. Also added some thoughts about the Westman Atelier Sun Tone Bronzing Drops in Shade 2 in that post as well. Haus Labs also redid their bronzer in a Powder Sculpt Velvet Talc-Free Powder Bronzer. I’m really trying to love this as it’s SO popular but the texture just doesn’t sit well on my skin and the colors don’t look right on my skin tone. I picked the third lightest shades Terra Sol Light Medium. As a tubing mascara fan now I picked up the Too Faced Ribbon Wrapped Lash Extreme Tubing Mascara to see how it compared to the Tarte. It’s a nice one and doesn’t smudge or flake, but it doesn’t add much volume to my lashes. I think the Tarte one is much better. I restocked the Glossier Boy Brow Arch Pencil in Cool Brown and Warm Brown. Even though these don’t have a ton of product I still really like them. I can wear either the warm or cool versions so I bought one of each again. That wraps up my super lengthy Sephora haul. If you had been wondering about any of these items I hope this haul + first impressions post helps! Stay tuned for more reviews and swatches as I get back into my routine! Also have a giveaway planned this week for the blog readers and will also be hosting one on my Instagram.",

A lot of stores still have stock even if things are sold out online and you can search stores near you by zip code.
