  "description": "I'm very regimented with my daily skincare routine - but there comes a time, whether it follows a night of too few hours of sleep or perhaps a drink (or two) too many - when the only way to achieve a glow is by faking one with beauty products. A good highlighter can lend a radiating effect without making its presence too obvious - there's nothing worse than glittering crow's feet. In fact, I've been looking for an option that's subtle enough to wear during the day. When a makeup artist friend mentioned that Yves Saint Laurent's Nu Halo Tint Liquid Highlighter ($30) was her go-to for creating natural-looking sheen, I obviously had to try it for myself. I decided to go with the Rosy-Quartz color. About the Yves Saint Laurent Nu Halo Tint Liquid Highlighter It's paraben-free, talc-free, BHT-free, EDTA-free, and mineral oil-free. It comes in three shades: Bronze, Rosy-Quartz, and Gold. Key ingredients include hydrating jasmine flower extract and vitamin E antioxidants. It's best for normal skin types and is built for 24-hour wear. What I Like About the Yves Saint Laurent Nu Halo Tint Liquid Highlighter The fine micro-pearls in this highlighter bounce light off the skin in a spectacularly subtle way. I've worn it with tinted moisturizer, a blush stick, and nothing else for a glowing, bare-faced, day-time look. In fact, it's so natural that I have to turn my head sometimes to catch the right angles to even see it. It blends in like a second skin and never looks caked on or greasy. I love how versatile it is, whether I'm using it as an eyeshadow base or even dabbing a couple of drops on my collarbone when I'm wearing a low-cut dress, it can go almost anywhere. I also have very dry, sensitive skin and it doesn't trigger any rash flare ups or breakouts when I use it. I appreciate that a little goes a long way. While $30 might seem expensive for a 0.5 oz tube of highlighter, I know I'll be able to use it for months. How to Use the Yves Saint Laurent Nu Halo Tint Liquid Highlighter You can apply a few drops to your nose, cheeks, forehead, and even eyelids for a subtle pop, or you can mix it with a tinted moisturizer for an all-over glow. What to Consider Before Trying the Yves Saint Laurent Nu Halo Tint Liquid Highlighter The formula's long-lasting component is nice in the sense that it stays put, but it also dries almost immediately, so you have to work quickly. If you don't apply it exactly where you intended or apply too much of it, it's going to stay there. The saving grace is that the formula is natural-looking, so mistakes aren't very noticeable. Where is the Yves Saint Laurent Nu Halo Tint Liquid Highlighter Available This liquid highlighter is available at Nordstrom and Yves Saint Laurent.
