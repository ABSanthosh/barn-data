  "description": "I got tired of my old sound system, too many wires, a big receiver whose functions I never used, all designed long before the 4-year-old 65-inch OLED screen on top of it all, so I downscaled to a Sony soundbar, figured that was as simple as you could get, for $300, thinking of it as an experiment. I liked it but then I thought to ask ChatGPT a question I've had for a while. I want a small amp designed for today's music and video, and went through a bunch of options and came up with the WiiM Home amp. No speakers, unlike the soundbar, but hooks up to the TV via the ARC connector, and I have plenty of old speakers to try out in this configuration. I got it yesterday and the setup experience was pretty great and the feature list is totally 2025. Will have more to say for sure. Rear view of the WiiM Home amp. PS: It's from a Silicon Valley tech company btw. Nice to see a company just designing nice products and not trying to take over the world.",
