This can make it difficult to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and understand how efficiently time and resources are being used. The lack of clear insights commonly prevents teams from aligning their work with broader business goals. Sleuth is designed to be an operating system for engineering, and help teams achieve more predictable delivery and align with business needs. Dylan Etkin is the Founder and CEO of Sleuth. Dylan is an Atlassian alum who has spent the last 15 years building dev tools with Jira, Bitbucket, and Statuspage. He joins the podcast to talk about the challenges faced by modern engineering teams and innovative strategies to overcome them. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Sleuth. Gregor Vand is a security-focused technologist, and is the founder and CTO of Mailpass. Previously, Gregor was a CTO across cybersecurity, cyber insurance and general software engineering companies. He has been based in Asia Pacific for almost a decade and can be found via his profile at vand.hk.",
