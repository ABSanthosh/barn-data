  "text": "Powerful project management for all your teams News YouTrackNew YouTrack Prices Starting from October 2025 We’re introducing a few changes to YouTrack prices, which will take effect on October 1, 2025.  What’s not changing YouTrack remains free for teams of up to 10 users.  Helpdesk projects remain free for teams of up to 3 agents with unlimited reporters.  The full feature set, support, and AI Assistance continue to be included at no additional cost with the YouTrack subscriptions.  What will be changing All active upgrade and support subscriptions will continue to work until the expiration date.  You can renew your subscription at the current pricing, but only until October 1, 2025.  After October 1, any renewal or addition of users/agents will be at the new prices.  Read on to learn about the reasons for this change, how to prepare, and what it means for YouTrack Cloud and Server customers. Why are we making this change? Our current pricing has remained unchanged since 2020. In fact, many long-time customers have been using YouTrack under legacy pricing introduced more than a decade ago, with full access to all features. Since then, we’ve added significant value – Knowledge Base, Helpdesk functionality, AI Assistance, apps, and much more. The new prices reflect these enhancements and our continued investment in YouTrack. We’re grateful to the teams that have chosen YouTrack over the years. This update will help us continue to improve YouTrack Cloud and Server for small teams and large enterprises alike. How to prepare  Here’s what license administrators need to know to plan ahead: Your existing Cloud or Server subscription will work at the current price until its expiration date. No immediate action is required on your side.  However, you can renew early at the current pricing. This is only possible one last time until October 1, 2025. After that date, all renewals and user/agent additions will be at the new prices. Below are details depending on your subscription type. Updates for YouTrack Cloud Customers YouTrack Cloud per-user subscriptions If you started using YouTrack Cloud in 2020 or later, you most likely have a per-user subscription. Here’s what the price change means for your team. YouTrack will continue to be free for teams of up to 10 users – no changes here.  If your team has more than 10 users, subscription prices will be adjusted starting October 1, 2025. For monthly plans, the new pricing starts at USD 5.40 per user per month. If you prefer an annual subscription, you’ll get two months free – the new starting price will be USD 4.50 per user per month. The larger your team, the lower your price, thanks to discount increasing as you add users. You can explore updated pricing examples in our FAQ. Helpdesk functionality remains fully included with your subscription. It stays free for teams with up to 3 support agents and unlimited reporters. For teams with 4 or more agents, new pricing will apply: USD 6 per agent per month with a monthly plan, or USD 5.50 per agent per month with an annual plan. All features – including AI Assistance and support – continue to be part of the subscription at no extra cost. We’re also keeping all our discounts for startups, non-profits, educational institutions, and open-source projects. YouTrack Cloud legacy user-pack subscriptions If you’ve been using YouTrack Cloud since before 2020 and haven’t switched to the per-user billing model, you may still be on a legacy plan with user packs.  These subscriptions will continue to work as usual until their expiration date, even after October 1, 2025. There’s no immediate action required on your side. However, this will be the last opportunity to renew under your current pricing. If you’d like to extend your subscription one more time on legacy terms, you can do so only until October 1, 2025. After that, renewals will require switching to the new per-user pricing. To make this transition easier, we’re offering three extra months free when you switch to an annual per-user subscription.  This plan gives you access to more flexibility and features than legacy plans could offer: You’ll be able to add or remove users as needed – no fixed-size user packs. You’ll also get more cloud storage – 3 GB per user. You gain access to Helpdesk projects, starting with 3 agents free and unlimited reporters. The new per-user pricing will take effect on October 1, 2025. After that date, monthly plans will start at USD 5.40 per user, and annual plans at USD 4.50 per user, with increasing discounts as your team grows. You can check our FAQ for examples to estimate your cost. As always, the full set of features, support, and AI assistance are included at no extra charge. Discounts for startups, educational and non-profit organizations, and open-source projects will remain available. Updates for YouTrack Server customers  If you’re using YouTrack Server, here’s what will and won’t change starting October 1, 2025. What’s not changing YouTrack Server will remain free for teams of up to 10 users – no changes there.  If you’ve purchased a license, you still own it: all existing YouTrack Server licenses are perpetual and will continue to work. Your current upgrade and support subscription will also remain valid until its expiration date. As always, every active subscription includes the full feature set, support, and AI Assistance at no additional cost. Discounts for startups, non-profit and educational institutions, and open-source projects remain unchanged. What will be changing You can still extend your subscription at the current pricing, but only until October 1, 2025. After that, all renewals and the addition of new users or agents will be available only at the new prices. We’ll continue to offer flexible user pack options, starting from 15 users and scaling up through 25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1,000, 1,500, 2,000, and more. After October 1, 2025, these will be offered only at the new pricing. If your team is larger than 2,000, feel free to reach out to the YouTrack team to get a custom quote. Renew and save 50% If your support subscription is still active – or expired less than 12 months ago – you can renew it at 50% of the new license price. We’ll continue offering this renewal discount going forward. If more than a year has passed since the expiration of your subscription, the discount no longer applies, but you can still purchase a new license and continue using YouTrack Server with all your data intact. Helpdesk prices Helpdesk projects remain free for 3 agents and unlimited reporters.  Starting October 1, 2025, for teams with 4 or more agents, the price will be USD 72 per agent per year. Need help? We are always here to support you. If you have any questions or need help estimating prices and preparing for the change, please don’t hesitate to reach out to the YouTrack team.
