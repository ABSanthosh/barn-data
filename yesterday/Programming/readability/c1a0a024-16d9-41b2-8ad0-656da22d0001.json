  "text": "The code quality platform for teams QodanaOn the Horizon: Top Three Updates Coming Soon From Qodana As we head deeper into Q1 of 2025, some exciting new developments are underway. From expanding Qodana’s integrations with new IDEs to consolidating organizational data, many more promising new projects are in the works to help increase code quality in your team. Let’s take a look at the top three! An organization-wide dashboard Insights into all your development projects We’ll introduce a new insights dashboard to Qodana, offering a high-level overview of your organization’s code quality. It’s perfect for team leads and project managers to track trends and spot vulnerabilities and will help you get a sense of your organization’s overall code health.  ✓ View behavioral trends and usage patterns. ✓ Identify projects that need extra work. ✓ Spot critical issues and vulnerabilities. This new multiproject dashboard will enable your team to filter by the total number of problems, critical problems, and code coverage level. It will also give you an indication of where Qodana is not set up for checks or has been inactive over time. You’ll also be able to check the state of third-party licenses and much more.  Book Dashboard Demo Lightweight, self-hosted solution Data control, compliance, and autonomy We’re about to release Qodana Self-Hosted Lite, which offers teams like yours a secure, lightweight solution for implementing static code analysis and other code quality and security checks. This works well for most software development teams, especially in regulated industries, that want control over their data while they work toward technical excellence.  ✓ Maintain control of your organization’s data. ✓ Scale up codebase checks easily.  ✓ Configure Qodana to catch issues you deem most important. Keep an eye on our social media for details, or reach out to Kai Schmithusen if you’re interested in a demo.  Get Demo New Visual Studio software quality plugin JetBrains code quality for everyone on the team You will soon be able to download the Qodana Code Quality Plugin for Visual Studio via your ReSharper installer to bring Qodana Cloud or self-hosted Qodana projects into Visual Studio. Identify code issues, detect bugs and vulnerabilities, run the analyses directly in your pipeline, and then view issues in the IDE where you work for better contextual updates and learning. You also have the option to download the solution as a standalone plugin.  Want to have a say in what Qodana focuses on? We’re building Qodana with a user-first approach, and while we’ve already got a lot in the pipeline, we want to give you the opportunity to have your say! Vote on issues in Qodana’s YouTrack, and you could impact what goes into development as we go. You can also reach out to our team with specific requests.  What to do next Subscribe to Qodana news and Qodana roadmap updates (on the right).
