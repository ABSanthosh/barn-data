  "text": "Perplexity has introduced Comet, a new web browser designed to integrate natural language interaction directly into the browsing experience. Unlike conventional browsers built around navigation and search, Comet aims to support users in research, comparison, and task execution by combining browsing with persistent context and AI assistance. The browser includes a built-in assistant that remains available across sessions and tabs, allowing users to ask follow-up questions, summarize content, and perform actions such as booking meetings or writing emails. Instead of switching between applications or copying information across tools, Comet supports an interaction model where queries can be posed and refined inline, with the assistant handling tasks in context. According to Perplexity, Comet is designed to address common friction points in how people interact with information online. Instead of opening dozens of tabs or copying content between tools, users interact with an integrated assistant that can interpret intent, maintain context, and take action. Some of the browser’s core capabilities include: Conversational browsing: Users can ask questions about what they’re reading, compare information across sources, or automate tasks without leaving the page. Session memory: The assistant maintains context across tabs, allowing multi-step reasoning and cumulative research. Task execution: Basic actions, such as emailing, summarizing, or product comparison, can be triggered by natural language instructions. Comet is currently available to Perplexity Max subscribers via an invite-based rollout. Broader access is planned over the summer. Some early adopters have noted concerns with the current distribution model and performance: Only issue is this invite thing. I have received mine \u0026 use it. However, this model of distribution is flawed. I think ARC’s lack of meaningful traction was in part due to this... There isn’t time to be cute. Get it out to as many people who want to try it. Others report mixed experiences with real-world usage: I was using it at work for a bit, but I’ve switched back to Chrome/Edge. Comet is slower than both and doesn’t really add any value yet. Plus, my IT department is confused or something because some pages are blocked when I access with Comet, but work in other browsers. Despite some limitations at launch, Comet reflects a broader trend toward embedding assistant technologies into core productivity tools. Perplexity has stated that future updates will expand capabilities and incorporate user feedback, with the long-term goal of making the browser a more dynamic and contextual interface for interacting with the web.
