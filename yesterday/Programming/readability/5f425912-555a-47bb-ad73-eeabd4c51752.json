  "text": "Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that was created by Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood in 2015. It uses a cryptocurrency called Ether as its native token to power transactions and operations on the Ethereum network. Ethereum’s proponents envision a future where the network forms the foundation for a second platform layer, called L2, where decentralized applications are run. As we approach the 10th anniversary of Ethereum’s creation we wanted to understand the state of the technology so we spoke with Andrew Koller who is an engineer at Kraken, which is a software company and popular cryptocurrency exchange. In this conversation Andrew talks about Kraken, security considerations at an exchange, the history of Ethereum, L2, and the future of Ethereum. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is an AI Entrepreneur in Residence at Confluent where he works on AI strategy and thought leadership. You can connect with Sean on LinkedIn.

You scramble to troubleshoot, but the complexity of your microservices environment makes it nearly impossible to pinpoint the problem quickly. That’s why Chronosphere is on a mission to help you take back control with Differential Diagnosis, a new distributed tracing feature that takes the guesswork out of troubleshooting. With just one click, DDx automatically analyzes all spans and dimensions related to a service, pinpointing the most likely cause of the issue. Don’t let troubleshooting drag you into the early hours of the morning. Just “DDx it” and resolve issues faster. See why Chronosphere was named a leader in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Observability Platforms at chronosphere.io/sed. This episode of Software Engineering Daily is brought to you by Jellyfish, the leading software engineering intelligence platform. AI codegen tools can be force multipliers for R\u0026D organizations, but are you making the most of them? Join your peers on April 17 at GLOWLive. It’s a dynamic 90-minute virtual event that explores the transformative nature and potential impact of AI codegen solutions. At GLOWLive, you’ll hear expert insights on: Navigating a constantly-shifting landscape Adopting codegen tools successfully And measuring their impact on your team, your work, and your company’s long-term success Register today at jellyfish.co/glow and get glowing!",
