To answer that question we’re revisiting Diff Authoring Time (DAT) – how Meta measures how long it takes to submit changes to a codebase. DAT is just one of the ways e measure developer productivity and this latest episode of the Meta Tech Podcast takes a look at two concrete use cases for DAT, including a type-safe mocking framework in Hack. Tune in to learn how we leverage metrics to run experiments on productivity in our internal codebase at Meta.
