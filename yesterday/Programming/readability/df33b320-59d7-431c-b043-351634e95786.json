They function as trusted artifacts to capture the nature of a commitment and provide clarity and accountability. Software has revolutionized many business functions, including the basic mechanics of digitally signing an agreement. However, the process of managing agreements systematically and at scale with type definitions, programmatic document creation, and storage schemas remains a complex and largely unsolved challenge. Dan Selman is the product architect at Docusign and was previously co-founder and CTO of the Smart Agreements Platform, Clause. Larry Jin is the VP of Product Management at Docusign and previously worked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. Docusign recently released a developer API focused on fully modernizing and scaling the agreements process. In this episode, Dan and Larry joined Sean Falconer to talk about the frontier of digital agreements. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Docusign. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing.
