Download IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 EAP 7 The IntelliJ IDEA 2025.1 Early Access Program is nearing its end, but there’s still time to explore everything we’ve introduced in this release cycle. If you haven’t yet, now is a great opportunity to test out the latest features and improvements. For a comprehensive overview, check out the 2025.1 EAP blog section. This build brings an important update – Maven 4 support. Beyond new features, we’ve continuously enhanced the IDE’s stability and performance to provide a smooth and productive development experience. Build tools Maven 4 Support Although Maven 4 is still in development, we’ve been working ahead to ensure IntelliJ IDEA supports it from day one. The IDE is fully prepared for its arrival and offers seamless compatibility with all changes, while also delivering resilient synchronization, accurate project outputs, smooth navigation (including POM files), and loads more features that will help you work with Maven 4 projects confidently. Improved support for multi-release JARs As a professional development tool, IntelliJ IDEA supports a wide range of use cases, including advanced scenarios like multi-release JAR generation, introduced in Java 9. Previously, syncing Maven projects using multi-release JARs meant that additional source roots with different language levels within a single JAR weren’t recognized correctly. With this update, IntelliJ IDEA now properly handles them, ensuring a smoother and more reliable project setup. We encourage you to test the latest build, explore the new features, and share your feedback. The full list of changes is available in the release notes.  If you encounter any issues, please report them via our issue tracker. Your input helps us refine IntelliJ IDEA before the final release – we appreciate your support! Subscribe to IntelliJ IDEA Blog updates",
