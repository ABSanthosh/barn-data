We received thousands of incredible submissions from talented developers across the globe, each pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI. To every developer who poured their passion and creativity into this competition: thank you. You've inspired us with your ingenuity and dedication to building a better future with AI.While we celebrated our winners in a previous post, we want to take a moment to recognize some of the outstanding projects that we loved. Gemini API Competition - Honorable MentionsOmni integrated the Gemini API with macOS to execute commands and perform tasks with natural language. This streamlines workflows and boosts productivity for users, from educators and professionals to students and programmers.EcoTrack is a Chrome extension that uses the Gemini API to analyze products and calculate their carbon footprint. It suggests sustainable alternatives and offers recycling information, so users can make environmentally conscious decisions.ITMZ is a home inventory app that uses the Gemini API to easily catalog belongings. Snap a photo of a room or space to identify, list, and track items.Jana AI helps users reflect on their daily experiences and emotions, promoting mental well-being. Jana AI makes self-reflection easier and more impactful by integrating with various apps to easily capture users’ activities and offers insights based on journal entries.Eagle AI is an app that uses the Gemini API to analyze security camera events and provide detailed descriptions and actionable alerts. This reduces false positives and improves response times in critical situations.AlphaFit is a fitness app that uses the Gemini API to create personalized workout programs for beginners, adjusting difficulty as users progress. The app also provides on-demand support, even offering tips to improve form and fun word games during rest periods.There are many more innovative projects you can explore on the website.The Gemini API Developer Competition blew us away and we can't wait to see these projects come to life, whether you're streamlining workflows, fostering creativity, or tackling new challenges.",
