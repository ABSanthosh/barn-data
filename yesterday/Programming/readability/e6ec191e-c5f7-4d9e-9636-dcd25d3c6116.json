It was developed by Facebook to address the problem of over-fetching or under-fetching data, which is a common issue with traditional REST APIs. Matt Bessey is a Principal Engineer and Software Architect. Earlier this year Matt wrote a blog post titled “Why, after 6 years, I’m over GraphQL”. The post put words to many users’ frustrations with the technology, and it went viral on Hacker News. Matt joins the show today to talk about GraphQL, the problems it solves, its security vulnerabilities, and why it might not be a good fit for backend engineering today. You can find a link to Matt’s blog posts here. Gregor Vand is a security-focused technologist, and is the founder and CTO of Mailpass. Previously, Gregor was a CTO across cybersecurity, cyber insurance and general software engineering companies. He has been based in Asia Pacific for almost a decade and can be found via his profile at vand.hk.

Are you trying to protect your API with OAuth or struggling to build an OAuth server? Implementing OAuth yourself can be challenging, and even risky. Meanwhile, one-stop identity solutions can be expensive, missing necessary features, or not fit into your existing architecture. Authlete can help. Delegate complex OAuth implementation to APIs designed and developed by the experts that authored many of the OAuth standards. With Authlete, you can use your existing authentication system and the language of your choice to quickly build your OAuth server. And you’ll always stay up-to-date with the latest specifications. Focus on developing applications and shipping features. Leave the complicated OAuth implementation to the experts.
