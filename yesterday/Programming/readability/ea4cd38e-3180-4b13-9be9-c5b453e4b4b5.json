The idea of not being able to put notes in your config.json files is absolutely ridiculous. # I wish the Ecmascript committee had put more effort into real soul-saving enhancements like comments in JSON instead of coming up with contorted ways to do the same old contortions we got used to dealing with ten years ago.

I want to do some more work there. # The predictive stuff, users most like you and recommendations, have not been ported, because there are only two users, and we recommend both of them to you. And all the programs I liked a lot are great, if you haven't watched them, you should, right now, stop everything.# If you have any questions or problems, I've started a thread. # It uses WordPress for identity. I like this because it's the same identity service I'm using for WordLand, of course, and this makes it possible to use WordLand to write reviews of shows you like or don't like for Bingeworthy. It doesn't mean anyone has to read them. And I have ideas for how to use OpenAI to generate some interesting stuff from collections of reviews. All of this is just in my head, not even started to be implemented. But the idea of compatibility between the two creates some interesting possibilities, and I love those kinds of integrations, a lot like what we were doing in Frontier on the Mac in the 90s. # BTW, of course I had ChatGPT do a logo.
