Capitol evacuated. A day which will live in infamy. Objectively, January 6, 2021 was even more of a \"day which will live in infamy\" than the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. It was more insidious because while Hawaii was an American territory, January 6 was an attack on the actual center of our government. Had the mob prevailed, the US would have been defeated, there and then. The Capitol police were our last line of defense, they received no help from military. The Supreme Court should count their blessings too, because their building is just behind the Capitol.",
