  "text": "Essential productivity kit for .NET and game developers .NET Tools Events Rider TeamCityJetBrains GameDev Days 2025 – Call for Speakers JetBrains GameDev Day is back! Join us online on October 21, 2025, for a day dedicated to all things game development. We’re looking for speakers who are eager to share their knowledge, experience, tools, or creative approaches across the gamedev community. What is GameDev Day? GameDev Day is a free, live, online event hosted by JetBrains and shaped by the community. Talks are presented by developers from around the world who care deeply about their craft, from engine internals and CI/CD pipelines to debugging tips to game architecture, and everything in between. Last year, thousands of developers tuned in to hear community-driven, deeply practical sessions. This year, we’re keeping the same spirit. The event will be a single-day online experience, packed with fresh voices, practical tips, and deep dives into the topics that matter to game developers. Whether you’re working with Unity, Unreal, Godot, or your own game engine, we want to hear from you. What kind of talks are we looking for? We welcome topics that resonate with the wider gamedev community. These could include, but aren’t limited to: Engine-focused workflows and optimizations (Unity, Unreal, Godot, custom engines) Performance optimization, memory management, debugging workflows Game architecture: balancing clean code with performance CI/CD pipelines, build automation, testing from unit to playtests Architecture decisions, dev tools, or open-source libraries Cloud-based workflows in gamedev Language features in C++, C# We’re especially happy to see talks that showcase how JetBrains tools support your work, but that’s entirely optional. If you’ve got a story, idea, or experience that others can learn from, we’d love to hear about it. Talk format All talks will be presented live and in English, with a length of 30, 45, or 60 minutes, followed by a short Q\u0026A. We’ll work with you to find a time slot that fits your time zone, and we’re happy to support you with dry runs and feedback if needed. Every session will be streamed and recorded, with videos published on our YouTube channel and promoted across our newsletters, blogs, and social media. As a speaker, you’ll also receive a complimentary 1-year JetBrains All Products Pack and promotion of your personal blog, project, or course (if you’d like to share one). One more thing This year, we’re also supporting small, self-organized local meetups on the same day around the world. If you’re interested in bringing local devs together to co-watch the stream, stay tuned – we’ll be sharing more on that soon. Ready to submit? We’d love to hear what you’ve been working on, struggling with, or thinking deeply about. If you have something to share, head over to the submission form and send us your proposal. The Call for Speakers will remain open until July 15, 2025. Not sure if your talk idea is a good fit? Drop us a line at matt.ellis@jetbrains.com and we’ll help shape it with you. More information is available on our Call for Speakers page. Please make sure you read and adhere to the Code of Conduct prior to submitting. We’re looking forward to your talk submissions!
