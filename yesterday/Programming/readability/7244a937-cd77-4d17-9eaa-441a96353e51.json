You wouldn't believe the greed I've seen. It's a virus, and it needs to stop, or at least be exposed as it's happening. # Yesterday I did a podcast about why it's important to choose humble names for groups of developers working on open formats, using podcasting as an example. Another case in point, the Social Web Foundation, which is about ActivityPub and the Fediverse, when there are many other forms of the social web. Here's where the rubber meets the road. They're having a meeting in Brussels where people can demo their social web apps, but it's only about ActivityPub. If you have a project for Bluesky, or Threads, or non-ActivityPub Mastodon, or RSS for that matter, you should feel welcome there, regardless of what their Call For Participation says. # Many Tesla drivers wish they'd evict Elon Musk. On the other hand can your car do this?# My Apple Watch can unlock my Model Y, turn the heat on, open the frunk.#",
