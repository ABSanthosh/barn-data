The emulator is remarkable for simulating the complex architecture of the PS2, which includes the Emotion Engine CPU, Graphics Synthesizer, and specialized subsystems. The emulator just hit a major milestone with the release of PCSX2 version 2.0. The release brings many changes including a Qt-based interface, big picture mode, auto-selection of graphics APIs, and native support for MacOS. TellowKrinkle is a developer for PCSX2 who ported the emulator to MacOS, among other contributions. In addition to his work on PS2 emulation he has also worked on Dolphin, which emulates the Nintendo GameCube and Wii. Tellow joins the podcast with Joe Nash to talk about how he got started in emulation, the PS2 architecture, the challenges of rendering PS2 games on modern GPUs, and more. Joe Nash is a developer, educator, and award-winning community builder, who has worked at companies including GitHub, Twilio, Unity, and PayPal. Joe got his start in software development by creating mods and running servers for Garry’s Mod, and game development remains his favorite way to experience and explore new technologies and concepts.",
