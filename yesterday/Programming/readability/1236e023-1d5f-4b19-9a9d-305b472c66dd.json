This is done to ensure that containerized applications can be securely deployed. Vulnerability analysis can often be time intensive, which has motivated the use of AI and ML to accelerate the process. Amanda Saunders is the Director of Enterprise Generative AI Software at NVIDIA, and Allan Enemark works on NVIDIA’s Morpheus cybersecurity SDK team. Amanda and Allan join the podcast with Gregor Vand to talk about Blueprints and their application to vulnerability and container security. Gregor Vand is a security-focused technologist, and is the founder and CTO of Mailpass. Previously, Gregor was a CTO across cybersecurity, cyber insurance and general software engineering companies. He has been based in Asia Pacific for almost a decade and can be found via his profile at vand.hk. Sponsors Are your software deployments secure-by-design?
