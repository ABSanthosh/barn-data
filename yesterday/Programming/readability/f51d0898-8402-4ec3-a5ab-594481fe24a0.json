  "description": "If there were a Joe Rogan of the left, he would tell you to stfu and vote for Cuomo for mayor of NYC. NYC is a special place, like the Knicks are a special NBA team. And btw, Cuomo, like Trump, is from Queens. The Unisphere from the 1964 World's Fair. PS: The Joe Rogan of the left will be from Queens too. :-) PPS: Queens doesn't have an Empire State Building, and they tore down Shea Stadium. So the Unisphere from the last World's Fair will have to do. But Queens is probably the most ethnically diverse place in the world. Think about that for a minute and how the fight for the soul of the US will be fought in Queens. PPPS: I come from Jackson Heights and Flushing.",
