  "text": "FAPI is a refinement of the OAuth standard developed by the OpenID Foundation. It was conceived to solve a core problem of providing a consistent approach to API security across the financial industry, with the goal of enhancing interoperability of financial data exchange. It has now been adopted across many different industries in applications where there is an API that requires a heightened authorization security implementation. Authlete is a service that provides a set of APIs to implement OAuth Authorization Servers and OpenID Connect identity providers, allowing either to be easily made FAPI-compliant. Joseph Heenan is the CTO at Authlete, and he also leads the certification program at the OpenID foundation. He joins the podcast with Gregor Vand to talk about the origins of FAPI, the motivations for its creation, the status of FAPI development, and more. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Authlete.
