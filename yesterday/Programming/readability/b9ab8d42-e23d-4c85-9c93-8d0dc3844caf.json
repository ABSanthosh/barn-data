  "text": "Meta develops infrastructure all across the globe to transport information and content for the billions of people using our services around the world. At the core of this infrastructure are aggregation points – like data centers – and the digital cables that connect them. Subsea cables – the unseen digital highways of the internet – are critical for Meta to serve people wherever they are in the world. In fact, more than 95% of the world’s intercontinental traffic goes through subsea cables.  Meta’s engineering team prioritizes both innovation and quality when designing and deploying these cables. In the latest Meta Tech Podcast, Andy Palmer-Felgate and Pascal Pecci, both subsea cable systems engineers, join Pascal Hartig on the Meta Tech podcast to discuss the latest in subsea engineering technology. This episode dives deeper into the engineering nuances of large-scale subsea cable projects like the recently announced Project Waterworth.  Learn more about Meta’s work on these engineering feats.
