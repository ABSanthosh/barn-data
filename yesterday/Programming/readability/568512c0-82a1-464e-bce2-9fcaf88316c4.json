  "text": "AI tools are transforming how developers write code, and although it’s difficult to pinpoint how much code is now AI-generated code, estimates suggest it’s between 20% and 40%, and this figure is poised to grow in the coming years. This evolution has given rise to a new coding paradigm in which developers act as directors, guiding and refining AI-generated solutions rather than manually writing every line of code. This approach was recently termed “vibe coding” by Andrej Karpathy, and it shifts the programmer’s role from detailed coding to overseeing and enhancing AI-produced code. It emphasizes collaborative interaction with AI, blending human creativity with machine efficiency to solve complex problems. Vish Abrams is the Chief Architect at Heroku and previously worked at Oracle and NASA, among other organizations. In this episode, Vish joins the show with Kevin Ball for a wide-ranging conversation about the state of AI-based tools, whether there are limits to vibe coding, AI tools for individuals vs. AI tools for teams, the Model Context Protocol, Heroku’s managed inference service, and much more. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Salesforce (Heroku). Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
