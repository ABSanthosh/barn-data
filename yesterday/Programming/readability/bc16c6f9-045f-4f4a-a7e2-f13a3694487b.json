The model is ranked first on LMArena, a benchmark for human preference in AI responses, and achieves strong results in math, science, and logic-based tasks. It also features a 1 million token context window, with plans to expand to 2 million. Gemini 2.5 Pro improves on previous models by offering better logical analysis, context understanding, and problem-solving abilities. It performs well on benchmarks like GPQA and AIME 2025 and achieves 18.8% accuracy on Humanity’s Last Exam, a dataset designed to test AI’s ability to process complex knowledge. Source: Google Blog Gemini 2.5 Pro shows notable improvements in AI-assisted coding, scoring 63.8% on SWE-Bench Verified, an industry benchmark for automated software development. It is designed to handle code generation, transformation, and editing efficiently. Despite its strengths, some users have reported issues with code integration. A Reddit user, Jumper775-2, pointed out: It seems good but it just will not produce code without the 'insert the rest of the code here' tags. I can deal with that using chat, but when I want to use an agent to make a small change it just nukes my codebase. I can live with that, but it is annoying and prevents it from being the best coding AI, even if it knows how to write better code. One of the main improvements in Gemini 2.5 Pro is its ability to process large amounts of data efficiently. With a 1 million token context window, it can manage extensive datasets and keep track of long text inputs. The planned 2 million token expansion will further enhance its ability to analyze long conversations, documents, and code repositories. The model can process multiple types of data, including text, images, audio, video, and code repositories. This capability allows for more efficient handling of different formats, making it useful for developers, researchers, and businesses working with varied data. The rapid evolution of Gemini models has impressed many in the AI community. Siyuan Guo, co-founder \u0026 CTO at Wavvest, remarked: Just catching my breath after digging into Gemini 2.5 Pro — and wow. A 1 million token context window, soon to be 2 million, with multimodal capabilities across text, audio, images, video, and even entire code repositories. The speed of model iteration alone is wild. Gemini 2.5 Pro is now accessible in Google AI Studio and Gemini Advanced, with plans to launch on Vertex AI soon. Google has announced that pricing details and higher rate limits will be introduced in the coming weeks. About the Author Robert Krzaczyński",
