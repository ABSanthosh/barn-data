  "description": "In this episode, Charles Humble speaks withhost Brijesh Ammanath about skills that can provide developers a grounding in systems thinking. Charles is a 30-year veteran of the IT industry, including as a former software engineer, architect, and CTO, as well as former editor in chief of InfoQ and chief editor for Container Solutions. He has published “Professional Skills for Software Engineers” as a series of 14 O’Reilly shortcuts covering communication, critical thinking, documentation, and networking. Underlying his work is the idea that as complexity increases in IT systems, the roles of architects and leaders move from linear thinking to something that might be more broadly defined as systems thinking -- looking at problems and systems as a whole rather than just the individual parts. This requires a skill set that isn’t generally taught or widely valued as an industry -- in part, because it's hard to test in whiteboard interviews. It requires a mixture of communication skills; interpersonal skills; critical thinking; the ability to synthesize large amounts of information.  Brought to you by IEEE Computer Society and IEEE Software magazine.",
