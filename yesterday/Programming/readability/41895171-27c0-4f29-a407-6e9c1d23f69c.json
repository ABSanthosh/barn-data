  "text": "AWS recently introduced a new feature for its AWS Transfer Family: Transfer Family web apps. This fully-managed resource allows organizations to create a branded, secure portal for accessing Amazon S3 data directly through a web browser. According to the company, this enhancement aims to simplify S3 data management for non-technical users, providing a user-friendly and no-code solution for securely browsing, uploading, downloading, and managing files. With Transfer Family web apps, even non-developer users can easily interact with S3 data without specialized software, scripts, or IT support. These web apps provide an intuitive interface where users can perform tasks like uploading, downloading, copying, and deleting files. (Source: AWS News blog post) Transfer Family web apps leverage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Identity Center and S3 Access Grants for detailed access control. Organizations can map users and groups from existing directories directly to S3 datasets, ensuring secure and compliant data management. AWS Transfer Family also meets stringent security standards, including SOC, PCI DSS, FedRAMP, and HIPAA compliance. Users can personalize web apps with custom page titles, favicons, and domain names using Amazon CloudFront for HTTPS access. Hosted on AWS, these apps inherit S3’s durability and availability and can integrate with features like S3 Versioning, server access logging, and EventBridge-powered workflows. Creating a Transfer Family web app is straightforward: admins can generate a shareable URL within the Transfer Family console in just a few clicks. This enables authenticated users to start working with data immediately, streamlining workflows across internal and external teams. The AWS Transfer Family supports file transfers using SFTP, FTPS, FTP, and AS2 protocols, making it a versatile tool for seamless workload migrations. The addition of browser-based access via web apps expands its utility, bridging the gap for users who may not be familiar with traditional file transfer protocols. Google Cloud Storage Browser and Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer are similar services to AWS Transfer Family Web Apps for managing cloud storage through a web interface. Google Cloud Storage Browser allows users to easily upload, download, and manage files in Google Cloud Storage, while Azure Storage Explorer offers similar functionality for Azure Blob Storage. Both services provide user-friendly interfaces and robust security features. In an earlier medium blog post, Christopher Adamson explains extensively AWS Family Transfer and its benefits: As you saw, it only takes a few steps to get started with managed file transfers using Transfer Family. AWS handles the undifferentiated heavy lifting so that you can focus on your file transfer workflows and applications. Transfer Family web apps are now available in select AWS regions. Organizations can build their web apps today through the AWS Transfer Family console. For more pricing information, visit the AWS Transfer Family pricing page. About the Author Steef-Jan Wiggers",
