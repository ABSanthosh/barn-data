  "description": "There’s a funny contradiction in the AI world. News orgs, published authors, great artists, universities, want to retain ownership of their intellectual property and don’t trust the utility of AI chatbots.

As a writer, of prose and software, I want to use the new tools to analyze and develop my work. I want ChatGpt to help port my biggest piece of software from Mac to Linux where it will work far better, far into the future. I want it to reassemble my 30+ years of every day writing into something that can be read by anyone in a few days. I want it to organize new writing projects in ways I can’t. I want it to help me learn about myself. I would gladly give it access to all my creative work, if only there were a relatively easy way to do it. Rather than demanding money, I would gladly pay thousands of dollars to have it all absorbed into its models so I can study and learn. Two very different approaches to the same technology.",
