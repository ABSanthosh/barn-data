  "text": "JetBrains AIThe Agentic AI Era at JetBrains Is Here Seamless in-IDE coding and async development with Junie Software development has been significantly influenced by AI coding agents taking over more repetitive tasks, generating code faster and getting more done with less effort. It’s nice to have access to a fast coding agent or an in-IDE AI assistant, but in real-world scenarios, intelligence and trustworthiness are much more important than mere speed. Fast agents will reduce the time it takes you to complete a given task, but smart ones will tangibly enhance the end-to-end development experience, minimizing errors, bugs, and context switching, and helping you achieve high quality code. Junie, the coding agent by JetBrains, is fully controlled by the developers who use it and boasts a transparent thought process, structured task planning, and comprehensive progress tracking. Our users value a detailed execution plan for approval, an in-depth actions log with reasoning for each action taken, and extensive collaboration options, including autonomous partner-like interaction*. 83% of managers mentioned that Junie increases their team’s productivity, and 76% are satisfied or very satisfied with Junie*.  *Based on data derived from the responses of 272 individual contributors and managers, collected via the Junie Developer Experience Survey conducted by JetBrains in June 2025  JetBrains is introducing some important updates to Junie that will help to make it the perfect companion for developers seeking to create high-quality solutions for commercial and personal projects. Async development with Junie and integration with IDEs With Junie now fully integrated with GitHub, the power of async development is at your fingertips. Delegate multiple tasks simultaneously, make quick-fixes without opening an IDE, and collaborate with your team on the same project straight from GitHub. Here’s how it works:  Save time on quick-fixes and changes that don’t require you to open the IDE and code directly in your project. For example, you can localize multiple pages from one project without having to stop working on another. Run multiple tasks at the same time, even across different projects. Fix a bug in your work repository, ask Junie to implement a new feature in your pet project, and then review and adjust them together at your convenience. Explore new ways of coding as a team: assign a task to Junie, ask your teammate to review it, and then finalize the project together. Switch between IDEs and GitHub for a seamless, fast, and productive development experience. The Early Access Program (EAP) for Junie on GitHub is now open! Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, and we’re always excited to hear your thoughts and ideas on how we can improve Junie. Junie on GitHub is currently available for JVM and PHP only. Call for open-source projects Our aim is to make Junie available to as many teams as possible, which is why we offer grants for open-source projects for Junie on GitHub.  We invite all open-source developers and teams to apply for a free, 6 months license for Junie on GitHub. Our aim is to support developers in their efforts to create exciting new open-source content using Junie. Please use this form to tell us about your project and include a general overview, details of how many people work on it, and an explanation of how you plan to use Junie to enhance your work. We’ll carefully review all applications and then choose a select number of projects to receive free access to Junie on GitHub.  Smarter and 30% faster in-IDE Junie We trust you to decide how you’d like to use Junie, and we want to support you by providing an in-IDE coding agent that can handle a wide variety of tasks and projects. Junie has already proven its effectiveness when it comes to understanding complex codebases in different programming languages, starting new projects, generating high-quality code, and writing functional tests – and now we’ve made it even better! Junie has received several major updates to its functionality. In addition to significant speed increases, we’re also rolling out MCP and remote development support. Your smart in-IDE coding agent is now 30% faster: we optimized Junie’s task completion speed without compromising on quality.  MCP support is now available: the Model Context Protocol allows Junie to connect external sources like databases, file systems, or APIs.  Remote development is now supported in Junie: You can work remotely with your team and delegate tasks to Junie at the same time. Please note, it’s currently available for MacOS and Linux only.",
