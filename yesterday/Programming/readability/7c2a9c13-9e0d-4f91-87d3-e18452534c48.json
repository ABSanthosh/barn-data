However, their openness and accessibility also make them a prime target for security threats, and this makes APIs a growing focus on software teams. StackHawk is a company that scans and monitors source code to obtain the full scope of an organization’s APIs and applications, and runs tests to identify vulnerabilities and address them pre-production. Scott Gerlach is the Co-Founder and Chief Security Officer at StackHawk and previously worked at SendGrid and GoDaddy. He has an extensive background running security operations and engineering and, in this episode, he joins the show to talk about the challenges around API security and leading-edge strategies to address them.
