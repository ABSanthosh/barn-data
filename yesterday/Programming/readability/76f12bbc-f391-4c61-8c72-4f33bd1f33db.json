The company recently released its Payments Developer Portal, or PDP, which serves as a gateway for developers to build and test payment APIs, and accept, manage, and send payments on their own platforms. Developing financial APIs at a global scale presents unique engineering challenges, in large part because there is no margin for error. Jack Gibson is a Managing Director and Head of Payments Engineering, Architecture and APIs at J. P. Morgan Payments. He joins the podcast with Sean Falconer to explore the design and engineering behind the company’s payments API offering. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from information visualization to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is Head of Marketing and Developer Relations at Skyflow and host of the podcast Partially Redacted, a podcast about privacy and security engineering. You can connect with Sean on Twitter @seanfalconer. Sponsors Are you among the 65% of developers who still hard-code secrets in source code?
