  "description": "This episode explores the concept of Chesterton's fence, a principle that advises against removing or altering something without first understanding its original purpose.â€¢ Understand the core message of Chesterton's fence: before getting rid of an existing system, process, or code, take the time to understand why it was put there in the first place.â€¢ Learn about the common thought process that leads to wanting to remove things without understanding them (\"Why on earth would anyone ever do it this way?\").â€¢ Discover the parable of Chesterton's fence: the more intelligent reformer questions the removal of a fence until its use is understood.â€¢ See an analogy in code review where a senior engineer might question the removal of code or tests without understanding their purpose.â€¢ Understand the cognitive bias of illusory superiority and the Dunning-Kruger effect, which can lead to overestimating one's own abilities and underestimating the reasoning behind existing systems.â€¢ Recognise the mistake of assuming that predecessors were incompetent and that their work was done in error.â€¢ Appreciate the importance of adopting a curious mindset and trying to understand the original reasons behind existing practices.â€¢ Understand that Chesterton's fence is not a justification for never changing anything, but a caution against recklessness and the importance of being informed.â€¢ Learn that even when deciding to remove something, understanding its purpose can lead to better decisions and improvements in the future (e.g., replacing an old test with a better one).â€¢ Realise the value of learning from the experiences and reasoning of those who came before.ðŸ“® Ask a QuestionIf you enjoyed this episode and would like me to discuss a question that you have on the show, drop it over at: developertea.com.ðŸ“® Join the DiscordIf you want to be a part of a supportive community of engineers (non-engineers welcome!) working to improve their lives and careers, join us on the Developer Tea Discord community by visiting https://developertea.com/discord today!ðŸ§¡ Leave a ReviewIf you're enjoying the show and want to support the content head over to iTunes and leave a review!
