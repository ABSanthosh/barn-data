Date: April 17, 2025 Time: 3:00–4:00 pm UTC REGISTER FOR THE LIVESTREAM Session abstract In today’s fast-paced software development landscape, AI has become a powerful tool for boosting developer productivity. This talk breaks down AI’s practical role in coding through real-world examples and live demonstrations, making it accessible for developers at any skill level. We’ll explore how AI enhances everything from code completion and bug detection to automated refactoring and test generation, showing you practical ways to streamline your workflow. You’ll discover how to harness AI-powered tools for everyday tasks like code generation, documentation writing, and collaborative programming with AI assistants. Through practical demonstrations, we’ll show how to integrate these technologies seamlessly into your development routine, no matter which programming language or development environment you use. You’ll leave this session equipped with concrete AI-driven strategies to enhance your coding efficiency and elevate your development capabilities. Asking questions Dan will try to answer all of your questions during the session. If we run out of time, we’ll publish answers to any remaining questions in a follow-up blog post.
