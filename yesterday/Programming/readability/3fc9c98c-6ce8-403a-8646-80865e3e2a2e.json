  "text": "Anthropic has announced the launch of Claude for Education, a specialized version of its AI assistant, Claude, developed specifically for colleges and universities. The initiative aims to support students, faculty, and administrators with secure and responsible AI integration across academics and campus operations. Claude for Education introduces a new Learning mode designed to promote critical thinking rather than provide direct answers. The feature encourages students to approach problems independently by engaging in Socratic dialogue and focusing on fundamental concepts. According to Anthropic, the goal is to reinforce deeper learning through guided reasoning and structured templates for tasks such as research papers or study guides. Beyond Learning mode, the initiative also includes broader institutional offerings. Full-campus deployments are already underway at Northeastern University, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE), and Champlain College, providing students and faculty with access to Claude across a variety of use cases—from thesis drafting and personalized essay feedback to automating administrative workflows and converting policies into FAQs. Anthropic is also engaging in academic and industry partnerships to integrate Claude into existing educational infrastructure. It has joined Internet2, a nonprofit consortium that supports technology infrastructure for education and research and is collaborating with Instructure, the company behind the Canvas learning management system. In addition to institutional tools, two new student programs are being launched: the Claude Campus Ambassadors initiative, where students can partner with Anthropic to drive AI-focused efforts on their campuses, and a program that provides API credits for student-led projects using Claude. Feedback from the community has already started to emerge. Zaid Abuhouran, a U.S. diplomat working in international education and emerging tech, remarked: I am glad to see that this mode is designed to encourage higher-level thinking and deeper understanding rather than just spitting out answers for students. I would love to see how this mode is used by educators to cultivate more meaningful learning outcomes using AI, and evidence on how it is creating more learning gains and fostering critical thinking among students as compared to traditional learning approaches. Some questions around access have also been raised. Oxana Y.  asked: Would the AI tools availability be extended to the alumni population as well, or only for currently enrolled students? In response, Drew Bent, who works on Education \u0026 AI at Anthropic, clarified: At the moment just current students and faculty, but this is something we can look into. Agreed it'd be powerful for alumni! Claude for Education and Learning mode are now available for institutions interested in exploring the use of AI in a secure, pedagogically aligned environment. Those looking to get started can register their interest through Anthropic’s website. About the Author Robert Krzaczyński",
