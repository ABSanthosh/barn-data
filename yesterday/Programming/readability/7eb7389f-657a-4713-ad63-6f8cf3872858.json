If you're on Bluesky, follow this account. \"This is the official rapid response page of the Democratic Party.\" I've been begging the Dems to do this since 2009, a permanent heartbeat for the Dems on social media.

This is a moment. I no longer have to beg for this. It exists. So the first step has already been taken, thank goodness!!! Now it's up to us to spread the news that there is a place to find the heartbeat of the Dems. I'm going to study it, RT it, and keep the flame lit the best I can.",
