  "description": "Given that the conversation has rightly turned to billionaire-proofness of Bluesky, if they allow devs to build on Bluesky with RSS in and out, that's enough to alleviate the concern about it being billionaire-proof. They already support outbound RSS. Now just let us get into the system with just RSS. Yes, I know it's a \"third party opportunity\" but something like this, to have the required value, has to be a fully supported and maintained feature of the platform. Let's do this right, and we can spread this into Masto-Land and Threads-Land and then we can thank Elon Musk for helping us not just bridge these systems, but make them all part of the same freaking system. We can do this.",
