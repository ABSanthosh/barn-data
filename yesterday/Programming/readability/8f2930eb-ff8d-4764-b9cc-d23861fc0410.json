  "text": "OpenAI's \"12 Days of Shipmas\" event, featured daily announcements of new AI features and tools. Below is a summary of the key developments: On Day 1, OpenAI introduced the o1 reasoning model, a faster and more accurate AI system, alongside ChatGPT Pro, a $200-per-month subscription offering access to advanced models like o1, o1-mini, GPT-4o, and Advanced Voice Mode. Day 2 focused on developers with an expansion of the \"Reinforcement Fine-Tuning Research Program,\" enabling domain-specific expert models with minimal training data. Day 3 saw the release of Sora, OpenAI's video generation model, which allows users to create videos from text or images and includes a storyboard feature for greater precision. On Day 4, OpenAI launched Canvas, a collaborative tool integrated into ChatGPT that provides an editable side panel for writing and coding tasks. Day 5 featured integration with Apple Intelligence, enhancing Siri with ChatGPT responses across Apple's platforms. Day 6 introduced Advanced Voice with Video, which pairs ChatGPT's voice capabilities with video generation, as well as a Santa Mode for seasonal interactions. On Day 7, \"Projects\" was added to ChatGPT, enabling users to upload files, organize conversations, and set custom instructions for improved workflow management. Day 8 unveiled ChatGPT Search, a tool for retrieving answers from web sources, first introduced in October 2024, optimized for speed and relevance. Day 9 highlighted OpenAI o1 and new tools for developers, including Real-time API improvements and a new fine-tuning method for creating specialized AI solutions. On Day 10, OpenAI launched a feature allowing users to call ChatGPT for up to 15 minutes for free via a designated phone number. Day 11 focused on working with apps, enabling ChatGPT to integrate and function seamlessly across multiple applications. Finally, on Day 12, OpenAI previewed its o3 and o3-mini models, expected to launch publicly in early 2025, showcasing advancements in AI reasoning and interaction. Community comments regarding OpenAI's \"12 Days of Shipmas\" event reveal a mix of reactions: PhD and author Pratik Desai shared on X: Shipmas didn't disappoint. That drop was epic. 2025 is going to be crazyyy. And Lukas Haas shared: Who won shipmas? great product launches by OpenAI but few model updates. Lots of models from Google, few product updates. The AI community showed critical, engaged, and looking for more from OpenAI in terms of innovation and practical application in their AI offerings. About the Author Daniel Dominguez",
