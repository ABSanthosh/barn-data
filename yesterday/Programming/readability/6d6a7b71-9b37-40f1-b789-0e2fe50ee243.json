  "text": "Wiz is a cloud security platform that helps organizations identify and remediate risks across their cloud environments. The company’s platform scans layers of the cloud stack, including virtual machines, containers, and serverless configurations, to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in context. The Model Context Protocol, or MCP, is emerging as a potential standard for connecting LLM applications to external data sources and tools. It has rapidly gained traction across the industry with broad backing from companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google. While the protocol offers great opportunities, it also introduces certain security risks. Rami McCarthy is a Principal Security Researcher at Wiz. He joins the podcast with Gregor Vand to talk about security research, AI and secrets leakage, MCP security, supply chain attacks, career advice, and more. Gregor Vand is a security-focused technologist, and is the founder and CTO of Mailpass. Previously, Gregor was a CTO across cybersecurity, cyber insurance and general software engineering companies. He has been based in Asia Pacific for almost a decade and can be found via his profile at vand.hk. Please click here to see the transcript of this episode.
