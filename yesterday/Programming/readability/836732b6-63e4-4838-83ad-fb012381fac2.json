  "text": "Early Access Program NewsThe CLion 2025.2 Early Access Program Is Open We’re launching our two-month Early Access Program (EAP) for CLion 2025.2. The EAP allows you to try new CLion features and improvements at no cost before the stable release. You can download the first EAP build, 252.13776.55, from the link below or via Toolbox App. DOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1 EAP For the first EAP release, we’ve mostly focused on usability improvements and bug fixes. Keep reading to get all the key details! Updates to the project status widget Thanks to your feedback and feature usage statistics from previous EAPs, we realized that the UI/UX improvements we made to the project status widget in 2024.3 weren’t effective enough. Some users don’t notice the small warning icon in the status bar and have trouble configuring their project. Having the widget prominently displayed helps identify and resolve such issues more easily. So, we’ve brought back the old yellow warning banner with the Fix… option at the top of the editor. But unlike before, you can now close the banner if the warning is irrelevant to your current task. An example might be if you just need to open an out-of-project file to analyze code. Otherwise, you can configure your project as a CMake one, configure the current file separately, or create a c_cpp_properties.json. Note that even if you’re working with a file that doesn’t belong to a project, you’ll still get all the essential typing assistant features. CLion Nova updates The CLion Nova language engine has received several features and bug fixes. Here are the most important ones. Support for the TEST_P macro: We’ve extended the functionality of our GoogleTest integration in CLion Nova, adding the TEST_P macro. TEST_P is useful for parameterized tests where you need to run the same test logic with different input values. Now, you can run a parameterized test by clicking the green Run button in the gutter next to a TEST_P function. Support for the _BitInt(N) type: CLion Nova now supports the _BitInt(N) type introduced in the C23 standard. It allows you to specify integer types with exact bit widths, such as _BitInt(24) value = 1000000, providing precise control over integer memory size. CLion Nova now correctly resolves _BitInt(N) with code highlighting, code completion, and other essential features. Fixes for issues involving missed compilation errors: Previously, CLion Nova might overlook some possible compilation errors when analyzing your source code and not show the corresponding warnings in the editor. As a result, these errors appeared only in the terminal after the build was complete. Now, CLion Nova catches all the errors before you click Build, Run, or Debug. DOWNLOAD CLION 2025.1 EAP Call for feedback We value your feedback, as your experiences and insights are essential to our mission of continuously improving CLion. This is especially valuable during the Early Access Program, as it helps us refine and prepare new features for the stable release. Please share your ideas and feedback in the comments below or submit them to our issue tracker. We would also be interested in setting up a quick call with you to learn more about your specific use cases. Let us know if you would like to participate! Subscribe to CLion Blog updates",
