Whether you're enabling AI-driven workflows, tightening access controls, or just looking for a smoother daily experience, this update brings meaningful improvements to how users interact with your knowledge base.Here’s what’s new in the 2025.5 Enterprise release.Following Slack personal and channel digests and Microsoft Teams channel digests, we’re rounding out the digest lineup with a final addition: personal digests delivered directly via Microsoft Teams direct messages.These weekly summaries surface what matters most to each user—their impact, key actions to follow up on, and trending content from the communities they care about. It’s a low-effort way to stay connected to your knowledge base, and it’s fully user-controlled: anyone can opt in or out from the Teams app settings under “Notifications.”With this addition, users across platforms can stay engaged and in the loop—without needing to check Stack Overflow daily.Enterprise customers often need tighter control over what can access their Stack Overflow for Teams instance. With this release, you can now configure separate IP allow lists for the application UI and the API endpoint.This added granularity means you can permit backend integrations to use the API from specific ranges—while restricting UI access to a different set. It reduces the risk of inadvertently blocking valid automation workflows while maintaining strong safeguards against unauthorized access.For security-conscious teams operating in regulated environments, this change brings welcome flexibility and control.As more customers build internal tooling powered by large language models, we’re making it easier to bring Stack Overflow knowledge into the mix.The new LangChain-compatible document loader offers a plug-and-play way to extract Stack Overflow for Teams content via our API v3. Whether you're building RAG apps, copilots, or internal search assistants, this reference implementation helps you skip the scaffolding and get straight to integration.It’s also a foundational step toward broader MCP use cases, where APIs drive deeper, smarter connections between your tools and your team’s knowledge.Need to sync all your communities into an internal portal? Assign access policies by team or topic? Build governance or reporting workflows?We’ve updated our /communities API endpoint to return a complete, paginated list of all communities in your instance—accurately and reliably. This means better automation, less guesswork, and more confidence in the systems that depend on your knowledge structure.It’s a small change with big implications for teams operating at scale.This release also represents a significant investment in the platform’s foundation. Over the past quarter, our teams have focused on resolving a backlog of long-standing usability issues and upgrading infrastructure for performance and reliability.You might not see these updates in a headline—but you’ll feel them in a smoother, faster experience, whether you’re browsing questions, updating tags, or toggling between communities.We’ll keep listening, iterating, and polishing—because your workflows deserve it.All features in the 2025.5 release will be live in Enterprise environments by 12pm ET on July 9, 2025. To learn more, visit the release notes, or reach out to your Customer Success partner with any questions.Thanks for continuing to build and learn with Stack Overflow for Teams.",
