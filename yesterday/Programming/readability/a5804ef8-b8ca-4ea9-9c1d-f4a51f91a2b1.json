  "text": "Opera has introduced Opera Neon, a new browser that goes beyond traditional web navigation by integrating AI agents capable of interpreting user intent, performing tasks, and supporting creative workflows. The launch reflects a move toward what Opera describes as “agentic browsing,” where the browser takes an active role in helping users accomplish goals, such as automating tasks or generating content, rather than simply displaying websites. Neon is the result of several years of development and includes three core AI-driven functions: Chat, Do, and Make. The Chat function embeds a conversational AI assistant directly into the browser, enabling users to ask questions, look up information, or receive contextual summaries related to the page they’re viewing, without switching tabs or apps. The Do agent, previously previewed under the name Browser Operator, is built to automate routine web tasks. It can fill out forms, search for travel bookings, or carry out online purchases by interpreting webpage structures and content. Importantly, Opera says these actions happen locally within the browser, reducing reliance on external servers and maintaining user privacy. The third feature, Make, introduces generative capabilities. Users can ask Neon to create websites, reports, code snippets, or visual assets. These tasks are processed in a cloud-based virtual machine that runs independently, allowing projects to continue even if the user disconnects. This setup enables more complex, asynchronous workflows that traditional browsers are not equipped to handle. The use of both local and cloud-based processing—local for basic tasks and cloud for more complex ones—has raised practical questions among users. A user on X asked: Does the browser divide the AI agent into two operating modes? Can it be run locally or in a virtual machine? Opera’s technical breakdown suggests that yes, the system uses both on-device and cloud-based agents depending on the task type and resource demands. Henrik Lexow, a senior AI product director at Opera, framed the release as an invitation for experimentation: We see it as a collaborative platform to shape the next chapter of agentic browsing together with our community. The early response from the community is positive. Jitendra Gupta, a technical lead and AI enthusiast, wrote on LinkedIn: Imagine your browser actually working for you instead of just waiting for commands. This feels like the start of a whole new era—Web 4.0—where our browser helps us think, create, and stay productive. Opera Neon is offered as a premium subscription product, with early access now available via a waitlist at operaneon.com.  About the Author Robert Krzaczyński",
