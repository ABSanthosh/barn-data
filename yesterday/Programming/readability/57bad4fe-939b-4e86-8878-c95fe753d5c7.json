While here, a professor of poetry ponders (gift link) on the value and limits of AI with writing: One of the real challenges here is the way that A.I. undermines the human value of attention, and the individuality that flows from that. What we stand to lose is not just a skill but a mode of being: the pleasure of invention, the felt life of the mind at work.",
