The models can significantly accelerate code writing, but with that increased velocity comes a greater need for thoughtful, scalable approaches to codereview. Integrating AI into the development workflow requires rethinking how to ensure quality,security, and maintainability at scale. CodeRabbit is a startup that brings generative AI into the code review process. It evaluates code quality and security directly within tools like GitHub and VS Code, acting as an AI reviewer that complements existing CI/CD pipelines. Harjot Gill is the founder and CEO of CodeRabbit. He joins the podcast with Kevin Ball to discuss CodeRabbit’s architecture. Its multi-model LLM strategy, how it tracks the reasoning trail of agents, managing context windows, lessons from bootstrapping the company, and much more. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by CodeRabbit. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
