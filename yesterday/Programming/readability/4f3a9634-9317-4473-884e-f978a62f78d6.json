Common evaluation methods include code reviews and automated testing, and can help identify bugs, ensure compliance with requirements, and measure software reliability. However, evaluating LLMs presents unique challenges due to their complexity, versatility, and potential for unpredictable behavior. Ankur Goyal is the CEO and Founder of Braintrust Data, which provides an end-to-end platform for AI application development, and has a focus on making LLM development robust and iterative. Ankur previously founded Impira which was acquired by Figma, and he later ran the AI team at Figma. Ankur joins the show to talk about Braintrust and the unique challenges of developing evaluations in a non-deterministic context. Sean’s been an academic, startup founder, and Googler. He has published works covering a wide range of topics from AI to quantum computing. Currently, Sean is an AI Entrepreneur in Residence at Confluent where he works on AI strategy and thought leadership. You can connect with Sean on LinkedIn.
