WordLand is simply an editor for writers who publish to WordPress. # I'm also interested in social networks and RSS and have written a lot about that in the context of WordLand, because it generates RSS, it can connect to any app that understands RSS. But don't get confused that WordLand is somehow a twitter-like silo. There are already too many of those. I want something much simpler and I believe more useful and less spammy and abusive -- a social network built around RSS. # Like many other people I love Severance, esp this season, and esp the most recent episode. My favorite scene in the last episode took place at a Chinese restaurant. Anyway, I was just listening to the latest episode of the Severance podcast, about this episode, which you should definitely listen to if you like me love the show. They have an interview with Christopher Walken who plays Burt. Amazing stuff. But even more amazing is that I learned in the podcast that the restaurant mentioned earlier is actually a famous Kingston restaurant that just re-opened after a long hiatus, so I've not yet had a chance to eat there, but I want to, Eng's. This, after learning that the diner that's in two scenes, one in each season, is the Phoenicia Diner, one of my favorite local eating places. # Me as a grad student at UW-Madison in 1977 or so, programming on a Unix system, probably working on my first outliner. # Note that the terminal I was using had uppercase and lowercase letters. This was a big innovation! # I was using a PDP-11/45 to write in C. # See the comment thread from 2014 on Facebook.# I lived in a big house with 10 roommates. And as weird as it must seem from the point of view of 2025, I was the only one who used a computer. I would tell them all the time that we'd all use computers someday. They rolled their eyes and smiled. \"There goes Dave again.\" The reason I was so sure was email and writing tools. # Me at 22 in Madison. My mother, Dr Eve Winer, took this picture.#",
