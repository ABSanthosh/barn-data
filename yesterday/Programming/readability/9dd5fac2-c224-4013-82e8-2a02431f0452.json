Sponsors This episode of Software Engineering Daily is brought to you by Jellyfish, the software engineering intelligence platform powered by a patented allocations model and boasting the industry’s largest customer dataset. You know, one of the biggest shifts in the past year or so is the adoption of genAI coding tools like GitHub Copilot. And engineering leaders are trying to figure out if their teams are actually using it, how much they’re using it, and how it’s affecting the business. Are they shipping more? Is more roadmap work being done? How do you know beyond anecdotes and surveys? That’s why Jellyfish introduced the Copilot dashboard in 2024 in partnership with GitHub…and since then they’ve analyzed data from more than 4200 developers at more than 200 companies. Want to know an interesting finding? Developers are shipping 20.9% more with Copilot.",
