Maybe political parties should have strongmen, that might have prevented us from having one as the head of the government. # I just changed the header graphic for my blog from the 1969 Mets, to the 2024 Supreme Court. They're Americans too, and I have a feeling they're going to be on the train to Aurora or Springfield before too long, if the worst happens. # What a sad situation. What started with the open web in the 90s is now owned by billionaires, who, looking for new worlds to conquer have adopted a fascist buffoon as their frontman. It was never supposed to be owned by anyone.# The Washington Post announcing it wouldn‚Äôt endorse a candidate for president is the first glimpse we‚Äôve had of how news publishing in the US has been devastated by fear of fascism. This must go back at least as far as the 2016 election and Hillary‚Äôs emails. The editorial people broke the wall, deciding to give the readers the first glimpse we‚Äôve gotten into the inner conflicts of one two most influential news orgs in the country. # Until now this was the one story they would never report on. Truly a milestone. And now that the window is open, open it further. Report on how a major news org holds back stories that would be of intense interest to the people, if only the news orgs did their jobs. This is where the \"public editors\" never went, and should have gone. # Why hasn‚Äôt the NY Times run a story that takes Trump at face value and explains to voters what it would be like to live in that United States? It should have been updated and run every time Trump ups the ante. # An example. Trump says Americans who criticize the Supreme Court for overturning Roe v. Wade should be imprisoned: ‚ÄúThese people should be put in jail for the way they talk about our judges and justices.‚Äù # A news story on this subject should include calls to all the justices on the Supreme Court to ask if they agree or disagree. It's time to bust some new norms. They are above reproach, traditionally, but they decided that the president can do whatever he wants, break any law without penalty. Are they concerned that perhaps they might be imprisoned if they make a decision that Trump doesn't like? Let's learn from them, how they think American citizens should feel about this. After all they are American citizens too, aren't they? If we can be jailed, or worse, for our speech, why not them? üòÑ# Of course if they refuse to answer, which they probably will, that should be part of the story. No deference allowed, by the journalists. Simple factual statements. # We've relied too much on the Democrats to stick their necks out, when in fact all our necks are on the line here. So if you have something to say about this, now is the time to do it. In a couple of weeks it might be too late. #",
