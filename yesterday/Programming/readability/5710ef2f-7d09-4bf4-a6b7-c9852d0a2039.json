  "description": "In this episode, we discuss how invisible inertia can cause us to misinterpret our reality in work scenarios.‚Ä¢ Discover why common misconceptions about behaviour are so difficult to spot.‚Ä¢ Explore why your \"unique\" situation might be a common trap, a \"uniqueness bias\".‚Ä¢ Learn how exceptional states can become the norm and impact your life.‚Ä¢ Uncover how people's values shape company culture, and how to evaluate this.‚Ä¢ Why might expecting a culture to change in the direction you want be unrealistic?‚Ä¢ Learn why you should evaluate situations for what they are right now, instead of expecting future change.üôè Today's Episode is Brought To you by: Wix StudioDevs, if you think website builders mean limited control‚Äîthink again.With Wix Studio‚Äôs developer-first ecosystem you can spend less time on tedious tasks andmore on the functionalities that matters most:‚óè Develop online in a VS Code-based IDE or locally via GitHub.‚óè Extend and replace a suite of powerful business solutions‚óè And ship faster with Wix Studio‚Äôs AI code assistantAll of that, wrapped up in auto-maintained infrastructure for total peace of mind.Work in a developer-first ecosystem.
