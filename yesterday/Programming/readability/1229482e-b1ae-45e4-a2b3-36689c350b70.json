  "text": "Welcome to your flow state. This year marks our tenth GitHub Universe—and one theme has remained constant: our focus on developers and the developer experience. Over 10 years, that developer experience has evolved from inventing the pull request to building the world’s most widely adopted AI coding tool, GitHub Copilot. Today, our platform serves more than 100 million developers, and through the power of this interconnected community combined with generative AI, we are enabling every developer to build, release, scale, and secure software rapidly. We have a lot to cover. As developers, we’re not known for being patient. So, let’s jump in. Introducing new, powerful AI-native experiences The best model for the task: the power of developer choice We are bringing developer choice to GitHub Copilot with Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro, and OpenAI’s o1-preview and o1-mini. These new models will be rolling out—first in Copilot Chat, with OpenAI o1-preview and o1-mini available now, Claude 3.5 Sonnet rolling out progressively over the next week, and Google’s Gemini 1.5 Pro in the coming weeks. From Copilot Workspace to multi-file editing to code review, security autofix, and the CLI, we will bring multi-model choice across many of GitHub Copilot’s surface areas and functions soon. Whether it’s in VS Code or on GitHub.com, individual developers can now decide which models work best for them, while organizations and enterprises have full control over which models they enable for their team. Try multi-model Copilot today! AI-native = GitHub Copilot Workspace + Code Review + Copilot Autofix With Copilot Workspace in pull requests, you can rapidly refine, validate, and land Copilot-generated code suggestions coming from Copilot code review, Copilot Autofix, and third-party Copilot Extensions. Get your pull requests “ready to merge” faster than ever. Learn about GitHub Copilot Workspace and Copilot Code Reviews \u003e Bring your ideas to life with GitHub Spark It starts with an idea. It always does. When we’re kids, we have thousands of them. Many of them are silly. Some of them are crazy. Today, we are giving you a new product to try all of them. We call it GitHub Spark—it’s powered by natural language, and it sets the stage for our vision to help 1 billion people become developers. This is about fun and personal software, not about enterprise productivity apps. With live history, previews, and the ability to edit code directly, GitHub Spark allows you to create micro apps that take that crazy small, fun idea and bring it to life. Go and play… Learn about the GitHub Spark technical preview \u003e Increasing your productivity with the Copilot-powered developer platform Momentum is our oxygen. And that is why we are announcing a wide range of improvements to accelerate how you build, release, scale, and secure software. Get ready to unlock your creativity.
