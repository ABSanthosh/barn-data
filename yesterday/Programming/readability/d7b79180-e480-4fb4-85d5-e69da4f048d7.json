  "text": "May is Maintainer Month–a chance to spotlight the people behind the projects powering the internet. We’re marking the occasion by opening applications to two high-profile opportunities where open source projects can take center stage. Whether you’re maintaining a mission-critical dev tool or launching a weekend side project that’s gaining traction, this is your shot to show the world what you’ve built. This summer and fall (or winter and spring, depending on what part of the world you live in!), bring your project to life. Connect with the developers who’ll use it. Tell the story only you can tell. Event 1 – Open Source Spotlight @ WeAreDevelopers World Congress 📅 July 9 – 11, 2025📍 Berlin, Germany📝 Apply by May 31 We’re heading to Europe for the 10th anniversary of WeAreDevelopers World Congress–one of the world’s largest developer conferences, drawing more than 15,000 engineers, contributors, and tech leaders for three days of code, conversation, and controlled chaos.  We’re bringing the Open Source Spotlight back to the show floor–a dedicated space in our booth, where your terminal, your live demo, and your repository get real-world attention. Fun fact: Thomas Dohmke, GitHub CEO, Copilot power user, and my boss’s boss’s boss is keynoting at this year’s World Congress. Your project could be just a few booths away. (Not saying he’ll swing by, but it has happened). What’s in it for you (besides fame, glory, and stickers)? Live demo space in GitHub’s booth Two free exhibitor passes to explore the full event Visibility with more than 15,000 developers, decision makers, and future fans Event 2 – Open Source Zone @ GitHub Universe 📅 October 29 – 30, 2025📍 San Francisco, CA📝 Apply by July 31 The Open Source Zone is a vibrant corner of GitHub Universe dedicated to celebrating the open source community. This is your chance to demo your project live, share your story, and connect with thousands of developers, contributors, and industry leaders from around the world. Last year, maintainers showcased everything from browser-based VR to open source AI tooling. This year, we want to see your project on display. @dmarcos casually bending reality with A-Frame in the Open Source Zone last year ✌🏻 Ready to bring your project from README to real-world? Here’s what you get: Your project in front of thousands of developers and decision makers A booth space with power, Wi-Fi, and good vibes Two free passes (because flying solo isn’t always fun) Travel stipends are available if you’re coming from far away “Booth duty isn’t everyone’s idea of a vacation, but if you’re passionate about your project and love nerding out with other developers, these are some of the best places to do it.” Lee Reilly, self-quoting in third person like it’s totally normal  For maintainers, by maintainers Maintainer Month is about celebrating your work and amplifying your impact, and these events are built to do exactly that. So whether you’re building a Python package, hardware firmware, or the next big AI dev tool, we want to help you share it with the community that matters most: other developers. Let’s celebrate maintainers. Not just in May, but all year long. Got questions? Curious if your project’s a fit? Drop us a line at opensourcezone@github.com. We’d love to hear what you’re working on.
