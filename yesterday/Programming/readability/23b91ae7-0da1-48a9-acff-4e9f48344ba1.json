It addresses the inefficiencies of older APIs like OpenGL and Direct3D and helps solve issues with cross-platform compatibility. Tom Olson is a Distinguished Engineer at ARM, and Ralph Potter is the Lead Khronos Standards Engineer at Samsung. Tom and Ralph are also the outgoing and incoming Chairs of the Vulkan Working Group. They join the podcast to talk about earlier graphics APIs, what motivated the creation of Vulkan, modern GPUs, and more. Joe Nash is a developer, educator, and award-winning community builder, who has worked at companies including GitHub, Twilio, Unity, and PayPal. Joe got his start in software development by creating mods and running servers for Garry’s Mod, and game development remains his favorite way to experience and explore new technologies and concepts. Sponsors This episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you’re building a, B2b, SaaS app, at some point, your customers will start asking for enterprise features like single sign on, skim provisioning, fine grained authorization and audit logs. That’s where WorkOS comes in with easy to use and flexible APIs that help you ship enterprise features on day one without slowing down your core product development today, some of the hottest startups in the world are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Perplexity, Versal, Brex, and WebFlow. WorkOS also provides a generous free tier of up to 1 million monthly active users for user management,making it the perfect authentication and authorization solution for growing companies. It comes standard with rich features like bot protection, MFA, roles and permissions, and more. If you are currently looking to build SSO for your first enterprise customer, you should consider using WorkOS. The APIs are easy to use in modular, letting you pick exactly what you need to plug into your existing stack. Integrate in minutes and start shipping enterprise plans today.
