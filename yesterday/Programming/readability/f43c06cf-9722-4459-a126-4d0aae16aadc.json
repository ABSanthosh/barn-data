  "text": "IntelliJ IDEA – the IDE for Professional Development in Java and Kotlin LivestreamsNew Livestream – Troubleshooting Spring Boot Applications with the Spring Debugger Join us for a new IntelliJ IDEA Livestream episode with Marco Belher and explore how to uncover and fix Spring Boot bugs using the Spring Debugger in IntelliJ IDEA. Date: July 17, 2025 Time: 3:00–4:00 pm UTC REGISTER FOR THE LIVESTREAM Session abstract Spring Boot hides a lot of complexity to help you build applications quickly. But when things go wrong – misconfiguration, incorrect bean injection, or tricky transaction behavior – debugging rapidly becomes complicated. In this stream, we’ll use the Spring Debugger for IntelliJ IDEA to explore real-world issues in Spring Boot applications. Whether you’re just getting started or already deep into production systems, you’ll learn how to uncover hidden problems, understand what’s really going on in your app, and find and fix issues in the code. We’ll walk through live examples, from simple mistakes to tricky bugs, and show how the IDE helps you troubleshoot step by step. Asking questions Marco will try to answer all of your questions during the session. If we run out of time, we’ll publish answers to any remaining questions in a follow-up blog post. Your speaker and host Speaker Marco Behler Marco works as a developer advocate at JetBrains in Munich, Germany. He loves to share everything he knows about writing and building awesome software – knowledge he acquired from a decade of consulting in the Java and Spring ecosystems – through guides, tweets, books and talks. Host Andrey Belyaev Andrey Belyaev is a product manager on the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate team. He works on various plugins and is now primarily focused on cloud and deployment support in IntelliJ IDEA.
