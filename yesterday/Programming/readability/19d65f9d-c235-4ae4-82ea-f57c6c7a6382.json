It was a cultural phenomenon and an early showcase for 3D graphics in console gaming. Dominic Szablewski is an engineer, game developer and hacker who has released projects such as Voidcall, Quake VR, and Q1K3 which is a 13 kilobyte version of Quake written in JavaScript. A version of the WipEout source code was leaked in 2022 and Dominic created a nearly complete rewrite of the game that compiles to Windows, Linux, macOS and WASM. Dominic joins the podcast to talk about the project. Joe Nash is a developer, educator, and award-winning community builder, who has worked at companies including GitHub, Twilio, Unity, and PayPal. Joe got his start in software development by creating mods and running servers for Garry’s Mod, and game development remains his favorite way to experience and explore new technologies and concepts.
