  "text": ".NET Tools News ReSharper PlatformReSharper 2025.2 EAP 2: First Public Build with Out-of-Process Mode Support  We’re thrilled to announce that ReSharper 2025.2 EAP 2 is the first public build to introduce support for running ReSharper out-of-process (OOP) with Microsoft Visual Studio. This long-anticipated architectural change lays the foundation for better stability and performance in the future, as it decouples the ReSharper process from the Visual Studio one. More on that in our latest progress update blog post. Although still in preview, OOP support is now available to all users who’d like to try it and help us refine it by providing feedback.  How to try ReSharper in Out-of-Process mode After installing the EAP 2 build, you can enable OOP mode via ReSharper’s Options | Environment | Products \u0026 Features. Simply check the box labeled “Run ReSharper in separate process” and click Save and restart to apply the change. This will reinitialize ReSharper without restarting the entire IDE. Afterward, ReSharper will start in OOP mode by default. You can also toggle between Out-of-Process and In-Process modes at any time via the status bar toggle in the bottom-right corner of Visual Studio. What to expect Running ReSharper out-of-process helps isolate ReSharper’s workloads from Visual Studio, potentially reducing any conflicts and freezes over time. However, as this is a preview build, you may notice some rough edges at this stage. With this build, you’ll likely see an increased number of exceptions reported during startup. This is a known issue and does not indicate actual runtime errors. These exceptions will be smoothed out in upcoming builds, and you can safely ignore them for now. Known limitations  Some features are not yet fully supported in out-of-process mode and may not operate as intended: AI-powered features Debugger features DPA, dotMemory, dotTrace, dotCover integrations Template editor Structural Search and Replace Regular expression validation Diagramming We’re actively working to bring these features up to speed in OOP mode, and your feedback is invaluable in helping us prioritize fixes. ReSharper C++ updates The EAP 2 build introduces initial support for several C++26 features, including: = delete(\"reason\") Placeholder variables Attributes for structured bindings We’ve added support for C11 _Atomic types.Index hints now supported in std::initializer_list. New formatter setting to add spacing before a colon in constructor initializers. Share your thoughts with us We’d love to hear what you think – let us know on X (formerly Twitter), Bluesky, or drop a ticket through YouTrack. Stay tuned for further improvements in upcoming builds!
