This has motivated the development and widespread adoption of dedicated observability platforms. Prometheus is an open-source observability tool designed for cloud-native environments. Its strong integration with Kubernetes and pull-based data collection model have driven its popularization in DevOps. However, a common challenge with Prometheus is that it struggles with large data volumes and has limited cost-optimization capabilities. This raises the question of how best to handle Prometheus deployments at large scale. Eric Schabell works in DevRel at Chronosphere where he’s the Director of Community and Developer. He is also a CNCF Ambassador. Eric joins the show with Kevin Ball to talk about metrics collection, time series data, managing Prometheus at scale, tradeoffs between self-hosted vs. managed observability, and more. Full Disclosure: This episode is sponsored by Chronosphere. Kevin Ball or KBall, is the vice president of engineering at Mento and an independent coach for engineers and engineering leaders. He co-founded and served as CTO for two companies, founded the San Diego JavaScript meetup, and organizes the AI inaction discussion group through Latent Space.
