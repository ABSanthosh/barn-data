We’ve had a great time putting together all of our episodes this year, and we’re grateful for your support. This year we continued our wide lens coverage of software engineering, and we also expanded our coverage of security, AI, and game development. We want to extend our thanks to all of our fantastic guests for sharing their time and expertise. We’re really excited about our 2025 podcast season and we think you’re going to love what we have in store. As always, we’re committed to bringing you high-caliber experts from across the tech landscape, and we can’t wait to explore new topics and perspectives in the coming year. To close out 2024, we’ll be pausing releases this week to spend time with our families, but we’ll be back with new episodes the first week of January. Please consider leaving us a review on Apple Podcasts or Spotify if you haven’t yet. We take your feedback very seriously and it helps us improve the show. And, if you have any topics or guests you’d like to hear on the podcast we want to know, and you can send them our way at editor@softwareengineeringdaily.com. Thank you again for listening to Software Engineering Daily and we wish you all a happy New Year!",
