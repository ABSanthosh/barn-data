  "text": "The 10th-seeded Florida Gators defeated the 15th-seeded South Carolina Gamecocks in the first round of the 2025 SEC Baseball Tournament on Tuesday evening, 11-3.Florida trailed 1-0 after the first inning but a three-run second inning rally turned the tables on South Carolina, resulting in four straight frames with a runner crossing the plate while the 'Cocks laid gooseeggs on the scoreboard until the eighth. Kevin O'Sullivan's team responded to the late push by their opponent by plating four more runners, leading to the eventual final score.The Orange and Blue left USC's pitching staff black and blue with its offensive assault, seeing seven players get at least one hit while five notched multiple-hit games. Most notable from that pack was designated hitter Ty Evans, who went 3-for-5 with two RBI and a pair of doubles. Shortstop Bobby Boser brought the boom with a three-run dinger as one of his two hits in four at-bats, which included a walk as well.Aside from Evans and Boser, Florida's multi-hit performances also came from first baseman Brendan Lawson (2-for-5, 2 RBI), catcher Brody Donay (2-for-4, HR, BB) and right fielder Hayden Yost (2-for-4, 2B, HR, BB).Starting pitcher Billy Barlow got into some trouble in the opening frame but rebounded to throw 3 2/3 innings, allowing just an early run on four hits and three walks while striking out two. Blaine Rowland relieved him and gave another 3 2/3, surrendering a pair of runs on six hits — but no walks — and two Ks.Christian Rodriguez tossed the final 1 2/3 frames, keeping the 'Cocks scoreless on just a hit and no walks while striking out two. By the time he came in, the save opportunity was long gone.Next up for Florida baseballThe Gators will take on the 7th-seeded Ole Miss Rebels on Wednesday, May 21, at 9 p.m. ET inside Hoover Metropolitan Stadium in Hoover, Alabama, for the second round of the 2025 SEC Baseball Tournament.
