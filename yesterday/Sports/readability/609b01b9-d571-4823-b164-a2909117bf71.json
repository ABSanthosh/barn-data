Now that every NFL team's schedule is public, the Packers are set to play five games in primetime in 2025.This number comes as no surprise considering the Packers are once again expected to be in playoff contention and have mass appeal to viewers.Last year, the Packers went 3-2 in primetime games, but all three of their wins were against teams that failed to make the playoffs, while both losses were against playoff teams. Knowing primetime games are usually against tougher competition, Green Bay hopes to stack up better this time around.Here are the five primetime games on the 2025 schedule for the Packers:Week 2 vs Washington CommandersWhen: Thursday, September 11Where: Lambeau FieldHow To Watch: Amazon Prime VideoGreen Bay faces a tough challenge in its first primetime game of 2025. Led by rookie phenom Jayden Daniels, the Commanders finished 12-5 last season and reached their first NFC Championship since 1992. Washington is a fun, exciting team with lofty expectations, but so are the Packers. This should be a fun one.Week 4 vs Dallas CowboysWhen: Sunday, September 28Where: AT\u0026T StadiumHow To Watch: NBCGreen Bay has had no issue traveling to Jerry's World since it opened in 2009, boasting a 5-0 record against Dallas, including the playoffs. After losing to the Packers in the 2023 postseason, injuries sent the Cowboys spiraling last year and cost Mike McCarthy his job. Dallas got Dak Prescott another weapon in George Pickens, but will it be enough to finally defend their home turf against Green Bay?Week 8 vs Pittsburgh SteelersWhen: Sunday, October 26Where: Acrisure StadiumHow To Watch: NBCThe Packers will have three primetime games within the first eight weeks of the season. Needless to say, this matchup would have plenty of excitement around it if Aaron Rodgers is the starting quarterback for the Steelers. Not only would it be a Super Bowl XLV rematch, but also the first—and possibly only—time Green Bay faces Rodgers after trading him in 2023.Week 10 vs Philadelphia EaglesWhen: Monday, November 10Where: Lambeau FieldHow To Watch: ESPN/ABCThe Packers fell to the Eagles twice last season—once in the season-opening loss in Brazil and then again in the NFC Wild Card Round, eliminating them from the playoffs. This will be a heavily anticipated mid-season matchup against two premier NFC teams. Not only can the Packers avenge last season's losses, but they will have an opportunity to take down the defending Super Bowl champions on a massive stage.Week 16 vs Chicago BearsWhen: Saturday, December 20Where: Soldier FieldHow To Watch: FOXThis game will either be at 3:30 or 7:00 pm CST. The Packers and Bears have met in primetime many times over the years, and typically, those games have ended in a Bears beatdown. However, the Bears defeated Green Bay to close out the 2024 season, and now, they have a new head coach and have added key pieces to their offense and defense during the offseason. This game may have divisional or playoff implications this late in the season. Facebook Twitter Email",
