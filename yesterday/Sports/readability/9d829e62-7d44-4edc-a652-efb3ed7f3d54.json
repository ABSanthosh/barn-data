  "text": "Shams details why Heat suspended Jimmy Butler indefinitely (1:18)Shams Charania details the steps that led to Jimmy Butler being suspended indefinitely by the Miami Heat. (1:18)The Miami Heat are suspending forward Jimmy Butler without pay for an indefinite period of time after the disgruntled star walked out of practice Monday, the team announced.It's the third time Butler has been suspended by the Heat in recent weeks, and it comes after he was expected to return from his second suspension Monday night against the Orlando Magic. The Heat said the latest suspension will last at least five games, which will take it through the NBA's trade deadline Feb. 6.The Heat were planning to replace Butler in the starting lineup with Haywood Highsmith beginning with Monday's game in Orlando, sources said, but he responded to the news by walking out of the morning shootaround.\"The suspension is due to a continued pattern of disregard of team rules, engaging in conduct detrimental to the team and intentionally withholding services,\" Miami said in its statement. \"This includes walking out of practice earlier today.\"Butler has missed nine of Miami's past 12 games because of the prior suspensions, the first of which was for seven games due to conduct that the Heat deemed detrimental. After Butler returned for three games, the Heat suspended him for two games after he missed a team flight to Milwaukee last week.The veteran has requested a trade, and the Heat have said they are working to find a deal.\"We didn't talk about anything today other than preparing for the Magic. ... We're just focusing on the task at hand,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said before Monday's game. \"There's no better place to be than just the present moment.\"Butler faces losing $532,737 per game under the latest suspension.The Associated Press contributed this story.",
