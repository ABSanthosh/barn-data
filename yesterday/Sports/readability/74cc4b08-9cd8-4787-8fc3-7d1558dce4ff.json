  "text": "Ball boy heroics, penalties \u0026 comeback chaos on epic Nations League nightImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cristiano Ronaldo had a mixed night - but ultimately ended up on the winning side as Portugal saw off Denmark\"We got up this morning with the idea it could be a great night.\"Little did you know, Kylian Mbappe. Little did you know.The France forward was speaking after his side's dramatic penalty shootout victory over Croatia in the Nations League, but in truth it barely even begins to cover the chaos that unfolded across the competition's quarter-final second legs on Sunday.There were 21 goals across four games, three of which went to extra time and two all the way to sudden death in a shootout. As teams piled forward with carefree abandon, there were a whopping 131 attempts on goal in total. It was bedlam.The matches ended as follows:France 2-0 Croatia (agg 2-2, France win 5-4 on pens)Germany 3-3 Italy (agg 5-4)Portugal 5-2 Denmark (agg 5-3)Spain 3-3 Netherlands (agg 5-5, Spain win 5-4 on pens)It all means France, Germany, Portugal and Spain will compete in the Nations League semi-finals in June.But, first, let's talk you through a night which saw a Portuguese legend miss a penalty, a German ball boy become a hero and very nearly an Italian comeback to end all comebacks.Ronaldo's penalty woeThe mayhem started just five minutes into the action when Cristiano Ronaldo was dragged down in the box and Portugal were awarded a penalty.A chance for the 40-year-old to produce his famous \"siu\" celebration, just three days on from Denmark striker Rasmus Hojlund copying it after scoring the winner in the first leg?Errr, no.Celtic goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel was completely unfazed by Ronaldo's stuttering run-up, diving low to his left to keep his tame effort out.The 32nd penalty miss of a glittering career. He's scored a few too, mind you (172).Germany take control as Kimmich 'does a Trent'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Gianluigi Donnarumma cut a forlorn figure with his Italy side 3-0 down at half-timeIt took a while for the goals to start flowing but once Germany had finally broken the deadlock against Italy they completely cut loose.Already 2-1 up from the first leg, the Germans scored three times in 15 blistering first-half minutes to seemingly take the tie away from their opponents.The second goal was undoubtedly the highlight, with Joshua Kimmich taking a quick corner while goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma remonstrated with the referee, allowing Jamal Musiala to sweep into the empty net. It was very much shades of Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold crossing for Divock Origi to score against Barcelona in 2019.It also meant 15-year-old Noel Urbaniack became the focus of post-match attention, with interviews and a signed football from the Germans after his lightning quick ball delivery teed Kimmich up.\"We had brief eye contact,\" Urbaniack said. \"I saw he wanted the ball and I quickly threw it to him. It was my first time as a ball boy.\"Olise stunner gives France hopeFrance, beaten 2-0 in the first leg, had endured a frustrating opening 52 minutes against Croatia in Paris, carving out chance after chance but failing to reduce their deficit.Step forward Michael Olise.The former Crystal Palace attacker, now with Bayern Munich, whipped in a delightful 25-yard free-kick to give his side hope.The goal came moments after the Netherlands forward Memphis Depay had cancelled out Mikel Oyarzabal's opener for Spain to make it 1-1 on the night and 3-3 on aggregate.Elsewhere, Portugal had recovered from Ronaldo's penalty miss to go 1-0 up against Denmark and level the tie, while Italy had also pulled one back against Germany.The night was gathering momentum...Penalty - then no penalty - to ItalyImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Referee Szymon Marciniak overturned a penalty decision for Italy with around 15 minutes remainingItaly had looked well beaten in a first half Germany dominated, with Kimmich going as far as describing his team's display as \"very, very sexy to watch\".The visitors started the second half 3-0 down on the night and 5-1 on aggregate but were a side transformed in the second 45 minutes. Former Everton striker Moise Kean - barely involved in a first half where he had seven touches of the ball - scored twice and suddenly a miracle comeback was on.Italy thought they had the chance to level matters on the night and be one goal behind on aggregate when they were awarded a penalty with around 15 minutes to go.Giovanni Di Lorenzo appeared to be fouled, but, after a review by the video assistant referee, the decision was overturned. Italy would go on to get and score a penalty in stoppage time - but by then it was too little, too late.France fight back as Portugal and Netherlands also force extra timeInside a full and loud Stade de France, there was always the feeling that something special could develop on the pitch.Even as time ebbed away there was still a sense of belief in the ground, which erupted into shared joy when France - having knocked on the door for so long - found their equaliser with 10 minutes remaining.Ousmane Dembele, who has been in sensational form this season, was the one to get it, finishing first time from Olise's cutback.That took the game to extra time, while Portugal and the Netherlands also took their ties with Denmark and Spain respectively into an additional 30 minutes.Extra time is a non-event, right? WrongImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Teenager Lamine Yamal struck in extra time for SpainPortugal, who after 85 minutes were heading out before Francisco Trincao's goal levelled the tie, then scored twice in extra time to ensure penalties were not needed to settle matters.That was not the case for Spain and the Netherlands, however.Lamine Yamal put the European champions ahead in the 103rd minute with a brilliant finish - fast becoming a trademark for the 17-year-old - only for the Netherlands to respond just six minutes later through Xavi Simons.The Dutch had trailed on three separate occasions during the night and each time clawed their way back into the contest.There wasn't quite the same drama in Paris, where France continued to press but were unable to find a winner.That all meant one thing...Penalty chaos to complete dramatic nightImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mike Maignan was the hero in the penalty shootout for FranceSo penalties would be needed to determine the final two sides that would progress to the semi-finals.In Spain, Dutch forward Noa Lang and Yamal both missed in the shootout before Spanish keeper Unai Simon kept out Donyell Malen's effort to allow Pedri to clinch a last-four spot for the 2023 winners.The Netherlands don't seem to have much luck in penalty shootouts, as their manager Ronald Koeman even alluded to afterwards.\"I think that both teams should have gone through but that's impossible,\" he said. \"In part fortune decided that Spain won.\"In France, home goalkeeper Mike Maignan was the hero as he saved two spot kicks, although misses by Jules Kounde and Theo Hernandez had taken matters to sudden death. Dayot Upamecano sealed their progression after Maignan had kept out Josip Stanisic's effort.\"We were convinced we were going to do it, we needed a game like this to get our fans back with us,\" concluded Mbappe.So, yes, ultimately it was France, Germany, Portugal and Spain - the teams many perhaps expected - who went through, but the drama and excitement of how they did it was what made Sunday a special night in the Nations League.More on this story",
