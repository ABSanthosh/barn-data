  "text": "The Utah Jazz expect rookie Ace Bailey to report to the team facility on Saturday, June 28, according to a report by ESPN.The 6-foot-10 guard was a highly touted prospect in the 2025 NBA Draft and was eventually selected by Utah with No. 5 overall pick on June 25.His pre-draft process had raised eyebrows across the league when he did not meet with teams for individual workouts.Guard Walter Clayton Jr. (18th overall pick) and forward John Tonje (53rd overall pick) are also expected to be in Salt Lake City for the team’s introductory rookie press conference on Sunday, June 29, and at practice on Monday, June 30.All three players are expected to participate for the Jazz during NBA Summer League.Ace Bailey’s pre-draft processBailey was the only American player who hadn’t conducted a single visit prior to the draft to work out for an NBA team.He drew attention after canceling a visit with the Philadelphia 76ers, who held the third overall pick in the draft. Bailey had reportedly declined invitations for a visit from the Jazz and the Charlotte Hornets, who had the fourth overall pick.\"I'm glad it's over,\" Bailey said about his process at the draft. \"I'm ready to play some basketball now. It's just been a great journey. Me working hard, pushing myself physically and mentally, just getting prepared for the next level.\"Omar Cooper, Bailey's agent, had previously addressed the ongoing conversation about his client. “Every NBA team watched him work out in Chicago,” Cooper told ESPN. “He did 18 interviews. Everyone got his medical. They watched him run and jump. They got his measurements. They watched him shoot in drills.”Cooper cited similar situations from the 2021 draft, including Davion Mitchell and Evan Mobley, and the lack of conversation that was had during their respective processes.Biggest winners from the 2025 NBA draftFor The Win's Bryan Kalbrosky says that smart trades and bold picks helped the Suns, Grizzlies, and Hawks steal the spotlight on draft night.Ace Bailey’s college statsAce Bailey started all 30 games he played in his only season at Rutgers. The point guard averaged 17.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 1.3 assists in 33.3 minutes per game.He was named to the All-Big Ten third team and the Big Ten All-Freshman team. Facebook Twitter Email",
