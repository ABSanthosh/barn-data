Austin head coach Lisa Lage was pleased with the play of her team. “While we wanted to win both, it was a great experience to see what it takes to play two games back to back, like we will have to do in the section tournament,” Lage said. “Kate Klouse had a wonderful day at the plate. She didn’t strike out once, she walked once and put the ball in play every other time. Adi Cline had a great day, too.” Email newsletter signup The Packers are now 3-4 overall.
