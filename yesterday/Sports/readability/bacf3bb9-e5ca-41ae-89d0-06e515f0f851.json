  "text": "We now know the game times of four Ohio State football games this fall after an announcement on Thursday. We already knew the Michigan game was set for Noon ET as is tradition, but now, we can confirm the official times and networks of games against Texas, Grambling State, and Ohio University, all at home.We already knew the game against Michigan would be a high-stakes, high noon affair on Fox. But Much to the chagrin of OSU fans, the much-anticipated game against Texas on Saturday, Aug. 30, in the 'Shoe has been confirmed as a Noon ET tilt on Fox as well. This was after reports surfaced of FOX and OSU approaching the Longhorns to move it to a prime time matchup on Sunday night were dashed by those in Austin.The week after the game vs. Texas, on Saturday, Sept. 6, Ohio State will face Grambling State at 3:30 p.m. on the Big Ten Network. It's the first meeting between the two. Following that, still at home, the Buckeyes will indeed get to witness a home night game inside Ohio Stadium when the Ohio Bobcats come to town to play at 7:00 p.m. ET on Peacock.So, things with the Ohio State football 2025 schedule lineup like this, with other game times still to be announced.Saturday, Aug. 30 vs. Texas | Noon ET | FoxSaturday, Sept. 6 vs. Grambling State | 3:30 p.m. ET | Big Ten NetworkSaturday, Sept. 13 vs. Ohio | 7:00 p.m. ET | PeacockSaturday, Sept. 27 at Washington | TBDSaturday, Oct. 4 vs. Minnesota | TBDSaturday, Oct. 11 at Illinois | TBDSaturday, Oct. 18 at Wisconsin | TBDSaturday, Nov. 1 vs. Penn State | TBDSaturday, Nov. 8 at Purdue | TBDSaturday, Nov. 15 vs. UCLA | TBDSaturday, Nov. 22 vs. Rutgers | TBDSaturday, Nov. 29 at Michigan | Noon ET | FoxWe'll continue to bring you any schedule updates as they become available, but don't expect many of these to be set until sometime into the season.
