(1:20)ESPN News ServicesMay 25, 2025, 05:57 PM ETSTOCKHOLM -- Buffalo Sabres star forward Tage Thompson scored the winner 2:02 into overtime, and Team USA outlasted Switzerland 1-0 in the final of the ice hockey world championship at Avicii Arena on Sunday.It is the first on-ice trophy for USA Hockey in this tournament in 92 years, after the Americans brought it home back in 1933. And it was an emotional one. As Team USA posed for its championship photo at center ice, players held up a No. 13 jersey of Johnny Gaudreau, the former NHL and USA Hockey star forward who died tragically last August when he and his brother, Matthew, were hit by an allegedly drunken and enraged driver as they cycled at night in their home state of New Jersey, on the eve of their sister Katie's wedding.\"Johnny was f------ here, watching this one,\" Team USA's Ryan Warsofsky, coach of the San Jose Sharks, said to his team during his celebratory locker room speech that was posted on USA Hockey's social media platforms. \"He was up there watching this one.\"Thompson, who had 44 goals and 72 points with the Sabres this season, is hoping to polish off his resume for a spot on the U.S. roster for the 2026 Olympics, and he's off to a great start. A Team USA reserve for the 4 Nations Face-Off in February who did not suit up, Thompson made the most of his time playing with a host of young NHL forwards who either did not make, or have been eliminated from, the Stanley Cup playoffs.HISTORY MADE.

Team USA outshot Switzerland 40-25.Boston Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman capped off the shutout in the final, finishing with 25 saves a year after his NHL teammate, David Pastrnak led the Czech Republic to this same title.\"We did it, the wait is over,\" Swayman said in a post to USA Hockey fans on the organization's social media platforms. \"Thanks for sticking along with us. It's going to be a great summer.\"The Americans were also formally awarded the title in 1960 when they won the Olympic tournament and the worlds did not take place. But they hadn't won it on the ice in more than nine decades.The Swiss played without injured star center Nico Hischier, the captain of the New Jersey Devils. After the loss, Genoni was named the tournament's MVP.Earlier Sunday, Sweden defeated Denmark 6-2 in the bronze medal game. Calgary Flames center Mikael Backlund and Minnesota Wild forward Marcus Johansson scored two goals each for the hosts, marking the second-straight third-place finish for Sweden. The fourth-place result was the best-ever finish for Denmark.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
