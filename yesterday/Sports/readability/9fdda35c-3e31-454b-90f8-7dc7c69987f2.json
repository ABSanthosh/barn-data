Kingsbury was available to do interviews after the Commanders were eliminated Sunday but opted against doing any.Kingsbury was one of three coaches officially requested by the Saints who later withdrew from their interview process. Aaron Glenn, who played for the Saints in 2008 and coached there from 2016 to 2020, never made it to a second interview. Glenn interviewed virtually with the Saints but was hired by the New York Jets after interviewing with them in person.Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Joe Brady, whose team was eliminated in the AFC Championship Game on Sunday, opted to stay in Buffalo instead of pursuing a second interview in New Orleans. Brady was an assistant coach in New Orleans during the 2018-2019 seasons.The remaining Saints candidates are believed to be New York Giants offensive coordinator Mike Kafka, Miami Dolphins defensive coordinator Anthony Weaver and Philadelphia Eagles offensive coordinator Kellen Moore, who all did second, in-person interviews with the team. Former Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy is also a potential candidate but has not yet interviewed.Kingsbury, the Arizona Cardinals' head coach from 2019 to 2022, said in December that he'd like to be a head coach again \"at some point.\" Kingsbury is still being paid by Arizona after the team signed him to a five-year extension in 2022 but fired him less than a year later.Kingsbury made it clear to people that he has been happy with his situation in Washington because he could just focus on running the offense and not the other responsibilities that come with being a head coach. He has also enjoyed working with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, who is considered the favorite to earn Offensive Rookie of the Year honors, and told ESPN last month \"it would take a lot to leave this kid.\"\"I didn't get into this to be a head coach again,\" Kingsbury told ESPN last month. \"It's not about money. It never has been about money. So, that won't move me at all. It's just I want to do the best job we can here for those guys and then kind of go from there.\"The news that Kingsbury has decided to remain with the Commanders was first reported by Fox Sports.",
