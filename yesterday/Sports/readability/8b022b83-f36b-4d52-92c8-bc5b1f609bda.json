  "text": "Arsenal's first trophy hopes of the season were left in tatters by Newcastle - as fans were yet again left rueing their lack of a striker.The Gunners' 2-0 defeat at St James' Park meant a 4-0 aggregate loss in the Carabao Cup semi-final.Mikel Arteta's side are still in the Premier League title race, sitting six points behind Liverpool, and into the Champions League last 16.Fail to win either of those and the wait for a trophy since the 2020 FA Cup will go into a sixth season.\"You need to be on the day very efficent. That is what takes you close to winning trophies and today we weren't,\" said boss Mikel Arteta.\"Today is painful and tomorrow is a different day.\"Ex-Gunners centre-back Matt Upson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, said: \"For how good this team have been, for the squad that Mikel Arteta has built, they had had a lot of joy, but they haven't won anything.\"That is not enough for what the club expects.\"The striker issue...Arsenal are the second top scorers in the Premier League this season with 49 goals - but they need a striker, a talisman up front.Newcastle, who do have one in Alexander Isak, had 17 shots to Arsenal's 34 across the two legs - and won 4-0.Usually football managers pretend they are happy anyway after a transfer window where they fail to recruit but Arteta admitted he was \"disappointed\" that they \"haven't achieved it\".Aston Villa rejected an approach from Arsenal for England striker Ollie Watkins in the week before the transfer window closed.Rumours linking them to Isak, Wolves' Matheus Cunha, Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and even Brighton's Evan Ferguson went nowhere.That leaves them with Kai Havertz - who is more of an attacking midfielder - as their only real option at number nine.Havertz has done well with 15 goals in all competitions - but that is still not a lot to be the top scorer for a team fighting for multiple trophies.The German is joint 12th top scorer in the Premier League with nine, level with Liam Delap, whose Ipswich Town are in the relegation zone.Gabriel Jesus - the last striker (although he is also a wide player) they signed back in 2022 - is injured, as is star winger Bukayo Saka, who was their only 20-goal scorer last season.Arteta said in the build-up to Wednesday's game that Havertz might have to start every game for the rest of the season.His other options to play there, he said, are wingers Leandro Trossard, Raheem Sterling, Ethan Nwaneri and Gabriel Martinelli.Martinelli went off injured against Newcastle, Sterling has scored one goal for the club and Nwaneri is 17.Their last 20-goal-a-season striker was Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (29 goals in 2019-20). Since then Aubameyang, Alexandre Lacazette, Folarin Balogun and Eddie Nketiah are among the strikers to leave the club.Sweden's Isak, a reported target, showed them what they were missing on Wednesday.He ran the Gunners defence ragged, had a goal disallowed by the VAR for offside and hit the post leading to Jacob Murphy's opener. He had also scored in the first leg - one of his 19 goals this season.\"They have been more efficient than us in the boxes and that is the difference in the tie,\" said Arteta afterwards.Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville, speaking on Sky Sports, said: \"Isak on one side and Havertz on the other – just imagine what the sides would be if they swapped shirts.\"It has shone a massive spotlight on the toothlessness of Arsenal's front players compared to Newcastle's.\"Former England midfielder Jamie Redknapp added: \"Havertz does a good job up there but does he do a great job? No. \"I almost feel sorry for him because of the stick but Arsenal have had wonderful nines and the fans will know he isn't in the class of the players they have had.\"The defenders couldn't cope with Isak, it is like they have seen a ghost. That is what Arsenal don't have.\"While there may be grumbles about Havertz, the fact is he is their only player in double figures for goals in all competitions - and the only one who has a good amount of experience as a striker.\"They haven't got a lot of numbers,\" said former Newcastle goalkeeper Shay Given. \"For Arsenal to achieve anything they have to keep Havertz fit and wrap him up in cotton wool. That is a big ask.\"\"This Arsenal team need a trophy,\" said Neville. Arteta won the FA Cup just seven months after becoming Arsenal boss - beating Chelsea 2-1 on 1 August 2020 at Wembley.They have not won a trophy or reached a final since, losing three semi-finals - two in the EFL Cup and one in the Europa League.Despite that they have improved dramatically under the Spaniard.They have finished second in the Premier League in the past two seasons to Manchester City - and are currently second behind Liverpool.Arsenal had only finished second once between 2004-05 and 2022-23.The ex-Manchester City assistant boss led the Gunners back into the Champions League for the first time since 2016-17.Arteta has been backed in the transfer market - with the club having a net spend of about £500m since his arrival.Morale was high coming into this game after a 5-1 Premier League win over City to keep the pressure on Liverpool. Will this affect things?\"Arsenal are out of the FA Cup and out of the League Cup, they can focus now on chasing down Liverpool, who are still in everything, and the Champions League,\" said ex-Newcastle winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"They will not be happy with their performance over the two legs, particularly tonight. However it could help them chase down Liverpool.\"Murphy, Bedford: I can't see Arsenal winning anything this season. When the chips are down and they need a big performance, this frail mentality shows itself again. Comfortable for Newcastle.Danny, Salford: You do worry about Arsenal's erratic mentality sometimes. On the edge. Angry. All too often, fragile. Unable to build on their perceived momentum. Arteta has a big job on his hands.Charles: Just as you start believing in Arsenal after their fantastic result against City they let you down again. Is there something in the water in North London?Nicholas, Belfast: It's time for us Arsenal fans to admit Arteta does not have the mentality to take us across the winning line.Nick: So it took Arteta 3 days to go from beating Man City 5-1 to 'not having the mentality to take us over the line'. Fans are ridiculous sometimes.",
