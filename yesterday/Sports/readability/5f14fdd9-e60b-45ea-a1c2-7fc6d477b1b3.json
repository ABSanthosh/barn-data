(0:35)Mark SchlabachJun 15, 2025, 08:30 PM ETCloseSenior college football writer Author of seven books on college football Graduate of the University of GeorgiaOAKMONT, Pa. -- J.J. Spaun survived a terrible start and challenging elements to pull away from the pack and capture his first major championship with a two-stroke victory in the 125th U.S. Open at Oakmont Country Club on Sunday.After birdieing the 17th hole to go ahead by one stroke, Spaun made a 64½-foot birdie putt on the 18th to secure his unlikely victory and defeat Scotland's Robert MacIntyre by two.After Spaun's long putt fell in the cup, he dropped his putter, raised his arms, and gave the crowd a fist pump. He hugged caddie Mark Carens and later embraced his wife, Melody, and two young daughters.Spaun was the only golfer to finish under par at 1-under 279. He posted an even-par 70 on Sunday and went 3 under on the back nine. Spaun will collect $4.3 million for the biggest payday of his career.MacIntyre, who was attempting to become the first left-handed golfer to win the U.S. Open, finished 1-over 281.Norway's Viktor Hovland finished third at 2-over 282.Spaun grabbed the outright lead at even par by reaching the green with a 309-yard drive on the short par-4 17th hole. His eagle try from 18 feet slid past the hole, but he made a 3½-foot birdie putt for a one-stroke lead.On the 18th hole, Spaun drove his tee shot down the right side of the fairway. As he prepared to hit his second shot, rain started to fall on the soaked course. Spaun hit his approach to 64½ feet, setting up the dramatic finish.Spaun started the day one stroke behind 54-hole leader Sam Burns, but trailed by as many as four after carding bogeys on five of his first six holes.Spaun, 34, is the first U.S. Open winner to start his final round with three consecutive holes over par, according to Elias Sports Bureau.It was the biggest moment of Spaun's career. The Los Angeles native's only prior PGA Tour victory came in the 2022 Valero Texas Open. Ranked 25th in the Official World Golf Ranking, Spaun has played some of the best golf of his career this year.It was a wild finish to a final round at Oakmont Country Club that included a 96-minute weather delay and steady rain that made one of the most demanding golf courses in the world even more difficult.Six golfers had at least a share of the lead in the final round, and at one point, five were tied for first.MacIntyre had a chance to reach even par but left a 33-foot birdie try on No. 18 a couple of feet short and settled for a 2-under 68 in the final round.",
