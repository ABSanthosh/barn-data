  "text": "Penny Hardaway, sitting in front of a roomful of Memphis Tigers fans at Brookhaven Pub \u0026 Grill on July 8, was explaining the challenges of putting together a strong non-conference schedule.“It’s tough, because we want to play some other teams, it just won’t match the schedule,” he said.That’s when one supporter from the standing-room only crowd piped up.“UT!” he said, referencing the University of Tennessee.Hardaway didn’t miss a beat.“Exactly,” he quipped. “That would be another good one, to get the UT rivalry going again.”Penny Hardaway talking scheduling, when someone in the crowd mentions Tennessee: “That would be another good one, to get the UT rivalry going again.” pic.twitter.com/MmxbfqY8zh— Jason Munz (@munzly) July 8, 2025A hearty round of applause followed. Hardaway put together the nation’s fourth-most difficult non-conference schedule in 2024-25, and the upcoming season’s slate is shaping up to be another gauntlet. It includes home games against Baylor, Vanderbilt, UNLV and San Francisco, as well as road dates with Louisville, Mississippi State and Ole Miss. The Tigers will also face Purdue at the Baha Mar Hoops Championship in the Bahamas, along with either Texas Tech or Wake Forest.The last time the Tigers and Vols met was 2019, when Memphis won in Knoxville. During a fan event in the Bluff City in April, Tennessee coach Rick Barnes reiterated he has no plans to agree to any games against the Tigers in the near future.“We haven’t talked about that in a couple years. It’s nowhere being talked about now,” he said. “With the changes, new teams coming into our league (the SEC) — we just came out of playing historically the hardest, best conference ever. So everything we do will be based on where we feel our league is and what we need to do.”Later, Hardaway said most teams Memphis approaches about scheduling home-and-home series are open to it.I can actually say, for the majority of teams – like Baylor and Louisville – there are teams that want to play,” he said. “They see us as a team that they need to play early to challenge their team. So, that’s a huge compliment. But then there’s also people that are just not going to do it. They feel like maybe they’re bigger than us and they don’t have to have that game.”Is Penny Hardaway's Memphis basketball roster set?The question for Hardaway was whether his 2025-26 roster was completely set.“The roster is done, at this point,” he told reporters after the school’s third “Tigers on Tour” fan event.The follow-up question was a bit more specific and elicited a different response.“We’ve got to get big,” he said. “So, we’re still looking for someone else as well.”Memphis has signed 13 players to this point, leaving the eighth-year coach with two open scholarships for the upcoming season. Only two Tigers – Aaron Bradshaw and Simon Majok – are taller than 6-8. Majok, a native of South Sudan who has spent the past three years playing professionally in Serbia, signed with Memphis on June 30. Majok has not yet reported to campus, and Hardaway does not have an expected arrival date.But he is confident Majok, a 7-footer, can help the Tigers.“We have to figure his game out,” said Hardaway. “We only saw a little film, but once he gets into practice or gets into the gym and we work him out, we’ll see where he’s needed.”Reach sports writer Jason Munz at jason.munz@commercialappeal.com, and follow him @munzly on X.
