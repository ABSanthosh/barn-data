(0:39)ESPN News ServicesMar 27, 2025, 05:16 PM ETTORONTO -- Baltimore Orioles outfielder Tyler O'Neill hit a three-run home run off the Toronto Blue Jays' Jose Berrios in the third inning of Thursday's game, extending his major league record by homering for a sixth straight Opening Day.Playing a season-opening game in his home country of Canada for the first time, O'Neill connected on a two-out, 2-1 sinker, driving in Colton Cowser and Adley Rutschman and putting Baltimore up 4-0.\"When he hit it, I think everyone was just going crazy because that's just such an amazing feat,\" Rutschman said. \"It was just so cool to see.\"O'Neill went 3 for 3 with two walks and scored three runs in the 12-2 victory. He said it was meaningful to have a strong performance with several of his family in the crowd.\"Very special,\" O'Neill said. \"I've had a great day so far. Playing in Toronto is always special for me.\"The Orioles hit a franchise record six Opening Day home runs in the rout.O'Neill's Opening Day home run streak began with the St. Louis Cardinals in 2020 and continued for four seasons, matching a mark held by Todd Hundley (1994 to 1997), Gary Carter (1977 to 1980) and Yogi Berra (1955 to 1958).O'Neill took sole possession of the mark when he connected in his lone Opening Day with the Boston Red Sox in 2024.Baltimore manager Brandon Hyde called O'Neill's streak \"mind-boggling,\" adding that he has quickly learned to appreciate everything his new outfielder brings to the clubhouse.\"Awesome personality,\" Hyde said of O'Neill. \"I love how hard-nosed he is. He's a team guy.\"O'Neill arrived at the stadium carrying two boxes of donuts from the Canadian chain Tim Hortons to share with his Baltimore teammates. He did the same thing on a visit to Toronto with the Red Sox last season.Hyde said he would have no problem with O'Neill repeating the donut delivery Friday.\"Whatever works,\" Hyde said. \"Wear the same clothes. Whatever he did today, do it tomorrow.\"The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
