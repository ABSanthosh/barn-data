Last event: 2-4 UFC main cards, 2025: 21-20-1 Molly McCann vs. Alexia Thainara UFC London preview The good news for McCann (14-7 MMA, 7-6 UFC) is she has post-fight bonuses in her past four wins. Rougher is that she’s dropped three of her past four. … Thainara (11-1 MMA, 0-0 UFC), from Brazil, stepped in for Istela Nunes on just 10 days’ notice. She’s won nine straight, including on DWCS this past September. Molly McCann vs. Alexia Thainara UFC London expert pick, prediction Filling out the main card in London is an impromptu strawweight scrap between Molly McCann and Alexia Thainara. Stepping in on just over a week’s notice to replace Istela Nunes is Thainara, who is fresh off of a successful showing on the last season of Dana White’s Contender Series. Despite only giving Thainara a C+ on the night, I was admittedly a bit more impressed with her improvements after going back to watch her tape. That always helps provide further context. Not only is Thainara showing to steadily shore up her raw sensibilities, but the Brazilian jiu-jitsu brown belt has also shown some solid offensive grappling skills that could provide some problems for McCann. McCann will be the more polished striker and big edge in experience, but Thainara, to her credit, does regularly train with the UFC’s Amanda Ribas, so I can understand why “Burguesinha” is bustling with confidence. This should be a principal pick for McCann given the short-notice intangibles and rawness of Thainara, but I suspect that the Brazilian’s athleticism, attitude and ability to punch the body will serve her well in this spot. The pick is Thainara by submission in Round 2. Molly McCann vs. Alexia Thainara UFC London odds The oddsmakers and the public are favoring the Brazilian fighter, listing Thainara (-196) and McCann (+158) via FanDuel. Molly McCann vs. Alexia Thainara UFC London start time, how to watch McCann and Thainara are expected to walk to the cage at approximately 5:15 p.m. ET. The fight will stream on ESPN+.
