Luis Matos scored the tying run and as Victor Robles bobbled the ball slightly, Tyler Fitzgerald — who had walked and stole second — ran through third baseman Matt Williams' stop sign and slid to slap a hand across the plate.Julio Rodríguez homered in the first inning off Justin Verlander, who retired just seven batters in his home debut after the 42-year-old signed a $15 million, one-year contract in January to pitch a 20th major league season.Seattle went ahead 8-6 in the sixth when Fitzgerald misplayed Cal Raleigh’s grounder to second Matt Chapman omered in the bottom half to get the Giants within 8-7 after his RBI single in the first delighted the sellout crowd of 40,865.Patrick Bailey's groundout in the sixth tied it at 8.
