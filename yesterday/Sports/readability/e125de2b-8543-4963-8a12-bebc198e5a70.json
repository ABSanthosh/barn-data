  "text": "LAS VEGAS — The opening weekend of the 2025 Las Vegas Summer League was packed with energy, rising stars and key rookie debuts. Here are the early takeaways from Vegas that set the tone for the week ahead.Cooper Flagg flashes star powerCooper Flagg's Summer League debut offered a compelling glimpse into his all-around game and sky-high potential. Dallas quickly shut him down, but in two appearances the No. 1 pick showed his versatility, operating as the primary option for the Mavericks. Whether playmaking or scoring, his performances were anchored by elite defense and athleticism.AdvertisementIn Game 1, the Mavericks challenged Flagg to run the offense. He impressed as a point-forward, recording 10 points, 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals and a block. There was potential for more, and despite facing pressure from 94 feet and half-court traps, Flagg remained composed. The shot wasn't falling (he shot 5-of-21 from the field), but his feel for the game, vision and defensive instincts stood out.All of the \"Flagg is overrated\" haters were silenced in Game 2. It was a scoring showcase, with Flagg pouring in 31 points (10-of-21 shooting), hitting 3s and relentlessly attacking the rim. Twenty of his 31 points came from the paint or charity stripe, a stark difference from Game 1. The Mavericks couldn't buy a bucket, so seeing Flagg adjust from the primary creator to a three-level scorer was exciting.With two versatile outings, Flagg proved he's more than hype — he's an NBA-ready player with a two-way game built for the modern league.AdvertisementLeBron James quietly makes his presence feltAnd then there was the rare appearance from LeBron James, who turned heads simply by being courtside in Las Vegas.Unlike previous years when he's been absent, LeBron's presence this summer was notable — but so was his silence.When approached about his contract situation, LeBron declined to comment.\"I ain't got nothing to talk about,\" James told ESPN's Dave McMenamin.With James exercising his player option for this season and his long-term plans still up in the air, his silence only deepened speculation about whether he'll continue in L.A. or explore other opportunities in the twilight of his career. Adding to the intrigue, his agent, Rich Paul, revealed four teams have already contacted the Lakers about James' availability, further igniting chatter about what could be a blockbuster move in the making. Does he stay? Does he go? Expect the speculation to carry well into next season.AdvertisementNotable rookie absencesAce Bailey (hip) and VJ Edgecombe (thumb), two of the top five picks in the 2025 NBA Draft, have yet to participate in the Las Vegas Summer League. It's a shame because both players turned heads at the Salt Lake City Summer League, leaving fans disappointed they didn't have a chance to see them in action during the opening weekend.The unexpected hype: Yang HansenHansen, the first Chinese player to be drafted in the first round in nearly 20 years, was the surprise pick of the 2025 draft class. He's now become one of the biggest draws of Summer League. The young big man passes the eye test, with Hansen's IQ, vision and passing drawing comparisons to Nikola Jokić.The hype train is building and his on-court performance in Vegas set the tone of what could be a promising rookie campaign.AdvertisementRising sophomoresMemphis Grizzlies F Jaylen Wells: The Desmond Bane trade left a gulf of an opportunity for Wells heading into his second season. He leveled up in Vegas, averaging nearly 20 points with 4 rebounds, 4 assists and 1.5 steals per game.Minnesota Timberwolves F Terrence Shannon: He officially graduated from Summer League, posting 22 points with 6 boards and 6 dimes in his two games at Thomas \u0026 Mack. He was in the Wolves' rotation during their run to the Western Conference finals, so seeing him play well in Vegas is not surprising.Cleveland Cavaliers G Jaylon Tyson: In three games, Tyson steadily produced, averaging 19.7 points, 6 rebounds and 6.7 assists.Other notable standouts: Houston's Reed Sheppard, Utah's Kyle Filipowski, Phoenix's Oso Ighodaro and Ryan Dunn, and Detroit's Ron Holland and Daniss Jenkins.It's also worth noting Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra called out Miami center Kel'el Ware for needing to improve his professionalism, consistency and approach.Record breakersTwo major records marked the 2025 Las Vegas Summer League. Washington Wizards F/C Alex Sarr set a single-game record with eight blocks. And shoutout to Minnesota Timberwolves rookie C Joan Beringer for tying the previous Summer League record with 7 blocks on Thursday.AdvertisementMeanwhile, the Chicago Bulls committed a record 34 turnovers in a loss to the Toronto Raptors. It's a reminder that Summer League basketball, while great, can be ugly at times.",
