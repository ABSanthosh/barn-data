The procedure limited him to only nine starts combined over the first two seasons of his Texas tenure.Texas Rangers starting pitcher Jacob deGrom (48)Tim Heitman-Imagn ImagesIn 2025, deGrom has returned to his peak form and was selected to his fifth All-Star Game last week.On Friday, deGrom decided to pass on being the Rangers’ lone representative, relieving manager Bruce Bochy, who said per Jeff Wilson, “He’s been carrying a pretty heavy workload coming off the surgery. We want to monitor his workload this year. So, yeah, there’s a big relief for us.”Through 18 starts, deGrom has a 2.29 ERA with 105 strikeouts across 106.1 innings.He carried a no-hitter into the eighth inning of the Rangers’ 7–0 win against the Baltimore Orioles a few weeks ago, signaling he is still at his best despite entering the latter stages of his career.",
