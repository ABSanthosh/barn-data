(Photo by Steven King/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)First impressions are important in so many aspects of our lives. But in sports, the introductory press conference is vital for a new coach.Win the press conference and a coach will likely earn some benefit of the doubt. A bad opening presser could form an impression that sticks throughout a coach's tenure. Sure, wins and losses mean ultimately far more. But that first impression goes a long way.New Jacksonville Jaguars coach Liam Coen provided a reminder of that with the awkward moment he created during his introduction on Monday. Coen attempted to do the \"DUUUVAL!\" chant popular among Jaguars fans to represent Jacksonville's home county, and it immediately became infamous.To be fair to Coen, trying to simulate a chant that's yelled in a stadium, at a quieter tone amid the closed setting of a press conference, wasn't setting him up for success. Yet he also could have just gone all-in with the chant. Would it have looked silly? Almost certainly. But it wouldn't have felt as awkward and probably wouldn't continue being mocked days later.Coen's cringy moment now joins a list of coaching press conferences that will likely be remembered for the wrong reasons. (Of course, no one will care if he's the man who turns the Jaguars' fortunes around.) Years later, these are still frequently referenced among sports fans and media. This is not an all-encompassing list, but rather 10 of the most memorable over the years.Adam Gase: New York Jets, 2019Adam Gase probably established the gold (or rust) standard for infamous coaching press conferences with his odd affectations while being introduced as the Jets head coach in 2019. As the presser began, Gase's eyes frequently opened wide and darted back and forth, making him look extremely uncomfortable and as if he wasn't quite in control of his movements.Perhaps Gase was reminding himself to take in all of his surroundings, recognizing that this was a special moment for him, perhaps the pinnacle of his career. Maybe he was trying really hard not to blink.Regardless of the reason, Gase's behavior boded poorly for a tenure during which he compiled a 9-23 record, and is still being pilloried six years later.Dan Campbell: Detroit Lions, 2021Few knew what to think of Dan Campbell when he was introduced as Lions head coach. He had a 12-game stint as interim coach with the Miami Dolphins and had never been a coordinator, usually the stepping stone to a head coaching job.But to Campbell's credit, he didn't spout the usual platitudes about what kind of team he would build and how it would play.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna kick you in the teeth, and when you punch us back, we‚Äôre going to smile at you. And when you knock us down, we‚Äôre gonna get up. And on the way up, we‚Äôre going to bite a kneecap off.‚ÄùNew @Lions HC Dan Campbell had quite the introductory press conference üò≥ pic.twitter.com/cWJTSFtJAQ‚Äî SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) January 21, 2021\"We‚Äôre gonna kick you in the teeth, and when you punch us back, we‚Äôre going to smile at you,\" Campbell said. \"And when you knock us down, we‚Äôre gonna get up. And on the way up, we‚Äôre going to bite a kneecap off.\"This wasn't a wrestling promo, nor a warning that the Lions would soon become a team of violent animals. He was talking about a mindset, one reflected in Detroit's turnaround from 3-13-1 to 15-2 during his four seasons thus far.Herm Edwards: New York Jets, 2002Some coaches made headlines long after they were introduced. One of the most memorable was Herm Edwards, who made a remark during his second season as Jets coach that has stayed with him more than 20 years later.After a 2-5 start, Edwards was asked if he thought the team felt like the season was over, leading to a legendary rant.\"This is what the greatest thing about sports is,\" he said in disbelief. \"You play to win the game! Hello?! You play to win the game! You don‚Äôt play to just play it... And I don‚Äôt care if you don‚Äôt have any wins, you go play to win! When you start telling me that it doesn‚Äôt matter, then retire.\"Mike Gundy: Oklahoma State, 2007Mike Gundy lashed out at a reporter who wrote a story about quarterback Bobby Reid losing the Cowboys' starting job and was seen being fed by his mother before a team flight. The coach was incensed that a 21-year-old was being criticized.‚ÄúThat article had to have been written by a person that doesn't have a child. And has never had a child that's had their heart broken and come home upset,‚Äù Gundy said.\"Come after me! I'm a man! I'm 40!\" he continued. \"I'm not‚Äî I'm not a kid. Write something about me, or our coaches. Don't write about a kid that does everything right that's heart's broken.\"John Beilein: Cleveland Cavaliers, 2020John Beilein shocked the basketball world when he left Michigan for the Cavaliers in May 2019. He soon showed that his coaching style was better suited for college athletes than professional players. But he also demonstrated a lack of judgment when reportedly telling his team during a film session that they were no longer playing \"like a bunch of thugs.\"Beilein met with reporters to say that he intended to say \"slugs,\" which didn't reflect how hard they were playing. However, few seemed to accept that explanation and the Cavaliers' performance did not improve. Beilein resigned as coach after just 54 games.Jim Mora: Indianapolis Colts, 2001Unlike most coaches whose outbursts are intended to defend their team or their job, Jim Mora questioned the Colts' chances of making the playoffs following a 40-21 loss to the San Francisco 49ers, in which Peyton Manning threw four interceptions. Don't blame the defense for that loss, said the coach.A local TV reporter then mentioned that the Colts, at 4-6, would have to win their remaining six games of the season to make the playoffs. That led to a succinct tirade that continues to be quoted and referenced more than 20 years later.\"Playoffs? What are you talking about? Playoffs? Are you kidding me?\" Mora asked. \"Playoffs? I just hope we can win a game.\"The Colts went 2-4 in those six games and did not make the playoffs at 6-10 overall. Mora was fired after the season.Dennis Green: Arizona Cardinals, 2006Much like Mora five years earlier, Dennis Green was upset over his team letting its opponent off the hook with poor play. After a Monday night matchup in which the Cardinals blew a 20-0 lead and eventually lost 24-23, Green blew up when asked how they could lose despite intercepting Rex Grossman four times.‚ÄúThe Bears were what we thought they were,\" Green said. \"What we thought they were. We played them in preseason... The Bears are who we thought they were. That‚Äôs why we took the damn field.\"If you want to crown them, then crown their a**,‚Äù he continued. \"But they are who we thought they were. And we let them off the hook.\"The diatribe was especially surprising from the normally mild-mannered Green. But perhaps he knew what was coming. The Cardinals went 4-6 in their final 10 games, finishing 5-11, and Green was fired after the season.Hal McRae: Kansas City Royals, 1993It wasn't the end, but it was probably the beginning of the end for Hal McRae as Royals manager. Following a 5-3 loss to the Detroit Tigers that dropped Kansas City to 7-12, McRae had a meltdown while meeting with reporters in his office.What set him off was a question about a pinch-hitting decision that he didn't make.\"No, no,\" McRae said. \"Don‚Äôt ask me all these stupid-a** f***ing questions. No... I‚Äôm tired of all these stupid-a** questions every f****** night.\"McRae then stood up and began throwing objects ‚Äî a drink, a rotary phone and an object believed to be an ashtray ‚Äî from his desk, continuing to rant at reporters and his players.Brian Kelly: LSU, 2021College football coaches have to demonstrate that they understand traditions and the communities they're joining. That's likely why Brian Kelly affected a Southern accent upon introducing himself to fans upon becoming the head coach at LSU.Kelly, a Massachusetts native, had a curious twang to his voice at a basketball game after being hired. The way Kelly said \"family\" particularly raised eyebrows.Kelly later admitted while joining the ESPN telecast of the Tigers' Texas Bowl matchup that he faked his accent.\"If he says you got to dance, why wouldn‚Äôt you dance?\" Kelly said. \"Whether it was dancing or I couldn‚Äôt get my accent down, the word ‚Äòfamily' ‚Äî listen, I‚Äôm from Boston, we don‚Äôt have strong accents.‚ÄùTommy Lasorda: Los Angeles Dodgers, 1978Cubs manager Lee Elia wins the award for most NSFW tirade by a major league manager to reporters. However, a close second is probably Tommy Lasorda's postgame rant in 1978 . The gathered media likely would have been relieved to deal with something cringy by comparison.The Dodgers lost to the Chicago Cubs, 10-7, squandering a 7-5 lead due in part to Dave Kingman hitting three home runs. Asked for his opinion of Kingman's performance, Lasorda then erupted with a torrent of profanity.\"What's my opinion of Kingman's performance? What the f*** do you think my opinion is of it?\" Lasorda began. \"I think it was [expletive]. Put that in. I don't f***ing care.\"What's my opinion of his performance? [Expletive]. He beat us with three f***ing home runs,\" he continued. \"What the f*** do you mean, 'What is my opinion of his performance?' How can you ask me a question like that?\"That wasn't the end of it, either.On the bright side, the Dodgers finished 95-67 that season, but went on to lose the World Series to the New York Yankees in six games. Lasorda's rant in May might be remembered more than his team's record.The NSFW category: Lee Elia, Chicago Cubs, 1983Elia's rant could arguably be considered the best of all time. It came after the Cubs blew a 3-1 lead late against the Dodgers, and Cubs fans were heckling players after the game. The late Chicago radio reporter Les Grobstein captured the expletive-laden audio, where Elia lost it at the fans.Listen at your own risk here.",
