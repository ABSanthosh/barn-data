  "text": "Getty ImagesSir Chris Hoy performed the baton ceremony before the men's cycling sprint finals at this year's Paris OlympicsSix-time Olympic cycling champion Sir Chris Hoy has announced that his cancer is terminal.In an interview with the Sunday Times, he says doctors have told him he has between two and four years to live.The 48-year-old Scot revealed earlier this year that he had been diagnosed with cancer.Hoy told the newspaper he has known for a year that his cancer is terminal.Hoy won six Olympic golds between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian behind Sir Jason Kenny's tally of seven.He retired from cycling in 2013 and in recent years has been a regular pundit and commentator as part of BBC Sport's cycling coverage.He had not previously disclosed the type of cancer.But he told the Sunday Times that he had been diagnosed with primary cancer in his prostate, which had spread to his bones - meaning it was stage four.Tumours were discovered to his shoulder, pelvis, hip, spine and rib.Sir Chris told the newspaper: \"As unnatural as it feels, this is nature.\"You know, we were all born and we all die, and this is just part of the process.\"You remind yourself, aren't I lucky that there is medicine I can take that will fend this off for as long as possible.\"",
