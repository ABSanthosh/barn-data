  "text": "Jimmy Butler trade rumors are flying around at warp speed around NBA social media. That's fun. However, meaningful action towards a Butler trade is not moving fast. At all. Let's break down where things stand with Butler.Miami is being patient. Both because that's their nature as a franchise and because they can be in this situation if they don't like the offers coming in — and so far, they do not.Miami and team president Pat Riley suspended Jimmy Butler seven games after Butler obviously tried to quiet quit on the team a week ago, then told the media, \"I want to see me getting my joy back playing basketball. Wherever that may be.\" Butler then said it's not going to be in Miami. He and his agent demanded a trade from Miami. Riley had seen the disruptive \"trade me\" Butler in Minnesota and made the pre-emptive strike.Through his actions and statements, he has shown he no longer wants to be part of this team. Jimmy Butler and his representative have indicated that they wish to be traded, therefore, we will listen to offers.— Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) January 4, 2025The NBA players' union has said it will appeal this suspension and likely will get Butler back some (if not all) of the $2.35 million he would lose during the suspension. However, the appeal process is slow and will not get Butler back on the team anytime soon.That suspension does not mean the Heat are rushing things. At all. Here is what Sam Amick of The Athletic said of the Heat after spending time around the club recently.The Heat are not about to be hurried or bullied into a bad deal. Even with the Heat’s desire to make a playoff push (they’re 19-17 and in sixth place in the East), Miami has all sorts of incentives to take its time — even if that means embracing all of the uncomfortableness that would come with a Butler return.Miami is listening to trade offers but the ones they are getting — because Butler is age 35 with a lengthy injury history, and because teams know he can be a free agent next summer ($52.4 million player option) and walk if he wants — are lowball. Miami is not going to take those deals. If that means Butler is back with the team on Jan. 17 after his suspension ends, so be it.Multiple reports have noted that Butler wants to go to Phoenix, and the feeling is mutual. However, that's an almost impossible trade to construct (keep reading below).What do Heat want in Butler trade?This is not a fire sale. Miami has two primary goals for any trade: acquiring win-now players who can help them this season and next (not just picks and young players) and taking back as little long-term money as possible. If Miami makes a deal, it wants the flexibility to rebuild around Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro without being anchored down by another long-term big contract.The challenge is Butler is making $48.8 million this season with a player option for $52.4 million next season — and the 35-year-old wants an extension (he could have that tacked on at the end of this contract taking him to age 38, or he could opt out of next season's contract and sign for two years, $112.6 million, taking him to his age 37 season).To trade for Butler means either teams have to send another expensive player back to Miami, or a team will have to trade four or five players to make it work. The reality is that if a trade happens, it likely ends up a three- or four-team trade. Which are incredibly challenging to put together (both financially and in making everybody happy). There's a reason some league sources have said Butler will be on the Heat roster until this summer, when a trade can be put together either around the NBA draft or in July.Top Butler destinationsThis is pretty much a one-team list.Phoenix SunsIn the past week, it's become clear that despite early reports that Butler was willing to go \"anywhere but Miami,\" he really wants to go to Phoenix. That hasn't exactly been a secret, but Jake Fischer at The Stein Line put it in stark terms.Every high-ranking team official contacted by The Stein Line for this story shared their belief that the Suns are the destination Butler desires on the other side of his standoff with the Heat. You hear the same sentiment even from executives with teams that have been mentioned as potential Butler suitors.There are good basketball reasons for Butler to want to go to the Suns — who doesn't want to play with Kevin Durant and Devin Booker; plus the Suns lack a certain level of toughness, this is not a team with a lot of dog in it, and Butler would bring that — but mostly it's because owner Mat Ishbia has suggested he would give Butler the kind of extension he seeks (two years, north of $100 million).The problem continues to be actually constructing a Butler to the Suns trade.The only way to make it work is for Phoenix to send out Bradley Beal, but there are a couple of massive problems with that. First, Beal has a no-trade clause and can veto any trade proposal he doesn't like. In what was not coincidental timing, Phoenix coach Mike Budenholzer told Beal he was being moved out of the starting lineup to the bench. While there are legitimate basketball reasons to make that move (rookie Ryan Dunn provides more athleticism and defense) it is seen around the league as a way to make Beal unhappy enough to waive his no-trade clause so he could be sent somewhere he might not otherwise approve. Beal said he hasn't been approached about any of this, \"If so, I need to be addressed because I hold the cards. So, until I'm addressed and somebody says something differently, then I'll be a Sun.\"The second and bigger challenge in a Butler-to-Phoenix trade is the Miami Heat want no part of Beal. Miami wants players who can help them win now and not to take on long-term money, Beal just got benched in favor of a rookie and is owed more than $100 million over the coming two seasons. There is no version of this trade where Beal is in Miami, the Heat will be patient and wait for a deal they like..Phoenix is scouring the league to find a three- or four-team trade where Beal goes to a third team. It's a nice idea, except that, much like the Heat, there are not other teams out there eager to take on Beal. The few that would consider it want a lot of sweeteners — first-round picks the Suns don't have to trade — thrown in. Those teams will also want Beal to drop his no-trade clause permanently as part of this, and he will be understandably reluctant to do so.That is why there are many skeptics in league circles. Sources who spoke to NBC Sports said Butler probably will remain with the Heat past the trade deadline and into the summer, when Miami can find a trade that works.Golden State Warriors not interestedIt makes sense on a surface level: The Golden State Warriors are looking for a star, a shot-creating, two-way player they can put next to Stephen Curry. Butler is available. Yet according to a report at The Athletic, the Warriors are not in the Jimmy Butler mix for three reasons: Butler's age, his injury history, and price tag (the Warriors would have to send out either Draymond Green or Andrew Wiggins, plus Jonathan Kuminga and at least two more players, then have to pay Butler next summer with a massive new contract).What the Warriors are thinking echoes what a lot of teams are thinking.Grizzlies, Bucks out of runningIn the wake of Butler and his agent making a trade demand to the Heat, ESPN reported Butler wanted to play \"anywhere but Miami.\" He just wanted out. Except \"anywhere\" does not apparently include Memphis or Milwaukee. Butler's people have told the Memphis Grizzlies he does not want to be traded there, reports Chris Haynes. Multiple other reports say the Bucks are on that same list. Because Butler can opt out after this season and be a free agent, he has leverage on where he gets traded. That doesn't mean he can easily force his way to Phoenix.What happened between Jimmy Butler and Pat Riley?This entire saga is all about the money. Don't pretend it's about anything else.Things fell apart between Butler and the Heat when Butler wanted to discuss a contract extension after last season, ideally with him opting out of his $52.4 million for next season to get two years, $112.6 million. Pat Riley emphatically shot that down when talking after last season.\"That's a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who's going to be there and available every single night. That's the truth,\" Riley said. Butler played 60 games last season and was out for the team's playoff series against the Celtics.Butler told the Washington Post this week he still believes he's in his prime.It's that simple: Butler wants to be paid, but the Heat don't want to do it, so Butler wants a trade to a place he thinks he will get paid.How old is Jimmy Butler?He is 35 years old and will turn 36 before training camp opens next season. This is his 14th season in the league.",
