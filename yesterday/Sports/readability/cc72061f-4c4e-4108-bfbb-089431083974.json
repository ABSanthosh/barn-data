  "text": "The Los Angeles Clippers are making moves ahead of Thursday's NBA trade deadline, sending P.J. Tucker and Mo Bamba to the Utah Jazz in exchange for Drew Eubanks and Patty Mills, per ESPN. Utah also reportedly receives a future second-round pick and cash in the trade.Bamba, 26, and Eubanks, 28, are a more direct part of the trade: The two centers have put up similar numbers for their respective teams this season. Bamba signed a one-year deal with the Clippers this offseason, while Eubanks signed a two-year contract in August that Los Angeles will pick up.The other two players in the trade are veterans. Tucker, 39, signed a three-year deal with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2022, which the Clippers took on when the veteran forward was sent to Los Angeles in 2023 as part of the James Harden trade.Mills, meanwhile, will be joining his fourth team in the past year. Mills was waived by the Atlanta Hawks last February, and signed with the Miami Heat in March; the 36-year-old guard then signed with the Jazz in September.Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, the trade puts the Clippers $4 million below the luxury tax, opening the team up for more flexibility ahead of the trade deadline. Tucker, Bamba and Mills are all on contracts that expire at the end of the season, while Eubanks will have one more year remaining on his deal.",
