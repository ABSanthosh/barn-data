  "text": "Semi-automated offside technology will be used in English domestic football for the first time during the fifth round of the FA Cup.On Thursday the Football Association (FA) announced, external that the technology will be used in the seven games taking place at Premier League stadiums.The FA added that \"following successful live operation in the Emirates FA Cup, the Premier League will look to implement the system later this season\".The system aims to remove some elements of human subjectivity by replacing decisions made by officials with automated ones taken by technology.As things stand, when a player scores after a borderline offside situation, officials in the video assistant referee (VAR) room must decide on three key things - when the ball was kicked, where and at what angle the defender's body was when the ball was kicked, and where and what angle the attacker's body was.All three of those decisions will now be automatically taken by the technology.Artificial intelligence manages the process, monitoring ball and player movement, before coming up with a decision as to whether the player was onside or offside.Bespoke cameras that will monitor a variety of key elements involved in any tight offside decision have been installed beneath the roof at all 20 Premier League stadiums.Premier League clubs unanimously approved its use for the 2024-25 season in April, with a planned introduction date of October 2024, although that was delayed to allow for further testing of the technology.Uefa introduced semi-automated offside technology in the Champions League at the start of the 2022-23 campaign.The FA said: \"Semi-automated offside technology will provide more efficient placement of the virtual offside line, based on optical player tracking, and produce virtual graphics to ensure an enhanced in-stadium and broadcast experience for supporters.\"The operation of semi-automated offside technology does not change the accuracy of the decision making but enhances the speed and efficiency of the process.\"VAR will also be active across all eight FA Cup fifth-round ties, including the match at Championship club Preston, with referees making in-stadium VAR announcements.The fifth round is scheduled for the weekend of Saturday, 1 March.",
