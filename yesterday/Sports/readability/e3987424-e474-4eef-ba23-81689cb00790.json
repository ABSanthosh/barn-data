  "text": "The Golden State Warriors have had over 600 players don the more than 60 jersey numbers used by their players over the more than 75 years of existence the team has enjoyed in its rich and storied history.Founded in 1946 during the Basketball Association of America (BAA -- a precursor league of the NBA) era, the team has called home the cities of Philadelphia, San Francisco, Oakland, and even San Diego. To commemorate the players who wore those numbers, Warriors Wire is covering the entire history of jersey numbers and the players who sported them since the founding of the team. For this article, we begin with the fifth of 23 players who wore the No. 11 jersey for the Warriors.That player would be Golden State forward alum Paul Arizin. After ending his college career at Villanova, Arizin was picked up with the third overall selection of the 1950 NBA draft by the (then) Philadelphia (now, Golden State) Warriors.The Philadelphia, Pennsylvania native would play all 10 seasons of his Hall of Fame career with the Dubs, winning a title in 1956 and retiring in 1962.During his time suiting up for the Warriors, Arizin wore only jersey No. 11 and put up 22.8 points, 8.6 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game.All stats and data courtesy of Basketball Reference.
