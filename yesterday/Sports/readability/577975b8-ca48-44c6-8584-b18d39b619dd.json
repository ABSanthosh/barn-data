  "text": "Following the 2024 college football season, which saw Penn State reach the semifinal of the College Football Playoff, there were some questions as to which of Penn State's dynamic running back duo would return. Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen each could have explored other options, be it the NFL or a potential transfer destination to no longer share the backfield. But then a funny thing happened.Both running backs decided to run it back in Happy Valley in 2025. There was much rejoicing, especially from head coach James Franklin.\"I thought one of those guys would decide to declare for the NFL and the other one would come back,\" Franklin said during his Big Ten football media day press conference in Las Vegas on Wednesday afternoon. He was not alone in thinking one of the two would be playing football somewhere else this fall. It may still be surprising for many to see Singleton and Allen each suiting up in the blue and white once again.Singleton and Allen each rushed for 1,000 yards last season (Allen rushed for a team-high 1,108 yards and Singleton rushed for 1,099 yards) during Penn State's playoff run. Even with the benefit of playing in a total of 16 games last season (12 regular season games, the Big Ten championship game, and three College Football Playoff games), Penn State received terrific production from its top two running backs, who have embraced playing together as a cohesive combo since their arrival as standout freshmen. Being able to bring both back for another season is nothing to overlook, especially behind Penn State's beefy offensive line.\"[When] you talk about taking some of that production, we've got two great running backs,\" Franklin said during Big Ten media day. \"You know as well as anybody Penn State from a historical standpoint at the running back position, been a ton of really good players. It's amazing to me that both Nick Singleton and Kaytron Allen have a chance to be the all-time leading rushers in Penn State history, 1 and 2, and they've been sharing carries their entire career.\"When the 2025 season kicks off for Penn State (Aug. 30 vs. Nevada), Singleton will already be Penn State's 10th all-time leading rusher with 2,912 career rushing yards. Right behind him on the list is Allen with 2,877 career rushing yards. Penn State has seven players in program history who have rushed for at least 3,000 career yards. It could take just one game for that number to increase.And yes, the top spots on the all-time list are attainable for Singleton and Allen. Evan Royster is Penn State's all-time leading rusher with 3,932 yards. Saquon Barkley is second on the list with 3,843 career rushing yards. Will Allen and Singleton be the new kings of the Penn State rushing record book by the end of the season? It is entirely possible and would be a remarkable feat.Follow Kevin McGuire on Threads, Bluesky, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook.Follow Nittany Lions Wire on X, Facebook, and Threads.
