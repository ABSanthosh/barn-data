  "text": "Zion Williamson's best plays of the season (1:59)Take a look at Zion Williamson's best plays of the season after it was announced he will be out for the remainder of the campaign due to injuries. (1:59)Michael C. WrightMar 31, 2025, 08:10 PM ETCloseJoined ESPN in 2010 Previously covered Bears for ESPN.com Played college football at West Texas A\u0026MThe New Orleans Pelicans announced Monday that forward Zion Williamson and guard CJ McCollum will miss the rest of the 2024-25 season.The announcement came a day after the Pelicans defeated the Charlotte Hornets 98-94 without Williamson (bone bruise in his back) and McCollum (bone bruise in his right foot) in the lineup.Williamson's latest setback ensures the 2019 No. 1 pick will play 30 games or fewer for the fourth time in six years. The 24-year-old sustained the lower-back injury during a fall March 19 at Minnesota and sat out of New Orleans' next five games. Over his eight appearances prior to the injury, Williamson had logged his first two career triple-doubles.New Orleans announced that Williamson's rehabilitation plan will consist of rest and treatment.Among the NBA players who have debuted since the 1997-98 season, Williamson ranks as the only one to average at least 15 points in the paint while shooting at least 55% in each of the first five seasons he played, according to ESPN Research. But over Williamson's six seasons, he has missed more games (258) than he has played (214).The two-time All-Star finishes the season with averages of 24.6 points, 7.2 rebounds and 5.3 assists with 1.2 steals in 30 games.McCollum, meanwhile, suffered his injury during a 40-point performance in a loss to Detroit on March 23. Like Williamson, the guard will follow a rehab program of treatment and rest, according to the team.None of the three Pelicans who averaged at least 20 points per game -- Williamson, McCollum and Trey Murphy III (torn labrum) -- were able finish the season.New Orleans (21-54) currently owns the fourth-worst record in the NBA and has used 41 different starting lineups in 2024-25 because of a slew of season-ending injuries to key players such as Williamson, McCollum, Murphy, Dejounte Murray and Herbert Jones.",
