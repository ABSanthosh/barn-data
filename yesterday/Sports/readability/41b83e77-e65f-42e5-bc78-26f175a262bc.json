  "text": "Malik Nabers is already in the New York Giants' franchise record book after his rookie season.With his fourth catch in Week 18's 20–13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, the first-year wideout reached 108 receptions for the season. That is the most for a single season in Giants history.Nabers nabbed the top spot with a 3-yard catch in the third quarter. He overtook Steve Smith, who set the team's all-time mark with 107 catches in 2009 (his third NFL season). After just one season, Nabers moved ahead of the top receivers in team history including Odell Beckham Jr., Victor Cruz, Plaxico Burress and Amani Toomer.Early in the fourth quarter, Nabers caught a 45-yard touchdown from Drew Lock, his seventh of the year.He finished the game with five catches for 64 yards and a touchdown. His rookie season ends with 109 receptions (on 170 targets) for 1,197 yards.Prior to the Las Vegas Raiders' Week 18 game with the Los Angeles Chargers, Nabers overtook tight end Brock Bowers for the most receptions by a rookie in NFL history. However, Bowers notched four catches in a 34–20 defeat to finish with 112 for the season, taking the record for himself.Nabers, 21, was the Giants' first-round pick (No. 6 overall) in the 2024 NFL Draft out of LSU. As a junior, he tallied 89 catches for 1,569 yards and 14 touchdowns with the Tigers. Nabers was the second wide receiver taken following Ohio State's Marvin Harrison Jr.Setting a team record and league record is especially impressive considering the uncertainty and upheaval the Giants have had at quarterback this season.Daniel Jones was benched coming out of the team's Week 11 bye, having passed for 2,070 yards, eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. Since then, the Giants have started Tommy DeVito and Tim Boyle for one game apiece, and Lock for five games.Nabers will more than likely catch passes from a new quarterback — perhaps a rookie first-round pick — in the 2025 season.",
