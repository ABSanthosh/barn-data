Graduate of University of Delaware.Florida men's basketball coach Todd Golden, who is the subject of an ongoing school inquiry, will remain in charge of the Gators for Monday's game against Grambling State, a spokesperson told ESPN on Sunday.\"Todd Golden's status as UF men's basketball coach has not changed,\" a University Athletic Association spokesperson said. \"He will be coaching the game Monday night.\"On Friday, a Title IX complaint showed the university was investigating Golden for allegations of sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, stalking and cyberstalking from multiple women. The complaint was filed Sept. 27 and alleged that Golden aimed these behaviors toward both current and former Florida students.The complaint, a copy of which was obtained by ESPN, includes allegations that Golden sent photos and videos of his genitalia, made unwanted sexual advances on Instagram and requested sexual favors.On multiple occasions, Golden allegedly took photos of women walking or driving -- or of their cars in various locations -- and then sent them to the subjects of the photos. He also allegedly showed up to locations where he knew the women would be, according to the Title IX complaint.Golden released a statement Saturday acknowledging the school inquiry and said he was considering \"defamation claims.\"\"For the last month, I have actively participated in and respected the confidentiality of an ongoing school inquiry,\" Golden said in a statement posted on X. \"I have recently engaged [attorney] Ken Turkel to advise me on my ability to bring defamation claims while this confidential investigation is ongoing.\"My family and I appreciate the support we have received and remain confident the university will continue its efforts to finish its review properly.\"Florida hired Golden in 2022 to replace Mike White, initially giving him a six-year, $18 million contract. Golden and the school agreed last March to a two-year extension, tying him to the school through the 2029-30 season.Prior to arriving at Florida, Golden had previously spent three seasons as the head coach of San Francisco, leading the Dons to their first NCAA tournament appearance since 1998. Golden was also an assistant under Kyle Smith at San Francisco for three seasons after two seasons apiece at Auburn and Columbia.",
