  "text": "Jul 23, 2025 9:11 PM EDTBack in March, the New York Jets re-signed linebacker and former Washington Commanders first-round pick Jamin Davis. Davis was originally claimed off waivers by the Jets back in December, but never played in a game. The Commanders selected Davis with the No. 19 overall pick in 2021. The former Kentucky Wildcast posted his best season as a pro in his second year in Washington, with 104 total tackles with 68 solo and five for loss across 16 games and 15 starts. Not only did Washington decline Davis’ fifth-year option, it waived him halfway through his fourth season. He was signed to the Green Bay Packers’ practice squad and then signed by the Minnesota Vikings, where he played in five games before the end of 2024. Davis became a free agent at the end of last season, and will now take his chance in Aaron Glenn’s defensive system. But PFSN believes he could be an early cut because of how crowded the linebacker room is. “At this stage, the New York Jets aren’t in much of a position to make any shocking cuts leading up to the regular season,” PFSN wrote. “They took an intriguing flyer on former first-round pick Jamin Davis, who’s still just 26 years old. There’s hardly a guarantee Davis makes the Jets’ 53-man roster, though. They have their starting linebackers lined up already, and recent late-round draft picks Francisco Mauigoa and Zaire Barnes sit ahead of him on the depth chart. Undrafted free agent Aaron Smith from Florida A\u0026M could be a name to watch, too.” About the AuthorTimm Hamm",
