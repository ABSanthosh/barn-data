  "text": "The Brooklyn Nets are coming off a disappointing 2024-25 NBA season in which they finished with a lowly 26-56 record, giving them the sixth-worst record in the league at the conclusion of the regular season. While Brooklyn was hoping for a better season despite this year being the first in what is hopefully a short rebuild, they are in a unique situation heading into the offseason.\"We are in a unique situation as an organization. We've had a chance to compete at a really, really high level and we're a toenail away from a championship potentially,\" BJ Johnson, Nets assistant general manager, said during Episode one of the team's \"SCOUT\" series heading into the 2025 NBA Draft. Johnson has been with the franchise since August of 2016 when he was hired as the player development coordinator under general manager Sean Marks.\"Now, we're on the backside of that, and now, we can rebuild,\" Johnson continued. \"We can rebuild in a way that highlights Brooklyn and our culture and our organization and the city that always set the foundation for us. Just understanding what the people of Brooklyn are all about.\"Johnson has been one of the main guys that have assisted in draft preparation for the Nets for the past few years and Marks has spoken before about how important Johnson is to the entire operation when it comes to scouting players. With four first-round picks to use in the upcoming draft, Johnson and the rest of the scouting department will have their hands full with what looks to be a huge opportunity for Brooklyn to get some young, high-upside talent.Head coach Jordi Fernandez gave his take during the episode of what he is looking for in the players that the team drafts moving forward and it seems like he and the rest of the franchise are on the same page. \"Right now, our job is to figure out who's going to be the next Net. You guys asked me if we go and scout, what type of player we're scouting. We want good dudes here. The players that are always on winning teams, there's a reason why,\" Fernandez said.
