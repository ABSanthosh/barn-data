  "text": "Kings fire Mike Brown amid five-game skid (0:48)The Kings part ways with Mike Brown after a five-game losing streak drops them to 13-18 on the season. (0:48)ESPNDec 27, 2024, 05:05 PM ETThe Sacramento Kings fired third-year head coach Mike Brown on Friday, sources told ESPN's Shams Charania.Doug Christie is expected to be the Kings' interim head coach, sources said. Christie has been an assistant with the Kings since 2021-22 and played in Sacramento for five of his 15 NBA seasons.Brown's firing comes as the Kings are mired in a five-game losing streak -- their longest since January 2022 -- with all five loses coming at home. Sacramento is 13-18 on the season, entering Friday three games back of earning a berth in a play-in game.Brown won Coach of the Year in his first season in Sacramento in 2022-23, leading the Kings to a No. 1 seed before losing in seven games to the Golden State Warriors in the first round of the playoffs. The Kings playoff appearance snapped a 16-season drought without a playoff berth for the Kings, the longest streak in NBA history.The Kings have lost an NBA-worst nine games this season after leading in the fourth quarter with the worst one coming in Brown's final game as coach Thursday night against the Detroit Pistons.Sacramento led by 10 points with less than three minutes to play only to collapse down the stretch. Jaden Ivey converted a four-point play with 3 seconds left when he made a 3-pointer in the right corner and was fouled by De'Aaron Fox. That gave the Pistons a 114-113 win, leaving the Kings in 12th place in the Western Conference.The Kings came into the season with hopes of finishing in the top six in the West and avoiding the play-in tournament after acquiring DeMar DeRozan in a sign-and-trade deal over the summer to add to a core that featured Fox, Domantas Sabonis and Keegan Murray.Fox, who is in the second-to-last year of his five-year, $163 million contract, declined to sign an extension in the offseason. He said on a podcast with Draymond Green earlier this month that he wanted to be on a team that could \"compete at a high level.\"Sacramento has been far from that this season, thanks in large part to an NBA-worst 3-11 record in games decided by five points or fewer. Brown publicly criticized Fox for his role in the game-winning play Thursday night, saying he should have been closer to Ivey instead of committing a foul on a close out.\"You should be hugged up to your man at the 3-point line,\" Brown said. \"Everybody should, and why there was a closeout by Fox, I'm not sure. I got to go back and watch the tape. But for sure 100% we told our guys, can't give up a 3, can't give up a 3, can't give up a 3, stay on the high side, stay on the high side.\"Brown has a 107-88 record in two-plus seasons in Sacramento with a winning record in both of his full seasons. Rick Adelman is the only other coach to post a winning record in a full season since the Kings moved to SacramentoBrown previously had two stints as coach in Cleveland and spent one-plus season as Lakers coach. He has a 455-304 record and has made the playoffs in seven of his nine full seasons. He won Coach of the Year twice, also getting the award in Cleveland in 2008-09.Brown had signed a three-year extension through 2027 with the Kings in June.Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.",
