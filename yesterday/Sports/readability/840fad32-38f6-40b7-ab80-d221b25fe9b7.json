Currently, private equity funds are limited to a 20% stake in NBA teams and are not allowed to serve in governing roles.The NBA has not faced a significant rival 5-on-5 league since the 1970s, when the short-lived American Basketball Association went under and the NBA absorbed four of its teams -- the Pacers, Nets, Nuggets and Spurs. The WNBA was beaten to market by the rival American Basketball League in the 1990s, although that league folded after 2½ seasons.This season, a new 3-on-3 women's league, Unrivaled, is starting up and has filled its rosters with many of the WNBA's biggest stars, though rookie sensation Caitlin Clark chose not to participate.",
