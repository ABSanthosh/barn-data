Like everyone knows it's been a tough year for me.\"Overall, it was a good performance. I was confident. I won the game, that's the main thing.\"Also on Friday night, Germany's Florian Hempel showed why he loves playing on the Alexandra Palace stage with a thrilling 3-1 victory in a high-quality contest against Jeffrey de Zwaan.Both men hit seven 180s in a match played at a fast and furious pace, but 34-year-old Hempel's superior doubles gave him a fourth straight first-round victory in the competition.Hempel moves on to a tie with 26th seed Daryl Gurney but it was a damaging loss for De Zwaan, 28, who came through a late qualifier in November and needed a good run here to keep his PDC tour card for next season.Mickey Mansell earned a third-round date with world number seven Jonny Clayton after a scrappy 3-1 win over Japan's Tomoya Goto, while Dylan Slevin came through an all-Irish tie against William O'Connor to progress to a second-round meeting with Dimitri van den Bergh.Bunting sees off Gotthardt to advanceImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Stephen Bunting is in the third round of the PDC World Darts Championship for a third consecutive yearIn the afternoon session, Stephen Bunting came from behind to beat Kai Gotthardt 3-1 and book his place in the third round.Englishman Bunting, ranked eighth in the world, dropped the first set and almost went 2-0 down in the match before staging an impressive recovery.Tournament debutant Gotthardt missed three darts at double eight to win the second set, allowing Bunting to take out double 10 to level the match before powering away to victory by winning the third and fourth sets without losing a leg.Victory for \"The Bullet\" sets up a last 32 meeting with the winner of Dirk van Duijvenbode's meeting with Madars Razma after Christmas.Should Bunting progress further, he would face world number one and defending world champion Luke Humphries in the quarter-finals on New Year's Day.Elsewhere in Friday afternoon's session, the Dutch duo of Alexander Merkx and Wessel Nijman advanced to the second round with wins over Stephen Burton and Cameron Carolissen respectively.England's Ian White was handed a walkover victory against Sandro Eric Sosing of the Philippines.Sosing withdrew from the competition on medical grounds and was taken to hospital following chest pains.Friday afternoon's resultsFirst roundStephen Burton 0-3 Alexander MerkxWessel Nijman 3-2 Cameron CarolissenIan White w/o Sandro Eric Sosing (Sosing withdrew on medical grounds)Second roundStephen Bunting 3-1 Kai GotthardtFriday evening's fixturesFirst roundMickey Mansell 3-1 Tomoya GotoFlorian Hempel 3-1 Jeffrey de ZwaanWilliam O'Connor 1-3 Dylan SlevinSecond roundMichael van Gerwen 3-0 James HurrellSaturday's scheduleAll times GMTAfternoon Session (12:30)First roundKarel Sedlacek v Rhys GriffinRichard Veenstra v Alexis ToyloSecond roundBrendan Dolan v Lok Yin LeeChris Dobey v Alexander MerkxEvening Session (19:00)Second roundDanny Noppert v Ryan JoyceRaymond van Barneveld v Nick KennyLuke Littler v Ryan MeikleDamon Heta v Connor Scutt",
