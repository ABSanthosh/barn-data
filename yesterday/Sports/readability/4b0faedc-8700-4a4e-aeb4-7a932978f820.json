  "text": "Ruben Amorim says he wanted to take the Manchester United job at the end of the season but accepted a mid-season appointment after being told it was \"now or never\".Amorim, 39, was confirmed as Manchester United's new head coach on Friday and will complete his move to Old Trafford from Lisbon club Sporting on 11 November.Speaking after Sporting's first match since that announcement - a 5-1 league victory which maintained their perfect start after 10 games - Amorim explained his only request following United's approach was to see out the current campaign, which he had already informed the club's president would be his last.But the Portuguese coach was told that would not be possible as the Premier League club sought an immediate replacement for Erik ten Hag, who was sacked on Monday.\"The season started, we started very well, and then Manchester United came, they pay above the compensation clause and the president defends the club's interests,\" Amorim explained.\"I never discussed anything with the president. For three days I said I wanted to stay until the end of the season, but then I was told it was not possible.\"It was now or never, or Manchester would go for another option. So, I had three days to make my mind up, to make a decision that changes radically my life.\"Amorim, who has agreed a contract until June 2027, is the sixth permanent manager United have appointed since Sir Alex Ferguson's illustrious 26-year reign ended with his retirement in 2013.He has established a reputation as one of Europe's most promising managers, leading Sporting to two league titles - including the club's first in 19 years - but said he only wanted Manchester United as his next move.\"I've had other opportunities - the president and [director of football] Hugo Viana can confirm this. It's not the first or the second time that I have been requested by another team and I don't want another team,\" said Amorim.\"After Sporting I wanted that one, Manchester, and I want that context because that context allows me to do things my way and the club believes me that way.\"There's a time when I have to take a step forward in my career. That's what happened. It was harder for me than to any Sporting fan, believe me, but I had to do this.\"He added: \"Now I go home happier because I have explained. People say 'it's about the money', but there was another team that wanted to hire me before and they paid three times more than Manchester.\"It was the best phase of my life. Everyone at Sporting knows. I understand the disappointment of the fans but today is not the farewell. We still have two important games against Manchester City [in the Champions League] and Braga [in the league] to maintain the lead.\"United, 20-time English champions, are 14th after nine Premier League games this season, with Ruud van Nistelrooy set to oversee the next three fixtures - two in the league and one in the Europa League - as interim boss prior to Amorim's arrival. Van Nistelrooy's future at the club remains unclear and Amorim stated his desire to take his current staff with him to Old Trafford, having worked with the same coaches since starting his first job at Portuguese club Casa Pia in 2018.\"I will take my staff with me. That was always one of my conditions. I brought them with me since Casa Pia,\" Amorim said.He also insisted he would not return to buy Sporting players in the January transfer window, after watching in-form Sweden forward Viktor Gyokeres score four goals on Friday.\"Gyokeres costs 100 million and it's very difficult. I'm not going to pick up any Sporting player in January,\" said Amorim.'A good addition to the league' - Premier League bosses react to Amorim's appointmentPremier League managers gave their reaction to Amorim’s appointment during Friday’s news conferences - including Ipswich Town boss Kieran McKenna, whose side will host Manchester United in Amorim’s first match in charge on 24 November.McKenna, a former coach at Old Trafford, said: “I wish him all the best. It is a club I have an affinity with and always want to see them do well, hopefully not in the game that is coming up [against us].\"Other than that I wish them all the best and I’m sure he will be a good addition to the league.\"Van Nistelrooy will remain in interim charge until Amorim’s arrival, with Chelsea up next in the Premier League on Sunday following Wednesday’s 5-2 victory over Leicester City in the EFL Cup in the club’s first match since Erik ten Hag’s sacking.Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca wished Amorim “all the best”, adding: \"If the people in charge took that decision, it's because they think it's the correct one.”On coming up against Van Nistelrooy on Sunday, Maresca added: \"I didn't speak with Ruud. I will give him a big hug on Sunday before the game. He's a fantastic guy, humble, very professional.”United were this week drawn against Tottenham in the EFL Cup quarter-finals – a tie for which Amorim will be in charge. Spurs boss Ange Postecoglou, whose side beat Ten Hag’s United 3-0 at Old Trafford in September, said: \"He will have his feet firmly under the desk by then and I’m looking forward to meeting him.\"",
