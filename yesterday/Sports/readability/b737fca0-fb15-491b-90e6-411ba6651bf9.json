  "text": "Was this the night it all came together for Ruben Amorim at Manchester United?The former Sporting boss has endured an uneasy start to life at Old Trafford since his appointment, particularly domestically where he has overseen just six wins in 23 Premier League games.But European football is looking like being his and United's salvation this season and Thursday's 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbao in their Europa League semi-final first leg ensures they have one foot firmly planted in the final.Granted, the Spanish hosts played much of the game with 10 men but this was nevertheless an impressive display against a side that boasts the best defensive record in La Liga.\"That was the best that I have seen Manchester United play under Ruben Amorim,\" former Leeds, Tottenham and Blackburn goalkeeper Paul Robinson said on BBC Radio 5 live.\"They were excellent - granted they were playing against 10 men, but they still had to do a job.\"Former Manchester United midfielder Robbie Savage said on TNT Sports: \"People will look at the result and say Athletic Bilbao were down to 10 men but this has been a magnificent performance.\"They concede hardly any goals, one of the best [defences] in Europe but to come here and score three goals, magnificent Manchester United performance.\"There have been plenty of poor performances and disappointing losses for United under Amorim but there has also been the odd eye-catching result.They won 2-1 at rivals Manchester City in December, drew 2-2 with Liverpool and knocked Arsenal out of the FA Cup in January and thrashed Real Sociedad 4-1 in Europe.But for Amorim this was the most impressive of the lot, saying: \"I think best result because nobody expected this.\"Few would have predicted such a win for United at San Mames Stadium - which will host the Europa League final on 21 May.Indeed, initially it did not look likely with some of the visiting players appearing nervous. Manuel Ugarte was often caught in possession in the opening 15 minutes, while a static defence was almost embarrassed when Inaki Williams rose highest to glance a header over.Patrick Dorgu was caught way up the pitch to allow Inaki Williams space to attack and deliver a cross for Alex Berenguer, whose shot was blocked on the line by Victor Lindelof.The loud atmosphere created by the home fans undoubtedly contributed to those nervous displays from United's younger players but their senior players stepped up to ultimately settle them.Brazil midfielder Casemiro rolled back the years with a display reminiscent of his Real Madrid days, sitting deep to break up attacks, offering composure and creativity on the ball while also providing an aerial threat.Harry Maguire, criticised previously for being past his best, scored the late winner against Lyon in the quarter-finals, and popped up on the right wing this time to deliver the cross that led to Casemiro's the opener.Then there was captain Bruno Fernandes, who was coolness personified to shut out the noise of the stadium and convert the penalty that put United in control, before dinking home a second when played through on goal.Amorim was full of praise for his senior players for providing the calming influence.He told TNT Sports: \"You can feel especially in the beginning player like Ugarte with a lot of experience was a bit nervous, also Patrick Dorgu.\"These kind of players like Casemiro, Harry Maguire and Bruno Fernandes help a lot.\"Comfortable first-half displays in Europe for Manchester United don't come around often.This was the first time they have scored three first-half goals in a major European game since November 2020 against Istanbul Basaksehir, and also the first time away from home since September 2017 against CSKA Moscow. Both of those were in the Champions League.For Bilbao to go to Old Trafford next week and score at least four goals seems a tall task and instead an all-English Europa League final between United and Tottenham is looking very like, after Spurs beat Bodo/Glimt 3-1 in their semi-final first leg. Another performance like this in the second leg and that will surely be enough to secure United's return to the San Mames in three weeks.\"We want our fans to travel twice to Bilbao,\" Fernandes told TNT Sports.\"The result for us was unbelievable. We should push a bit more in that second half, but we controlled the game and that is good.\"Amorim, however, is looking no further than the next game.\"Of course we are have an advantage,\" he said. \"We have our fans, but again this could change.\"Anything can happen in one game.\"",
