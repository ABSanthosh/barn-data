  "text": "Jhonattan Vegas knocks in birdie for clubhouse lead on Day 1 (0:21)Jhonattan Vegas' late flurry of birdies at Quail Hollow gives him a round of 64 and the outright lead at the PGA Championship. (0:21)Associated PressMay 15, 2025, 08:48 PM ETCHARLOTTE, N.C. -- The strongest field of the majors gave way to a few surprises Thursday in the PGA Championship, starting with Jhonattan Vegas charging into the lead with a 7-under 64 and the top 10 players in the world nowhere to be found among the top 10 at Quail Hollow.A long day filled sunshine and mud balls ended with Vegas in the penultimate group playing the best golf hardly anyone saw.A briefly energized crowd had mostly left when Vegas blazed his way to the finish with five birdies on his last six holes, ending with an 18-footer on No. 8 and a 25-footer on the rugged ninth.It was Vegas' best score in 45 rounds playing the majors. The Venezuelan has never finished in the top 20 in a major and hadn't qualified for this one in three years.He had a two-shot lead over Ryan Gerard, the PGA Tour rookie who grew up in North Carolina and was the only other player to reach 7 under until bogeys on his last two holes. He was joined at 66 by Cam Davis of Australia.The biggest crowds belonged to the top three in the world, and it wasn't nearly as inspiring as four of the past five majors they have combined to win.Masters champion Rory McIlroy didn't make birdie over his last 12 holes and had nothing to say about that after a 3-over 74 sent him straight to the range.Scottie Scheffler and defending PGA champion Xander Schauffele had plenty to say about mud balls on tee shots, particularly on the 16th hole that sent both to double bogey. Scheffler at least holed two shots from off the green -- one for birdie, one for eagle -- and he finished with a 6-iron from 215 yards to 3 feet on No. 9 that sent him to a 69.\"I did a good job battling and keeping a level head out there during a day which there was definitely some challenging aspects to the course,\" Scheffler said. \"Did a good job posting a number on a day where I didn't have my best stuff.\"For the first time in at least 30 years, the top 10 scores after the opening round of a major did not include anyone from the top 10 in the world ranking.In their places were Vegas, who got his game back in order only last year when he won in Minnesota, and a host of other surprises.Alex Smalley, the first alternate who found out about 15 hours before he teed off that he had a spot in the field, rolled in a 70-foot eagle putt on his way to a 67. Ryan Fox of New Zealand, who qualified by winning the Myrtle Beach Classic, also was at 67.They were joined by a large group that included Luke Donald, the 47-year-old Ryder Cup captain for Europe who was the only player without a bogey on his card. The U.S. captain, Keegan Bradley, was another shot behind.\"It's always fun, bogey-free in a major championship on a course that you wouldn't have thought would be ideal for me,\" said Donald, who is only in the field because of a PGA of America tradition to invite active Ryder Cup captains.Considering the champions the majors have produced in recent years, this leaderboard more closely resembled the Myrtle Beach Classic. None of the top eight players have won a major, nor have they ever seriously contended.Gerard looked comfortable playing before a home crowd. He made a tough par on the rugged ninth hole, then ran off four straight birdies on the back nine, and was 7 under for the round after holing a 60-footer for eagle on the par-5 15th.Davis had seven birdies and narrowly missed a 10-foot par putt on his last hole for the lead. Not bad for someone who recently ended a stretch of five straight missed cuts and hasn't had a top 10 since early February.\"It's just constantly trying to go back to things that have worked, trying to keep the head in a place where you're not feeling like you're banging your head against the wall all the time,\" Davis said. \"It's letting it organically come -- good processes, good routines, all those little one percenters add up to good golf eventually.\"The others at 67 were Stephan Jaeger and Aaron Rai, who both became first-time PGA Tour winners last year.Scheffler at 69 had the best score of anyone from the top 10 in the world.Jordan Spieth likely will have to wait until next year at Aronimink to try for the career Grand Slam. The three-time major champion, lacking only the Wanamaker Trophy for his major collection, ran off three straight bogeys early on the back nine and shot 76.",
