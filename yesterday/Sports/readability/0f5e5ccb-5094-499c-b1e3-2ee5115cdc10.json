New York Islanders: Matthew Schaefer, DTeam: Erie (OHL) DOB: 09/05/2007 | Ht: 6-1.75 | Wt: 183 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 17 | G: 7 | A: 15 | P: 22Scouting notes: Schaefer is projected to become a true No. 1 cornerstone for years to come. A dynamic presence at both ends of the ice, he skates with ease and elite mobility to shut down opponents in all situations, while creating offense with quality transition play.Executives and scouts view him as a future elite NHL defenseman and a foundational piece for a championship-caliber roster. Schaefer's ability to control play from the blue line, play tough matchups, and run a power play -- combined with the belief in his character and leadership -- result in many believing that Schaefer has the tools to become a top-10 defender in the league, while wearing a letter as part of a team's leadership group.How he fits: After trading Noah Dobson earlier in the day, the Islanders drafted their franchise cornerstone defender. Schaefer does everything well, and is a dynamic skater with elite mobility. He will take on the toughest matchups, help the Islanders exit the zone with smooth passes and carry outs, and drive offense from the back end. He's a future No. 1 defenseman who will log 25-28 minutes per night and run the power play.Schaefer's ability to dictate play from the back end is franchise-changing for the Isles. Schaefer will attend development camp next week, and it is highly likely he starts the season in the NHL lineup. Don't be surprised if Schaefer is running the power play and logging major minutes by November.A very emotional Schaefer hugged his family and pulled on the Isles jersey for the first time, with a cancer patch. Through tears, he shared his excitement and emotion, and gained the hearts of a lot more than just Isles fans.2. San Jose Sharks: Michael Misa, CTeam: Saginaw (OHL) DOB: 02/16/2007 | Ht: 6-0.75 | Wt: 184 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 65 | G: 62 | A: 72 | P: 134Scouting notes: Granted exceptional status in the OHL in 2022, Misa delivered one of the most remarkable goal-scoring seasons in recent memory in 2024-25, netting 62 goals in just 65 games. He projects to be a top-line forward capable of consistently exceeding 90 points per season in the NHL.Misa's offensive instincts are elite. He processes the game at a high level and executes at top speed. Scouts believe he is NHL-ready and has the potential to become an elite top-line center. Away from the puck, Misa excels at finding soft areas in coverage and has a flair for delivering in clutch moments. His combination of high-end playmaking and goal-scoring ability makes him a constant dual threat in the offensive zone.How he fits: The Sharks kept everyone guessing until the very last moment, but ultimately selected Misa. He is a special talent and adds a second elite two-way center to the organization. He projects as a first-line star, with dual-threat playmaking and scoring ability -- notching 62 goals in 65 OHL games.If Misa's two-way game continues to improve, there's a real chance the Sharks will have two centers capable of dominating play in all three zones with 2024 No. 1 pick Macklin Celebrini already in place. On the power play, Misa can facilitate, be a shooting threat and carry the puck on entries. Because of his dual-threat capabilities, he can play the bumper, the flank or down low. With this selection, the Sharks have the potential to feature the best one-two punch down the middle for years to come.3. Chicago Blackhawks: Anton Frondell, CTeam: Djurgarden (SWEDEN-2) DOB: 05/07/2007 | Ht: 6-1 | Wt: 198 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 29 | G: 11 | A: 14 | P: 25Scouting notes: Frondell is a versatile two-way forward that plays both center and right wing. His flexibility is attractive to teams, although many believe he is most likely to reach his potential as a winger in the NHL.Frondell is coming off one of the most productive seasons by an under-18 player in Allsvenskan history, giving him a confident projection as a first-line NHL forward. He's a cerebral player, who picks apart defenders in one-on-one situations and defensive coverage in offensive zone play. The details of Frondell's game are translatable, including excellent forechecking ability, willingness to attack the middle of the ice and high-end anticipation on both sides of the puck.He has shown play-driving capabilities against men in the Allsvenskan, which has translated to the NHL for other prospects in the past. He's projected to produce between 75-85 points per season. His style of play translates well and has executives excited about his ability to step in the league in the next 18 months.How he fits: It was no secret that Chicago wanted to add some size up front, and Frondell is exactly that. He can play center or the wing, and brings an excellent two-way game. He confidently projects as a first-line forward that beats defenders one-on-one, drives play on both ends of the ice, and should score nearly a point per game.He plays on the inside of the ice and has the ability to score 30-plus goals in the NHL because of his excellent shot. Frondell is a year away from playing in the NHL, and probably two or three from hitting his potential as a top-line forward who drives play. Chicago can play him behind Connor Bedard up the middle, or on Bedard's line to capitalize on the versatility he brings.4. Utah Mammoth: Caleb Desnoyers, CTeam: Moncton (QMJHL) DOB: 04/11/2007 | Ht: 6-1.5 | Wt: 178 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 56 | G: 35 | A: 49 | P: 84Scouting notes: Described as a \"coach's dream\" because of his ability to take an offensive or checking assignment and execute consistently. He makes smart, simple plays, provides a physical presence on the forecheck and generally agitates and makes life difficult on defenders.He projects to be a quality second-line center with a decent chance of becoming a first-line player. He's cerebral, with quick hands and playmaking ability. He's not flashy, but he's consistently effective and makes intelligent plays with the puck. As one scouting director described \"he's the type of player you win with.\" Some have quietly compared him to Patrice Bergeron and Jonathan Toews, who are lofty comparisons, to say the very least.How he fits: The Mammoth kept everyone guessing: Would they trade or keep the pick? Ultimately, they kept the pick and selected Desnoyers. He can play in any situation as one of the best two-way players available. He's a serial winner who plays whatever style of game required to win. If he needs to produce offense, he does. If he needs to shut down the opponent's best, he does that too.Utah needed some size and two-way capability to mesh with Logan Cooley, Clayton Keller and Dylan Guenther, and Desnoyers is exactly that. He'll be NHL-ready a lot sooner than people think because his professional details are top-notch. He projects as a play-driving, two-way, second line center that the Mammoth will turn to in key situations. As noted above, there's a lot of Jonathan Toews in Desnoyers' game, which will excite Mammoth fans, management and coaches.5. Nashville Predators: Brady Martin, CTeam: Sault Ste. Marie (OHL) DOB: 03/16/2007 | Ht: 6-0 | Wt: 178 | Shot: R 2024-25 stats: GP: 57 | G: 33 | A: 39 | P: 72Scouting notes: A Swiss Army knife type of player who will be most effective on the wing because of his strong wall play, Martin projects as a middle-six forward capable of scoring 20 goals routinely, with upside as a second-line forward.He's a wrecking ball that will bring value in all three zones, on and off the puck. Martin has scouts raving about him after an excellent performance at the IIHF under-18 championship, with many opining that he could go very early in the first round. He's a workhorse without an off switch, who brings a blend of physicality and hard skill. He's a nightmare to contain with his brute strength, and forces defenders into precarious positions with good speed and willingness to make \"winning\" plays.Several teams mentioned how impressive Martin was during interviews at the combine. Combine an attractive personality with the hard-nosed style, and it forms a rare combination that is valuable to many scouts who believe he's the type of player teams need to win in the playoffs. Surely, his mention of Conn Smythe winner Sam Bennett as a role model grabbed attention.How he fits: Another pick that was rumored to be on the move, the Predators kept it and selected Martin. Martin is a raw player with functional strength and projects to be a middle-six forward. He will shine as the games get tighter and more physical, and can swing momentum with a brilliant forecheck or big hit.The hard-nosed style of game was very attractive to many teams, especially with Bennett and the Panthers' recent success. Martin needs at least another season or two to develop his offensive game, and while the Predators did leave some skill with James Hagens and Porter Martone on the board, they believe Martin can be an impactful player for years to come.6. Philadelphia Flyers: Porter Martone, RWTeam: Brampton (OHL) DOB: 10/26/2006 | Ht: 6-2.75 | Wt: 208 | Shot: R 2024-25 stats: GP: 57 | G: 37 | A: 61 | P: 98Scouting notes: A big, cerebral forward, Martone is a dual-threat offensive player with ability to score on his own and facilitate. He projects to be a second-line scoring winger who should see top power-play minutes.His competitive nature will make him an effective agitator as he learns to physically impose himself on opponents. He needs to hone the competitiveness and physicality to increase its effectiveness, but he is exactly the type of player teams covet because of the unique combination of offensive talent and competitive fire.His unique combination of scoring ability, size and hard skill make him a very attractive prospect. While his most confident projection is as a top-six forward, Martone has a legitimate chance to become a top-line winger if his skating improves.How he fits: The Flyers got a lot bigger and better with Porter Martone. Considered the smartest player in the draft by scouts, Martone is a dual-threat offensive player with excellent playmaking and shooting ability. There is an aura of competitiveness and physicality that will develop and will undoubtedly make him a fan favorite in Philly.Martone projects to be a scoring winger who will be tough to handle as he develops his power forward game. The Flyers have some elite young players, and Martone has a big frame with elite talent, and can create offense and make special plays happen. He needs a year or two to improve his skating to fully unlock his potential as a top-six scorer, but Rick Tocchet is going to love this player.play2:00Charles Barkley announces Porter Martone as No. 6 pick in NHL draftNBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley helps the Flyers select Porter Martone with the sixth pick of the NHL draft.7. Boston Bruins: James Hagens, CTeam: Boston College (H-EAST) DOB: 11/03/2006 | Ht: 5-10.5 | Wt: 177 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 37 | G: 11 | A: 26 | P: 37Scouting notes: Hagens is projected to be a top-line center, or one of the NHL's best second-line centers. He lacks the dynamism of Misa, opting for a highly cerebral and efficient play style. He brings a good work rate with excellent speed and passing ability that should see him effectively drive play at the NHL level. Scouts and executives are impressed with the professional details of his game (puck support, winning battles, defensive puck play), and they believe it will ease the transition to the NHL while he finds his offensive gear.Another season at Boston College to further develop a more a dynamic offensive gear to become a top-line NHL center -- the one that had scouts impressed during his NTDP season (with 102 points) -- could be the remedy. After playing on one of college hockey's top lines with Gabe Perreault (New York Rangers) and Ryan Leonard (Washington Capitals), Hagens would now be relied upon to drive his own line, create offense through his own playmaking and play a significant matchup role.Hagens has the potential to be the complete package in the NHL. His understanding of spacing and ability to anticipate stands out among his peers. He's smaller and slighter than other prospects, which worries some teams, but there's a mix of Clayton Keller and Jack Hughes in him in terms of transition play and creativity.How he fits: The organization starved for centers lucks out as Hagens falls to No. 7. He's a highly cerebral player, with a nonstop motor, excellent speed and playmaking ability. There is little doubt he will be a play driver at the NHL level. His professional details are already top-notch with puck support, battle success, and strong defensive play.Another year up the road at Boston College will mean Bruins fans won't have to go far to watch their prized prospect. Hagens will step into the Bruins' lineup as their first-line center when he is ready, and David Pastrnak will love that. Hagens has one of the highest ceilings in the draft, especially if his offense continues to develop. Bruins fans should be extremely excited to have their center of the future because he should not have been available at this point.play1:48Adam Sandler announces Bruins pick at NHL draftAdam Sandler joins the NHL draft to announce the Bruins picking Boston College's James Hagens with the seventh overall pick.8. Seattle Kraken: Jake O'Brien, CTeam: Brantford (OHL) DOB: 06/16/2007 | Ht: 6-1.75 | Wt: 172 | Shot: R 2024-25 stats: GP: 66 | G: 32 | A: 66 | P: 98Scouting notes: Deceptive and incredibly smooth, O'Brien projects to be a point-producing, top-six center with a chance to become a top-line center. The right-handed pivot is one of the best playmakers in the draft, creating high-danger chances with regularity; for my money, he is the best pure creator in the draft.He consistently manipulates defenders, distributes the puck on the forehand and backhand and uses fakes that send turn defenders and goalies into pretzels. The development will come from simplifying offensive plays to eliminate turnovers caused by holding the puck for too long.O'Brien's shot is going to be a necessary development area if his passing is to be an elite threat in the NHL. There is risk here, because he's slighter than other players available at the center position, but he has room to fill out over the next few years. O'Brien's elite playmaking skills will be that much more valuable if he can add a speed gear and increase his shooting threat.How he fits: The Kraken are collecting centers like infinity stones, but O'Brien's ceiling was too good to pass on at No. 8. O'Brien sees the ice extraordinarily well, has elite playmaking ability and will certainly help facilitate offense. Matty Beniers and Shane Wright play a two-way game, while O'Brien and Berkly Catton can drive offense.The Kraken are now loaded up the middle, and can easily move one or two players to the wing to round out their top six. O'Brien needs a couple of years to physically mature and improve his shot to become a dual-threat offensive player. As it is, he is more than capable of quarterbacking a power play and facilitating offense. There is no need for the Kraken to rush him, and allowing him to further develop his elite playmaking skills might improve his projection to a first-line forward who tallies a point per game in the NHL.9. Buffalo Sabres: Radim Mrtka, DTeam: Seattle (WHL) DOB: 06/09/2007 | Ht: 6-5.75 | Wt: 207 | Shot: R 2024-25 stats: GP: 43 | G: 3 | A: 32 | P: 35Scouting notes: A 6-6, right-handed defenseman with decent mobility who plays in all situations has scouts very excited. He's very difficult to get around, routinely thwarting attackers in their tracks and killing plays. He projects as a top-four, shutdown defenseman because of his excellent stick work, mobility and transition defense. Mrtka uses his mobility to escape pressure, activate in the rush and make quality passes to the middle of the ice.Mrtka should develop into a strong transition defender, a reliable penalty killer and efficient puck mover. He shoots the puck hard and could become more of a scoring threat if he can pick his spots to get pucks through. While everything flowed through him in Seattle, there are well-placed concerns about his lack of offense.His size and physicality give him the tools to develop into a minute-munching, shutdown defender if his mobility continues to progress. His late birthday gives him lots of development runway to refine his skating, offensive playmaking, and physicality in all areas of the ice.How he fits: A big, right-handed defenseman who plays a hard game, Mrtka is at least two or three years away from playing in the NHL. The Sabres have certainly been lacking players who play a hard game, and Mrtka provides that. He is a mobile skater with good puck-moving ability and projects as a shutdown defenseman at the NHL level. Mrtka's ability to defend in transition, force attackers to the outside and kill plays is attractive.Mrtka has a late birthday and his development runway is longer than others, giving him time to improve his playmaking, pick his spots physically and become an effective shutdown defender. There was some belief the Sabres would take a forward, and this pick raised some eyebrows, but the Sabres felt they needed a defender like Mrtka to complement Rasmus Dahlin and Owen Power.10. Anaheim Ducks: Roger McQueen, CTeam: Brandon (WHL) DOB: 10/02/2006 | Ht: 6-5.25 | Wt: 197 | Shot: R 2024-25 stats: GP: 17 | G: 10 | A: 10 | P: 20Scouting notes: Described as \"a unicorn\" because he's a 6-5 center who skates with the speed and mobility that you would expect from a smaller player, McQueen a hot topic all season. He profiles as a prototypical modern-day power forward who blends soft skill with physicality. Elite right-handed centers are rare in the NHL, and McQueen's size and willingness to physically dictate play adds undeniable value. He has professional defensive habits that are translatable to the NHL, and unique offensive upside that is still developing given the loss of playing time due to a back injury during his draft season.McQueen dominates the cycle game, creates offense on the rush and uses his physical gifts to dominate the cycle and protect pucks. His projection as an elite top-line center lacks confidence, due to lack of playing time from his back injury. Without the injury, we might be discussing McQueen near the top of this draft class because his package of skating, skill and physical gifts are rare, and the type of toolbox of which executives dream.He is a textbook case of high-risk, high-reward player; however, his performance at the scouting combine went along to proving his back injury had healed completely. Playing against tougher competition, where McQueen will be forced to develop his ability to protect himself, the puck control and ability to create offense against bigger bodies will be important. If developed without setback, he could become a two-way force in the NHL for years to come.How he fits: The Ducks swung the bat, and are hoping McQueen is a home run for them at No. 10. Had it not been for injury, there's a very real chance that McQueen gets taken in the top five. McQueen moves with the speed and agility of a much smaller player. He can dictate play physically, drive play at both ends of the ice and possesses unique offensive upside.Anaheim has some high-end forwards -- and McQueen likely has the highest upside of them all. He can dominate off the rush, on the cycle, and at the net front. The combination of McQueen's physical gifts, skill and skating make him an easily projectable power forward who changes the course of games. If he can remain healthy, get stronger and improve his puck-protection skills, the Ducks have a special player.Patience will be key as McQueen needs a few years to develop his skill set, but if he hits his ceiling, he's going to be a dominant two-way force in the NHL.11. Pittsburgh Penguins: Benjamin Kindel, CTeam: Calgary (WHL) DOB: 04/19/2007 | Ht: 5-10 | Wt: 176 | Shot: R 2024-25 stats: GP: 65 | G: 35 | A: 64 | P: 99Scouting notes: Kindel is a scoring machine. Following a 60-point rookie campaign in the WHL in 2023-24, he vaulted into elite status this season, finishing seventh in overall scoring, and was excellent at even strength.Though undersized, Kindel blends pace, vision and quality instincts, and he projects to be a middle-six winger with two-way ability. Kindel's motor is relentless, which makes up for his lack of speed, and enables him to weave through traffic and execute give-and-go's with ease. A dual-threat attacker, he pairs an accurate shot with dangerous passing ability. His elite hockey sense allows him to consistently outsmart opponents and set teammates up with creative plays in dangerous areas with time and space, while playing positionally sound hockey off the puck.Defensively and on the forecheck, Kindel leverages his intelligence, anticipation and effort to win battles despite size disadvantages. He'll need to refine and improve his skating posture and puck control, while adding another speed gear to succeed in the NHL.While the potential exists for Kindel to a top-six NHL player, he is more likely to find himself in the middle-six as a complementary piece.How he fits: Kindel is a facilitator of offense, a brilliant playmaker and somewhat of a surprise at No. 11. Kindel brings high-end hockey sense to identify opportunities to set up teammates in space. He's undersized, but his package of speed, playmaking and relentless motor should translate well to the NHL.Kindel's ceiling is a second-line center who facilitates for his teammates and drives play. If he doesn't, he's likely to be a middle-six, secondary producer who plays on the second power-play unit. The Penguins need players who are cerebral, skate well and drive offense -- and are certainly swinging on Kindel's ceiling. If he grows an inch or two as he develops over the next two years, the comparable to Brayden Point is a good one given the similarities in skating, cerebral play, and driving play at that size.12. Philadelphia Flyers: Jack Nesbitt, CTeam: Windsor (OHL) DOB: 01/12/2007 | Ht: 6-4.25 | Wt: 185 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 65 | G: 25 | A: 39 | P: 64Scouting notes: Nesbitt is an intelligent, two-way center whose game is rooted in competitiveness, defensive reliability, and off-puck hockey IQ. He excels defensively by using his 6-4 frame to break up plays with physical engagement and smart stick positioning to pick off pucks. His hockey sense consistently places him in strong positions in all three zones, allowing him to create turnovers and execute quick passes to create dangerous chances off those turnovers.His offensive upside hinges on his skating, which is a concern. His stiff skating stride and lack of demonstrated flexibility at the combine might limit how much he can improve. Despite flashes of skill, he struggles to maneuver past defenders, and his inconsistent puck handling under pressure often disrupts his playmaking.Nesbitt showed improvement throughout the season, leveraging his size offensively and initiating more contact more consistently. If these improvements continue, and he's able to improve his skating stride, he projects confidently as a dependable middle-six center who can anchor a defensive line and support skilled players higher up the lineup.How he fits: Philadelphia traded with their state rival, the Penguins to select Nesbitt. He's a high-floor player who likely tops out as a third-line center. At his height, he's been described as a \"hard to play against\" center who plays a throwback game, which fits with the style the Flyers want to play.There were a lot of rumors this week that Nesbitt would get taken early because of his positional value, blend of size, hard skill and hockey sense. A very intelligent player that executes quality passes, he plays a reliable game. His skating stride will be the ultimate determining factor in his NHL ceiling. If he adds mobility and an extra gear, there's more offense to unlock, but the focus will be his ability to check. He needs two or three years to develop, but Nesbitt had one of the most confident, low-volatility projections in the draft class as a third-line center.13. Detroit Red Wings: Carter Bear, LWTeam: Everett (WHL) DOB: 11/04/2006 | Ht: 6-0 | Wt: 179 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 56 | G: 40 | A: 42 | P: 82Scouting notes: Bear is the type of player that a team looking for high-end instincts and playmaking covet. Before a season-ending injury in March, Bear was one of the CHL's most dangerous offensive players and a reliable defensive forward. He's versatile, in that he plays center and the wing, and projects as a 65- to 75-point, second-line player, most likely on the wing.He's a quality playmaker using different passes to create advantages in dangerous areas. His ability to manipulate defenders and create space for teammates while pulling coverage towards him should translate well in the NHL. He's got good hands in tight spaces, which make him a threat around the net, and is one of the best offensive facilitators in the draft class.On top of his offensive gifts, Bear's defensive play makes him a quality two-way player. His stick positioning allows him to disrupt passes, and he's a tenacious forechecker who tracks well on the backcheck and finishes hits. His skating posture needs to be more upright to allow him to develop a more explosive stride to take advantage of his offensive skills in transition, but the instincts and execution of plays already exist.Bear is a good mix of soft and hard skill with projectable traits on both sides of the puck, and he is the type of player who should thrive in a matchup role while contributing offensively.14. Columbus Blue Jackets: Jackson Smith, DTeam: Tri-City (WHL) DOB: 05/13/2007 | Ht: 6-3.25 | Wt: 195 | Shot: L 2024-25 stats: GP: 68 | G: 11 | A: 43 | P: 54Scouting notes: Smith is a big, physical defenseman with untapped offensive ability. He possesses all the qualities of a top-four matchup guy. He defends the rush well, closes gaps and steers the play in transition, making him one of the best neutral-zone, transition defenders in the class. Given the importance of transition defense in a matchup role, Smith has a real chance to the guy coaches rely upon to play heavy minutes against the best players.His blend of skating, size and poise with an offensive game that progressed positively as the season wore on makes me a believer that there is more to give, and playing at Penn State next season should help it along.Smith stands 6-3, and executives love the simplicity of his game, reading pressure, disrupting plays and making effective passes to exit the zone. He lacks explosive skating, and the consistent creativity required to be a quality offensive contributor at the NHL level, but his reads are there to be a plus transition player and join the rush as a support player.Smith's development from here will be about using his excellent mobility to prevent rush offense and becoming a more consistent offensive threat with better puck management. If Smith can drive play on both sides of the puck in transition and become a power-play threat, there's a real chance he becomes a No. 2 defender at the NHL level.15. Vancouver Canucks 16.

He profiles as a prototypical modern-day power forward who blends soft skill with physicality. Elite right-handed centers are rare in the NHL, and McQueen\u0026#39;s size and willingness to physically dictate play adds undeniable value. He has professional defensive habits that are translatable to the NHL, and unique offensive upside that is still developing given the loss of playing time due to a back injury during his draft season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcQueen dominates the cycle game, creates offense on the rush and uses his physical gifts to dominate the cycle and protect pucks. His projection as an elite top-line center lacks confidence, due to lack of playing time from his back injury. Without the injury, we might be discussing McQueen near the top of this draft class because his package of skating, skill and physical gifts are rare, and the type of toolbox of which executives dream.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe is a textbook case of high-risk, high-reward player; however, his performance at the scouting combine went along to proving his back injury had healed completely. Playing against tougher competition, where McQueen will be forced to develop his ability to protect himself, the puck control and ability to create offense against bigger bodies will be important. If developed without setback, he could become a two-way force in the NHL for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow he fits:\u003c/strong\u003e The Ducks swung the bat, and are hoping McQueen is a home run for them at No. 10. Had it not been for injury, there\u0026#39;s a very real chance that McQueen gets taken in the top five. McQueen moves with the speed and agility of a much smaller player. He can dictate play physically, drive play at both ends of the ice and possesses unique offensive upside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnaheim has some high-end forwards -- and McQueen likely has the highest upside of them all. He can dominate off the rush, on the cycle, and at the net front. The combination of McQueen\u0026#39;s physical gifts, skill and skating make him an easily projectable power forward who changes the course of games. If he can remain healthy, get stronger and improve his puck-protection skills, the Ducks have a special player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePatience will be key as McQueen needs a few years to develop his skill set, but if he hits his ceiling, he\u0026#39;s going to be a dominant two-way force in the NHL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003chr/\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nhl/500/pit.png?w=110\u0026amp;h=110\u0026amp;transparent=true\" width=\"50\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2\u003e11. \u003ca data-clubhouse-guid=\"472f7324-d0ab-e645-bce6-a3cd3dcb110d\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nhl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-penguins\"\u003ePittsburgh Penguins\u003c/a\u003e: Benjamin Kindel, C\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTeam:\u003c/strong\u003e Calgary (WHL)\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDOB:\u003c/strong\u003e 04/19/2007 | \u003cstrong\u003eHt:\u003c/strong\u003e 5-10 | \u003cstrong\u003eWt:\u003c/strong\u003e 176 | \u003cstrong\u003eShot:\u003c/strong\u003e R\u003cbr/\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e2024-25 stats: GP:\u003c/strong\u003e 65 | \u003cstrong\u003eG:\u003c/strong\u003e 35 | \u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e 64 | \u003cstrong\u003eP:\u003c/strong\u003e 99\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eScouting notes:\u003c/strong\u003e Kindel is a scoring machine.

Kindel\u0026#39;s motor is relentless, which makes up for his lack of speed, and enables him to weave through traffic and execute give-and-go\u0026#39;s with ease. A dual-threat attacker, he pairs an accurate shot with dangerous passing ability.

If he doesn\u0026#39;t, he\u0026#39;s likely to be a middle-six, secondary producer who plays on the second power-play unit.

He excels defensively by using his 6-4 frame to break up plays with physical engagement and smart stick positioning to pick off pucks. His hockey sense consistently places him in strong positions in all three zones, allowing him to create turnovers and execute quick passes to create dangerous chances off those turnovers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHis offensive upside hinges on his skating, which is a concern. His stiff skating stride and lack of demonstrated flexibility at the combine might limit how much he can improve.

He\u0026#39;s a high-floor player who likely tops out as a third-line center. At his height, he\u0026#39;s been described as a \u0026#34;hard to play against\u0026#34; center who plays a throwback game, which fits with the style the Flyers want to play.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere were a lot of rumors this week that Nesbitt would get taken early because of his positional value, blend of size, hard skill and hockey sense. A very intelligent player that executes quality passes, he plays a reliable game. His skating stride will be the ultimate determining factor in his NHL ceiling. If he adds mobility and an extra gear, there\u0026#39;s more offense to unlock, but the focus will be his ability to check.

Before a season-ending injury in March, Bear was one of the CHL\u0026#39;s most dangerous offensive players and a reliable defensive forward.
