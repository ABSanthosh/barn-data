  "text": "Littler thrashes Bunting to set up Van Gerwen finalImage source, ReutersImage caption, Littler is only the seventh player to reach consecutive PDC World Championship finalsTeenager Luke Littler thrashed Stephen Bunting 6-1 with a ruthless display to set up a PDC World Championship final against Michael van Gerwen on Friday.The 17-year-old was runner-up last year and is bidding to become the youngest winner of the tournament after a whirlwind 12 months which has seen him become a household name.The teenager averaged 105.48, his highest of this year's competition, as he overpowered his fellow Englishman at Alexandra Palace in London.Three-time champion Van Gerwen, who defeated Chris Dobey 6-1 in the semi-finals on Thursday, became the youngest winner aged 24 in 2014.\"If we both turn up like we did tonight, it is going to be really good,\" said Littler of the final, which starts at 19:30 GMT.Fourth seed Littler has looked increasingly comfortable as the tournament has progressed and raced into a 4-0 lead on Thursday.He took the opening set despite an average of 113.35 from Bunting and kicked on from there.Eighth seed Bunting won the fifth set but missed three double attempts to seal the next and Littler went further ahead with bullseye to clinch an 84 checkout.With victory in sight, the teenager treated the crowd to a spectacular 170 finish.Third seed Van Gerwen also won 6-1 and is taking nothing for granted.\"We're not even close yet, we're still so far away,\" said the Dutchman.Littler 'can't wait' for finalThe way Littler demolished former BDO world champion Bunting showed why he has taken the world of darts by storm as he threw 13 180s and took out three ton-plus finishes.\"It has been an amazing tournament so far,\" he said. \"I have just beaten what's in front of me and I am glad to get through.\"Littler has risen from 164 to number four in the world rankings since his fairytale run to the final in January 2024, where he lost to Luke Humphries.He won 10 titles in his debut year as a professional, amassed more than £1m in prize money and was named BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.In the process, he has helped the profile of darts soar, with the number of junior academies doubling.Google say he was the most searched-for athlete online in the UK during 2024.\"I have won plenty of titles leading up to this, that is what we do, we lead up to the big one, I can't wait for the final,\" said Littler.Van Gerwen 'on a mission'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Van Gerwen will compete in his seventh world championship finalVan Gerwen is seeking his fourth title but last triumphed in 2019, with two defeats in the final since then.The third seed started strongly against Dobey, who was unable to reel him in with the Dutchman's 98.84 average enough to seal victory.England's Dobey had knocked out 2021 champion Gerwyn Price in the last eight but failed to reach the same level in his first world semi-final appearance.Dobey missed three darts at the double in the second set to go two behind, and while the world number 15 fought back to win the third - where he notched a 170 'Big Fish' checkout before a 108 finish - it was a brief highlight.Van Gerwen rattled off the next four sets with the minimum of fuss to reach the final for a seventh time. He threw eight 180s and took out three ton-plus checkouts, including a majestic 158.\"I'm here with a mission and a target. You will have ups and downs but today I showed a good mentality,\" he said.\"Even when things were not going my way I was able to produce good stuff at the right moments. That gives me a lot of confidence.\"",
