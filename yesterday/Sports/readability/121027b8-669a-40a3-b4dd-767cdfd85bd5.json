  "text": "All eyes were on goalkeeper Hannah Hampton after a rocky week for the England squad - but just half an hour in, it was someone else taking the spotlight at Wembley.Chelsea forward Aggie Beever-Jones was star of the show, scoring her first England hat-trick in the 6-0 thumping of Portugal in the Women's Nations League.The 21-year-old's treble came in just 33 minutes.It was a scintillating performance from Beever-Jones and the Lionesses just five weeks out from Euro 2025 when they will attempt to defend their European title.Noise had been building pre-match following goalkeeper Mary Earps' shock international retirement. How would they cope without one of their talismanic leaders? Could Chelsea's Hampton handle the pressure?Clearly, they coped extremely well, and newly confirmed number one Hampton barely had to move a muscle. \"Are you not entertained?,\" said former England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley on BBC Radio 5 Live.\"I'm running out of rubber on my eraser because I keep having to change [goalscoring] tally marks.\"It's been so fun to watch, with so much fluidity, and the enjoyment this England team has been playing with.\"Ex-England defender Lindsay Johnson described it as a \"Friday night funfest\" and even manager Sarina Wiegman celebrated more than usual in the dugout.With so much attention on matters off the pitch over the past week, this was a performance that emphatically shut out the noise and lifted the mood.It was \"back to business\" as Wiegman claimed afterwards.She had fielded questions regarding Earps' retirement on Thursday, admitting it had been a \"hard\" start to the week.Wiegman was visibly emotional, reflecting on the good times they shared together and unwilling to discuss how frustrating the sudden departure of the 32-year-old may be.With only 13 caps for Hampton prior to kick-off, and none for the other two goalkeepers in the squad, fears were raised about their inexperience.But when the team in front plays so well, it quickly becomes less of a concern. Hampton spent the majority of the second half stood still, watching on as her team-mates tried to add to their five first-half goals, managing one more through Chloe Kelly.Hat-trick hero Beever-Jones gave some insight into Wiegman's talk before the Group A3 tie: \"She said before the game, 'it's a new kit, it's a new England, we have a new squad'.\"But it wasn't a new England, it was a \"vintage\" England, according to Bardsley, who was waxing lyrical by the time the fifth goal came in only the 33rd minute, sealing a treble for Beever-Jones.Lucy Bronze nodded in England's second, while Beth Mead joined in on the action and substitute Kelly added the finishing touch with the sixth in the 62nd minute.\"This is reminding me of vintage England, casting myself back to 2022,\" said Bardsley, who made 81 appearances for the Lionesses. \"Portugal have been poor, but among the noise, it is so wonderful to see the girls with smiles on their faces.\"They were not the only ones with smiles on their faces as supporters danced and celebrated at full-time, clearly encouraged by what they had witnessed.England's form has dipped throughout the last 18 months. Just seven weeks ago they were beaten in Leuven by Belgium - who are bottom of the Women's Nations League group - and two months after picking up a victory over world champions Spain at Wembley.But the Lionesses showed they were up to the task when the pressure was on, buoyed by the return of key players Georgia Stanway, Lauren Hemp and Alex Greenwood from injury.\"There has been a lot of noise [this week] and players wanted to put that to bed,\" added Johnson.\"Questions in the press conference were relentless and they are going to be. They just want to talk about football and they made it all about the football.\"Mary [Earps] will be missed, but when you score six goals in the fashion they did, we are just talking about the football and how good England were.\"\"Aggie Beever-Jones is a baller,\" was also Bardsley's statement at full-time as she lauded the matchwinner.The Chelsea forward has given her chances of selection for Euro 2025 a significant boost and Wiegman couldn't help but laugh when asked the question.\"I think she did really well…\" said the Dutchwoman with a smile.\"She is a goalscorer. She scores goals very easily and very well. She has such quick feet. She is also really tight on the ball, she played really relaxed.\"Team-mate Kelly said it was great to see Beever-Jones \"firing\" in an England shirt and Bardsley said she was a \"pesky\" forward to play against.Competition for a starting role will be hard to come by though. Arsenal's Alessia Russo was watching from the bench, rested for this match after picking up a minor calf injury, while Chelsea's Lauren James has still to return from injury.Hemp was impressive too on her first England game since knee surgery in November, while Mead was on the scoresheet and Kelly proved her worth off the bench.\"She really announced herself and put her case forward to Sarina Wiegman so she knows she is capable of starting at the Euros this summer,\" added Bardsley of Beever-Jones.\"Knowing there's that weapon, whether it's on the bench or from the start, is so lovely to know that she's in Sarina Wiegman's tool kit.\"Beever-Jones looked over to her family to celebrate and revealed the team had signed the match ball to take home afterwards.But whatever her role is at the Euros, she is ready to make an impact.\"In football it's never just a straight line. I've had to be patient in this set-up and that just shows the quality the team has,\" Beever-Jones told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"I got the opportunity and I am grateful to everyone who helped me get into this place. I couldn't have hoped for a better day.\"I wouldn't want anyone else for competition. Alessia [Russo] is an incredible player, I learn so much off her and the whole frontline. Hopefully I can contribute where I can.\"Whenever I'm playing for England I just hope I'm giving the right people the right headaches.\"",
