The duo kicks things off by revisiting the Kansas City Chiefs' dominant win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, where despite some strong production value, the game got blown open as the Chiefs appeared to be entering postseason mode. The show then pivots to a tough reality check for the Houston Texans, who were completely outclassed by the Baltimore Ravens. While CJ Stroud did his best, the Texans‚Äô glaring weakness in the trenches is hard to ignore, and Nate has some strong thoughts on their offensive line struggles.Next, Nate and Charles deep dive on the Denver Broncos @ Cincinnati Bengals matchup‚Äîa defensive hoss fight that features some of the league's top talent, including Ja'Marr Chase and Patrick Surtain II, and preview an intriguing Green Bay Packers @ Minnesota Vikings game where defensive adjustments will likely determine the outcome.As the episode rounds out, the guys tackle a high-stakes game for the Atlanta Falcons, who need a win against the Washington Commanders to keep their playoff hopes alive, and a double slop watch featuring the Dallas Cowboys @ Philadelphia Eagles and the Carolina Panthers @ Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
