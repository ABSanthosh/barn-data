  "text": "The $18 million righty says he is open to \"any\" role now.Back in spring training, Marcus Stroman made one thing clear: he’s a starter. Not a reliever. Not a swingman. “I’m a starter,” he repeated, any time he was questioned about the New York Yankees' crowded rotation. But now, coming off his first rehab outing since hitting the injured list in April, Stroman’s tone has shifted.“I’m very open to whatever my role may be,” Stroman told The Athletic’s Brendan Kuty on Wednesday, after throwing 3⅓ innings for Double-A Somerset. It was an interesting comment. One that stood in contrast to the defiant certainty of March. He added that he hasn’t had detailed conversations with the Yankees yet but expects to be built back up as a starter. That aligns with Aaron Boone’s earlier comments, saying the team was approaching his rehab with that in mind. Vincent Carchietta-Imagn ImagesStroman allowed one earned run on two hits in the rehab outing, walking two and striking out four. It was his first game action since April 12, when left knee inflammation shelved him after a rocky start to the season.Where he fits when he’s healthy remains unclear. The Yankees' current rotation of Max Fried, Carlos Rodon, Clarke Schmidt, Will Warren, and Ryan Yarbrough has held up for the most part. Luis Gil is expected back at some point this summer. For now, the team has the luxury of time, and Stroman seems ready to accept whatever direction that leads.Before the injury, he posted an 11.57 ERA across three starts and because of all the time he has missed, he actually made himself more attractive on the trade market. There is little chance he could reach the 140-innings needed for his $18 million option for 2026 kicked in. That was a major hurdle when the Yankees were trying to trade him this winter. His next rehab outing will be telling. But for now, the biggest development might not be in the box score—it's in his buy-in.",
