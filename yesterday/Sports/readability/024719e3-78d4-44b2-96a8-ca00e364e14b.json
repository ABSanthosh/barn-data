  "text": "Premier League official Coote sacked after investigationImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Coote officiated his first Premier League game in 2018Premier League official David Coote has been sacked by referees' body the PGMOL following a \"thorough investigation\" into his conduct.Coote, 42, was suspended by the PGMOL (the Professional Game Match Officials Limited) on 11 November pending a full investigation after a video allegedly showing him making derogatory comments about Liverpool and the club's former manager Jurgen Klopp was circulated on social media.A further investigation was opened two days later after the Sun published photos it says were taken during this summer's European Championship, alleging that they appear to show Coote sniffing a white powder through a rolled up US bank note.The PGMOL said Coote's actions made his position \"untenable\".Neither the pictures nor the video have been verified independently by the BBC.\"David Coote's actions were found to be in serious breach of the provisions of his employment contract,\" the PGMOL said.\"Supporting David Coote continues to be important to us and we remain committed to his welfare.\"Coote has the right to appeal the decision to terminate his employment.How did we get here?The PGMOL first took action against Coote on 11 November following the release of a video on social media, which allegedly showed him criticising Liverpool and their former manager Klopp.The video appeared to refer a Premier League match that Coote officiated between Liverpool and Burnley in July 2020, which finished 1-1.Klopp criticised Coote after the game, saying the referee failed to give fouls for challenges made on Liverpool's players.The FA opened an investigation the following day.On 13 November, the PGMOL said it was taking further allegations \"very seriously\" following the publication of images showing appearing to show Coote sniffing a white powder.Coote was working at the Euros in his capacity as a match official and Uefa, European football's governing body, also suspended Coote as it launched its own investigation.On 27 November, the FA opened a new investigation following an allegation that Coote had discussed giving a yellow card before a Championship match between Leeds and West Brom in 2019.A report in the Sun claimed Coote exchanged messages with a fan discussing giving a yellow card before and after the game.Coote denied any wrongdoing and said the allegation was \"false and defamatory\".The contents of the report have not been verified by the BBCThe exchange referred to a booking Leeds defender Ezgjan Alioski received in the match from Coote. There is no suggestion of any financial gain by Coote and the booking is regarded as entirely correct.What are Coote's refereeing stats?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jurgen Klopp remonstrated with referee David Coote after Liverpool's 1-1 draw against Burnley in July 2020Coote was appointed as a Premier League referee for the first time in April 2018 when West Brom won 1-0 at Newcastle.He oversaw 11 games in the top flight during 2018-19 and has gone on to referee 112 Premier League games, including three Liverpool fixtures.July 2020 - 1-1 draw with Burnley at AnfieldMarch 2024 - 2-1 win against Brighton at AnfieldNovember 2024 - 2-0 win over Aston Villa at AnfieldCoote has refereed Liverpool on a further five occasions in cup games.As one of the PGMOL's most highly-rated video assistant referees (VAR), Coote has been the VAR for 64 Premier League matches, 11 of which have involved Liverpool, the first of which was in September 2019.In October 2020, Coote was the VAR when Liverpool drew 2-2 with Everton and Klopp complained about the decision not to send off Jordan Pickford for a challenge on Virgil van Dijk, as well as a stoppage-time goal from Jordan Henderson being disallowed for offside.Liverpool asked the Premier League to review those two VAR decisions.Coote was then not appointed as the VAR of a Liverpool Premier League match until September 2023, the first of seven Liverpool Premier League matches as VAR last season.",
