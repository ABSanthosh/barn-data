  "text": "More abuse as women's football grows - BronzeMedia caption, Lionesses support Carter following racial abuse - BronzeEngland defender Lucy Bronze says players are getting more abuse the bigger women's football becomes, after team-mate Jess Carter revealed she has been sent racist messages during Euro 2025.Carter said she would take a step back from social media after experiencing \"a lot of racial abuse\" during the tournament, and the Football Association is \"working with police to ensure those responsible for this hate crime are brought to justice\".The Lionesses will also stop the anti-racism gesture of taking a knee before matches, saying it is \"clear we and football need to find another way to tackle racism\".Bronze - an ever-present as England have set up a Euro 2025 semi-final against Italy on Tuesday - said players have had to deal with \"more abuse\" since achieving international success.\"The bigger the game gets, the bigger the noise becomes, the more fans there are, but the more critics there are,\" said the full-back, 33.\"We're obviously open to critics - that's why we love the sport - but we're not open to abuse. Especially in women's football, the online abuse seems to be getting worse and worse. \"We see it more in the stadiums in men's football and online, but I think with women's football there seems to be a real target online. \"It's something that we're very aware of. There is a way to make a change. There is a solution. I don't have the answer, but I'm sure that there is one.\"'We're never helpless as players'Bronze said Sarina Wiegman's squad held meetings before the tournament to discuss abuse and how it had become a \"huge factor specifically in women's football\".Before travelling to Switzerland, Arsenal and England striker Alessia Russo said she preferred to stay off social media because of how \"damaging\" the abuse can be.And Chelsea forward Lauren James, who received racist abuse at the 2023 Women's World Cup and during the following Women's Super League season, said abuse \"never really stops\".Their comments came after British tennis player Katie Boulter spoke to BBC Sport about being subjected to online abuse and death threats.In 2021, football clubs, players and sporting bodies staged a four-day boycott of social media platforms to tackle abuse and discrimination.Bronze said she hoped that by standing before kick-off, instead of taking a knee, \"noise will be reached around the world\".\"We know the people higher up are the ones who can ultimately put in things to make change. But I think we know we're never helpless as players,\" she added.\"Our voices are loud enough to be heard by people around the world, whether that's social media platforms or federations like Uefa and Fifa. \"That's something we're very proud of as a Lionesses team, that we've created this voice and a platform so we can reach the highest of heights. We're willing to use that platform and that voice to make differences.\"Bronze also called for more action from social media platforms, adding: \"People need to be held accountable.\"We don't want it to be small steps anymore.\"No player needs social media. We play football because we love the sport, we love playing. We do love connecting with our fans, social media is a great way to do that, but we don't need it.\"That's something that the platforms should be very aware of. We can thrive without it.\"On Carter calling the abuse out publicly, she said: \"For her to speak out is so empowering to our whole team in general, especially to the likes of someone like Michelle [Agyemang] who is in her first tournament. \"It gives people more power to be brave, stand up and speak up and see all the team-mates and the country are behind [Carter]. That means a lot in moments like this. \"A lot of players have known that this has always been an issue in football. To hear Jess talking about it yesterday, we're all just so disappointed in so-called fans writing these messages. \"For Jess herself, she probably wouldn't put it out to the world, but it's obviously difficult for her to go through. We know it's not just Jess as well.\"Greenwood plea for help 'to make a change'England defender Alex Greenwood believes taking the knee has \"lost its purpose\" and the squad want to send a message they \"don't stand\" for abuse.However, she said they need \"some help\" from other organisations to drive real change.\"We hope other organisations, and other teams, have the same feeling as us and also want to do something to make a change,\" Greenwood told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"But the responsibility lies with us in our team right now and what we've decided to do, we feel really passionate and strongly about. \"I know we can only do so much, but what we are capable of doing, we will continue to do.\"Uefa has developed an online abuse programme which monitors and reports cases during major tournaments and European competitions. It was created before Euro 2022 and running in 2025, with details of the programme's findings released at the end of the tournament. A revised Fifa disciplinary code was also agreed in May which will introduce new measures to fight racist abuse, including increased minimum bans and enhanced financial penalties.A Fifa-led social media protection service, external was also in operation during the 2023 Women's World Cup. It identified 7,085 comments as abuse which was subsequently reported to social media platforms.Fifa president Gianni Infantino said he was \"deeply saddened\" by the abuse directed at Carter.He added: \"No player should be discriminated against in any way. They should be free to be at their very best on the pitch.\"",
