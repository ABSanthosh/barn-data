Cockcroft and Eric KarabellplayPassan on Bellinger deal: Yanks, Cubs were 'perfect' trade partners (2:13)Jeff Passan breaks down what led to Cody Bellinger's trade from the Chicago Cubs to the New York Yankees. (2:13)Jeff Passan, Senior MLB InsiderDec 17, 2024, 04:52 PM ETCloseESPN MLB insider Author of \"The Arm: Inside the Billion-Dollar Mystery of the Most Valuable Commodity in Sports\"The New York Yankees acquired outfielder/first baseman Cody Bellinger in a trade with the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday, continuing to stock up on high-end talent in the wake of outfielder Juan Soto's free agent defection to the New York Mets.Chicago also sent cash considerations to New York, which shipped right-hander Cody Poteet to the Cubs to complete the deal.Sources told ESPN that the Yankees will receive $5 million to offset Bellinger's salary -- he will make $27.5 million in 2025 and has a player option for $25 million in 2026. Chicago will pay $2.5 million to cover part of Bellinger's $27.5 million salary this season. The remaining $2.5 million will either cover the contract buyout if Bellinger does not exercise his player option or go toward his $25 million salary in 2026, according to a source.Bellinger, 29, is the 2019 National League MVP whose father, Clay, played for the Yankees from 1999 to 2001. Bellinger's return to form after three substandard seasons came in 2023 with the Cubs, and he agreed to a three-year, $80 million free agent contract with Chicago in March.After hitting .266/.325/.426 with 18 home runs and 78 RBIs this year, Bellinger declined to opt out of the rest of his deal.New York's acquisition of Bellinger follows the free agent signing of left-handed starter Max Fried and the trade for All-Star closer Devin Williams. Coming off a World Series loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Yankees have spent the week since Soto's signing fortifying for another run.Bellinger's versatility fits perfectly into holes in New York's lineup. He is an above-average center fielder and can either play there or in left field if the Yankees prefer to use rookie Jasson Dominguez in center. Bellinger also is a top defensive first baseman, and though Anthony Rizzo's free agency opened the position, New York could opt for an in-house option in Ben Rice or pursue Pete Alonso or Christian Walker in free agency.At his best, Bellinger is a middle-of-the-lineup force whose bat-to-ball skills should help buttress the loss of Soto. When he won the MVP as a 24-year-old in 2019, Bellinger hit .305/.406/.629 with 47 home runs. Over his eight-year career, he has batted .259/.334/.484 with 196 home runs and 597 RBIs in 1,005 games.The Cubs had spent the winter seeking a trade partner for Bellinger, looking to free up payroll in hopes of improving a team that went 83-79 this year. The teams spent significant time haggling over the amount of money the Cubs would include in a potential deal.Ultimately, they settled on the $5 million figure and the 30-year-old Poteet, who started four games for the Yankees this year. In 24⅓ innings, Poteet struck out 16, walked eight and posted a 2.22 ERA. In three major league seasons split between starting and relieving, Poteet has a 3.80 ERA with 69 strikeouts, 35 walks and 13 home runs allowed in 83 innings.",
