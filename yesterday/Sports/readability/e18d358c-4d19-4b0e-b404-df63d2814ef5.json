  "text": "England leg-spinner Rehan Ahmed says the third and deciding Test in Pakistan is \"still level\" despite the tourists losing three wickets late on the second day.Saud Shakeel’s sublime century took Pakistan to 344, a lead of 77, before spinners Noman Ali and Sajid Khan left England 24-3, 53 behind in Rawalpindi.\"Obviously having three down is not ideal,\" Ahmed told Test Match Special. \"We've got so much batting in the locker room.\"The momentum is with them at the moment but hopefully we can soak it up a bit tomorrow, put it back on them and try to get a lead.\"Ahmed took three wickets on Friday morning to leave Pakistan 177-7, still 90 behind England's first-innings 267.But Shakeel added 88 with Noman and another 72 with Sajid to give Pakistan a vital advantage.In fading light, Sajid trapped Ben Duckett leg before, then Noman had Zak Crawley lbw and Ollie Pope caught at slip.England at least have the benefit of bowling last on a pitch that was dried with fans and heaters before the Test began, though the tourists will need runs on Saturday to make it count.Asked about the state of the game, Ahmed said: \"It's still level, isn't it?\"The 20-year-old, who finished with 4-66 in his first Test since February, added: \"As a batting group having three down is never part of the plan.\"At one stage it looked like we could've got them just before they got a lead but it's cricket, things happen quickly.\"England were ground down by Shakeel in the afternoon session, the left-hander taking advantage of some questionable tactics from the visitors.The tourists spread the field, alleviating pressure on Shakeel, who accepted the singles on offer. He took 70 singles in his first 100 runs, a record in the era such data has been recorded.England also ignored the pace of Gus Atkinson until they had bowled 15 overs with the second new ball and it was Atkinson who eventually removed Shakeel. Captain Ben Stokes did not bowl himself at all.The struggle to remove Noman and Sajid also continued a poor record against tailenders during Stokes' time as captain.\"Saud Shakeel batted very well,\" said Ahmed. \"He batted time and stuck to his method.\"When Saud Shakeel took the singles, they weren't the balls we wanted to bowl. If we bowled our best ball every time, we wouldn't go for singles. We tried to stop his scoring options.\"Shakeel made his fourth Test century and said taking singles is his \"strength\".He added: \"When you score a hundred you are really pleased. At the same time we got a good, handsome lead, so that is the most satisfying thing.\"It’s evenly poised. We have the slight upper hand but we have to see what happens tomorrow. We still have to bowl well and hopefully won’t have a big target.\"",
