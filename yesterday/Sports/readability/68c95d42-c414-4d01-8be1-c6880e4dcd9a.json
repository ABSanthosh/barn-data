You can follow him via Twitter @RichCimini.FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- The New York Jets-Aaron Rodgers marriage appears to be ending after two disappointing seasons, as the future Hall of Fame quarterback is unlikely to remain with the team in 2025, sources told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Sunday.Rodgers, 41, flew to New Jersey last week to meet with new coach Aaron Glenn and new general manager Darren Mougey, a source confirmed to ESPN. Fox Sports reported Sunday that Rodgers was informed in that meeting that the team has decided to part ways with him.A Jets spokesman declined to confirm the report.Glenn has been in contact with Rodgers since he was hired, as part of an evolving discussion on the quarterback's future. Glenn, at his introductory news conference on Jan. 27, was noncommittal on Rodgers. The coach said he wanted to meet with the veteran before choosing a direction at quarterback.A formal announcement is likely in the coming days.Rodgers said at the end of the season that he understood the circumstances, that the Jets, with a new regime, might want to start fresh at quarterback.\"Either way, I won't be upset or offended whatever they decide to do,\" he said.Rodgers accounted for 18 starts, six victories, one highly publicized Achilles tear and countless headlines in his two years with the Jets. It's unclear whether he will continue his career; he has maintained that he's undecided on a 21st season.The future Hall of Famer has one year remaining on his contract, a nonguaranteed $37.5 million. He was due to count $23.5 million on the cap.The Jets will be left with $49 million in dead money, which can be spread over two years if he's designated a post-June 1 cut. In that case, they would have to carry his $23.5 million on the cap until June 1. At that point, he'd count $14 million in 2025, a net savings of $9.5 million.However, in the June 1 scenario, there would be a $35 million charge in 2026.If he opts for retirement, the same accounting applies.Determined to end their five-decade Super Bowl drought, the Jets made the biggest trade in franchise history on April 24, 2023, acquiring the four-time MVP from the Green Bay Packers for a package of draft picks.Expectations soared, as the Jets trumpeted Rodgers as the missing piece. His first season ended soon after it began, with a torn left Achilles on the fourth snap of the 2023 season.Rodgers returned healthy in 2024, started every game despite some nagging leg injuries and delivered a vintage, four-touchdown game in the season finale -- a 32-20 win over the Miami Dolphins. There weren't many games like that for Rodgers, whose performance over the course of the season was uneven.He passed for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns, both third on the Jets' single-season list, but he also had 11 interceptions and finished with a 48.1 QBR, which ranked 25th out of 32 qualified NFL passers. The Jets underachieved on offense, finishing 24th in scoring, and went 5-12, in one of the season's biggest disappointments.Rodgers' slow start was a big reason coach Robert Saleh was fired only five games into the season. Rodgers' closest confidant, offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, was demoted at that point. Six weeks later, Joe Douglas was fired as the general manager.Saleh, Douglas and Hackett were part of the Jets' contingent that visited Rodgers at his Malibu, California, home in March 2023, persuading the quarterback to play for the Jets. At that point, the Jets and Packers started working on a trade that took a month to finalize. By then, the Packers had decided to promote Jordan Love to the starting job.So began five months of breathless hype for the Jets, highlighted by an appearance on HBO's \"Hard Knocks.\" Rodgers debuted with the team Sept. 11, 2023, on \"Monday Night Football.\" During introductions, he ran out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel carrying an American flag -- one of the greatest moments of his career, he later said.Within minutes, he crumpled to the ground after a sack, his left Achilles ruptured.Rodgers' expected departure will leave Tyrod Taylor, 35, as the only experienced quarterback on the roster. The Jets are likely to pursue a starting-caliber quarterback in the offseason. They also could draft a quarterback.Rodgers' imminent departure also means they could release wide receiver Davante Adams, who will have to renegotiate his prohibitive cap charge ($38.3 million) to stay on the roster. Adams said after the season that his decision would be influenced by whether Rodgers stays or goes.",
