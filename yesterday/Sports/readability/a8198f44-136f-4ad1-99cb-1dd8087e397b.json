  "text": "Adam Schefter, Senior NFL InsiderDec 14, 2024, 06:05 PM ETClose ESPN NFL Insider Joined ESPN in 2009 Former president of the Pro Football Writers of America and the author of four booksLas Vegas Raiders star Maxx Crosby needs season-ending arthroscopic ankle surgery, he said as part of an Instagram post Saturday.Crosby initially hurt the ankle in Week 2 in Baltimore, later missing just one game. He said he aggravated it \"even worse\" last weekend against Tampa Bay, leading to the need for surgery.\"Some people will say that I should just take my time and just relax and get ready for next year, I will never be that person,\" he wrote. \"I have a team around me that made it possible for me to come back and still disrupt even though I truly wasn't fully healthy all year. I will stand in the fire no matter what the circumstance because this game is my life. If I got a heartbeat, I expect to play for the fans that spend their hard earned money to watch me perform and wear my jersey every Sunday. I do it because it means everything to me and I will never change my approach to this game.\" Crosby will meet Monday with Dr. Rob Anderson and undergo the arthroscopic surgery that will determine whether a second surgery is needed and how much damage he's suffered to the ankle, sources told ESPN. Doctors believe the extent of the injury could be worse than initially thought.The Raiders (2-11) already have been eliminated from postseason contention, and Crosby will begin rehabbing with an eye on the 2025 season. The question will be whether it's for the Raiders.Multiple teams inquired about Crosby with Las Vegas leading up to or at the NFL trade deadline in November. The Raiders refused to entertain any team's interest, and owner Mark Davis even told ESPN: \"We're Not Trading Maxx Crosby. Before Or After the Trade Deadline!!!\"Still, it won't stop other teams from approaching the Raiders again this offseason as they attempt to rebuild their roster around whichever quarterback they draft for the 2025 season.Crosby will turn 28 in August and is entering the prime of his career, which will be attractive to other teams -- or Las Vegas if it does keep him.",
