One league source familiar with other teams' efforts told ESPN that \"it would be beyond shocking\" if Crosby was dealt before the NFL's Nov. 5 trade deadline.New Raiders minority stakeholder Richard Seymour said on this week's \"Adam Schefter Podcast\" that he could not envision the Raiders trading away the \"heartbeat of the team.\"\"If I'm the Lions, I want to come get Maxx Crosby, too,\" Seymour said on the podcast. \"Why wouldn't they? He's the heartbeat of our team. But that would be Mark Davis' decision, and I don't see him making that decision to trade away Maxx Crosby.\"Crosby is beloved within the organization, especially by Davis, who now has effectively slammed shut the door on the idea that his team could trade its best player.Crosby also said this week on his podcast that he wants to stay with the Raiders and addressed the trade speculation involving the Lions, who are without injured star defensive end Aidan Hutchinson.\"I'm sitting here innocently and just doing what I do and I feel like I got to like address it with my teammates,\" he said on \"The Rush with Maxx Crosby\" podcast.\"I'm like, 'I'm not trying to leave.' ... I don't have 100% control and all that, but I want to be here, I want to be Silver and Black. I'll say it loud and f---ing clear, I want to be a Raider. I've said that over and over and over again.\"The Raiders already made one high-profile trade last week, sending star wide receiver Davante Adams to the Jets for a conditional third-round draft pick.Teams like the Lions still in search of potentially adding pass-rush help before the trade deadline now will have to look to other teams and other players. One of the most logical is Cleveland's former Pro Bowl defensive end Za'Darius Smith, who has drawn some attention across the league.Smith has the resume, the talents and a friendly enough salary this season to make him attractive to other teams, and league sources said they will not be surprised to see the Browns deal him before the trade deadline.Crosby, 27, has 6.5 sacks this season, tied for the sixth-most in the NFL. The three-time Pro Bowler has played his entire career with the Raiders, recording 58.5 sacks in 89 games over five-plus seasons.",
