  "text": "Dustin Poirier gave insight on Islam Makhachev's UFC welterweight debut.Makhachev (27-1 MMA, 16-1 UFC) vacated his UFC lightweight title for a move up to 170 pounds, and is expected to challenge welterweight champion Jack Della Maddalena (18-2 MMA, 8-0 UFC) at the end of the year.Poirier (30-9 MMA, 22-8 UFC) was submitted by Makhachev at UFC 302 last June. A heavy handed and technical boxer like Della Maddalena, \"The Diamond\" explained how the Aussie's approach will impact how the fight goes.\"I think we'll find out in the first or second round how much trouble (Makhachev) has getting (Della Maddalena) down,\" Poirier told MMA Junkie. \"I think if he gets those takedowns, he's going to get the win. If Jack can stop those takedowns – he does have good takedown defense - I think the boxing and the size could wear on Islam and give him some problems. But Islam's striking is awkward and different. You have to worry so much about the takedown.\"You can't plant your feet and throw off those number combinations and really rip and sit on your punches because he's going to change levels, so it changes the way you fight. For me, it did. I'm speaking from experience. We'll see how Jack approaches and how Jack executes out there, but if you're worried about takedowns, your shots are different. You're not sitting on everything and standing in front of the guy, you're trying to move and be light on your feet. I think the first two rounds will tell us how the fight is going to go.\"Della Maddalena was able to fend off Belal Muhammad's grappling and outstrike him en route to a unanimous decision win to claim the welterweight title at UFC 315.
