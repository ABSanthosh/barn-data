When his young batting partner departed for 55, the Lancashire all-rounder took full control.Soon after reaching his half-century, he hit three consecutive sixes off Gudakesh Motie.Livingstone only need 17 balls more to complete his century, with Curran fitting nicely into his slipstream with a run-a-ball 52.After Curran departed in the 46th over, the 31-year-old hit debutant Shamar Joseph for three sixes and a four in the following over to ease any nerves in a young side which had lost 12 of their previous 18 matches in this format.Hope's dazzling century not enoughImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Captain Hope's 117 had guided West Indies to a healthy total of 328It was a masterful captain's innings from Hope that put the Windies in a commanding position at the halfway stage, despite losing the toss.Coming in after John Turner sent back the West Indies openers, the Barbadian oversaw a rebuilding job with Carty which swung the momentum firmly back in the host's favour.Despite a wicket offering movement for the bowlers and a slow outfield, Hope made a blistering start, hitting Turner and Adil Rashid for sixes early on before exercising restraint to keep the scoreboard ticking.While Carty was dropped twice, Hope offered just one chance for England on 60 when he nicked Bethell, only for wicketkeeper Salt to drop it.After the early fireworks, he next took the aerial route in the 23rd over to bring up his half-century from 66 balls and his team's 100, sending Bethell over the mid-wicket boundary.The 30-year-old targeted the England spinners and brought up his 17th ODI ton in 118 balls while Rutherford added a rapid 54 from 36 balls to build on his captain's innings.But Livingstone eclipsed Hope's effort to lead England to a victory that sets up an intriguing decider.'Getting back to my best' - what they saidEngland captain and player of the match Liam Livingstone: \"I feel like I am getting back to my best, maturing, knowing my game and enjoying my cricket. If I'm doing that, I know I'm playing pretty well.\"I tried to get myself going, then knew we could wait until the end and target their death bowling. Sam Curran played beautifully. He hit his second ball for six and he was off and away. I've played a lot of cricket with him, I know I can trust him at that end.\"West Indies captain Shai Hope: \"I thought it was a decent score with the conditions, but obviously it wasn't in this case.\"\"We need to be more disciplined. In that first game, we showed when we hit our straps, things happen. We didn't execute well. We gave them a lot of easy options to score and when you play cricket like this, guys will capitalise.\"",
