  "text": "Six wins out of six, top of the league, and \"one of the world's best keepers\" returning to the starting XI - are Liverpool favourites to win the Champions League?Arne Slot's side have made a dream start in Europe this season and, winning at Girona on Tuesday night, have all but skipped the play-off round and secured a spot in the Champions League last 16.Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand thinks Liverpool have \"ridiculous\" momentum and \"form-wise have to be\" frontrunners.Speaking to TNT Sports, Ferdinand said the Reds \"have all the make-up to be very successful\" but did warn things can be \"very different come April\".He said: \"Form-wise they have to be the favourites at the moment but the trophy isn't handed out now.\"They have been perfect so far.\"Liverpool are leading the Champions League table after six games and are four points clear at the top of the Premier League with a game in hand.It was not supposed to be this easy.In September, before the first match of the league phase, Opta gave Liverpool a 4.6% chance of winning the Champions League.Six teams were given a higher percentage, including Manchester City (24.9%) and Arsenal (6.3%).But Liverpool have since gone on a phenomenal run in the competition. Slot, tasked with replacing legendary Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp, looks right at home at Anfield.Indeed, the Dutchman is the only manager to win all of his first six Champions League matches with an English club. The former Feyenoord manager has masterminded:AC Milan 1-3 LiverpoolLiverpool 2-0 BolognaRB Leipzig 0-1 LiverpoolLiverpool 4-0 Bayer LeverkusenLiverpool 2-0 Real MadridGirona 0-1 LiverpoolUnderstandably, the percentages have since changed.Before this week's round of fixtures, the Reds' chances of winning the tournament had shot up to 20.7%,, external making them favourites. Opta also gave them a 51.3% chance of making it to the semi-finals.On Tuesday, Liverpool were boosted return of Alisson, who Slot called \"the best goalkeeper in the world\" after the game.The Brazilian, who made five saves in the first half to help extend the club's run without conceding for close to nine hours, had not played since pulling his hamstring in a win at Crystal Palace on 5 October.Slot said: \"We have an incredible goalkeeper. I said as a joke, maybe the players wanted to see how fit he was to give him so much work.\"If you ask me about all the six games, I'm really pleased with all the results.\"I'm really pleased with the five games, the way we played. I am far from pleased about the performance tonight.\"Stand-in stopper Caoimhin Kelleher largely impressed when he deputised, though was at fault for Newcastle's late equaliser in a 3-3 draw last Wednesday.Liverpool can also rely on forward Mohamed Salah who is propelling the Reds to victories this season.He has the joint-most goals and assists in Europe's top five leagues this season (level with Eintracht Frankfurt's Omar Marmoush with 28).The 32-year-old, whose contract expires this summer, is currently red-hot in front of goal and became the 11th player to score 50 Champions League goals - including the four he scored in qualifiers.After scoring a penalty against Girona on Tuesday, the Egypt forward has 16 goals in 22 games in all competitions, and seven in his past six.So, with a firing forward, a returning rock at the back, and a manager making a fairytale start - are Liverpool your Champions League favourites?",
