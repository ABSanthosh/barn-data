(AP Photo/Jayne-Kamin-Oncea)UCLA head coach Mick Cronin was ejected from Friday's game against Maryland after passionately arguing with officials. The often-fiery coach was given a technical foul late in the second half of the loss, and was quickly sent off.With a little over five minutes left in the game, UCLA forward William Kyle III made contact with multiple Maryland players, losing the ball and falling, but the officials deemed that it was not a foul. Cronin was outraged after at the no-call, entering the court to yell at the nearest official. Cronin then got in the referee's face and followed him down the sideline, furiously waving his arms.After the official gave him a technical, Cronin tossed one more jab at the official before walking straight to the locker room. The Bruins went on to lose 79-61, unable to overcome the Terrapins' lead.With the loss at unranked Maryland, UCLA has now lost three straight games — all three of them upsets. The Bruins fell to No. 24 Michigan on Tuesday and unranked Nebraska on Saturday.",
