How it looks, and we need to understand how to cool the players down, to drink. What our options are.\"Let's see because it is after the season, so it will be very similar. The actual experience is for the players, but I have done pre-season there in Orlando and I will be very surprised if we do not suffer. Suffering is one of the headlines for this World Cup.\"There have been warnings that the temperatures at 14 of the 16 stadiums being used for the 2026 World Cup could exceed 'potentially dangerous levels' during the tournament.
