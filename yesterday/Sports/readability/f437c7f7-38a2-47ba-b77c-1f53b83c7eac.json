And the Cleveland Browns acquired Kenny Pickett from the Philadelphia Eagles for Dorian Thompson-Robinson and a fifth-round pick.Pass rusher Josh Sweat is reportedly headed to Arizona on a four-year, $76.4 million deal, and eight of Schwab's top 10 in the free agent rankings are off the board already.And in a blockbuster move that should make QB Jayden Daniels happy, the Commanders acquired left tackle Laremy Tunsil from the Texans in exchange for several draft picks.Earlier in the day, Tampa Bay opened the negotiation period with a bang, reportedly agreeing to re-sign wide receiver Chris Godwin to a three-year, $66 million deal and adding pass rusher Haason Reddick on a one-year, $14 million deal.Defensive tackle Milton Williams, who's No. 2 on Schwab's top 25 list, is reportedly headed to the New England Patriots after helping the Philadelphia Eagles and their dominant defense win the Super Bowl.Also from Monday:Talanoa Hufanga, Broncos reportedly agree to three-year, $45 million dealJimmy Garoppolo is reportedly staying with the Los Angeles Rams on a one-year dealThe Panthers made Jaycee Horn the new highest-paid defensive back in NFL history with a four-year, $100 million extensionThe Chargers are bringing Khalil Mack back on a one-year, $18 million dealStay updated with all the latest news and analysis right here.NFL free agency cheat sheets and analysisTop 25 overall players on the marketFree agent positional rankingsHow does Sam Darnold fit with Seahawks from fantasy standpoint?Patriots spending big to start free agencyEagles losing key defensive piecesBears dominating offseason once again, this time through trenchesFranchise tag deadline winners and losersListen: Defensive free agency previewLive163 updatesThe Seattle Seahawks have their new quarterback. After trading Geno Smith to the Raiders, the Seahawks have agreed to a 3-year contract with former Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold valued at $100.5M with $55 million guaranteed, NFL Network reports.A former first-round pick of the Jets who flamed out in New York, Darnold revived his career in Minnesota with a career campaign last season that resulted in his first Pro Bowl berth. Darnold led the Vikings to a 14-3 record, but raised concerns with poor performances in Minnesota's season finale loss to the Lions and a wild-card loss to the Rams.The Vikings ultimately let Darnold walk and will presumably move forward with second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who missed his rookie season with a knee injury. The Seahawks, meanwhile, will retool around Darnold.Sam Darnold is joining the Seahawks.
