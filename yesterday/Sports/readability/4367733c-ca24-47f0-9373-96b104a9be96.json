  "text": "Image source, Getty ImagesTottenham's euphoric players stepped off the plane the day after the night before and ventured straight into central London.The squad, according to well-placed sources, ended up in trendy London nightspot Mistress of Mayfair to mark the club's Europa League final victory over Manchester United in Bilbao.Once there, the players frantically waved white table handkerchiefs above their heads to a live rendition of Freed From Desire expertly played by the in-house saxophonist.Their manager, Ange Postecoglou, was elsewhere - having a separate celebration in the capital.Outwardly, the head coach's relationship with his squad appeared to be one of the strongest reasons to keep the 59-year-old.Away from the glare of the cameras, however, there were cracks in that togetherness.Now, just 16 days after victory in Bilbao, Postecoglou has been sacked after his customary second-season success.Here we look at some of the key reasons - from a breakdown in relationships, to concern over injuries, tactics and signings - before assessing who might be next.Media caption, Postecoglou's final BBC interview on Match of the Day after defeat by BrightonPostecoglou 'loyal but increasingly distant'Public backing from a host of players - including key figures Cristian Romero and James Maddison - and the squad's determination to include Postecoglou in their on-pitch celebrations in Bilbao appeared to be an indication of deep connections.But it had not gone unnoticed that Postecoglou had become increasingly distant from the squad in recent months.At the start of his reign, the Australian would regularly have breakfast - certainly at away games - with the rest of his team.Recently, however, his obligatory ham and cheese toastie had been delivered to his room by a member of staff.On those away trips, it had been known for him not to be visible around the team hotel until noon.As a result, some players started taking issues they'd usually approach Postecoglou with to other members of the backroom team.That isn't to say the players didn't like Postecoglou. They did.They found him a refreshing change from the insular and sulky demeanour of Antonio Conte.The public messages of support for Postecoglou since the final provides evidence that their remains a bond between the group and their manager.While Postecoglou may have maintained a divide between himself and his players in recent months, his loyalty to his staff cannot be questioned.Indeed, it was said the biggest concern Postecoglou had about losing his job was his staff. He had been at pains to make sure they would be looked after.Tension over failure to land key targetThe story of Tottenham's campaign started with the visit of one of European football's emerging 'Golden Boys'.It is a little-known fact that Spurs' preparations for the 2024-25 campaign started with a visit from Desire Doue.The talented attacker, then playing for Rennes, was so intrigued by Postecoglou's project he made an undercover visit to the club's training ground in Enfield amid optimism a deal could be done.Fast forward nine months and Doue, who in the interim had signed for Paris St-Germain, was the star of the Champions League final.In retrospect, Spurs' failure to lure him was a sign of what was to come - a series of blows during a truly forgettable domestic season.It's important to stress their inability to land Doue, 20, wasn't for the want of trying - but while his reputation has soared, Tottenham and Postecoglou were left in despair all too often.Media caption, 'I told them and they laughed' - Postecoglou at Tottenham's Europa League victory parade'Blame game' over club's injury recordSpeak to those behind the scenes at Tottenham and they will explain injuries have been the most pertinent factor behind their recent issues.Romero, Son Heung-min, Dominic Solanke, Dejan Kulusevski, Micky van de Ven, Richarlison and Guglielmo Vicario are among the players to have spent extended spells on the sidelines this season - many with muscular issues.Maddison, Kulusevski and Lucas Bergvall were all unavailable in Bilbao while Son started on the bench because he was deemed unfit having only recently returned from injury.Multiple sources have told BBC Sport the club's injury record has been at the centre of some friction between members of the coaching team and medical and strength and conditioning staff over the course of the season.\"It's been the blame game,\" one well-placed source said.Richarlison's injury-disrupted campaign has been a real bone of contention, according to sources, particularly in the aftermath of the 4-0 Carabao Cup defeat by Liverpool in February when, having only recently returned from hamstring and groin problems, the Brazil international injured a calf.There have been other examples this season when Postecoglou's team and the medical and fitness department have not seen eye to eye.Over-reliance on Ange-ball?Much has been made of Postecoglou's attacking approach or, more pertinently, the accusation he was unwilling to adapt.\"It's just who we are, mate,\" he famously said when questioned about his tactics earlier this season.Some continue to call his apparent refusal to ditch his philosophy commendable. Others believe his stubbornness was the root of Tottenham's difficulties.Certain members of the team felt during the first half of the season they were too open, and Postecoglou should have considered making defensive tweaks. The Australian's apparent reluctance to adapt led to a degree of internal frustration.Letting a two-goal lead slip in the 3-2 loss at Brighton raised eyebrows, and there was similar angst in the 4-3 loss to Chelsea in December after Spurs raced 2-0 ahead inside 12 minutes.Intriguingly, well-placed sources insist Postecoglou did tweak his defensive approach in both games.Postecoglou was also widely praised for the way he set up his team sturdily in the Europa League quarter-final second-leg win over Eintracht Frankfurt.Spurs were particularly robust in the comprehensive semi-final victory over Bodo/Glimt, too, then kept another clean sheet in Bilbao to finish the job.League the bottom line for LevySpeaking in the aftermath of the Europa League final victory, Postecoglou made clear his hope he would stay in charge.It seemed perfectly reasonable, with a trophy and Champions League qualification not generally leading to the sacking of a manager.Unfortunately for Postecoglou, Daniel Levy simply wasn't for turning - the Tottenham chairman sticking with 'Plan A' to dispense with the Australian.The euphoria and affection directed towards Postecoglou from players and supporters may have run some interference, but not enough to change the direction of travel.Had Spurs lost to United, it is widely acknowledged Postecoglou would have been relieved of his duties before now.Victory added some emotion into the equation - but clearly not enough for Levy to have a change of heart.The delay in making the decision is the result of various factors. Most pertinently, Postecoglou, Levy and chief football officer Scott Munn - whose job is also under threat - were away last week.But sources have also claimed Levy wanted to put time between the emotional outpouring that came after the final and making his decision.At the heart of his thinking was Tottenham's 17th-place finish in the Premier League after 22 losses in 38 matches. In the end, he could not look past it.In fact in the statement announcing his sacking, Spurs pointed out - with eye-opening precision - the team had taken 78 points from their past 66 games.Football Daily Postecoglou sacked by SpursWho is next for Spurs?Attention will now turn to who replaces Postecoglou.Multiple sources have told BBC Sport there is an interest in Brentford head coach Thomas Frank.Frank has a good relationship with Spurs technical director Johan Lange, which could be a deciding factor when Levy comes to decide who he appoints.It is understood consideration was given to the prospect of making an unlikely move for Eddie Howe, but Newcastle's qualification for the Champions League would, you imagine, nip that in the bud.A return for Mauricio Pochettino would have significant support from fans but is a move that comes with a number of obstacles. Pochettino is managing the United States, who will co-host next year's World Cup, and it would take a compensation package described to BBC Sport as one of the \"biggest in football history\" to release him.Bournemouth's Andoni Iraola, Fulham's Marco Silva, recently appointed Al-Hilal boss Simone Inzaghi and Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner are among the others to have been considered.So just a fortnight after Spurs were partying, all eyes are now on what present Levy delivers for the club.Premier LeagueTottenham HotspurFootballMore on this story",
