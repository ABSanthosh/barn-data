The Tonga international was perhaps fortunate to avoid a red as Hassell-Collins was already bringing down the Quins centre when the contact was made.Luke Northmore's drive over the line from the resulting scrum gave Harlequins the slenderest of leads at half-time and they were unable to take further advantage of the extra man after the restart.Freddie Steward's try either side of two Marcus Smith penalties levelled the encounter at 27-27 to set up a grandstand finish.Murley's second try of the match was dramatically cancelled out by Cole's score with just two minutes left and Pollard's calm conversion settled the outcome as a stalemate.Harlequins head coach Danny Wilson told BBC Radio London:\"Overall, we're looking more like us. Our attacking game tonight was way more like Harlequins, we scored some really good tries.\"Frustrating with the opportunities we gave them but credit to Handre Pollard, it's an unbelievable kick.\"I'm pleased we've come away with three points but I suppose I'm disappointed as I think it should have been five points.\"It made for a great game of rugby. Huge credit for selling out this place.\"We put on a show that the did the occasion justice.\"Leicester Tigers head coach Michael Cheika speaking to BBC Radio Leicester:\"It was a great crowd and a great occasion. I would have liked us to have been a bit more ruthless within the occasion.\"We took home some points which I think are important given the nature of the tale. We move on to next week.\"We hadn't looked like making a break from long range all game. We didn't nail our opportunities really well in short range.\"I felt like we just got through that game on fight.\"The biggest thing about this game was the mentality. We had a poor performance last week [54-24 defeat against Bristol Bears] around physicality of the game and I still feel we can be more physical.\"I thought we hung in the game really well even though things went against us.\"Harlequins: David; Isgro, Beard, Northmore, Murley; Smith, Care; Baxter, Walker, Lamositele, Herbst, Lamb, Chisholm, Kenningham, DombrandtReplacements: Riley, Jones, Lewis, Launchbury, Cunningham-South, W Evans, Porter, J EvansLeicester: Steward; Brown, Kelly, Kata, Hassell-Collins; Pollard, Van Poortvliet; Smith, Montoya, Heyes, Henderson, Martin, Liebenberg, Reffell, CracknellReplacements: Clare, Whitcombe, Cole, Holloway, Ilione, Youngs, Shillcock, WoodwardSin-bin: Kata [37]Referee: Matthew Carley",
