(0:36)Tim MacMahonFeb 8, 2025, 05:18 PM ETCloseJoined ESPNDallas.com in September 2009Covers the Dallas Cowboys and Dallas MavericksAppears regularly on ESPN Dallas 103.3 FMDALLAS -- Anthony Davis' dominant debut for the Dallas Mavericks was cut short when he suffered what the team called a \"lower-body injury.\"The Mavericks announced Davis as doubtful to return with less than five minutes left in the fourth quarter, but the star big man never came back onto the court after leaving late in the third. Dallas was still able to hold on for a 116-105 win over the Rockets.Davis, the headliner of Dallas' return in the Luka Doncic trade that prompted a large pregame protest outside of the American Airlines Center on Saturday, exited with 1:37 remaining in the third quarter and headed to the locker room while clutching his midsection.He had 26 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists and 3 blocks in 31 minutes before exiting. Davis had missed the previous five games -- his final three with the Los Angeles Lakers and first two with the Mavs -- due to an abdominal injury.Davis was injured while attempting to contest Alperen Sengun's driving dunk as a help defender. Davis went down in the paint while holding his midsection.Davis described the ailment as tightness in the area between his groin and quadriceps and did not anticipate an extended absence.\"Just the leg got tight, like a little spasm,\" Davis said postgame from his locker, which is the stall previously occupied by Doncic. \"Just came back and tried to get it loose and everything. Obviously, dealing with the ab strain still, so just tried to get it loose. It wouldn't really loosen up and let go, but it's nothing serious. I'm fine.\"Mavs general manager Nico Harrison's decision to trade 25-year-old face of the franchise Doncic, who led the league in scoring last season before leading Dallas to the NBA Finals, resulted in outrage among the fan base.The pregame protest was attended by approximately 1,000 people, many of whom held signs and participated in chants that were critical of Harrison.Harrison, who sources said has received multiple death threats since the trade, did not sit in his normal seat in the arena's lower bowl.Davis had the arena rocking from the opening possession -- when he threw a lob to center Daniel Gafford -- until his early exit.After a putback dunk with 7:34 remaining in the first quarter -- Davis' fourth bucket in the first four-plus minutes -- he prompted roars from the crowd by waving his arms at the stands when the Rockets called timeout.\"I'm here,\" Davis shouted as he pointed at the American Airlines Center court.Davis, 31, a 10-time All-Star selection, has had durability issues for much of his career. He played a career-high 76 games last season.",
