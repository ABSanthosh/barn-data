(0:49)Associated PressNov 2, 2024, 07:51 PM ETJACKSONVILLE, Fla. -- Carson Beck threw for 309 yards and two touchdowns to offset three interceptions, and No. 2 Georgia escaped \"The World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party\" with a 34-20 victory over Florida on Saturday.The Bulldogs (7-1, 5-1 Southeastern Conference) won their fourth straight in the series, their longest streak since winning six in a row between 1978 and 1983. They took advantage of Florida's quarterback woes and a special teams error in this one.Standout freshman DJ Lagway left the game on a cart in the second quarter with a left hamstring injury and with the Gators (4-4, 2-3) leading 10-3. Without him, it was mostly ugly.Walk-on Aidan Warner was 7-of-22 for 66 yards with an interception. Warner was thrust onto the field because Florida starter Graham Mertz tore a ligament in his left knee at Tennessee last month and is out for the season.The Gators kept the game close thanks to a stingy defense that forced Beck into more mistakes. Jack Pyburn, Aaron Gates and Devin Moore had picks that led to a combined 10 points for Florida.But the most significant turnover belonged to the Gators. Punter Jeremy Crawshaw failed to handle Rocco Underwood's low snap on a 51-yard field goal attempt late in the third. It resulted in a 31-yard loss, setting up Beck's first TD pass.The Gators tied the score on Ja'Kobi Jackson's 15-yard TD run. But Beck and the Bulldogs answered with a 75-yard drive, highlighted by Beck's completions of 34 and 21 yards, and capped by his 10-yard TD pass to Dominic Lovett.Warner threw an interception on the ensuing play, and Georgia scored two plays later to ice it.",
