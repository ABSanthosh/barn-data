  "text": "'Duckett would've infuriated me as a bowler - he's one of world's best'Media caption, England chase down 371 to seal staggering win over IndiaNothing will ever come close to the tension and drama of Ben Stokes' epic Headingley miracle in the Ashes in 2019.But, in terms of a pure run chase, England's pursuit of 371 to win the first Test against India on the same ground is right up there with the very best I have seen.Special things happen here.The most memorable are Stokes' win and the famous 1981 Ashes comeback victory, inspired by Ian Botham and Bob Willis' iconic performances.Another special performance came from Mark Butcher, who led England to victory with a fourth-innings century against Australia in 2001, just like Ben Duckett did against India on Tuesday.Butcher batted like a god that day.I had dinner with him this week and he told me how he never played like it ever again. It was a once in a lifetime innings.What I admired about Duckett, in contrast, is he just batted like Duckett and made 149 - the second-highest score by an England opener in the fourth innings.Many of the other great fourth-innings centuries are defensive in their nature because they are attempts to save the game.Duckett's was in his attacking style but perfectly controlled.The 30-year-old's gift is that he cashes in on being so short - his size messing with bowlers' lengths - and plays those cuts, pulls and sweeps. The reverse-sweep for six off Ravindra Jadeja was simply extraordinary.I would have found Duckett infuriating to bowl at. He leaves the ball so rarely outside off stump and as a bowler you think he is going to nick one behind eventually but, somehow, he does not.It would drive me up the wall.Media caption, 'Wow!' - sublime Duckett innings puts England on course for victoryPeople are starting to talk about him being one of the very best batters currently playing all formats in the world and it is hard to disagree.It helps him that he plays a Test innings much the same as he plays in a T20, albeit with a few more expansive shots in the shortest format, which allows him to switch between formats more easily.His success is made even more pleasing given the difficult start he had in Test cricket.A number of people whose opinion I respect greatly told me not to give up on Duckett, after he looked out of his depth in those four Tests in India and Bangladesh in 2016.Duckett had an average of 15.71 but they told me to keep the faith.Having benefited from the fresh start of swapping counties and been given the chance by Stokes and Brendon McCullum back in 2022, he is now one of the crucial players in England's XI and is one you would love to have in your team.Duckett is always up for the fight, does not take a backwards step and stands there with his chest puffed out.This innings is only further proof he has become a very fine batsman.Media caption, Crawley brings-up half century as England run chase rolls onIn reviewing this brilliant win we must also give a lot of credit to Zak Crawley, who more than played his part in the opening stand of 188 with Duckett that laid the platform for England to complete their chase - their second-highest in Test history.I rate their partnership so highly because of the control they showed.A lot has been spoken about the refined version of England's attacking approach. This was it in perfect form.Yes India's attack is lacking apart from the exceptional Jasprit Bumrah, but rather than being reckless as they were in the horrible defeats in Rawalpindi and Hamilton in the winter, Crawley and Duckett batted with control.Do not overlook the immense pressure that comes when walking out with such a target.We have been shouting for England to show some common sense and they did it in the modern sense.They batted at four or five runs per over but at no point did it feel like a wild assault. They knocked the ball around while always looking to put the bad balls away.This should be their template going forward.Media caption, 'He's splattered the stumps!' - Tongue takes three wickets in four ballsJosh Tongue must also be given praise after he twice blew away India's tail to finish with seven wickets in the match. India should have buried England and scored 600 in the first innings from their position of 430-3.That Tongue twice quickly wrapped up the innings is a big plus for England, given how they have struggled to do so under Stokes, and now should make their next decision easier.There has been a lot of talk about Jofra Archer returning for the second Test but I hope that is put to bed now England are moving onto Edgbaston next week with a win.After all of the heartache, the careful planning and the patience from both sides, there is no logic in rushing Archer back after one first-class match.You can bowl as many overs in the nets as you like, play as many T20s as you want, but until you have spent a day in the field, bowled spell after spell and backed it up again, you will never be prepared for Test cricket.Sussex have another County Championship match starting on Sunday.Let Archer play in that and then he will be ready for the third Test at Lord's, if England want to make the change.They deserve so much credit for this win at Headingley, one of their best in recent memory. Do not do something silly now.Jonathan Agnew was speaking to BBC Sport's Matthew Henry at Headingley.",
