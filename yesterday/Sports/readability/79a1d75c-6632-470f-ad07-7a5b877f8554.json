  "text": "Former Scotland, Manchester United and Manchester City striker Denis Law - the only Scottish player to have won the Ballon d'Or - has died at the age of 84.The man dubbed 'The King' and 'The Lawman' spent 11 years at Old Trafford, his 237 goals in 404 appearances placing him third in United's history behind Wayne Rooney and Bobby Charlton.Born in Aberdeen, Law began his career with Huddersfield Town, also had a spell in Italy with Torino and was capped 55 times for his country - his 30 goals making him Scotland's joint top scorer of all time.He was sold for a British record fee three times during his career.In 2021, he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.A family statement said: \"It is with a heavy heart that we tell you our father Denis Law has sadly passed away. He fought a tough battle but finally he is now at peace.\"We would like to thank everyone who contributed to his wellbeing and care, past and much more recently.\"We know how much people supported and loved him and that love was always appreciated and made the difference. Thank you.\"Manchester United said everyone at the club is mourning the loss of \"the King of the Stretford End\".They added: \"He will always be celebrated as one of the club's greatest and most beloved players.\"The ultimate goalscorer, his flair, spirit and love for the game made him the hero of a generation.\"Our deepest condolences go out to Denis' family and many friends. His memory will live on forever more.\"The Scotland national team called Law \"a true great\", adding: \"We will not see his likes again.\"Law was 15 when he signed for Huddersfield, and was transferred to Manchester City four years later, in 1960, for £55,000.A year later, he joined Torino for £110,000, but he found it difficult to settle in Italy and moved to Manchester United for £115,000 in 1962, before ending his career with City in 1974.Law was part of the United team that became the first from England to lift the European Cup in 1968, although he missed the final - a 4-1 victory over Benfica - through injury, watching it from a hospital bed.He also won one FA Cup and two English league title medals with United, as well as helping Scotland win the British Home Championship six times.His 11 goals in seven Scotland appearances during 1963 - as well as scoring for a Rest of the World side against England at Wembley - went some way to helping him receive the 1964 Ballon d'Or, which at the time was the prize awarded to the best footballer in Europe.After retiring from football, Law became a television pundit, patron of UK-based charity Football Aid, and established the Denis Law Legacy Trust, which operates programmes and activities focused around community engagement and widening sporting participation.He was appointed CBE in 2016 for services to football and charity, received honorary degrees from Aberdeen, St Andrews and Robert Gordon universities, has had statues erected in his honour at Old Trafford and Aberdeen, and received the Freedom of the City of Aberdeen.Manchester City said everyone in the city is mourning Law, adding: \"Our thoughts are with Denis' family and friends at this difficult time.\"Former Scotland and Manchester United forward Joe Jordan told BBC Radio 5 Live that Law was a \"proper icon\".He said: \"Denis was a special player and to lose someone like him will affect an awful lot of Manchester United fans.\"A proper icon for his ability on the field to score goals but he had a special edge to him, not just as a player but as a person.\"Denis Law is one of the greatest players to ever play for Scotland.\"Huddersfield Town said they are \"profoundly saddened\" by Law's death.The Terriers added: \"A legend of not only our great club, but an immortal of the sport as a whole, he will be deeply missed and his memory cherished by us all.\"Torino called Law an \"iconic figure\" in their history.Former Manchester United captain Gary Neville posted on Instagram: \"Rest in Peace Denis. A great footballer and a great man. It's a privilege and an honour to have spent time in your company.\"Aberdeen, who Law supported, said: \"One of Scotland's greatest ever players, his legacy will live on in the north east.\"\"Denis was more than just a fantastic footballer, he was a fantastic man,\" said former Manchester United midfielder Bryan Robson in a Daily Mail column., external\"He would always be in my greatest ever Manchester United XI. He was a player so many of his peers idolised and with good reason, that iconic image of him with his sleeves pulled down and the one arm salute after scoring.\"Alzheimer's Society chief executive Kate Lee said: \"We'll be forever grateful that Denis and his family raised not only money for Alzheimer's Society but a great deal of awareness too.\"",
