In his two playoff games, he averaged 24 points and seven assists on 51% shooting (41% from 3).Mobley and Hunter were injured during the fourth quarter of Game 1 on separate plays in which Atkinson said he thought the contact was excessive. Neither play was whistled for a foul.Mobley, the reigning Defensive Player of the Year, sprained his left ankle after landing on Pacers center Myles Turner after a jump shot. Hunter sprained his right thumb after having a layup attempt blocked by Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin.All three players had been listed as questionable entering Friday's game, but they also participated in shootaround earlier in the day, a step forward after not taking the court before Game 2 on Tuesday.With all three players sidelined in Game 2, the Cavs blew a 20-point first-half lead, including seven points in the final 50 seconds, to fall into a 2-0 series deficit entering Friday.",
