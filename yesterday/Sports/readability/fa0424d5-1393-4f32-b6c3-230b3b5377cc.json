Enter two of the league's best teams for a massive new chapter in their rivalry, as the little brother in this series over the past several decades looks to be the first NFC team to punch its ticket to extended January football.The 11-1 Detroit Lions can earn a playoff berth Thursday night at home against the 9-3 Green Bay Packers, who are well positioned to become a playoff team in their own right in the coming weeks. These two were last seen on the same field in Week 9 in Green Bay — a 24-14 Lions win. Jared Goff was very efficient that day, going 18-for-22 for 145 yards and a touchdown pass. Green Bay's offense gained more than 400 yards in that game, but went just 3-for-12 on third downs and committed 10 penalties in the loss.That victory was win No. 6 on Detroit's current 10-game winning streak, which is tied for the longest in franchise history. Back in 1934, the Lions also won 10 straight games before the streak ended at home ... in a loss to the Green Bay Packers.Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Ford Field | DetroitStreaming: Amazon Prime VideoLive4 updatesThu, December 5, 2024 at 4:56 PM PSTLions wearing Brian Branch t-shirts during warm-upsWhen the Packers and Lions last played in Week 9, Detroit safety Brian Branch was ejected for a head-to-head hit and endeared himself to Green Bay and NFL fans by giving the double-bird to fans as he left the game.Branch's teammates appear to be using that as motivation going into this Week 14 matchup, putting the infamous image of that gesture on t-shirts.Thu, December 5, 2024 at 4:43 PM PSTAidan Hutchinson has ditched his crutches, now running in a poolThe Lions have 13 defensive players on injured reserve, which is why they've added players like David Long, Kwon Alexander and Jamal Adams in recent weeks.
