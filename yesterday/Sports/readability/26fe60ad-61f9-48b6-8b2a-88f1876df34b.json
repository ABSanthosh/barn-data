  "text": "'Scots did not show best but can raise bar in Finland'Image source, SNSImage caption, Scotland's Sophie Howard kept a close watch on Finland captain Linda SallstromScotland did not show the best version of themselves in their Euro 2025 play-off goalless draw with Finland, but defender Sophie Howard is \"very confident\" they can raise their level in Tuesday's decisive second leg.Finland had the better of a cagey encounter at Easter Road in Edinburgh but neither side could find a way through. It means the meeting in Helsinki will now be a winner-takes-all match as Scotland look to reach a first major finals since the 2019 World Cup. \"No team wants to show everything they have, so it was a bit hesitant,\" Leicester City centre-back Howard told BBC Sport Scotland. \"We are fully aware this was not the best Scotland that we can produce. \"But I'm very confident we can raise the bar and we're fully prepared and committed to do that on Tuesday.\"Related internet linksWhile Howard excelled in defence, goalkeeper Eartha Cumings made a superb first-half save to keep out Linda Sallstrom's lob as well as dealing well with other Finnish attempts.The Rosengard keeper focused on the importance of not conceding, and insisted the tie remains in the balance. \"Tonight wasn't a bad result,\" she told BBC Sport Scotland. \"They're a really good side. \"If anything it's probably positive because we've just got to go away from home and play our best and not really masses of pressure on us. We just need to go and win.\"Amid a blunt attacking display from the Scots, lone forward Martha Thomas was withdrawn in the second half, with young midfielder Emma Watson taking over in attack.However, head coach Pedro Martinez Losa explained Thomas had been unwell and hadn't trained for the past three days. \"It was agreed that as soon as she lost energy, we would have another plan,\" he said.'Scots looked nervous' - what the pundits saidEmma Black, capped 42 times by Scotland, was on punditry duty for BBC Radio Scotland at Easter Road and felt \"deflated\" after the 0-0 draw.\"We're at home, we should take the game to Finland, we're going into this game as favourites and we just looked a shadow of ourselves,\" she said.\"We looked very nervous. We dropped deep and allowed them to have possession. \"We're lacking cover on the bench. My worry is where are we going to get goals from?\"Fellow Sportsound pundit and Scotland midfielder Rachael Boyle, capped 43 times, added: \"You expect more. Finland's gameplan worked really, really well.\"It's almost like we've got an imbalance on the bench. We've got a lot of midfielders but not a lot of attackers.\"We've got Scottish players scoring in the SWPL week in, week out. You need to start bleeding these players in because they are what's going to come next.\"What do you think?Scotland fans, what did you make of Friday's match? And what are your thoughts on Tuesday's second leg in Helsinki?Let us know, external",
