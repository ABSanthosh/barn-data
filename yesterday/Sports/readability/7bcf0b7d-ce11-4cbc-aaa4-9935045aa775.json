He is averaging career playoff highs of 16.8 points and 7.3 rebounds and has made several clutch plays.The Nuggets are 5-0 this postseason when Gordon scores at least 20 points, and his seven assists in Game 6 are tied for the most in any game of his playoff career.Gordon has hit a pair of game-winning shots this postseason -- a buzzer-beating putback dunk in Game 4 against the LA Clippers and a 3-pointer with three seconds remaining in Game 1 against the Thunder. He also made an overtime-forcing 3 with 28 seconds remaining in regulation of the Nuggets' Game 3 victory over Oklahoma City.Injuries limited Gordon, 29, to only 51 games during the regular season. He missed two extended stretches because of a right calf strain that Gordon is managing.",
