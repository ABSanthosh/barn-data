  "text": "Manchester City striker Erling Haaland will see a specialist after suffering an ankle injury in Sunday's FA Cup win against Bournemouth, with the club expecting him to play again this season.The Norwegian was substituted in the 61st minute after scoring the equaliser as City went on to beat the Cherries 2-1 and reach the semi-finals.The 24-year-old was later seen in a video on social media leaving the Vitality Stadium on crutches and with his left ankle in a protective boot.City said on Monday that they anticipate Haaland \"will be fit to play a further part in the remainder of this season including this summer's Fifa Club World Cup\".The club explained that Haaland, who has scored 30 goals in 40 games this season, had tests on Monday before being referred to a specialist to understand \"the full extent of the injury\".Haaland missed a penalty and two big chances on Sunday, but he turned in Nico O'Reilly's cross to level the game before Omar Marmoush put City ahead as Pep Guardiola's side progressed to the last four.The FA Cup provides City's only remaining chance of silverware this season following a difficult Premier League campaign and early exits from the Champions League and Carabao Cup.Manager Guardiola has had to deal with injuries to key players throughout the campaign. His side sit fifth in the Premier League, one point off Chelsea in the Champions League places.",
