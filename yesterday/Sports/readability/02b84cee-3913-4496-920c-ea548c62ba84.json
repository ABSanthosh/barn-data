We created enough chances to win the game. Then after the break, the game changed -- for me personally, it's not football.\"AdvertisementEarlier, Chelsea had been seemingly poised for victory after Reece James' opportunistic second-half free-kick had left them 1-0 up with four minutes of regulation time remaining.But just as Chelsea began to think about their quarter-final assignment, the arrival of a storm over Charlotte triggered local safety protocols which required the game to be halted.It marked the sixth occasion during the Club World Cup that a game has been disrupted by a weather warning.\"If you are already suspending, six, seven, eight games it probably means there is something that is not working well,\" Maresca said. \"Because in a football game, it's not normal to suspend the game.\"AdvertisementWhen play resumed just under two hours later, a revitalised Benfica grabbed an injury-time equaliser after Chelsea substitute Malo Gusto was adjudged to have handled in the penalty area following an intervention by the Video Assistant Referee.Benfica's Argentine veteran Angel Di Maria stepped up to roll in an ice-cold penalty, sending the game into extra time.An end-to-end first half of extra time saw Benfica, reduced to 10 men following Gianluca Prestianni's second yellow card at the end of regulation, threaten to take the lead as they chased an improbable victory.But instead it was Nkunku who fired Chelsea back in front, the French international bundling in from close range after Moises Caicedo's low shot squirted underneath Benfica goalkeeper Antoliy Trubin.AdvertisementAs the game opened up, Benfica were increasingly vulnerable on the counter-attack and Chelsea pounced.Neto made it 3-1 with a nerveless finish after going clean through on goal in the 114th minute, and three minutes later Dewsbury-Hall completed the rout to send Chelsea through to the last eight.rcw/as",
