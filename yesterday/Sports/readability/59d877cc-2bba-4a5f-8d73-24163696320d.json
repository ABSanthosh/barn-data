  "text": "It seemed like England were on course to start their Women's Nations League campaign in positive fashion against Portugal - but at full-time there was a familiar underwhelming feeling.The Lionesses have won just two of their last six matches and with five months to go until they attempt to defend their title at Euro 2025, they look far from their best.Alessia Russo's opener in the 15th minute capped off a strong start from England and they went on to control the first half. But Portugal substitute Kika Nazareth capitalised on a period of pressure from the hosts to equalise in the second half as England had to settle for a 1-1 draw.Manager Sarina Wiegman insists England are \"moving forwards\" and said she was \"not concerned\" by their disappointing run of form.However, defender Millie Bright admitted there is \"lots to work on\" and this is not the first time England's performance has dipped in the second half. So is there reason to be concerned or is there enough to suggest England are on the right path?Portugal came into the game unbeaten in their last 10 matches - having not tasted defeat since a narrow 1-0 loss by France in December 2023.They sit 18 places lower than England in the Fifa world rankings but they are not to be underestimated.England were missing key players including Georgia Stanway, Alex Greenwood, Beth Mead and Lauren Hemp through injury but that didn't seem to phase them when things initially got going in Portugal.Manchester United midfielder Grace Clinton slotted into Stanway's role and was effective, full-back Lucy Bronze was dangerous on the right-hand side and Russo continued her fine goalscoring form to put England ahead.Wiegman's side looked in complete control, dominating proceedings and moving the ball around nicely.But they failed to capitalise and did not extend their lead - something which ultimately proved costly.\"I think when it's just 1-0 you keep a team in it and the longer it stays 1-0 the more the opposition gets confidence,\" Bright told BBC Radio 5 Live.\"We definitely need to be more ruthless in front of goal and take our chances. We need to create a few more as well.\"That was a message repeated by Wiegman, who called for more ruthlessness and admitted she was frustrated they did not add to their tally.As a result, Portugal responded, using their pace to get in behind England's backline and a tiring midfield.\"In the second half I was scratching my head thinking it's a different team,\" said former England midfielder Karen Carney on ITV.\"The basics went and that's when you get punished. There are lessons to be learnt.\"Bright described it as \"a game of two halves\" but this is nothing new for England.A poor display against Germany in October led to a 4-3 defeat before unconvincing victories over South Africa and Switzerland and a goalless draw with an injury-hit United States.With just five months to go until Euro 2025, should Wiegman be concerned?\"It is not July now. I'm not concerned. I'm just working really hard with the team to get things right and I think we are improving,\" said Wiegman.\"If you look at the results then you might think we are not improving, but if you look at how we play in the first-half performance, we are definitely moving forwards.\"Yes, we want to get results and it's disappointing we didn't win, but as I said, it's February now and not July.\"England's next test will be even tougher as they face world champions and current Nations League holders Spain at Wembley Stadium on Wednesday (20:00 GMT). Wiegman says that is \"another opportunity\" to show their progression and Bright hopes more consistency will help England come the summer.\"We need to be confident, we didn't win the game [against Portugal] but equally we didn't lose,\" added Bright. \"I think you have to draw out the positives from the performance. It's small margins in football. If we make those tweaks, it takes us to another level.\"",
