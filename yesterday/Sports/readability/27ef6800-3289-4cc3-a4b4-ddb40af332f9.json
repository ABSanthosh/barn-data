  "text": "The 2025 NFL scouting combine is officially in the rearview mirror. We spent the week in Indianapolis, learned a lot, and are now taking all that new information and boiling it down into a fresh big board as draft season really kicks into gear.Here's Yahoo Sports NFL Draft expert Nate Tice's latest big board.Past big boards: 1.0 | 2.01. Travis Hunter, CB/WR, ColoradoAs the most dynamic player in the country, Hunter was a game-changer at cornerback and wide receiver in college. Still, I think his best path as a professional is as a full-time defender with some spot duty on offense — a usage resembling his coach/mentor Deion Sanders when he played with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.Hunter can consistently stay sticky to his coverage assignment, showing off the quickness and body control to thrive in man-to-man situations, with the excellent burst to make plays on the football and nullify the receiver. He plays with a high level of intelligence for the position, and will take calculated gambles to fall off his coverage assignment and even bait quarterbacks into potential interception opportunities. Hunter’s ball skills and feel for the position are rare. His athleticism is unlocked by his innate ability to always find — and come down with — the football. Hunter just seems to make a big play in every quarter of the game.The ball skills, quickness and body control all show up when Hunter plays wide receiver, too, but he is more raw at the position, lacking the refinement he shows on the other side of the ball — and, yes, he has rapidly improved this season. He also plays bigger than his listed size (6-foot, 188 pounds) because of his hands and hand-eye coordination, while also being able to create with the ball in his hands. This makes two-way play at the next level a real possibility, even if it’s for a small package of plays.Hunter’s moderate bulk does not come up as a tackler; he’s a physical defender. But it is also a reason why I have some hesitation about Hunter being a full-time player on both sides at the next level (along with the sheer mental load, but that’s something that can come with time). No matter what, Hunter is a helluva football player and whatever team drafts him is getting a game-changing talent.2. Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn StateWhen a Penn State defender now gets the No. 11 jersey, he is inevitably going to get compared to Micah Parsons, which is unfair for any player and such a high bar. Still, Carter is about as close to that Parsons comparison as a player can get.He is a twitchy pass rusher who can bend around corners and somehow stay on his feet despite contorting his body like Gumby. Carter is still adding layers to his usage of hands and how to keep blockers off-balance, but he has the package of length, quick-twitch athleticism, bend, play strength and effort level to give him the upside of an elite ace edge defender with double-digit sack upside in the NFL.He also has prior experience as an off-ball linebacker and interior pass rusher to boot. He still has to work on discipline in the run game, and can rely on knifing inside on his pass rush (which allows QBs to escape the pocket) a bit too much. He also doesn’t have elite bulk, but that’s the trade-off with his ability to move. He plays hard and it’s difficult to find this amount of true pass rushing juice. His medicals are also throwing a wrench in his evaluation, as combine testing revealed a stress fracture in his foot, which must be monitored.Plus, he also does cool things with tape on his facemask.3. Tetairoa McMillan, WR, ArizonaA monster on the outside, McMillan is a smooth athlete with excellent hands and ball skills that give him true X-receiver upside. McMillan consistently creates yards with the ball in his hands because of his strength and balance, and plenty of burst in such a big frame. He is also a good route runner who can consistently sink on his route breaks, with the ability to create separation on the intermediate levels.McMillan was dominant in 2024 when the ball was anywhere in his vicinity and has the makings of a matchup nightmare at the next level. He also already has experience working from the slot, not just vertically but on underneath routes as well, with his ability to get in and out of breaks really shining on these routes.McMillan is a big receiver who most importantly plays big. His volleyball and basketball background constantly show up in his game; he is very comfortable extending for throws away from his frame (which happened often at Arizona) and he doesn’t lose speed when catching the ball on the move because of his confidence in his hands.McMillan lacks elite long speed, but he still has enough speed — and most importantly the frame and ball skills — to win consistently vertically. McMillan brings a lot to the table and can be an instant strong contributor at the next level because of his route-running polish and ball skills. I’m very bullish on McMillan.4. Will Campbell, OT/OG, LSUA smooth technician who seldom gets out of position with his feet or body as a blocker, Campbell already shows off good hand usage and the ability to recover against defensive counters because of his calm and quick footwork.LSU often puts Campbell on an island in drop-back situations that will help his game translate to the next level, and he plays with good eyes and awareness as a run blocker and in protection, often anticipating defensive stunts and quickly adjusting. His funky stance often does his actual athleticism a disservice; Campbell is an excellent athlete (which was backed up in Indianapolis) with the bend to thrust underneath his blocks with ease.Here is Nate Tice's post-combine 2025 NFL Draft big board. (Davis Long/Yahoo Sports)Campbell’s arm length is going to be the topic of discussion among evaluators: He was measured at 32 5/8 inches, just below the common team prerequisite of 33 inches for offensive tackles in the NFL. It hasn’t hindered him so far against longer defenders in college because of his hand placement, technique, athleticism and ability to constantly create leverage on his blocks. That makes me think he can at least have a chance to stay out at tackle in the NFL. He’s an extremely smart player, too, often calling out blitzes and defensive movement on his side of the ball.I think that combination of athleticism and technique allows Campbell to mitigate his arm-length deficiencies and stay at tackle, but even if he kicks inside to guard, he could be a needle-moving player on the interior.5. Armand Membou, OT, MissouriMembou has a unique build for a tackle but still has the length, strength and athleticism to stay out there. He had an excellent testing day at the NFL combine in Indianapolis with 4.91 40 time while reaching a top speed of 20.28 miles per hour — both fastest among all offensive linemen. It’s a particularly absurd top speed to reach at 332 pounds.Membou also backs up the testing numbers on film. He is an easy mover in space and can consistently reach outside defenders on zone runs, an ability that helped unlock a lot of Missouri’s best hitting plays.Membou can absolutely stay out at tackle, and while he played on the right side this year for Missouri, I think he has the movement ability, length and enough polish to kick over to the left side, if needed. Membou could even kick inside at the next level, which is more a compliment to his skill set than something that is necessary. Membou could still work on his technique and hand placement, but those are teachable things that will come with time and are way more acceptable considering Membou’s youth (he doesn’t turn 21 until the end of March).Membou is an ascending prospect with a lot of things that are hard to coach and a lot to like.6. Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise StateA human highlight reel. Jeanty isn’t the tallest (5-foot-8 1/2), but he has a good build (211 pounds) and is a strong runner of the football. Jeanty has excellent speed and burst, but is more than willing to do his work between the tackles — where he shows off his rare contact balance and clean vision for running the football.Jeanty is also excellent at tempoing his runs, slowing to let blocks develop and then accelerating through the hole just as it opens, which show up on Boise State’s gap schemes featuring pulling offensive linemen.Jeanty is explosive, tough, well-rounded (he’s a natural catcher of the football and has a great feel on screens), is a great pass protector and has the size, speed and vision to handle any type of run concept. Jeanty took on a lot of touches this year (his 397 led FBS, and there were some tough touches in there) and running back value is always a discussion, but Jeanty is worth a lottery pick. He can stay on the field and impact the game, in true game-breaking ways, on every single down. That’s valuable.7. Jalon Walker, Edge/LB, GeorgiaOne of my favorite players in the draft. Walker plays both as an off-ball linebacker and an edge defender on the line of scrimmage in Georgia’s rush packages. He plays a little bit of everywhere, so much so he calls himself an “HLB” which stands for \"hybrid linebacker.\"As an off-ball linebacker, Walker is a strong tackler and good athlete who is consistently diagnosing plays quickly. He can run, chase and has no issues taking on and shedding climbing offensive linemen, and has the athleticism to be a plus-player in coverage. He can be a bit slow when having to turn and diagnose, something that would get cleaned up with more time at the spot.Walker is also a talented and productive pass rusher, and shows off his bend, strength and quickness when getting after the QB. Walker plays with his hair on fire and can hang as an off-ball linebacker who can stay on the field for all three downs and be a positive player against the run and pass, with the pass-rush ability being a giant cherry on top.He won’t be an ideal fit for every team, but I think Walker is just a guy I would want in my front seven. His competitive play style is infectious and he has the ability to fill up the box score in different ways, with leadership to boot. He reminds me a lot of Clay Matthews.8. Mason Graham, DT, MichiganThe human hand grenade, Graham is constantly exploding off the ball and creating havoc in the middle of an offense. Graham’s excellent first step, quick hands, balance and strength will get him in the backfield in the blink of an eye, letting him end plays or force them to go off script, right after the snap.Graham lacks ideal arm length (32 inches) and weighed in at 298 pounds at the combine, 20 pounds lower than his listed weight at Michigan. Neither are exactly dealbreakers, considering Graham’s strength and ability to be disruptive, but that lack of length and bulk do show up with his lack of consistency in holding up against double-teams and longer and stronger guards in college.Having said that, Graham was still an explosive play machine for Michigan in 2023 and for flashes in 2024, even though he did battle an injury for most of the season. Graham would be best if he was allowed to fire off the ball in a four-down defense operating primarily as a 3-technique with the ability to move across the defense on passing downs and in different fronts because of his athleticism and how dangerous he is on defensive stunts and twists.9. Will Johnson, CB, MichiganHe has battled injuries in 2024, but Johnson’s talent still shines when he’s on the field. A long player with good size (6-1, 194 pounds, 30 1/8-inch arms), Johnson has the build and athleticism of a prototypical modern NFL cornerback.Johnson uses that size to smother wide receivers. That’s not the only way he can do it. Whether it’s zone or man coverage, Johnson is able to constantly stay in the pocket of wide receivers, even smaller ones, with his excellent combination of quickness, burst and body control.Johnson doesn’t have elite long speed, and his physicality is more “OK” than “good,” but he’s a fluid athlete who doesn’t get put in bad positions because of his ability to turn and run and ability to close on the football. There will be some questions about Johnson’s inconsistent 2024 season and his injury history that teams are figuring out, but he has the upside to be a true No. 1 cornerback at the next level in a variety of schemes.10. Cam Ward, QB, Miami (FL)Cam Ward exudes calmness when you watch him. Whether it’s in his pocket movements or executing in big moments, Ward is more than happy to try and make tough throws or attempt trick shots. He has no qualms continuing it even when punished.Ward has a good frame, a good arm with a quick sidearm delivery that can attack all three levels, and he can create with his legs or off-platform when needed. He can also make the higher-difficulty plays. Ward can get a little too carried away with his heat-check moments and have some throws get away from him, but he has continued to add layers to his game at each stop of his college career and makes everyone around him better.Ward is a good, but not overwhelming athlete, but is an effective scrambler with a good clock in his head for when to tuck the ball and run. Ward measured in under 6-foot-2 at the combine, but his height isn’t a deterrent because of his ability to quickly operate and change arm angles around pass rushers.Ward still has a few things to clean up, and might lack a true overwhelming trait, but he’s young and has already shown the ability to operate (and excel) both in and out of structure — with results, too. Any fan base that drafts him should be rightfully excited because Ward is just a fun player to watch. You gotta love a QB that tries stuff.11. Mykel Williams, Edge, GeorgiaWilliams battled injuries in 2024, but the flashes and tools were still there when he was on the field. His production started to ramp up, too, with those tantalizing traits morphing into sustained impact on the game.Like most recent defensive line and edge prospects from Georgia, it’s all about seeing what Williams does when he is on the field as part of Georgia’s deep rotation up front. After a part-time role at the beginning of his Georgia career, Williams’ package of traits and impact play is instantly apparent now with more extended snaps. In the run game, he is constantly blasting offensive linemen backward with his explosive strength and twitch. When rushing the passer he flashes an in-progress move set with real get-off.Williams has the size, athleticism, technique and competitiveness to be a good pass rusher from the edge for a defense down the road. But his ability to be a plus-run defender right away gives him a high floor to see the field early while he continues to develop his pass-rush arsenal.He has upside as a true impact player against the run in a short amount of time. Williams has the size and versatility to kick inside for snaps to create matchup advantages. He showed that already in college where even dominated guards in the run game. He still has to show more consistency and diversity with his pass-rush moves, but Williams is an impressive player who should keep adding layers to his game with more playing time. He will benefit from more snaps on the outside at the next level when he can pin his ears back and go. Players like DeMarcus Lawrence and Montez Sweat are what Williams can project to at the next level — at least as far as play style — with just that little bit of upside for more as a pass rusher.12. Tyler Warren, TE, Penn StateA modern-day \"Slash\" for the Nittany Lions, Warren lined up all across the formation, even as a quarterback on designed read plays.Warren is a talented athlete who can win against defensive backs when lined up in the slot and is a clean route runner with strong hands. Warren is also a real threat with the ball in his hands, typically making the first defender miss with his play strength and balance. His competitive play style shows up when Warren is a runner and also as a blocker, too.Warren also has upside to align in-line at the next level, as he is a strong player and willing blocker, but did measure in with shorter arms (31 3/4 inches) that could hinder him against bigger and better NFL athletes. The No. 44 jersey, explosive play ability and shorter arms have me thinking of Dallas Clark when I watch Warren.13. Mike Green, Edge, MarshallGreen is a competitive and bendy pass rusher who can get after the QB as well as anybody else in this draft class (he recorded 17 sacks in 2024, which led the FBS). Although he didn’t play the highest level of competition, Green did dominate it, which is exactly what you’re hoping to see out of a prospect that plays in a non-Power 4 conference. He was also an impact defender when Marshall played Ohio State early in the season.Green doesn’t have ideal size (6-foot-3, 251 pounds, 32-inch arms, 8 1/2-inch hands), but he is twitchy and explosive and plays with the effort and want-to to help compensate for any size mismatches. Green is disruptive against both the pass and run, and has as much pass-rushing upside as any player in this class. He’ll need to continue to add more play strength and hold his weight, but his effort and bend will easily translate to the next level.Teams are also going to have to be comfortable with previous off-field concerns.14. Colston Loveland, TE, MichiganLoveland is a matchup nightmare who is a terror up the seams and the intermediate area of the field. He has good height and size (6-5, 248 pounds), with a frame that he can keep growing into and adding strength to. Loveland has the speed, body control, quickness and route-running polish to win across the formation, even on the outside to beat smaller and quicker defensive backs. Loveland has good hands and catching range, and the smooth athleticism with loose hips that can get in and out of his routes easily. He’s also a big body that is comfortable working over the middle.Loveland is still a work in progress as an in-line blocker and will likely have to be on the backside or split out in the run game. Still, the spark and advantages Loveland provides as a receiver make him a strong prospect and one of the best overall pass catchers in this class.The production hasn’t been there in 2024 because of shoddy quarterback play in Ann Arbor, and Loveland might never be able to consistently block in-line, but he is a real mismatch as a pass catcher who will be a valid weapon on every down and in the red zone because of his easy athleticism and ball skills.15. Derrick Harmon, DT, OregonHarmon transferred from Michigan State and made a big impact on Oregon’s line in 2024. He aligned across the defensive line for the Ducks and is a strong defender against both the run and pass.It’s Harmon’s ability to impact the game in different ways, and on every down, that makes me like him so much. He has the size to play in the interior, with the strength to two-gap and enough explosive athleticism to create edginess along the offensive line when asked to slant across a lineman’s face or shoot the gap. Harmon has the foot speed and balance to be a rusher as a looper and can stay on the field for all four downs because he is an overall viable pass rusher. He even has winning snaps from a wide-end position, but mostly wins with his strength and burst.Harmon’s ability to contribute in so many ways and on every down makes him a fit on any type of defense.16. Jihaad Campbell, LB, AlabamaCampbell is a refreshing player to watch: a defender with the combination of size, speed, violence and intelligence to truly have the potential to play as an every-down off-ball linebacker in the NFL.Campbell is a big body (6-3, 235 pounds) who had a great day of testing in Indianapolis with a 4.52 40 time. He also has the game tape that reflects his size and speed combination. Campbell is strong enough to take on climbing offensive linemen and has the speed to run sideline-to-sideline. He is plenty fluid and explosive enough to be a good coverage player, but can be a bit inconsistent in that area because of his still-developing feel as an off-ball player.Campbell also is a disruptive pass rusher who can win against linemen (he has experience as an edge defender) and was a total mismatch against poor college RBs. There’s still parts to clean up, but Campbell has the potential to be a real impact defender at a position where it has become increasingly hard to find even mid-term starters. He makes sense in a lot of different defenses, too.17. Shemar Stewart, Edge, Texas A\u0026MStewart put on a show at the combine, which wasn’t a total surprise given what he flashes on film. Stewart’s natural talent cannot be taught, and he was very disruptive this season in terms of generating pressure despite finishing with only 1.5 sacks (and 4.5 sacks in three years at College Station).Finishing is something that Stewart still needs to work on, as he will often run right by the QB or ball carrier after he beat his blocker. His feel for the game is not something that seems to come natural for him.But, again, Stewart’s tools are eye-popping. He’s explosive in a big frame (6-5, 267 pounds) and has the length (84 3/4-inch wingspan) and strength to keep blockers at bay while he figures out how to attack, and he still plays hard. He’s also devastating when he gets to attack on twists and defensive line games. Stewart just needs a lot of refining and honing in on his talent (his pass rush arsenal is quite limited right now, too).He’s the classic traits-laden edge prospect who carries risk, but the NFL is always about the high-end traits. Top five-type talent, Day 2-type production, I split the difference and put him at 17.18. Malaki Starks, Safety, GeorgiaStarks is a modern two-way safety who can align all over the field, make plays and provide answers for his defensive coordinator. On just one drive watching Starks, you will see him play as a split-field safety; deep in the post; as a robber; in the box; and in the slot.While I do think that Starks is a good tackler who is more than willing to square up and fill the run, he can get caught out of position because of a misstep and isn’t an overwhelming enough athlete to overcome it. He is still a good overall athlete, though.Starks has the skill set to play in the slot or on the back end in any type of defense. He might not have enough speed to cover every type of player in man-to-man situations, but he can be a tight end eraser and a very strong zone defender across the defense.19. Kenneth Grant, DT, MichiganMason Graham is sitting higher on the board, but Grant was a talented player in his own right on Michigan’s front.Grant won’t always fill up the box score with his play, but he’s a 330-plus-pound nose tackle who can devour blockers with his size and strength, but has light feet and plenty of quickness to do more than just push the pocket or lean into the block.Grant is squarely built with a big trunk but isn’t a total plodder. He plays with the agility to retrace on screens and chase down plays down the field, too. He wasn’t consistently productive at Michigan, but there are real stretches of games where Grant is dominating (ask USC and Ohio State). Grant is an intriguing combination of size and athleticism, with enough good film to make evaluators optimistic that he is just starting to come together as a football player.20. Josh Simmons, OT, Ohio StateSimmons was putting together a fantastic season before suffering a knee injury that ended his 2024 campaign. Long and light on his feet, Simmons is a good athlete and an easy mover in the run game. He is constantly able to stay balanced when climbing to the second level and is able to consistently get his head across inside defenders on the back side of zone runs. His technique and strength in pass protection had improved greatly this season, making him a more balanced player than just purely finesse-driven.Simmons’ play strength improved so much that he was starting to bring some pop on contact in the run game before suffering his injury.Simmons may be injured, but he has the size, enough length (33-inch arms) and talent to be a legitimate blindside protector at the next level. His athleticism and ascending play makes me think there is even more to tap into for a team with a good offensive line coach once Simmons becomes 100% again.21. Matthew Golden, WR, TexasGolden shot up big boards as the 2024 season went along, including mine, and his big week in Indy didn’t slow him down. He’s a smooth route runner and operator who can beat press with his balance, burst and play strength.Golden doesn’t have overwhelming size, but he maximizes it with toughness and comfort in extending for footballs away from his body. Golden has the ability to line up inside and out and is effective underneath and on throws down the field because of his body control and hand-eye coordination. He might not have true No. 1 upside, but he can be a very good secondary receiver for somebody because of how effective he is in a variety of different roles. He plays a lot like D.J. Moore.22. Tyler Booker, OG, AlabamaA big, strong people mover, Booker is a power guard who does his best work in gap schemes where he can use his strength to block down on defenders.Booker isn’t the quickest player, and his poor testing at the combine wasn’t a total shock, but he is a clean puller and is consistently able to stay under control to land his powerful blows. He won’t be a scheme fit for some offenses and lacks positional versatility (though he has done some work at center), but he will be a Day 1 starter at guard and solidify the interior of the pocket in the passing game. Get Booker next to another talented player up front, and whatever team that drafts him always has a side to run the ball behind.23. Aireontae Ersery, OT, MinnesotaAn easy mover in a large (6-6, 331 pounds) and long frame, Ersery has real starter potential as a blindside tackle at the next level. He plays with solid technique and his hand placement is much better and more consistent than you will see with a majority of college tackles, which makes sense given his extended time as a starter.Ersery is an asset in the run game because of his athleticism and quickness, being able to consistently cut off defensive linemen on the back side of runs and also climb to the second level. He displays good strength in his play, too.Even though Ersery is long-limbed, he can bring some real movement and pop when he connects with his hands in the run game, making him a viable player to run behind. Ersery does have things to clean up, especially against interior pass-rush moves. But he shows the ability to adjust as games go along.It’s hard to find this package of length, size and athleticism at left tackle — with the prospect actually having some polish to his play, as well. His strong week in Indy also adds to the intrigue.24. Kelvin Banks Jr., OT/OG, TexasBanks is an experienced blindside blocker who is always under control. He is broadly built and seldom gets out of whack because of his light feet, good base, strength and balance. He’s a competitive and tough player who can move people in the run game, and coordinators will have no qualms with running behind him.Banks is even more fun to watch as a pass protector. He shows the ability to strike defenders on the inside of their pads, allowing him to control and nullify them, but can be inconsistent with his hand placement which can put him in bad positions at times.Banks has a good build to play either inside or outside and enough length (33½ inches) that helps him compensate for any mistakes. His combination of quickness and strength, along with having 40 games under his belt when he enters the NFL, gives Banks the profile of a high-quality offensive line prospect who can hit the ground running as a professional.I do see him best at guard at the next level, but his play this season, and measurables from the combine, have more than earned him the shot to stay out at tackle.25. Emeka Egbuka, WR, Ohio StateEmeka Egbuka is the latest wide receiver prospect to come from the Ohio State factory. (Photo by Michael Miller/ISI Photos/Getty Images)Egbuka is ol’ reliable at the wide receiver position. He checks a lot of boxes as a prospect, even if none of his tools are elite. He is strong with good size, and is a sound and clean route runner who can play in the slot and outside with a great feel against zone and how to make himself friendly to the quarterback.Egbuka has good hands, speed and body control to consistently create yards after the catch with the burst to split defenders. He might not have the highest ceiling for a prospect, but he is an extremely smart player with a very high floor — with enough athleticism to keep tapping into.26. Shavon Revel Jr., CB, East CarolinaRevel has the ideal size and length of a starting outside cornerback in the NFL. He has good foot quickness and can start and stop to keep up with receivers, along with the ball skills to smother receivers.Revel missed most of 2024 after an ACL injury early in the season, but his traits and small sample of play were strong enough that I think he will have plenty of fans in the league if his medicals come through clean. He could also stand to add some bulk and play strength to his game, and like most young cornerbacks he can be inconsistent with his technique at times. Still, he has the size, length, twitchy athleticism and overall upside of a high-end corner who can play in any type of defense.27. Omarion Hampton, RB, North CarolinaWhile there is some concern about the wear and tear Hampton undertook this season, there’s a reason why North Carolina gave him the ball so much in 2024: He’s good.Hampton has a great build for the position and runs with balance and a strong base. He constantly keeps his shoulders square to the line and uses jump cuts to set up blocks and work his way through holes.Hampton is not a big plodder, either. He can accelerate through the hole and quickly to the second level when he does plant his foot to get upfield.Hampton is also a valid receiver because of his good hands and ability to drop step and get north in a hurry. He is a tough runner with the size and vision to be effective and has enough long speed to be an explosive play threat as well. He has all the makings of an every-down back who takes the majority of touches for a team on Day 1.Omarion Hampton could be the clear-cut RB2 behind Ashton Jeanty this NFL Draft.

And I still felt that way initially after Jackson moved out to left tackle after Josh Simmons’ injury. But Jackson went from playing admirably as Will Howard’s blindside protector to downright good as the season went along. So much so that I started to think longer about Jackson’s future on the outside.A powerful and explosive player, Jackson has become a more consistent player as both a run and pass blocker this year, with cleaner hands and sets both helping him stay out of losing positions and also letting him get some real movement on contact in the run game and stonewalling pass rushers. He was more consistent with his hand placement at guard and his technique carried over at left tackle, where Jackson was able to win with his length (33 1/2-inch arms) and power.I still think Jackson is going to do his best work on the inside at the next level, where his lack of overwhelming lateral quickness won’t hinder him quite as much. But having the ability to kick outside in a pinch definitely adds to his value.29. Jahdae Barron, CB, TexasBarron has aligned all of the field in college, and he’s just best described as a football player. He doesn’t have great overall long speed, but he’s twitchy and has the burst to quickly close on the football. He’s a good tackler who has a knack for making plays on the football. (He tries to punch and jar every football near him loose.) Barron is also a good blitzer who has a feel for knifing inside and making plays.In coverage, Barron is best as a zone defender or in man coverage on tight ends (better and faster receivers can give him some issues). I think Barron’s best position will be as a full-time slot defender who can move around the defense for a creative defensive play-caller at the next level.30. Grey Zabel, C/OG, North Dakota StateZabel has clean technique, tons of experience (at four spots along the line, too) and never plays out of control. Zabel doesn’t have ideal bulk, but he is a good athlete and his calm playstyle lets him stay in balanced positions that let his strong hands latch on and win rep after rep — something that stood out during one-on-ones at the Senior Bowl and against Colorado in the season opener.This draft doesn’t have many centers at the top, and it’s the one position that Zabel doesn’t have multigame experience, but he looks like a plug-and-play starter there whose technique, lateral athleticism and skill set will be highlighted — and lack of ideal bulk nullified.31. Josh Conerly Jr., OT, OregonConerly has good length and plays light on his feet. He can really move in the run game because of his explosive get-off at the snap and has the ability to recover consistently as a pass protector because of his athleticism.You can see Conerly working on his hand placement and technique while he plays, and he greatly improved in this area this season. It’s encouraging Conerly can still win on his blocks despite the inconsistencies because he is such a good athlete. And it must be remembered that he’s on the younger side, too, having turned 21 in November.Conerly rapidly improved over the season and will hopefully keep ascending and add even more layers to his technique. He could stand to add more play strength, especially on the lower half, but that’s something you hope comes along as he gets older. Overall, Conerly has plenty of tools, is young, and has potential to play both inside and out, including at left tackle, if his play strength and technique continue to develop.32. Marcus Mbow, OG, PurdueMbow played tackle at college but should transition inside because of his build and the 32-inch arm length he measured in at the combine. (It should be noted that he measured with 33-inch arms at the Senior Bowl — just to make it really fun and easy on us evaluators.)Mbow is an explosive and violent athlete who can fire out of his stance and can quickly close on defenders in space because of his athleticism and balance. Mbow still needs to add bulk and play strength, especially his lower half, to be able to hold up on the inside against more powerful defenders. He could still get bull-rushed by stronger and longer defenders in college, but moving inside won’t expose him as much on an island, even though defenders are even bigger and stronger there in the NFL.Mbow is an easy-moving and explosive athlete who uses his hands well. That’s a fun package for a coach to work with. There’s a lot to work with and Mbow could be a weapon as a blocker at the next level if he gets stronger because of his movement ability.33. Nick Emmanwori, Safety, South CarolinaEmmanwori is a jumbo safety who tested off the charts in Indy. He is explosive and can close quickly when he diagnoses route concepts, but his tight hips make him an inconsistent coverage defender when he has to turn and run with routes.Emmanwori is best when he can attack downhill, either as a quarters safety or in a single-high scheme where he can keep everything in front of him. And he has the production to match his ability to close on the football.Nick Emmanwori helped himself with a great NFL combine. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)Emmanwori’s testing doesn’t always show up with his film, but he has size, explosiveness, ball skills and is a willing tackler. This all gives him some versatility (in theory) to move around the box at the next level. I would like to see him do some work from the slot, too.34. Luther Burden III, WR, MissouriAn explosive slot wide receiver who can create first downs and touchdowns out of nothing, Burden has a good frame and is a weapon on manufactured and underneath touches. He can also win deep because of his very good speed and hand-eye coordination.Burden still has to show more as a route runner and whether he can win consistently on the outside and against press (he has mostly played from the slot or after being put in motion), but he has the ability to create explosive plays that NFL teams covet, with the ball skills to pluck the football from a variety of angles. He endured some pretty inconsistent QB play in 2024, which hindered some of his progress.Burden’s role has been streamlined so far in his career. He can be an exciting player if he goes somewhere that can expand his route tree and overall skill set.35. Shedeur Sanders, QB, ColoradoSanders improved his play this season, especially with his feel in the pocket and timing that he plays with on concepts. Sanders is tough, has a good arm and is more than willing to challenge defenders on tougher throws like in-breakers over the middle. When in rhythm, he can let his pass catchers thrive because of his friendly ball placement.Sanders has below-average size and is also just an average athlete, which shows up when asked to create. He has markedly better pocket movement (although he still has a tendency to drift backward).Sanders still has plenty to work on, especially in regards to timing and feel in the pocket. And while he has a good-enough arm for the NFL, his tools aren’t overwhelming enough to consistently mitigate tough situations. Sanders will have to be dropped into a good ecosystem to keep ascending at the next level.36. Mason Taylor, TE, LSUTaylor has a strong pedigree being the son of Jason Taylor and nephew of Zach Thomas. He has a good frame and is a clean route runner who can quickly transition from receiver to runner — while also having the speed to be an intermediate threat down the seams.Taylor will compete as a blocker, but still has to add more play strength. He still shows the potential to hang as an in-line blocker.Taylor was an instant contributor when he started college and LSU’s dropoff in receiver talent allowed him to be highlighted more this season. He’s a classic QB’s best friend with good hands and a large catching range; Taylor is more than comfortable extending and snatching throws away from his body and is such a smooth athlete that he can still keep his feet even when he needs to reach for throws.Taylor has the size, athleticism and football IQ to be an early starter who can be a positive player in any type of offense.37. James Pearce Jr., Edge, TennesseeThe definition of a speed rusher, Pearce has excellent burst and get-off and can get his way around offensive tackles in the blink of an eye. He can heat up the quarterback with speed around the edge or use his good length to bullrush tackles into the quarterback.Pearce is not as dynamic as a run defender — best knifing inside as opposed to taking on blockers — as he is as a pass rusher because of his average play strength. But he has good length and a frame that he can keep adding bulk to, which gives you optimism he'll improve in the area and even has nice plays dropping into coverage, though his game will always be primarily built around getting after the passer.Pearce’s frame and speed-only-type play style gives me some apprehension about how he will affect the game if he doesn’t win right away, as he’s not the most explosive or strongest player. This type of pass rusher profile carries risk with it.38. Tyleik Williams, DT, Ohio StateWilliams is a monster in the middle for the Ohio State defense. He has very good size (334 pounds at the combine) and is a strong run defender who seldom gets put out of position by the blocker.Williams is a quick mover for his size. He is valuable on defensive line games and twists, and can loop around the edge and get in the backfield at a quicker pace than most players with his frame. That quickness also applies to his hands. He is an active pass rusher who really works and will also get his hands up when quarterbacks look to throw quickly.Players with size and skill on the interior like Williams will grow on every evaluator.39. Walter Nolen, DT, Ole MissA part of the Rebels’ tenacious front, Nolen has finally started to hone his talent into more consistent play after transferring to Oxford from Texas A\u0026M. Nolen is a very good athlete whose explosion, balance and bend stand out. He is consistently able to keep his feet while working through and shedding blocks and is a true weapon on defensive line twists and games.Walter Nolen (2) might make a defensive line-needy team very happy late in the first round or early on Day 2 of the NFL Draft. (Photo by James Gilbert/Getty Images)Nolen can get out of position too frequently, making him a non-factor on plays where he doesn’t gain advantage right away and — he’s still inconsistent in diagnosing blocks. Nolen still is an intriguing combination of athleticism and size who’s hard to find, and could be a fun project for a team with a strong defensive line coach to maximize his bundle of tools.40. Jonah Savaiinaea, OG, ArizonaSavaiinaea has a good, thick build and never looks out of sorts as a player. He’s able to stay in balance and in control as both a run and pass blocker (although getting a tad too high at times in the run game). He’s a smart player who plays with consistent hand placement and can really surprise pass rushers with his quickness.Savaiinaea played at right tackle for the games I studied, but he will be best served as a guard in the NFL — a position he has also played in his time at Arizona. He has good size and technique, but I do think quicker NFL edge rushers will give him issues. It’s funny how much of Savaiinaea’s game — and how I view him — remind me of his former teammate (and Packers first-round selection) Jordan Morgan.41. Kaleb Johnson, RB, IowaJohnson (6-foot-1, 224 pounds at the combine) plays and runs like if you took a shrink ray to Derrick Henry; a big, long-striding back with good vision and an upright running style who can rip off big runs when given a lane, but whose upright style also leads to them getting tripped up or absorbing big hits a bit too frequently.Just like Henry, Johnson becomes a load as he builds up steam, but his long strides can limit him in tight spaces or if he has to adjust quickly because of backfield penetration. But when given a clean lane, Johnson does a great job of reading running lanes, planting his foot and getting north.Johnson has more receiving ability than Henry and is a good pass protector, too. He has taken plenty of touches in college, but Johnson can be an innings eater at the next level and lead a backfield on all four downs.42. Quinshon Judkins, RB, Ohio StateJudkins is strong and runs with a fun combination of power and grace. The Ole Miss transfer can quickly get to fourth gear (maybe not fifth) and into the secondary in a hurry. He’s not a back who relies on just his speed, consistently showing the ability to tempo his runs while using good vision to set up blockers and use his burst to take advantage.Judkins is also a good receiver with sticky hands who is a viable player to draw up plays for out of the backfield, with those sticky hands applying to his lack of career fumbles.Overall, Judkins has the size, explosive play ability and hands of a strong three-down running back who can take the majority of touches in a backfield — with versatility to be used in any situation and in any scheme. He might not have home run speed (and combine testing matched the eye test; see the chart below and compare Judkins and the average RB speed) but he can be a consistent doubles hitter on the ground or through the air in any type of offense.43. Donovan Ezeiruaku, Edge, Boston CollegeEzeiruaku doesn’t have overwhelming size, but he’s long (34-inch arm length) and is a disruptive pass rusher with a devastating swim move. He is a productive player who can consistently affect the passer and has twitchiness and enough length to overcome his lack of ideal size, but he can still get smothered by larger offensive tackles, especially in the run game.While this might limit Ezeiruaku’s every-down projection at the next level, everyone loves pass rushers, and Ezeiruaku plays hard, is disruptive, has a pass-rush arsenal already and gets after the passer in a hurry.44. Jack Sawyer, Edge, Ohio StateSawyer is a (forgive me here) Jack-of-all-trades for the Buckeyes' defense. He can play the run, rush the passer or drop into coverage and fill multiple roles throughout the front seven.Sawyer is a solid athlete with strong hands who consistently bursts off the snap, and his hands are constantly working and that helps him win over and over again against blockers. He might not have a singular standout trait, but Sawyer’s ability to align across the defensive front on any given down will make him an interesting skeleton key-type player for a creative NFL defensive coordinator.Sawyer’s arm length (31 3/4 inches) will concern some teams, but his strength, hands and relentlessness still allows him to be an effective football player.45. JT Tuimoloau, Edge, Ohio StateTuimoloau was flirting with the first round if he declared after the 2023 season. He decided to return to Columbus for a last hurrah and thank goodness he did!Tuimoloau plays with good strength against the run and pass, and loves pushing the pocket (and poor offensive tackles) back into the quarterback. He can consistently set the edge and disrupt offenses in the run game and maintain position because of his strong hands and power.Tuimoloau has just-adequate bend but his overall pass-rushing skills and strong and competitive play style make him a valuable player on a front. I see him as more of a strong secondary edge who can contribute against both the run and pass than a true ace.46. Devin Neal, RB, KansasShifty is how I would describe Neal. The classic “quicker-than-fast”-type athlete, Neal has just average long speed, but he is a strong runner with good balance and vision.Neal has a great feel for setting up his blocks and knowing when to plant his foot and accelerate through the hole. He is constantly finding ways to get effective yards and knows how to pace his runs on a variety of run concepts (even being frequently used as a wildcat QB at Kansas, too).On passing downs, Neal is a natural pass catcher who knows how to stay friendly to the QB and can get upfield after the catch quickly. He is also a good pass protector already, with both his eyes constantly going to the right assignment and his build, technique and strength allowing him to stonewall blitzers.Overall, Neal isn’t the sexiest running back in the world, but he’s an overall good player who contributes to winning football in a variety of ways.47. TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Ohio StateHenderson’s ability to affect the game on all three downs, especially in pass protection, will give him a path to success alone at the next level.Combined with solid hands and real home run speed, with an efficient running style that lets him get downhill in a hurry, that will make him a strong contributor in any NFL offense. Henderson’s vision can be inconsistent at times (like most fast running backs, he has a tendency to unnecessarily bounce the run at times) and I like him best in a shared backfield where he can split some of the load and have someone take more of the “harder” runs between the tackles.Still, Henderson’s speed and pass-protection ability gives him a home in any running back room — and should give him a nice career, too.48. Jaylin Noel, WR, Iowa StateNoel is an easy-moving athlete who did his best work in motion or from the slot at Iowa State.Noel can quickly accelerate to top speed and is dangerous as an intermediate and downfield option because of his speed and excellent ball skills. Noel isn’t just a burner, though. His balance and body control show up as a route runner, where he consistently does a nice job of throttling his speeds and sinking on his routes to keep coverage defenders uneasy on breaking routes.Noel has just adequate size (5-foot-10, 194 pounds, 29½-inch arm), but he plays with good strength and balance on his routes and at the catch point. He’s also a good blocker who doesn’t have to be hidden in the run game, something that will be paramount to his success if he stays in the slot full-time at the next level.It’s good to see him play with such a competitive edge and scrap it up with defenders.Overall, Noel is just a useful player. He can be an explosive play threat but also does enough inbetween stuff to contribute to winning football. He’s an ideal type of secondary receiver.49. Riley Leonard, QB, Notre DameI’m likely going to be one of the higher people on Leonard. I do think there is a lot to like and tools to work with for a Day 2 dart throw.Leonard has good size and is an excellent athlete who is a weapon on designed runs and in the open field. He has a good feel in the pocket (but can bail outside a bit too quickly at times) with an ability to mitigate sacks and pressure, something he has now shown behind two shaky offensive lines at Duke and then behind a — forgive the pun — green Notre Dame unit.Leonard is an accurate thrower underneath with some real flashes of layering throws (and some downright excellent throws like at the end of the game against Indiana in the CFP), but his deep ball remains a gigantic question mark. Some of that was Notre Dame’s iffy receiving core, but Leonard did shy away from pushing the ball at times.Leonard’s tools, toughness and ability to avoid negative plays make him intriguing to me, and his overall passing has picked up as the season went along as Notre Dame’s offense – and personnel – started to mature. But he still has to show that he can execute those complex throws on a more consistent basis, which might never happen and will make him more just an interesting backup option.But it’s not the worst bet to make on such a competitive player with this much athleticism — who shows more feel for the position than he gets credit for — could turn into a starter down the road.50. Landon Jackson, Edge, ArkansasJackson is best when he can just line up and go. He is a good athlete but has long legs which can make it tough for him to bend and consistently turn the corner as a pass rusher (he will lose his feet a bit more often than you’d like).Jackson plays hard, though, and knows how to use his length when he strikes blockers in the run game. I would like to see him continue to add to his play strength, especially in his legs, and learn to become a true speed-to-power-type edge defender as a true 4-3 defensive end.But, his competitiveness and straight speed will allow him to be an early contributor as he continues to figure out his game and gets into a more focused role at the next level.",

Travis Hunter, CB/WR, Colorado\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs the most dynamic player in the country, Hunter was a game-changer at cornerback and wide receiver in college. Still, I think his best path as a professional is as a full-time defender with some spot duty on offense — a usage resembling his coach/mentor Deion Sanders when he played with the Dallas Cowboys in 1996.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHunter can consistently stay sticky to his coverage assignment, showing off the quickness and body control to thrive in man-to-man situations, with the excellent burst to make plays on the football and nullify the receiver. He plays with a high level of intelligence for the position, and will take calculated gambles to fall off his coverage assignment and even bait quarterbacks into potential interception opportunities. Hunter’s ball skills and feel for the position are rare. His athleticism is unlocked by his innate ability to always find — and come down with — the football. Hunter just seems to make a big play in every quarter of the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe ball skills, quickness and body control all show up when Hunter plays wide receiver, too, but he is more raw at the position, lacking the refinement he shows on the other side of the ball — and, yes, he has rapidly improved this season. He also plays bigger than his listed size (6-foot, 188 pounds) because of his hands and hand-eye coordination, while also being able to create with the ball in his hands. This makes two-way play at the next level a real possibility, even if it’s for a small package of plays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHunter’s moderate bulk does not come up as a tackler; he’s a physical defender. But it is also a reason why I have \u003cem\u003esome\u003c/em\u003e hesitation about Hunter being a full-time player on both sides at the next level (along with the sheer mental load, but that’s something that can come with time). No matter what, Hunter is a helluva football player and whatever team drafts him is getting a game-changing talent.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"2-abdul-carter-edge-penn-state\"\u003e2. Abdul Carter, Edge, Penn State\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhen a Penn State defender now gets the No. 11 jersey, he is inevitably going to get compared to Micah Parsons, which is unfair for any player and such a high bar. Still, Carter is about as close to that Parsons comparison as a player can get.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe is a twitchy pass rusher who can bend around corners and somehow stay on his feet despite contorting his body like Gumby. Carter is still adding layers to his usage of hands and how to keep blockers off-balance, but he has the package of length, quick-twitch athleticism, bend, play strength and effort level to give him the upside of an elite ace edge defender with double-digit sack upside in the NFL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe also has prior experience as an off-ball linebacker and interior pass rusher to boot. He still has to work on discipline in the run game, and can rely on knifing inside on his pass rush (which allows QBs to escape the pocket) a \u003cem\u003ebit \u003c/em\u003etoo much. He also doesn’t have elite bulk, but that’s the trade-off with his ability to move. He plays hard and it’s difficult to find this amount of true pass rushing juice. His medicals are also throwing a wrench in his evaluation, as combine testing revealed a stress fracture in his foot, which must be monitored.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlus, he also does \u003ca data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/pennstatecollection/p/C1gE3hVMXYH/abdul-carter-went-with-the-sean-taylor-facemask-tape-again-in-the-peach-bowl-so-/\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:cool things with tape on his facemask;cpos:4;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\"\u003ecool things with tape on his facemask\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"3-tetairoa-mcmillan-wr-arizona\"\u003e3. Tetairoa McMillan, WR, Arizona\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA monster on the outside, McMillan is a smooth athlete with excellent hands and ball skills that give him true X-receiver upside. McMillan consistently creates yards with the ball in his hands because of his strength and balance, and plenty of burst in such a big frame. He is also a good route runner who can consistently sink on his route breaks, with the ability to create separation on the intermediate levels.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcMillan was dominant in 2024 when the ball was anywhere in his vicinity and has the makings of a matchup nightmare at the next level. He also already has experience working from the slot, not just vertically but on underneath routes as well, with his ability to get in and out of breaks really shining on these routes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcMillan is a big receiver who most importantly \u003cem\u003eplays \u003c/em\u003ebig. His volleyball and basketball background constantly show up in his game; he is very comfortable extending for throws away from his frame (which happened often at Arizona) and he doesn’t lose speed when catching the ball on the move because of his confidence in his hands.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMcMillan lacks elite long speed, but he still has enough speed — and most importantly the frame and ball skills — to win consistently vertically. McMillan brings a lot to the table and can be an instant strong contributor at the next level because of his route-running polish and ball skills. I’m very bullish on McMillan.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"4-will-campbell-otog-lsu\"\u003e4. Will Campbell, OT/OG, LSU\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA smooth technician who seldom gets out of position with his feet or body as a blocker, Campbell already shows off good hand usage and the ability to recover against defensive counters because of his calm and quick footwork.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLSU often puts Campbell on an island in drop-back situations that will help his game translate to the next level, and he plays with good eyes and awareness as a run blocker and in protection, often anticipating defensive stunts and quickly adjusting. His funky stance often does his actual athleticism a disservice; Campbell is an excellent athlete (which was backed up in Indianapolis) with the bend to thrust underneath his blocks with ease.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Here is Nate Tice\u0026#39;s post-combine 2025 NFL Draft big board.

(Davis Long/Yahoo Sports)\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eCampbell’s arm length is going to be the topic of discussion among evaluators: He was measured at 32 5/8 inches, just below the common team prerequisite of 33 inches for offensive tackles in the NFL. It hasn’t hindered him so far against longer defenders in college because of his hand placement, technique, athleticism and ability to constantly create leverage on his blocks. That makes me think he can at least have a chance to stay out at tackle in the NFL. He’s an extremely smart player, too, often calling out blitzes and defensive movement on his side of the ball.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI think that combination of athleticism and technique allows Campbell to mitigate his arm-length deficiencies and stay at tackle, but even if he kicks inside to guard, he could be a needle-moving player on the interior.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"5-armand-membou-ot-missouri\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e5. Armand Membou, OT, Missouri\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMembou has a unique build for a tackle but still has the length, strength and athleticism to stay out there. He had an excellent testing day at the NFL combine in Indianapolis with 4.91 40 time while reaching a top speed of 20.28 miles per hour — both fastest among all offensive linemen. It’s a particularly absurd top speed to reach at 332 pounds.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMembou also backs up the testing numbers on film. He is an easy mover in space and can consistently reach outside defenders on zone runs, an ability that helped unlock a lot of Missouri’s best hitting plays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMembou can absolutely stay out at tackle, and while he played on the right side this year for Missouri, I think he has the movement ability, length and enough polish to kick over to the left side, if needed. Membou could even kick inside at the next level, which is more a compliment to his skill set than something that is necessary. Membou could still work on his technique and hand placement, but those are teachable things that will come with time and are way more acceptable considering Membou’s youth (he doesn’t turn 21 until the end of March).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMembou is an ascending prospect with a lot of things that are hard to coach and a lot to like.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"6-ashton-jeanty-rb-boise-state\"\u003e6. Ashton Jeanty, RB, Boise State\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eA human highlight reel. Jeanty isn’t the tallest (5-foot-8 1/2), but he has a good build (211 pounds) and is a strong runner of the football. Jeanty has excellent speed and burst, but is more than willing to do his work between the tackles — where he shows off his rare contact balance and clean vision for running the football.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJeanty is also excellent at tempoing his runs, slowing to let blocks develop and then accelerating through the hole just as it opens, which show up on Boise State’s gap schemes featuring pulling offensive linemen.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJeanty is explosive, tough, well-rounded (he’s a natural catcher of the football and has a great feel on screens), is a great pass protector and has the size, speed and vision to handle any type of run concept. Jeanty took on a lot of touches this year (his 397 led FBS, and there were some \u003cem\u003etough\u003c/em\u003e touches in there) and running back value is always a discussion, but Jeanty is worth a lottery pick. He can stay on the field and impact the game, in true game-breaking ways, on every single down. That’s valuable.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"7-jalon-walker-edgelb-georgia\"\u003e7. Jalon Walker, Edge/LB, Georgia\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eOne of my favorite players in the draft. Walker plays both as an off-ball linebacker and an edge defender on the line of scrimmage in Georgia’s rush packages. He plays a little bit of everywhere, so much so he calls himself an “HLB” which stands for \u0026#34;hybrid linebacker.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs an off-ball linebacker, Walker is a strong tackler and good athlete who is consistently diagnosing plays quickly. He can run, chase and has no issues taking on and shedding climbing offensive linemen, and has the athleticism to be a plus-player in coverage. He can be a bit slow when having to turn and diagnose, something that would get cleaned up with more time at the spot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWalker is also a talented and productive pass rusher, and shows off his bend, strength and quickness when getting after the QB. Walker plays with his hair on fire and can hang as an off-ball linebacker who can stay on the field for all three downs and be a positive player against the run and pass, with the pass-rush ability being a giant cherry on top.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe won’t be an ideal fit for every team, but I think Walker is just a guy I would want in my front seven. His competitive play style is infectious and he has the ability to fill up the box score in different ways, with leadership to boot. He reminds me a lot of Clay Matthews.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"8-mason-graham-dt-michigan\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e8. Mason Graham, DT, Michigan\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe human hand grenade, Graham is constantly exploding off the ball and creating havoc in the middle of an offense. Graham’s excellent first step, quick hands, balance and strength will get him in the backfield in the blink of an eye, letting him end plays or force them to go off script, right after the snap.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGraham lacks ideal arm length (32 inches) and weighed in at 298 pounds at the combine, 20 pounds lower than his listed weight at Michigan. Neither are exactly dealbreakers, considering Graham’s strength and ability to be disruptive, but that lack of length and bulk do show up with his lack of consistency in holding up against double-teams and longer and stronger guards in college.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving said that, Graham was still an explosive play machine for Michigan in 2023 and for flashes in 2024, even though he did battle an injury for most of the season. Graham would be best if he was allowed to fire off the ball in a four-down defense operating primarily as a 3-technique with the ability to move across the defense on passing downs and in different fronts because of his athleticism and how dangerous he is on defensive stunts and twists.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"9-will-johnson-cb-michigan\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e9.

A long player with good size (6-1, 194 pounds, 30 1/8-inch arms), Johnson has the build and athleticism of a prototypical modern NFL cornerback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohnson uses that size to smother wide receivers. That’s not the only way he can do it. Whether it’s zone or man coverage, Johnson is able to constantly stay in the pocket of wide receivers, even smaller ones, with his excellent combination of quickness, burst and body control.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJohnson doesn’t have elite long speed, and his physicality is more “OK” than “good,” but he’s a fluid athlete who doesn’t get put in bad positions because of his ability to turn and run and ability to close on the football. There will be some questions about Johnson’s inconsistent 2024 season and his injury history that teams are figuring out, but he has the upside to be a true No. 1 cornerback at the next level in a variety of schemes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"10-cam-ward-qb-miami-fl\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e10. Cam Ward, QB, Miami (FL)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCam Ward exudes calmness when you watch him. Whether it’s in his pocket movements or executing in big moments, Ward is more than happy to try and make tough throws or attempt trick shots. He has no qualms continuing it even when punished.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWard has a good frame, a good arm with a quick sidearm delivery that can attack all three levels, and he can create with his legs or off-platform when needed. He can also make the higher-difficulty plays. Ward can get a little too carried away with his heat-check moments and have some throws get away from him, but he has continued to add layers to his game at each stop of his college career and makes everyone around him better.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWard is a good, but not overwhelming athlete, but is an effective scrambler with a good clock in his head for when to tuck the ball and run. Ward measured in under 6-foot-2 at the combine, but his height isn’t a deterrent because of his ability to quickly operate and change arm angles around pass rushers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWard still has a few things to clean up, and might lack a true overwhelming trait, but he’s young and has already shown the ability to operate (and excel) both in and out of structure — with results, too. Any fan base that drafts him should be rightfully excited because Ward is just a fun player to watch. You gotta love a QB that \u003cem\u003etries\u003c/em\u003e stuff.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"11-mykel-williams-edge-georgia\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e11.

His production started to ramp up, too, with those tantalizing traits morphing into sustained impact on the game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLike most recent defensive line and edge prospects from Georgia, it’s all about seeing what Williams does when he is on the field as part of Georgia’s deep rotation up front. After a part-time role at the beginning of his Georgia career, Williams’ package of traits and impact play is instantly apparent now with more extended snaps. In the run game, he is constantly blasting offensive linemen backward with his explosive strength and twitch. When rushing the passer he flashes an in-progress move set with real get-off.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWilliams has the size, athleticism, technique and competitiveness to be a good pass rusher from the edge for a defense down the road. But his ability to be a plus-run defender right away gives him a high floor to see the field early while he continues to develop his pass-rush arsenal.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe has upside as a true impact player against the run in a short amount of time. Williams has the size and versatility to kick inside for snaps to create matchup advantages. He showed that already in college where even dominated guards in the run game. He still has to show more consistency and diversity with his pass-rush moves, but Williams is an impressive player who should keep adding layers to his game with more playing time. He will benefit from more snaps on the outside at the next level when he can pin his ears back and go. Players like DeMarcus Lawrence and Montez Sweat are what Williams can project to at the next level — at least as far as play style — with just that little bit of upside for more as a pass rusher.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"12-tyler-warren-te-penn-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e12.

Warren is also a real threat with the ball in his hands, typically making the first defender miss with his play strength and balance. His competitive play style shows up when Warren is a runner and also as a blocker, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWarren also has upside to align in-line at the next level, as he is a strong player and willing blocker, but did measure in with shorter arms (31 3/4 inches) that could hinder him against bigger and better NFL athletes. The No. 44 jersey, explosive play ability and shorter arms have me thinking of Dallas Clark when I watch Warren.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"13-mike-green-edge-marshall\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e13. Mike Green, Edge, Marshall\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreen is a competitive and bendy pass rusher who can get after the QB as well as anybody else in this draft class (he recorded 17 sacks in 2024, which led the FBS). Although he didn’t play the highest level of competition, Green did dominate it, which is exactly what you’re hoping to see out of a prospect that plays in a non-Power 4 conference. He was also an impact defender when Marshall played Ohio State early in the season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGreen doesn’t have ideal size (6-foot-3, 251 pounds, 32-inch arms, 8 1/2-inch hands), but he is twitchy and explosive and plays with the effort and want-to to help compensate for any size mismatches. Green is disruptive against both the pass and run, and has as much pass-rushing upside as any player in this class. He’ll need to continue to add more play strength and hold his weight, but his effort and bend will easily translate to the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTeams are also going to have to be comfortable with \u003ca data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-draft-prospect-mike-green-denies-sexual-assault-allegations-addresses-departure-from-virginia\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\" data-ylk=\"slk:previous off-field concerns;cpos:6;pos:1;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas\"\u003eprevious off-field concerns\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"14-colston-loveland-te-michigan\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e14.

He has good height and size (6-5, 248 pounds), with a frame that he can keep growing into and adding strength to. Loveland has the speed, body control, quickness and route-running polish to win across the formation, even on the outside to beat smaller and quicker defensive backs. Loveland has good hands and catching range, and the smooth athleticism with loose hips that can get in and out of his routes easily. He’s also a big body that is comfortable working over the middle.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLoveland is still a work in progress as an in-line blocker and will likely have to be on the backside or split out in the run game. Still, the spark and advantages Loveland provides as a receiver make him a strong prospect and one of the best overall pass catchers in this class.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe production hasn’t been there in 2024 because of shoddy quarterback play in Ann Arbor, and Loveland might never be able to consistently block in-line, but he is a real mismatch as a pass catcher who will be a valid weapon on every down and in the red zone because of his easy athleticism and ball skills.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"15-derrick-harmon-dt-oregon\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e15.

He aligned across the defensive line for the Ducks and is a strong defender against both the run and pass.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s Harmon’s ability to impact the game in different ways, and on every down, that makes me like him so much. He has the size to play in the interior, with the strength to two-gap and enough explosive athleticism to create edginess along the offensive line when asked to slant across a lineman’s face or shoot the gap. Harmon has the foot speed and balance to be a rusher as a looper and can stay on the field for all four downs because he is an overall viable pass rusher. He even has winning snaps from a wide-end position, but mostly wins with his strength and burst.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHarmon’s ability to contribute in so many ways and on every down makes him a fit on any type of defense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"16-jihaad-campbell-lb-alabama\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e16. Jihaad Campbell, LB, Alabama\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eCampbell is a refreshing player to watch: a defender with the combination of size, speed, violence and intelligence to truly have the potential to play as an every-down off-ball linebacker in the NFL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCampbell is a big body (6-3, 235 pounds) who had a great day of testing in Indianapolis with a 4.52 40 time. He also has the game tape that reflects his size and speed combination. Campbell is strong enough to take on climbing offensive linemen and has the speed to run sideline-to-sideline. He is plenty fluid and explosive enough to be a good coverage player, but can be a bit inconsistent in that area because of his still-developing feel as an off-ball player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCampbell also is a disruptive pass rusher who can win against linemen (he has experience as an edge defender) and was a total mismatch against poor college RBs. There’s still parts to clean up, but Campbell has the potential to be a real impact defender at a position where it has become increasingly hard to find even mid-term starters. He makes sense in a lot of different defenses, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"17-shemar-stewart-edge-texas-am\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e17.

Stewart’s natural talent cannot be taught, and he was very disruptive this season in terms of generating pressure despite finishing with only 1.5 sacks (and 4.5 sacks in three years at College Station).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFinishing is something that Stewart still needs to work on, as he will often run right by the QB or ball carrier after he beat his blocker. His feel for the game is not something that seems to come natural for him.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, again, Stewart’s tools are eye-popping. He’s explosive in a big frame (6-5, 267 pounds) and has the length (84 3/4-inch wingspan) and strength to keep blockers at bay while he figures out how to attack, and he still plays hard. He’s also devastating when he gets to attack on twists and defensive line games. Stewart just needs a lot of refining and honing in on his talent (his pass rush arsenal is quite limited right now, too).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHe’s the classic traits-laden edge prospect who carries risk, but the NFL is always about the high-end traits. Top five-type talent, Day 2-type production, I split the difference and put him at 17.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"18-malaki-starks-safety-georgia\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e18.

On just one drive watching Starks, you will see him play as a split-field safety; deep in the post; as a robber; in the box; and in the slot.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile I do think that Starks is a good tackler who is more than willing to square up and fill the run, he can get caught out of position because of a misstep and isn’t an overwhelming enough athlete to overcome it. He is still a good overall athlete, though.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStarks has the skill set to play in the slot or on the back end in any type of defense. He might not have enough speed to cover every type of player in man-to-man situations, but he can be a tight end eraser and a very strong zone defender across the defense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"19-kenneth-grant-dt-michigan\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e19.

He plays with the agility to retrace on screens and chase down plays down the field, too. He wasn’t consistently productive at Michigan, but there are real stretches of games where Grant is dominating (ask USC and Ohio State). Grant is an intriguing combination of size and athleticism, with enough good film to make evaluators optimistic that he is just starting to come together as a football player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"20-josh-simmons-ot-ohio-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e20.

Long and light on his feet, Simmons is a good athlete and an easy mover in the run game. He is constantly able to stay balanced when climbing to the second level and is able to consistently get his head across inside defenders on the back side of zone runs. His technique and strength in pass protection had improved greatly this season, making him a more balanced player than just purely finesse-driven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimmons’ play strength improved so much that he was starting to bring some pop on contact in the run game before suffering his injury.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSimmons may be injured, but he has the size, enough length (33-inch arms) and talent to be a legitimate blindside protector at the next level.

Golden has the ability to line up inside and out and is effective underneath and on throws down the field because of his body control and hand-eye coordination. He might not have true No. 1 upside, but he can be a very good secondary receiver for somebody because of how effective he is in a variety of different roles. He plays a lot like D.J.

He could also stand to add some bulk and play strength to his game, and like most young cornerbacks he can be inconsistent with his technique at times. Still, he has the size, length, twitchy athleticism and overall upside of a high-end corner who can play in any type of defense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"27-omarion-hampton-rb-north-carolina\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e27.

He constantly keeps his shoulders square to the line and uses jump cuts to set up blocks and work his way through holes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHampton is not a big plodder, either. He can accelerate through the hole and quickly to the second level when he does plant his foot to get upfield.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHampton is also a valid receiver because of his good hands and ability to drop step and get north in a hurry.

And I still felt that way initially after Jackson moved out to left tackle after Josh Simmons’ injury. But Jackson went from playing admirably as Will Howard’s blindside protector to downright good as the season went along. So much so that I started to think longer about Jackson’s future on the outside.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA powerful and explosive player, Jackson has become a more consistent player as both a run and pass blocker this year, with cleaner hands and sets both helping him stay out of losing positions and also letting him get some real movement on contact in the run game and stonewalling pass rushers. He was more consistent with his hand placement at guard and his technique carried over at left tackle, where Jackson was able to win with his length (33 1/2-inch arms) and power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e think Jackson is going to do his best work on the inside at the next level, where his lack of overwhelming lateral quickness won’t hinder him quite as much.

Jahdae Barron, CB, Texas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eBarron has aligned all of the field in college, and he’s just best described as a football player. He doesn’t have great overall long speed, but he’s twitchy and has the burst to quickly close on the football. He’s a good tackler who has a knack for making plays on the football. (He tries to punch and jar every football near him loose.) Barron is also a good blitzer who has a feel for knifing inside and making plays.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn coverage, Barron is best as a zone defender or in man coverage on tight ends (better and faster receivers can give him some issues). I think Barron’s best position will be as a full-time slot defender who can move around the defense for a creative defensive play-caller at the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"30-grey-zabel-cog-north-dakota-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e30.

Zabel doesn’t have ideal bulk, but he is a good athlete and his calm playstyle lets him stay in balanced positions that let his strong hands latch on and win rep after rep — something that stood out during one-on-ones at the Senior Bowl and against Colorado in the season opener.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis draft doesn’t have many centers at the top, and it’s the one position that Zabel doesn’t have multigame experience, but he looks like a plug-and-play starter there whose technique, lateral athleticism and skill set will be highlighted — and lack of ideal bulk nullified.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"31-josh-conerly-jr-ot-oregon\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e31.

He can really move in the run game because of his explosive get-off at the snap and has the ability to recover consistently as a pass protector because of his athleticism.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can see Conerly working on his hand placement and technique while he plays, and he greatly improved in this area this season. It’s encouraging Conerly can still win on his blocks despite the inconsistencies because he is such a good athlete. And it must be remembered that he’s on the younger side, too, having turned 21 in November.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eConerly rapidly improved over the season and will hopefully keep ascending and add even more layers to his technique. He could stand to add more play strength, especially on the lower half, but that’s something you hope comes along as he gets older. Overall, Conerly has plenty of tools, is young, and has potential to play both inside and out, including at left tackle, if his play strength and technique continue to develop.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"32-marcus-mbow-og-purdue\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e32. Marcus Mbow, OG, Purdue\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eMbow played tackle at college but should transition inside because of his build and the 32-inch arm length he measured in at the combine. (It should be noted that he measured with 33-inch arms at the Senior Bowl — just to make it really fun and easy on us evaluators.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMbow is an explosive and violent athlete who can fire out of his stance and can quickly close on defenders in space because of his athleticism and balance. Mbow still needs to add bulk and play strength, especially his lower half, to be able to hold up on the inside against more powerful defenders. He could still get bull-rushed by stronger and longer defenders in college, but moving inside won’t expose him as much on an island, even though defenders are even bigger and stronger there in the NFL.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eMbow is an easy-moving and explosive athlete who uses his hands well. That’s a fun package for a coach to work with. There’s a lot to work with and Mbow could be a weapon as a blocker at the next level if he gets stronger because of his movement ability.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"33-nick-emmanwori-safety-south-carolina\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e33.

He can also win deep because of his very good speed and hand-eye coordination.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBurden still has to show more as a route runner and whether he can win consistently on the outside and against press (he has mostly played from the slot or after being put in motion), but he has the ability to create explosive plays that NFL teams covet, with the ball skills to pluck the football from a variety of angles. He endured some pretty inconsistent QB play in 2024, which hindered some of his progress.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBurden’s role has been streamlined so far in his career.

When in rhythm, he can let his pass catchers thrive because of his friendly ball placement.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSanders has below-average size and is also just an average athlete, which shows up when asked to create.

And while he has a good-enough arm for the NFL, his tools aren’t overwhelming enough to consistently mitigate tough situations.

He still shows the potential to hang as an in-line blocker.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaylor was an instant contributor when he started college and LSU’s dropoff in receiver talent allowed him to be highlighted more this season. He’s a classic QB’s best friend with good hands and a large catching range; Taylor is more than comfortable extending and snatching throws away from his body and is such a smooth athlete that he can still keep his feet even when he needs to reach for throws.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTaylor has the size, athleticism and football IQ to be an early starter who can be a positive player in any type of offense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"37-james-pearce-jr-edge-tennessee\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e37.

He can heat up the quarterback with speed around the edge or use his good length to bullrush tackles into the quarterback.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePearce is not as dynamic as a run defender — best knifing inside as opposed to taking on blockers — as he is as a pass rusher because of his average play strength. But he has good length and a frame that he can keep adding bulk to, which gives you optimism he\u0026#39;ll improve in the area and even has nice plays dropping into coverage, though his game will always be primarily built around getting after the passer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003ePearce’s frame and speed-only-type play style gives me some apprehension about how he will affect the game if he doesn’t win right away, as he’s not the most explosive or strongest player.

He might not have home run speed (and combine testing matched the eye test; see the chart below and compare Judkins and the average RB speed) but he can be a consistent doubles hitter on the ground or through the air in any type of offense.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"\" src=\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/pib30PNvwlKNqGoCFsPzKQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY3NDtjZj13ZWJw/https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXc8YKpGmDKd47Id5nWw2F2s5w1n0IIZ7TlrzvLDpbR0-_jv0DYcbDI-3z1lN6uiXaYcCNY4lJTLYDrgJH5a6KpU7YlzpDOVNsT4AxwZTpV-dSA6LzAqYHrW_TMFNEq8kJRnJH6OkA?key=jFOAojz5I79KhxGlc9Okj9Vy\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"43-donovan-ezeiruaku-edge-boston-college\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e43. Donovan Ezeiruaku, Edge, Boston College\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eEzeiruaku doesn’t have overwhelming size, but he’s long (34-inch arm length) and is a disruptive pass rusher with a devastating swim move. He is a productive player who can consistently affect the passer and has twitchiness and enough length to overcome his lack of ideal size, but he can still get smothered by larger offensive tackles, especially in the run game.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile this might limit Ezeiruaku’s every-down projection at the next level, everyone loves pass rushers, and Ezeiruaku plays hard, is disruptive, has a pass-rush arsenal already and gets after the passer in a hurry.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"44-jack-sawyer-edge-ohio-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e44. Jack Sawyer, Edge, Ohio State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eSawyer is a (forgive me here) Jack-of-all-trades for the Buckeyes\u0026#39; defense. He can play the run, rush the passer or drop into coverage and fill multiple roles throughout the front seven.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSawyer is a solid athlete with strong hands who consistently bursts off the snap, and his hands are constantly working and that helps him win over and over again against blockers. He might not have a singular standout trait, but Sawyer’s ability to align across the defensive front on any given down will make him an interesting skeleton key-type player for a creative NFL defensive coordinator.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eSawyer’s arm length (31 3/4 inches) will concern some teams, but his strength, hands and relentlessness still allows him to be an effective football player.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"45-jt-tuimoloau-edge-ohio-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e45. JT Tuimoloau, Edge, Ohio State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eTuimoloau was flirting with the first round if he declared after the 2023 season. He decided to return to Columbus for a last hurrah and thank goodness he did!\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTuimoloau plays with good strength against the run and pass, and loves pushing the pocket (and poor offensive tackles) back into the quarterback. He can consistently set the edge and disrupt offenses in the run game and maintain position because of his strong hands and power.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTuimoloau has just-adequate bend but his overall pass-rushing skills and strong and competitive play style make him a valuable player on a front. I see him as more of a strong secondary edge who can contribute against both the run and pass than a true ace.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"46-devin-neal-rb-kansas\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e46. Devin Neal, RB, Kansas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eShifty is how I would describe Neal. The classic “quicker-than-fast”-type athlete, Neal has just average long speed, but he is a strong runner with good balance and vision.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNeal has a great feel for setting up his blocks and knowing when to plant his foot and accelerate through the hole. He is constantly finding ways to get effective yards and knows how to pace his runs on a variety of run concepts (even being frequently used as a wildcat QB at Kansas, too).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOn passing downs, Neal is a natural pass catcher who knows how to stay friendly to the QB and can get upfield after the catch quickly. He is also a good pass protector already, with both his eyes constantly going to the right assignment and his build, technique and strength allowing him to stonewall blitzers.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, Neal isn’t the sexiest running back in the world, but he’s an overall good player who contributes to winning football in a variety of ways.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"47-treveyon-henderson-rb-ohio-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e47. TreVeyon Henderson, RB, Ohio State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eHenderson’s ability to affect the game on all three downs, especially in pass protection, will give him a path to success alone at the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCombined with solid hands and real home run speed, with an efficient running style that lets him get downhill in a hurry, that will make him a strong contributor in any NFL offense. Henderson’s vision can be inconsistent at times (like most fast running backs, he has a tendency to unnecessarily bounce the run at times) and I like him best in a shared backfield where he can split some of the load and have someone take more of the “harder” runs between the tackles.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eStill, Henderson’s speed and pass-protection ability gives him a home in any running back room — and should give him a nice career, too.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"48-jaylin-noel-wr-iowa-state\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e48. Jaylin Noel, WR, Iowa State\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eNoel is an easy-moving athlete who did his best work in motion or from the slot at Iowa State.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNoel can quickly accelerate to top speed and is dangerous as an intermediate and downfield option because of his speed and excellent ball skills. Noel isn’t just a burner, though. His balance and body control show up as a route runner, where he consistently does a nice job of throttling his speeds and sinking on his routes to keep coverage defenders uneasy on breaking routes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eNoel has just adequate size (5-foot-10, 194 pounds, 29½-inch arm), but he plays with good strength and balance on his routes and at the catch point. He’s also a good blocker who doesn’t have to be hidden in the run game, something that will be paramount to his success if he stays in the slot full-time at the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt’s good to see him play with such a competitive edge and scrap it up with defenders.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eOverall, Noel is just a useful player. He can be an explosive play threat but also does enough inbetween stuff to contribute to winning football. He’s an ideal type of secondary receiver.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"49-riley-leonard-qb-notre-dame\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e49. Riley Leonard, QB, Notre Dame\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eI’m likely going to be one of the higher people on Leonard. I do think there is a lot to like and tools to work with for a Day 2 dart throw.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeonard has good size and is an excellent athlete who is a weapon on designed runs and in the open field. He has a good feel in the pocket (but can bail outside a bit too quickly at times) with an ability to mitigate sacks and pressure, something he has now shown behind two shaky offensive lines at Duke and then behind a — forgive the pun — \u003cem\u003egreen\u003c/em\u003e Notre Dame unit.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeonard is an accurate thrower underneath with some real flashes of layering throws (and some downright excellent throws like at the end of the game against Indiana in the CFP), but his deep ball remains a gigantic question mark. Some of that was Notre Dame’s iffy receiving core, but Leonard did shy away from pushing the ball at times.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLeonard’s tools, toughness and ability to avoid negative plays make him intriguing to me, and his overall passing has picked up as the season went along as Notre Dame’s offense – and personnel – started to mature. But he still has to show that he can execute those complex throws on a more consistent basis, which might never happen and will make him more just an interesting backup option.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut it’s not the worst bet to make on such a competitive player with this much athleticism — who shows more feel for the position than he gets credit for — could turn into a starter down the road.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch2 id=\"50-landon-jackson-edge-arkansas\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e50. Landon Jackson, Edge, Arkansas\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cp\u003eJackson is best when he can just line up and go. He is a good athlete but has long legs which can make it tough for him to bend and consistently turn the corner as a pass rusher (he will lose his feet a bit more often than you’d like).\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eJackson plays hard, though, and knows how to use his length when he strikes blockers in the run game. I would like to see him continue to add to his play strength, especially in his legs, and learn to become a true speed-to-power-type edge defender as a true 4-3 defensive end.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBut, his competitiveness and straight speed will allow him to be an early contributor as he continues to figure out his game and gets into a more focused role at the next level.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
