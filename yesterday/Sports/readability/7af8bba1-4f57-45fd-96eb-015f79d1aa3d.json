  "text": "The Detroit Lions franchise is in an unfamiliar position as the 2024 season winds down. Next Sunday, they'll take on the Vikings for all the NFC (regular-season) marbles in the first-ever in-season matchup of 13-plus-win teams. But before that home sendoff to the season, they're in San Francisco Monday night to take on a 49ers team that has limped through an injury-plagued season to the finish line.It seems like every position group in San Francisco has been decimated at one point or another this season by injury, and for Week 17, that's on the offensive line. Three starters — Aaron Banks, Spencer Burford and Colton McKivitz — are on the injury report heading into this week, with Banks and Burford out of practice and McKivitz a limited participant.Regardless of the outcome of Monday's game, next week's Sunday Night Football Vikings vs. Lions matchup in Detroit will be for the NFC's No. 1 seed. Head coach Dan Campbell says the Lions are \"bringing everything [they've] got to this game,\" and won't be resting any starters.Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium | Santa Clara, Calif.TV channel: ESPN, ABCStreaming: ESPN+, FuboLive4 updatesMon, December 30, 2024 at 5:58 PM MSTTeddy Bridgewater's warming up as Detroit's emergency quarterback:Mon, December 30, 2024 at 5:44 PM MSTBarring a tie in next week's Lions-Vikings clash, tonight's outcome does not matter in the race for the No. 1 seed. Thanks to a previous win over the Vikings, the Lions hold the tiebreaker edge over Minnesota and would secure the NFC North title and No. 1 seed in the NFC if both teams finish with a 14-3 record — an outcome that would result from a Lions loss tonight and win next week.The loser of next week's game will be relegated to the No. 5 seed and a first-round road game in the postseason.A loss by the Lions tonight would only come into play in the event of a tie next week. In that instance the Vikings would finish 14-2-1, ahead of the 13-3-1 Lions in the standings.Mon, December 30, 2024 at 4:55 PM MSTLions inactives: Teddy Bridgewater is emergency QBFresh off of coaching his high school alma mater to a state championship, Teddy Bridgewater will make his 2024 debut with the Lions as their emergency quarterback. Bridgewater signed for his second stint with the Lions last week and is highly unlikely to see the field Monday night.Mon, December 30, 2024 at 4:51 PM MSTJi'Ayir Brown, Colton McKivitz active for 49ersThere are no surprises of note with San Francisco's inactives.
