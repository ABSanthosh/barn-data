He made a nice catch on a pass behind him and then took Green Bay Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine's soul.Goedert initiated contact that included one small stiff-arm, then shoved off Valentine twice more, hitting him in the face, as he worked his way to the 24-yard touchdown. It's sure to become a meme.The Eagles needed something like that. They hadn't scored a touchdown since the opening minutes of the game. But when Goedert had his chance to turn things around he wasn't going to be denied, to the detriment of Valentine.",
