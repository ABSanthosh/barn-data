  "text": "Kevin PeltonJul 17, 2025, 07:10 PM ETClose Co-author, Pro Basketball Prospectus series Formerly a consultant with the Indiana Pacers Developed WARP rating and SCHOENE systemNBA free agency is underway, and teams are adding stars and making moves to fill their rosters for the 2025-26 season.Among the most impactful signings so far: Myles Turner leaving the defending Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers for the Milwaukee Bucks; max extensions for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Jaren Jackson Jr.; James Harden's new two-year deal with the LA Clippers; and the $52.6 million player option for LeBron James with the Los Angeles Lakers.As more deals get reported, we're grading the moves and examining what each means for next season and beyond.Jump to a deal: Booker's max extension | Ayton to Lakers Turner chooses Bucks | SGA's supermax Grizzlies max Jackson | LeBron's opt-in Finney-Smith to Rockets | Harden's new deal MORE: Trade grades | Offseason news, buzzJuly 17: Dame returns to Trail BlazersPortland Trail Blazers agreed to a reported three-year, $42 million contract with guard Damian LillardGrade: A-Lillard's return to Portland is a feel-good ending to an unhappy chapter with the Milwaukee Bucks that culminated in an Achilles injury and Lillard's release with two years remaining on his contract.Given the opportunity to pick his destination as a free agent for the first time in his career, Lillard opted to go back to where he starred over his first 11 NBA seasons and where his family and children still reside.In basketball terms, Lillard will be an interesting fit for a Blazers team that found a new identity without him during the second half of last season. Portland acquired Toumani Camara as part of the Lillard deal and turned the players and picks acquired from that trade into Deni Avdija, the two leading contributors to the Blazers going 23-18 in the second half of last season.Now, Portland has both Jrue Holiday (part of the return for Lillard, traded to the Boston Celtics days later and then reacquired this summer for Anfernee Simons) and Lillard along with the young talent those trades produced -- with more Milwaukee first-round picks and swaps still to convey.Given the timing of his left Achilles rupture in late April, it's unlikely Lillard will play a significant role for the Blazers this season. No NBA player since JJ Barea in 2019 has returned from an Achilles rupture faster than 10Â½ months after the injury, a timetable that would put Lillard back in mid-March at the earliest.Still, after striking a buyout with center Deandre Ayton -- another part of the Lillard deal -- on the eve of free agency, Portland could afford to use its non-taxpayer midlevel exception to pay Lillard on top of his $54 million guaranteed salary from the Bucks without going into the tax. This deal is really about having Lillard back for 2026-27, when a healthy version would have potentially commanded more than the $14 million the Blazers will pay him.By then, Portland should have a better idea of how its backcourt shakes out. The Simons trade should create more on-ball opportunities for Scoot Henderson during his third season, while the Blazers will know how much Holiday has left in the tank and the long-term future of shooting guard Shaedon Sharpe. Sharpe can be a restricted free agent next summer if he doesn't agree to an extension before the start of this season.There's still work for Portland to do, particularly if the team wants to be a player in free agency next summer. With Lillard's salary on the books, plus a $25.2 million cap hold for Sharpe, the Blazers might be better off staying over the cap as things stand. If Portland can get out of the final two years of veteran forward Jerami Grant's contract, however, it's possible the Blazers could open cap space for a run at another contributor.Give Lillard credit for negotiating a favorable deal. If Lillard comes back at a high level in 2026-27, a player option for the final season of this contract will allow him to collect more money the following season, when he's no longer being paid by Milwaukee. And after going to a destination that wasn't his initial target in the 2023 trade, Lillard got a no-trade clause, joining LeBron James as the only players in the league with one after Bradley Beal's was extinguished when he agreed to a buyout with the Phoenix Suns on Wednesday.July 16: Bradley Beal agrees to buyout with Suns, to join ClippersLA Clippers agreed to a reported two-year, $11 million contract with guard Bradley BealGrade: B+The Clippers have finally completed the second step in the plan we anticipated when they traded starting shooting guard Norman Powell to the Miami Heat last week in a deal that netted forward/center John Collins.With an open position in their lineup alongside James Harden in the backcourt, the Clippers became an obvious landing spot for Beal whenever he completed a buyout agreement with the Phoenix Suns.Powell was the better player last season, providing stronger efficiency on higher usage than Beal, who finished second in the league in scoring as recently as 2020-21 but transitioned to a complementary role in Phoenix. One surprising stat: Powell, who is coming off a career year, is a month older than Beal.Still, I can get why the Clippers preferred having both Beal and Collins to Powell and whoever else they could have added using the remainder of their non-taxpayer midlevel exception, even if it cost them a second-round pick (sent to the Utah Jazz in the trade) to make that exchange.Although he's no longer an All-Star, Beal's skill set scales down well. More of a volume 3-point shooter during his high-scoring days with the Washington Wizards, Beal hit 41% of his 3s during two seasons with the Suns. And with his role on offense diminished, Beal put more of his energy toward creating for others and defense, two important factors for the Clippers.Specifically, Beal's most important benefit to the Clippers seems to be leading a second-unit backcourt alongside Bogdan Bogdanovic with Harden on the bench. Without a traditional point guard behind Harden at the moment -- though Chris Paul remains an unrestricted free agent -- the Clippers appear headed toward having Beal and Bogdanovic fill that role by committee.Though the idea of Beal as a starting point guard lost its luster in Phoenix, he and Bogdanovic should provide sufficient playmaking against second units.Presumably, the Clippers will at least begin the season accomplishing that goal by staggering Beal's minutes with Harden's after they start together in the backcourt. It's hard to see Beal signing up for a return to the bench after unhappily playing that role during the second half of last season.Come the playoffs, assuming the Clippers get there in a loaded Western Conference, Ty Lue's decisions on which players to start could become more complicated. Starting Collins alongside Ivica Zubac in the frontcourt might be the Clippers' best option, but that would leave Kawhi Leonard as the team's primary wing defender, a role the Clippers probably want to take off his plate as much as possible to keep Leonard fresh for offense. Kris Dunn or Derrick Jones Jr. might fit better starting on the wing than Beal in that scenario.At this point, we'll consider that a good problem. The Clippers have an 82-game regular season to get through, and their depth will be important given the amount of time Beal -- who last played more than 53 games in the shortened 2020-21 campaign -- and Leonard tend to miss.Adding Beal at a max salary, particularly given the complication of his no-trade clause, proved a net negative for the Suns. The story is different now that the Clippers are getting him at a wildly different price point, with a player option giving Beal the chance to make up the money he gave back in a buyout or potentially even come out ahead if he plays well this season.It's worth addressing the Phoenix side of the equation. To some degree, the Suns might have benefited from the NBA rule limiting how much dead salary teams can have on their books after completing a waive-and-stretch. That meant Beal had to agree to reduce his guaranteed salary by nearly $14 million at a minimum for a legal buyout of this type, putting a floor on negotiations.Like the Milwaukee Bucks with Damian Lillard, the Suns will have Beal's salary on their books for five years if they agree to stretch it, with the upside of possibly getting out of the luxury tax altogether, per ESPN's Bobby Marks.Before we see how Phoenix responds, I wouldn't take this as an indication that owner Mat Ishbia is retrenching on spending along the lines of what we saw with Mikhail Prokhorov in Brooklyn after the Nets' trade for Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce went bust.After all, the limitations on teams spending over the second luxury tax apron in the new collective bargaining agreement mean there are basketball benefits to the Suns reducing their payroll by stretching Beal's salary. In fact, they could use the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel exception now, though it's unclear there are any free agents remaining that would sign up for that but not the veteran's minimum.Getting out of the second apron will allow Phoenix to aggregate salaries in trades and mean the Suns will have access to their non-taxpayer midlevel exception next summer if they lose center Mark Williams as a restricted free agent or he re-signs for his qualifying offer.I'm still not sure stretching Beal's salary will prove better for the Suns on the court in the long term than just riding out his remaining two seasons, but given how unpleasant his time in Phoenix seemed for both sides, I understand the desire to simply move on.July 10: Thunder extend Williams on a five-year dealOklahoma City Thunder agreed to a five-year, maximum extension with forward Jalen WilliamsGrade: Pass (extensions graded on a pass/fail scale)The third and presumably final max rookie extension for a 2022 first-round pick essentially split the difference between the first two.Like Paolo Banchero of the Orlando Magic, the other 2022 first-rounder to make an All-Star Game, Williams received 30% max criteria in his deal that will increase its value to a maximum of a projected $287 million if he makes All-NBA first team this season or is voted MVP or Defensive Player of the Year.Given Williams was an All-NBA third-team pick last season at age 23, the Thunder should certainly prepare as if he'll make more than the 25% max teammate Chet Holmgren will get on his max extension, agreed to Wednesday.As with Holmgren, Williams did not get the player option that Banchero secured in his extension. That's especially important as Oklahoma City plans well into the future. Williams wouldn't begin a potential supermax extension -- or hit unrestricted free agency -- until 2031-32 at the earliest.Given Williams has accomplished more through three seasons than Banchero, including averaging 23.6 points in the NBA Finals, he certainly had a case for securing a player option.From a big-picture standpoint, the Thunder now have both Holmgren and Williams under contract through 2030-31 and MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander signed through 2029-30 (with a player option for 2030-31) after he completed his own supermax extension last week.The size of those contracts, which guarantee the three players approximately 85% of the salary cap when Gilgeous-Alexander's deal begins in 2027-28, will present challenges to Oklahoma City maintaining its depth. But the Thunder have been planning for that moment since before drafting Holmgren and Williams and have the financial flexibility and draft picks to ensure continued contention throughout their stars' prime years.July 9: Booker gets max extension from SunsPhoenix Suns agreed to a reported two-year, max extension with guard Devin BookerGrade: Fail (extensions graded pass/fail)This extension adds two years to Booker's contract, which already runs through 2027-28, starting at the maximum 35% of the cap when it's set in the summer of 2028. Currently, that's estimated at $70 million, which could be the largest salary in the NBA depending on how much the cap grows from the 2026-27 season, when Shai Gilgeous-Alexander begins a supermax extension.It doesn't take advanced statistical projections to suggest that Booker will probably not merit a $70 million-plus salary. Despite playing 75 games last season, his most since 2016-17, Booker was neither chosen an All-Star nor to an All-NBA team. He's made All-NBA just twice in his career and only received MVP votes once. (That came in 2021-22, when Booker finished fourth in the voting and was chosen for the All-NBA first team.)During his prime, Booker has been more like a top 25 NBA player than a top 10 one. And while he should still be an All-Star contender by the time this extension kicks in, shortly before his 32nd birthday, it's more likely that Booker will be a complementary piece than the centerpiece the Suns have made him.It's understandable that Phoenix would value a star player who wants to be there after the Suns traded Kevin Durant and as they consider a buyout for Bradley Beal. Booker has played his entire career in Phoenix and was the most important catalyst as the Suns went from 10 consecutive seasons in the lottery to the 2021 NBA Finals. Yes, Chris Paul was key to that season, but Paul likely would not have come to Phoenix without the promise Booker showed.Still, Booker's loyalty didn't translate into any kind of discount, and the Suns are taking a considerable risk by agreeing to this extension with so much time remaining on Booker's current contract.One key question in evaluating any extension is whether a player will have more trade value after striking the deal. In this case, because Booker will get the maximum raise between the two seasons of the deal, he won't be tradeable for six months. The question is more a hypothetical one. I suspect Booker would have more value to other teams on his current contract.Certainly, Phoenix hopes that question is moot and the team can rebuild a contender around him. In the event the Suns' missing draft picks and a potential stretch of Beal's contract doom them to remain in the lottery, either Booker's commitment to The Valley or his trade value might be tested before this extension even begins.July 9: Holmgren agrees to max deal with OKCOklahoma City Thunder agreed to a reported five-year, max rookie extension with center Chet HolmgrenGrade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail)Compared with the other two max rookie extensions we expect from the 2022 first round -- one for Paolo Banchero reported Monday and one yet to be completed with Holmgren's Thunder teammate Jalen Williams -- this was a bit less of a no-brainer.From a performance standpoint, Holmgren has met expectations since being drafted No. 2 behind Banchero. He finished second to Victor Wembanyama in Rookie of the Year voting and was one of three double-figure scorers for Oklahoma City during the team's championship run.Given Holmgren's ability to impact a game at both ends with his 37% career 3-point shooting and 2.3 blocks per game, there's a case to be made that he has been more effective on a per-minute basis than Banchero despite not being named to an All-Star team.Yet durability remains a concern with Holmgren, who has missed extended periods due to a pair of rare, serious injuries -- a Lisfranc fracture that sidelined him his entire first NBA season and a hip fracture in November. He has played just 114 regular-season games, compared with 198 for Banchero and 215 for Williams.Nobody knows Holmgren's medicals better than the Thunder, however, and given their record as a front office, I'm inclined to believe them that his fluke injuries don't tell us anything about his health going forward despite any concerns about his thin frame.Although Holmgren got the max, the Thunder held the line in other areas. Holmgren did not get a player option like Banchero, and even if he reaches 30% max criteria by winning MVP or Defensive Player of the Year or making an All-NBA team, Holmgren's extension will start at 25% of the cap. By contrast, Banchero could reach the full 30% max, projected at $287 million.As Oklahoma City prepares for a financial future that includes a supermax extension struck last week with MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander plus a coming extension for Williams, those wins on the edges could be crucial. At the same time, Holmgren is assured life-changing money no matter what happens with his health, making this deal a win-win.July 7: Magic give Banchero rookie max extensionThe Orlando Magic agreed to a reported five-year, $239 max extension with forward Paolo Banchero.Grade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail)That sound you just heard is the Oklahoma City Thunder's front office yelling in frustration about Banchero becoming the first player to get an option in a max rookie extension since Luka Doncic and Trae Young both did in 2021. That precedent could be relevant as the Thunder negotiate with the two other 2022 first-round picks likely to get max extensions: Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams.There are, generally speaking, two points of negotiation on what ESPN's Brian Windhorst has termed the \"fun\" max for players concluding their rookie contracts.One is eligibility for 30% max criteria that boost the starting value of the extension from the typical 25% to as high as 30% if the player earns All-NBA honors, MVP or Defensive Player of the Year. Banchero also received this in his new deal.The other negotiating point is a player option, and teams have held the line there since Doncic and Young. Anthony Edwards didn't get one coming off making the All-Star team in his third season. Nor did Ja Morant, the most accomplished player at the same stage of his career since Doncic and Young, after Morant made the All-NBA second team in Year 3.Certainly, Banchero is a promising young player in his own right. The No. 1 draft pick in 2022, he made his All-Star debut at age 21 and improved his statistical output last season. An oblique tear in October prevented Banchero from making a run at becoming the first player since Doncic with multiple All-Star appearances in his first three seasons.Still, there's a gap between Doncic -- an All-NBA first-team pick in his second and third campaigns -- and Banchero, who has yet to finish in the top 20 in All-NBA voting. (He wasn't eligible last season following the injury.)I'm surprised the Magic weren't able to lean on the recent track record to strike a deal without a player option, which could allow Banchero to escalate his salary to the supermax a year earlier, if he qualifies, or potentially become an unrestricted free agent in 2030 near his peak at age 27.That follows Orlando giving Franz Wagner a max extension last summer, before he'd earned corresponding accolades. Wagner probably would have merited a max offer sheet as a restricted free agent this offseason, though the Brooklyn Nets were the only team that could plausibly make such an offer.In the wake of Banchero joining No. 3 pick Jabari Smith Jr. as the second player drafted in the 2022 first round to strike an extension, it's worth watching the Thunder's duo of Holmgren (drafted between Banchero and Smith) and Williams. No. 12 pick Williams is the other All-Star from the 2022 draft, and his play as Oklahoma City won the NBA championship gives him a strong case for a player option on his own max deal.July 2: Ayton agrees to deal with LakersLos Angeles Lakers agreed to a reported two-year contract with center Deandre AytonGrade: B+After agreeing to a buyout with the Portland Trail Blazers, Ayton seemed like a fit for the Lakers, and not just because of the symmetry of pairing the No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft with No. 3 pick Luka Doncic. (No. 2 pick Marvin Bagley III is a free agent if the Lakers want to complete the trio.)At nearly 27 years old, Ayton is substantially younger than the Lakers' other center options using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception. Realistically, the Lakers were looking at 39-year-old Al Horford or 37-year-old Brook Lopez, with Luke Kornet (soon to be 30) as the other candidate.If things work out, Ayton could be a long-term option for the Lakers in the way the veterans are not while also supplying more of a lob threat for Doncic in the pick-and-roll. We saw with Jaxson Hayes last season how powerful vertical spacing can be in the context of a Lakers offense with Doncic, LeBron James and Austin Reaves as pick-and-roll ball handlers. Hayes shot 74% after the All-Star break, averaging 13.4 points per 36 minutes -- up from 11.8 before break.But the rest of Hayes' skill set wasn't starter caliber, which explains why he quickly fell out of coach J.J. Redick's rotation during the opening round of the playoffs. Hayes did not reach 10 minutes in any game against the Minnesota Timberwolves and was a DNP-CD in the deciding Game 5.Ayton was one of the NBA's most prolific pick-and-roll finishers during his time with the Phoenix Suns, ranking third in points scored as a screen setter in both 2021-22 and 2022-23, according to GeniusIQ tracking. Ayton hasn't been nearly as effective running pick-and-roll with the Blazers' ball handlers and weaker spacing the past two seasons, shooting just 58% on resulting shot attempts as compared to 62% over his last three years in Phoenix.Although Ayton is only a marginal upgrade over Hayes as a rim protector, his superior size makes Ayton a better defensive rebounder. That should keep Ayton on the court against playoff-caliber opposition.By splitting the non-taxpayer midlevel exception between Ayton and Jake LaRavia, the Lakers have gone from five players Redick trusted during the playoffs -- a group that included Dorian Finney-Smith, who left for the Houston Rockets as an unrestricted free agent -- to hopefully six. Going beyond that number will depend on the development of the Lakers' young talent, most notably Dalton Knecht, and in-season moves.James' decision to exercise his $52.6 million player option rather than potentially re-signing for the $54.1 million maximum salary for players with 10-plus years of experience leaves the Lakers with some wiggle room below the lower luxury-tax apron, which will serve as a hard cap for them because they used the non-taxpayer midlevel. If the Lakers keep 14 players on their roster and waive Shake Milton, whose $3 million salary is non-guaranteed, they can add about $5 million in salary via trade or the biannual exception.Depending on what James thinks of Ayton, those moves might not be sufficient to convince him the Lakers have built a championship-caliber roster after losing in the first round. The Lakers have their 2031 first-round pick or potential swaps in 2026, 2028, 2030 and 2032 that could turn the expiring contracts of Maxi Kleber and Gabe Vincent into significant contributors -- the kind of win-now move James would surely prefer they make in his age-41 season.Without knowing exactly what's on the table for the Lakers, I think signing Ayton is the right call for now. He increases their playoff ceiling if accepting a buyout from Portland and signing for a small fraction of his previous max salary gets Ayton to buy in to a degree we haven't seen since he helped the Suns to the 2021 Finals.Meanwhile, waiting will give the Lakers more information about what they need and who might become available by the trade deadline. If the Lakers put their unprotected pick and swaps on the table, they should be able to add a starting-caliber player at that point.Of course, I'm not the person the Lakers need to convince. Nor is James, no matter how many statements he and agent Rich Paul release. The real pivot point for the Lakers' offseason will be Doncic's decision on signing an extension ahead of what could be the final season of his contract. Doncic is eligible for an extension starting Aug. 2, and that's when we'll really be able to grade the Lakers.July 2: Hornets retain Mann, add guard depth with DinwiddieCharlotte Hornets agreed to re-sign guard Tre Mann to a reported three-year, $24 million deal; agreed to a reported one-year deal with guard Spencer DinwiddieGradesMann: B- Dinwiddie: BWhen the Hornets acquired Collin Sexton from the Utah Jazz on Sunday, I wrote that Sexton's addition addressed a Charlotte need for playmaking with LaMelo Ball on the bench. After bringing back Mann and adding Dinwiddie, the Hornets appear insistent on ensuring that issue never comes up this season.A season-ending injury to Mann in November was a big factor in that weakness. In 13 games before experiencing disc irritation that eventually required surgery, Mann averaged 14.1 PPG in just 24.5 MPG off the bench. That was fueled in part by 40% 3-point shooting, which Charlotte can't necessarily expect to continue. Mann has shot 35% over his four-year career.Despite that quibble, there's reason to believe Mann can carve out a key role as a bench scorer. He had a nice 28-game run for the Hornets as a starter after being acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder at the 2024 trade deadline while shooting a more modest 36% on 3s. Mann averaged 5.2 APG in that role, an encouraging sign of his ability to create for others.A first-round pick by the Thunder in 2021, Mann is still just 24. As long as he stays healthy, Mann should have more development in front of him.The Luka Doncic trade and Kyrie Irving's ACL tear thrust Dinwiddie into an unexpectedly large role with the Dallas Mavericks last season. He started 30 games and played 2,000-plus minutes for the third consecutive season. That role surely overexposed Dinwiddie, who fell out of the team's rotation for the play-in.As a fifth guard in Charlotte, Dinwiddie is overqualified to serve as injury insurance. Adding him does create a roster jam for the Hornets, who had 10 players under guaranteed contract including Mann, plus four draft picks and three players on non-guaranteed deals.Charlotte could waive Pat Connaughton after acquiring him from the Milwaukee Bucks in a salary-related deal, while the Hornets might also move on from Josh Okogie's non-guaranteed $7.75 million deal.July 1: Turner to Bucks on four-year dealMilwaukee Bucks agreed to a reported four-year, $107 million deal with center Myles TurnerGrade: B-For multiple reasons, this is the most truly shocking development in NBA free agency perhaps since Paul George was traded to the LA Clippers in 2019, convincing Kawhi Leonard to simultaneously sign with the Clippers weeks after winning MVP of the NBA Finals.Turner seemed like a lock to re-sign with the Indiana Pacers, having started Game 7 of the NBA Finals for them nine days ago. Meanwhile, the Bucks' ambitions in free agency seemed much more modest after an opening day of free agency that suggested they would stay over the cap and use the non-taxpayer midlevel exception to replace departed starter Brook Lopez.With two-time MVP Giannis Antetokounmpo monitoring their offseason to evaluate his future in Milwaukee, the Bucks thought far bigger. Bigger in part as the biggest waive and stretch in NBA history involving Damian Lillard, whose entire $112.6 million extension that begins today will be stretched over five seasons, sitting on Milwaukee's cap sheet for $22.5 million through 2029-30.That move alone isn't enough to create the cap room necessary for the Bucks to sign Turner to this deal. Milwaukee subsequently agreed to a trade sending Pat Connaughton to the Charlotte Hornets with draft picks for Vasilije Micic. If Milwaukee can agree to a buyout with Micic, whose interest in returning to Europe was reported during last season, that should make up the difference.In many ways, Turner is like a younger version of Lopez, whose signing helped kick-start this era of Bucks contention. Having a center who can both protect the rim and take that responsibility off Antetokounmpo's plate and stretch the floor for him on offense is the ideal scenario for Milwaukee. Besides Lopez, who is 37, the only other center in free agency who fills both of those roles is Al Horford -- who is two years older than Lopez.That made Turner, 29, the only real option for the Bucks to pair with Antetokounmpo through the rest of what they hope will be the remainder of his prime spent in Milwaukee. Turner is coming off the best 3-point season of his career, having averaged 2.2 per game at a 40% clip, and his career 36% accuracy is a tad better than what Lopez shot over his entire seven seasons with the Bucks.Turner's defensive upside isn't quite as high as Lopez's. He topped out at fifth in Defensive Player of the Year voting, where Lopez was second in 2022-23. But Turner was often asked to serve as the only rim protector for the Pacers before Pascal Siakam's arrival. He has never played with a secondary defender as strong as Antetokounmpo. And opponents shot slightly better against the slowing Lopez inside five feet last year, per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats, than they did against Turner.Certainly, the contrast between Lopez and Turner was on full display when the two centers met in the first round of the playoffs. Turner averaged 16.8 PPG and 2.2 BPG as Indiana won the series in five games, part of a strong postseason run. Lopez totaled just eight points and one block in the final three games against the Pacers, yielding his starting job to backup Bobby Portis for what proved to be Lopez's final game in Milwaukee.That said, Lopez wasn't the only reason, or even the primary reason, the Bucks lost that series. Their starting wing duo of Kyle Kuzma and Taurean Prince was invisible against Indiana, combining for 35 points on 14-of-45 shooting. Milwaukee hasn't yet done anything to address that weakness.If the Bucks are as serious about contending as this move suggests, it's imperative that they use their remaining draft assets (an unprotected 2032 first-round pick, plus a swap in 2031 or re-swapping picks that either the New Orleans Pelicans or Portland Trail Blazers can swap) to upgrade from Kuzma. Cam Johnson, perhaps the cleanest replacement, is already off the board after a trade agreed to Monday sent him to the Denver Nuggets.Failing that, while I credit Milwaukee for creativity and boldness of this move, I'm not sure the Bucks are much closer to championship contention. Waiving Lillard takes away the upside of him potentially returning from an Achilles rupture in the playoffs to play at a high level. Turner, the third option at best in the Pacers' offense, is now the only player besides Antetokounmpo on the roster who averaged even 15 points last season.If Antetokounmpo decides at some point he's ready to move on from Milwaukee, the good news is Turner should have more trade value on this contract than Lillard would have making the max. The downside is the Bucks' eventual rebuild will be saddled by not controlling their own draft picks and by the cap hit for the Lillard stretch. Milwaukee might not be able to stretch players making appreciable salary for the next five years because of the CBA rule that limits teams to 15% of the current cap as dead salary after a stretch is completed.The news is worse for the Pacers, who lost a key contributor to their Finals run in his late prime. Indiana should now be able to use the full $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel to replace Turner without pushing into the luxury tax, whereas matching this offer to Turner would have required the Pacers to trade one of their rotation players to avoid the tax.Still, if ever there was a time for a small-market team like Indiana to pay the tax, it's coming off getting within one win of a championship. Tyrese Haliburton's Achilles rupture in Game 7 of the NBA Finals changes expectations for the Pacers next season, but Turner would have remained a valuable starter beyond Haliburton's return to full strength in 2026-27.Already, center depth was one of Indiana's biggest needs after two backups (Isaiah Jackson and James Wiseman) suffered Achilles ruptures during the 2024-25 regular season. The Pacers alternated journeymen Thomas Bryant (an unrestricted free agent) and Tony Bradley (whose team option was exercised) in the playoffs. So there's no replacement for Turner on the roster in the short or long term.July 1: SGA gets supermax extension from OKCOklahoma City Thunder agreed to a reported four-year, supermax extension for guard Shai Gilgeous-AlexanderGrade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail)The NBA added the so-called \"supermax\" designated veteran extension to the 2017 collective bargaining agreement in large part because of Kevin Durant leaving the Thunder for the Golden State Warriors in 2016, so it's fitting Oklahoma City now benefits from being able to use the supermax with another MVP.Back then, restrictive rules around raises in extensions and the salary-cap jump precipitated by new national TV deals made a Durant extension unrealistic even had he preferred to stay with the Thunder. The situation is dramatically different now, meaning the only question was whether Gilgeous-Alexander would sign the supermax this summer or wait until next year when he could have added a fifth year to his contract.In an ideal world, Gilgeous-Alexander might have taken slightly less than the full 35% of the cap that a supermax extension allows as a starting point. (The actual value of the contract, currently projected at $285 million by ESPN's Bobby Marks, won't be known until the salary cap is set for the 2027-28 season.)Gilgeous-Alexander has earned every penny of the supermax, certainly, and Oklahoma City is more prepared than any team in NBA history has been for its stars to get raises. In addition to Gilgeous-Alexander, Thunder All-Star Jalen Williams and starter Chet Holmgren are eligible for rookie extensions this summer that will kick in for 2026-27.Knowing these contracts were coming, Oklahoma City has been looking ahead for years with team options and contracts that decrease on an annual basis, giving the Thunder the flexibility to shed salary without needing to pay for the privilege. And the unprecedented stockpile of first-round picks Oklahoma City accumulated during its rebuild means the team will continue incorporating cheaper contributors to replace parts of the 2025 champions and stay in contention throughout Gilgeous-Alexander's prime years.July 1: Bucks land deals with Harris, SimsMilwaukee Bucks agreed to a reported two-year deal with guard Gary Harris; agreed to a reported two-year deal with center Jericho SimsGradesHarris grade: C Sims grade: B-After Tuesday's stunning pair of moves -- waiving Damian Lillard and stretching his salary to make room to sign center Myles Turner -- the Bucks continued filling out their roster later in the day.At this point, Harris is a bigger name than he is as a contributor. Harris averaged just 14.8 minutes on an Orlando Magic team desperate for perimeter production last season and scored just 3.0 points. A regular starter as recently as the 2023-24 season, Harris could sop up bench minutes in a 3-and-D role but doesn't really fill a need for Milwaukee.If anything, shooting guard is probably the strongest part of the Bucks' depth chart outside of power forward. Milwaukee agreed to re-sign Gary Trent Jr. Monday and still has sharpshooter AJ Green, two of the five players coach Doc Rivers trusted by the end of the Bucks' first-round series against the Indiana Pacers. Green and Trent combined for 14 3-pointers and 52 points in Game 5.Sims, acquired midseason from the New York Knicks, also featured in the rotation ahead of Brook Lopez. Sims gave Milwaukee some good minutes during Bobby Portis' NBA suspension and is a reliable third center.The biggest quibble here is how many player options the Bucks are handing out this summer. Trent, Kevin Porter Jr. and Taurean Prince also got so-called \"one-plus-one deals\" with a player option for 2026-27.Several teams got burned by player options they handed out in the summer of 2023, which saddled them with underperformers clogging up roster spots. Milwaukee risks the same issue, and I'm not sure Harris and Sims are better enough than the alternative choices to merit getting player options.July 1: Knicks land backup big YabuseleNew York Knicks agreed to a reported two-year, $12 million contract with forward/center Guerschon YabuseleGrade: BYabusele was a rare bright spot in the Philadelphia 76ers' lost season. Back in the NBA for the first time since 2019 after starring for the French national team in the Olympics, Yabusele started 43 games on a minimum contract and averaged 11.0 points and 5.6 rebounds.With the Sixers pushing the luxury tax before re-signing restricted free agent Quentin Grimes, Yabusele was expendable in free agency. Enter the Knicks, who will add him to a frontcourt rotation of Josh Hart, Mitchell Robinson and Karl-Anthony Towns.Stretched as a center in place of Joel Embiid for Philadelphia because he's not a rim protector at all (0.5 blocks per 36 minutes), Yabusele should fit better in New York. We saw during the Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers the benefit to the Knicks of playing with more size in the frontcourt than the 6-foot-4 Hart provides.At 6-foot-8, Yabusele is a happy medium between Hart and playing Robinson and Towns together. And a Towns-Yabusele frontcourt will give New York five-out spacing. Yabusele hit 38% from 3-point range last season, attempting more than five 3s per 36 minutes.Utilizing the taxpayer midlevel exception to sign Yabusele will require some creative cap management from the Knicks. New York is pushing right up against the resulting hard cap at the second luxury tax apron and will likely take advantage of second-round picks counting less against the aprons in its first two seasons than other players signed for the minimum.As a result, the Knicks might be done maneuvering this summer barring a trade, with Yabusele and Jordan Clarkson as the veteran newcomers to the team that reached last year's conference finals. In a wide-open East, any boost they provide could make the difference for New York. And Yabusele is young enough at 29 to be a long-term option for the Knicks, who won't likely have access to their midlevel exception next summer if they extend the contract of forward Mikal Bridges and push into the second apron.July 1: Denver adds Hardaway to summer signingsDenver Nuggets agreed to a reported one-year deal with guard Tim Hardaway Jr.Grade: A-Clearly, these are no longer Calvin Booth's Nuggets. Hardaway was precisely the sort of veteran Booth preferred not to add to Denver's bench as GM, wanting those minutes given to recent draft picks Julian Strawther and Peyton Watson -- much to the dismay of former coach Michael Malone.Hardaway started all of his 77 games last season for the Detroit Pistons and averaged 31.3 minutes in the playoffs. Hardaway's role in Detroit's turnaround was overrated but apparently other NBA teams weren't moved, freeing the Nuggets to add him at a bargain price. Along with fellow free agent Bruce Brown and trade addition Jonas Valanciunas, Hardaway strengthens what's now looking like a deep Denver bench.As a volume 3-point shooter (2.2 per game last season, his fewest since 2016-17 but surpassed only by Jamal Murray and former Nugget Michael Porter Jr. among Denver players), Hardaway most clearly competes with Strawther. The 2023 first-round pick played just 88 minutes in the 2025 playoffs.If new Denver coach David Adelman couldn't trust Strawther in the playoffs, when the Nuggets' rotation shrunk to seven players at times, better to bring in someone Adelman will play. With 14 players now under contract, Denver seems just about finished with a makeover that has strengthened its chances of knocking off the Oklahoma City Thunder next spring.July 1: Raptors extend Poeltl; add Mamukelashvili to bolster benchToronto Raptors agreed to a reported four-year, $104 million extension with center Jakob Poeltl; agreed to a reported two-year, $5.5 million deal with forward/center Sandro MamukelashviliGradesPoeltl: Fail (extensions graded on pass/fail) Mamukelashvili: B+Since sending what became the No. 8 pick of the 2024 draft to get Poeltl at the 2023 trade deadline, the Raptors have consistently valued him like an above-average starting center. Toronto re-signed Poeltl to a four-year, $78 million contract the following summer and is now giving him nearly the largest possible raise off that contract.Technically, Poeltl could have added $88.5 million on a three-year extension after exercising a $19.5 million player option for 2026-27. This deal pays him nearly but not quite that amount, adding $84.5 million in new money for the total of $104 million after this season.The Raptors can point to Poeltl's adjusted plus-minus impact as evidence of his value. According to xRAPM, from the co-creator of ESPN's Real Plus-Minus (Jerry Engelmann), Poeltl rates 2.2 points per 100 possessions better than league average, putting him in the 89th percentile leaguewide.There are two problems with applying that rating to Poeltl's extension. The first is it's unlikely the rest of the league values Poeltl as highly, so it's certainly possible Toronto could have gotten him back as an unrestricted free agent next summer (or in 2027) for less money and it's unlikely the Raptors would have been outbid.The second concern is how Poeltl will age. He'll be 32 when this extension kicks in for the 2027-28 season and 34 by the end of it. Already, Poeltl's rim protection hasn't rated as well since rejoining Toronto as it did with the San Antonio Spurs. Opponents have hit better than 60% of attempts inside the restricted area with Poeltl as the primary defender over the past three seasons, per GeniusIQ tracking, as compared to 53.5% in 2020-21 and 56% in 2021-22.From a bigger-picture standpoint, the Raptors continue to invest in a core that hasn't yet proved capable of making the playoffs. Poeltl gives Toronto four starters under contract for a combined $145 million in 2027-28, and granting that one of them (Brandon Ingram, acquired at the trade deadline) has yet to make his Raptors debut, it's far from clear that this group is good enough to contend in the East.Given that context and the lack of urgency to extend Poeltl, I would have waited. This exact deal would not have been possible once the season started, but if Poeltl was willing to exercise his player option, Toronto could have executed an identical contract before the start of free agency next summer. In signing a deal that won't kick in for two years, I think the Raptors are taking on too much risk for too little reward.I'm much higher on the Mamukelashvili signing. He averaged 20.4 points per 36 minutes for the Spurs last season, including a 34-point outburst on 13-of-14 shooting against the New York Knicks in March. Mamukelashvili shooting 37% on a reasonable sample of 3-point attempts (161) was encouraging, since he has long been accurate inside the arc.If Mamukelashvili can shoot, I particularly like the idea of pairing him with either Jonathan Mogbo or Collin Murray-Boyles in second-unit frontcourts. Both supply the defensive playmaking that is a weakness for Mamukelashvili. For the cost, this is a worthwhile flier for Toronto.July 1: Kings add PG Schroder on three-year dealSacramento Kings agreed to a reported three-year, $45 million contract with guard Dennis SchroderGrade: C-New Sacramento GM Scott Perry seemed to signal the Kings' pursuit of a point guard when he called the lack of a traditional playmaker an \"obvious need\" during his introduction to local media. Although that statement is hard to dispute, I'm not convinced playmaking was actually Sacramento's biggest shortcoming.After the Kings reshuffled their roster by trading De'Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs in a three-team deal that netted Zach LaVine as a replacement, they essentially filled point guard by committee. LaVine and nominal small forward DeMar DeRozan are capable ball handlers, as are guards Keon Ellis and Malik Monk.After the All-Star break, Sacramento did rank 25th in the NBA in assist rate. Then again, that's not necessarily such a bad thing. The 64-win Cleveland Cavaliers were one spot behind the Kings, while the LA Clippers (who went 19-9 after the break) were one spot ahead. Overall, Sacramento's 12th-ranked offense after the break was less of a factor in the team's 12-15 finish to end up in the play-in than rating 22nd in defensive rating over that span.To some degree, Schroder could help there. He's capable of providing full-court pressure on opposing ball handlers. Still, the 6-foot-1 Schroder makes the Kings even smaller on the perimeter, and he's certainly a downgrade defensively as compared to Ellis.Offensively, Schroder has always been better cast as a playmaker off the bench than as a starter. His value has fluctuated in large part with his 3-point percentage. Schroder shot 38.5% during 2019-20, when he averaged 18.9 points and finished second in Sixth Man of the Year voting, but he hasn't reached that height over a full season while playing for seven teams in five years -- not counting two separate stints with the Los Angeles Lakers.Schroder was at his best starting last season with the Brooklyn Nets, where he hit 39% of 3s and averaged 18.4 points and 6.6 rebounds. Schroder fit like oil and water with the remaining Splash Brother after a December trade to the Golden State Warriors, shooting 37.5% in 24 games for the Warriors before being sent to the Detroit Pistons in the Jimmy Butler III trade. Schroder played an important bench role for Detroit, averaging 12.5 points in the Pistons' hard-fought first-round loss to the New York Knicks.Whether Schroder fills the right need for Sacramento, the other question is handing out a three-year contract to a player who will turn 32 in September. Given how important Schroder's quickness is to his playmaking, any drop-off should be a major concern.Signing Schroder to this contract necessitated the Kings making the trade reported Tuesday sending backup center Jonas Valanciunas to the Denver Nuggets for Dario Saric, a clear downgrade in terms of on-court production justified only by Saric's smaller salary. Based on that cost, I undoubtedly would have preferred offering Tyus Jones a deal similar to the one he signed with the Orlando Magic for one year and $7 million.June 30: JJJ gets massive extension with Memphis, Aldama returnsMemphis Grizzlies agreed to a five-year, $240 million renegotiation and extension with forward/center Jaren Jackson Jr.; agreed to re-sign forward Santi Aldama to a three-year, $52.5 million contractGradesJackson: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail) Aldama: B-As part of what already has been a busy offseason and presumably isn't finished yet, the Grizzlies struck a pair of new deals with current players in the opening hours of free agency.Getting Jackson signed was the more pressing business for Memphis. Based on Jackson's existing $23.4 million salary in the final season of his contract, the Grizzlies could add a maximum of $147 million over four years on an extension after he fell short of qualifying for a supermax extension as a player with All-NBA honors. (Jackson was 17th in the voting, 13 points shy of making the third team.)Using cap space to renegotiate Jackson's 2025-26 salary upward allowed Memphis to make a more competitive extension offer. This structure presumably adds $10 million to Jackson's current contract, allowing his starting salary to bump up to $46 million or so in 2026-27. That's still shy of the max Jackson could have made as an unrestricted free agent next summer ($50 million, based on the NBA's updated projection of a 7% cap increase), but getting more money now helps make up that difference.All told, Jackson is adding $217 million in new money, as compared to the projected $219 million other teams could have offered on a four-max in 2026 free agency. Locking in the security of a massive deal now in a place Jackson wants to play is probably worth the modest difference.From the Grizzlies' perspective, this is still a huge win. They take the potential of Jackson leaving in free agency off the table, as well as the possibility of him qualifying for the supermax by making All-NBA next season. Creating cap space by moving Marcus Smart for expiring contracts at the trade deadline did cost Memphis a first-round pick, but I'd say that gamble paid off.Technically, the Grizzlies don't yet have the cap room necessary to complete this deal. ESPN's Shams Charania reported that Memphis does not need to make a trade, suggesting the team will waive players and stretch its salary if no deal materializes before then. Doing so with reserve forward John Konchar wouldn't create quite enough space, so the Grizzlies are probably looking at letting newly acquired guard Cole Anthony go. If stretched, Anthony would count $5.2 million against Memphis' cap through 2029-30.Trading a player or stretching their salary is necessary to allow the Grizzlies to retain full Bird rights for Aldama, who averaged career highs in points (12.5), rebounds (6.4) and assists (2.9) per game in the final season of his rookie contract. Still just 24, Aldama figures to remain a key part of Memphis' rotation through the life of his contract.Given the limited amount of cap space available this summer and Aldama's modest qualifying offer ($5.9 million), it's possible the Grizzlies could have squeezed him more on this deal. Aldama will make far more than the $44 million that is the most other teams could have offered over this span using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception.The upside for Memphis is getting to structure Aldama's contract in a favorable manner. I'd guess his contract will start at its highest point before descending, allowing the Grizzlies to stuff as much salary as possible on their books for this season. Memphis is nowhere near the luxury-tax line and has plenty of flexibility to use its $8.8 million room exception to add a contributor. The Grizzlies have been linked to Cleveland Cavaliers guard Ty Jerome, an unrestricted free agent.June 30: Hawks land Alexander-Walker and KennardAtlanta Hawks agreed to a reported four-year, $62 million contract with guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker via sign-and-trade; agreed to a reported one-year, $11 million deal with guard Luke KennardGradesAlexander-Walker: A- Kennard: BThe market for Alexander-Walker, already likely to be robust, surely benefited from the way the postseason played out. Having multiple point-of-attack defenders proved crucial in the late rounds of the playoffs because of the way teams utilized full-court, on-ball pressure. And if those defenders can make 3s, all the better.Alexander-Walker also helped his own cause with a strong series against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference finals, combining for 52 points in Games 2, 3 and 4 on 19-of-32 shooting. Those performances helped assure Alexander-Walker would be out of Minnesota's price range unless the Timberwolves were willing to let either Naz Reid or Julius Randle walk, making Alexander-Walker gettable as well as coveted.Ultimately, the Hawks utilized the $25 million trade exception they created in last summer's Dejounte Murray trade to offer Alexander-Walker ever so slightly more than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception, which topped out at $60.6 million over four years. Per ESPN's Shams Charania, Atlanta will send a Cleveland 2027 second-round draft pick and cash to Minnesota to complete the deal.That continues a strong offseason for the Hawks under first-year general manager Onsi Saleh. Atlanta previously added Kristaps Porzingis in a three-team trade that has yet to have officially been completed, as well as a valuable 2026 first-round pick in a draft-night deal.Alexander-Walker slides into the rotation spot vacated by Caris LeVert, who agreed Monday to sign with the Detroit Pistons on a similar two-year deal. Alexander-Walker is four years younger, making him a better fit for Atlanta's timetable. He also is capable of playing some point guard alongside Dyson Daniels, giving the Hawks a fearsome defensive backcourt when starter Trae Young is on the bench.Later Monday, Atlanta continued building its depth by adding Kennard on a one-year deal for $11 million. A 44% career 3-point shooter, Kennard led the league in accuracy in both 2021-22 and 2022-23. The Hawks now go four deep in the backcourt and are probably close to complete with their offseason moves.Before the dust settles, it's tough to say exactly where Atlanta ranks in the Eastern Conference. If Porzingis can stay on the court for most of the season, however, the Hawks look well-positioned to avoid the play-in tournament for the first time since reaching the 2021 East finals. And although the San Antonio Spurs own swap rights on Atlanta's first-round pick, the draft-night trade gives the Hawks a chance at lottery luck, too.June 30: Lopez heads to Clippers on two-year dealLA Clippers agreed to a reported two-year, $16 million contract with center Brook LopezGrade: AWhile we were all thinking about Lopez signing with the other Los Angeles team, he also makes a lot of sense for the Clippers, particularly on a contract that's appropriate for a backup center.For all their vaunted depth, the Clippers struggled last season when starter Ivica Zubac was on the bench. Lineups without Zubac were outscored by 5.5 points per 100 possessions, according to Cleaning the Glass, ranking in the 22nd percentile leaguewide in offensive rating.Compared with Mo Bamba, Zubac's backup to start 2024-25, Lopez is a far more credible shooting threat. \"Splash Mountain\" has made at least 130 3-pointers during each of the past three seasons. Lopez also is an occasional post-up threat against switches, something the Clippers could utilize given Zubac posted up more often than any player besides Nikola Jokic last season, per GeniusIQ tracking.Lopez will be an upgrade at the defensive end too, giving the Clippers 48 minutes of quality rim protection. Opponents shot 59% on attempts inside 5 feet with Lopez as a primary defender, per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats, not far off the 57% they shot against Zubac.The only concern here is that Lopez is 37. Given his strengths -- size and shooting -- tend to age better than any other skills, I'm not worried about a two-year contract for Lopez. Whatever aging risk exists is justified by the reward of getting a player who started all 80 games last season for less than $10 million per year.June 30: Milwaukee signs Porter, Trent and PrinceMilwaukee Bucks agreed to re-sign guard Kevin Porter Jr. to a two-year, $11 million deal; agreed to re-sign guard Gary Trent Jr. to a two-year, $7.5 million deal; agreed to re-sign forward Taurean Prince to a two-year, $7.1 million dealGradesPorter: B Prince: C Trent: AHaving already agreed to a new deal with free agent Bobby Portis on Sunday, the Bucks brought back three more rotation players -- all of them coming off minimum contracts -- at modest prices Monday.Porter got the biggest raise after averaging 14.3 PPG and 4.7 APG in the 13 games after Damian Lillard was sidelined because of deep vein thrombosis at the end of the regular season. With Lillard expected to miss all of 2025-26 after an Achilles rupture, Porter projects as Milwaukee's starting point guard.Porter's talent is unquestionable. He played last season at the minimum after spending 2023-24 out of the league following a plea deal on assault and harassment charges stemming from a September 2023 incident.Porter had struggled to score efficiently before landing with the Bucks at the trade deadline in February. His 41% 3-point shooting the rest of the way isn't likely sustainable, but his career-best 53% accuracy inside the arc might be legit. Milwaukee using the biannual exception for his deal was a necessary part of the team's offseason plans.Like Porter, Trent was important in the Bucks' first-round series with the Indiana Pacers, topping 30 points twice in five games. For Milwaukee to get Trent back using non-Bird rights (a 20% raise off his minimum salary) is a huge win. Trent, meanwhile, will establish early Bird rights if he declines a 2026-27 player option.Prince was one of the noncontributors pushed out of the rotation against Indiana. After starting 73 games during the regular season, Prince played just 22 minutes over the last three games of the series after scoring a combined six points in Games 1 and 2. In that context, I'm a little surprised Prince earned a two-year deal with a player option. That means he'll count on the cap at his actual $3.3 million salary rather than the $2.3 million veteran's minimum.From a bigger-picture standpoint, the question is where the Bucks are heading by bringing back their 2025 playoff rotation minus departed Brook Lopez. Milwaukee has enough room under the lower luxury tax apron to use its $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception to sign a replacement for Lopez, with Deandre Ayton a reasonable target. But none of this makes up for the loss of Lillard, let alone improves on a Bucks team that hasn't won a playoff series since 2022.There are still opportunities for Milwaukee to make trades. Barring something stunning, however, the Bucks look no closer to competing for a championship.June 30: Kornet heads to San Antonio on a four-year dealSan Antonio Spurs agreed to a reported four-year, $41 million deal with center Luke KornetGrade: B+On the surface, the Spurs signing a center when they already have Victor Wembanyama seems nonsensical, but adding Kornet is reasonable on multiple levels.The biggest long-term need for San Antonio is probably a combo forward who can shoot, handle the ball and defend multiple positions. Alas, if that player existed in free agency, he surely would be out of the Spurs' price range. The realistic option for San Antonio was more likely Guerschon Yabusele, Wembanyama's teammate on the French national team.At center, the Spurs could shop closer to the top of the market. Kornet was prominent on the list ESPN's Zach Kram compiled Monday of underrated free agents. Advanced metrics have consistently shown Kornet making a major impact with his rim protection and high-percentage finishing.Since taking the 3-pointer out of his game, Kornet has shot 68% over the past three seasons. Meanwhile, as Kram highlighted, opponents shot just 52% against Kornet within 5 feet, according to GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats, putting him in the top 10 alongside Wembanyama among players who defended at least 100 such attempts.Adding Kornet addresses San Antonio's biggest weakness last season: defending with Wembanyama on the bench. The Spurs' defensive rating ranked in the 73rd percentile with Wembanyama on the court and dropped to the 9th percentile without him. Improving that weakness is the fastest way for San Antonio to reach the playoffs.Beyond that, I suspect Kornet should play with Wembanyama at times, too. The Spurs ditched playing Wembanyama as a power forward last season after they struggled with him next to Zach Collins as a rookie. Per my analysis of lineup data from NBA Advanced Stats, Wembanyama played exclusively at center in 2024-25.Still, I think it's worth revisiting with a better center option and more shot creation around them. Double-big lineups were effective for several teams last season and are worth exploring for San Antonio.Even if Kornet is strictly a backup center, I'd rather have him on this deal than nearly all the older big men who agreed to similar contracts Monday or the more defensively challenged players who re-signed over the weekend (Bobby Portis and Naz Reid). The Spurs can maximize Kornet's long-term value by starting his contract at its highest point and descending it, meaning a lower salary when Wembanyama is off his rookie deal and the luxury tax becomes a concern.June 30: Nuggets agree to deal with BrownDenver Nuggets agreed to a reported contract with guard/forward Bruce Brown Jr.Grade: B+A reunion between Brown and the Nuggets was one of the more obvious free agent fits. Neither side has done as well since Brown's season in Denver resulted in an NBA championship.An unrestricted free agent that summer, Brown cashed in with a two-year, $45 million deal from the Indiana Pacers that the Nuggets couldn't match. The deal paid off for the Pacers, who flipped Brown as part of their trade for Pascal Siakam, but Brown has seen his production dip in the past two seasons. A 36% 3-point shooter in Denver, Brown has hit just 33% the past two seasons, and his accuracy dipped inside the arc last season, too.It's possible that defending bigger opponents could be taking a toll on the 6-foot-4 Brown, who will turn 29 this summer. There's a track record of players who are undersized for their position -- Brown has often played forward, and occasionally even power forward during his time with the Brooklyn Nets earlier in his career -- aging early as they lose the quickness needed to compensate.Alternatively, the Nuggets are surely hoping Brown just needs to get back to the ball movement that a Nikola Jokic-led offense provides. Brown's ability to cut and read the game fit well with Jokic. The price is also right.Per league sources, Denver signed Brown for the veteran's minimum, leaving the Nuggets free to use part of their non-taxpayer midlevel exception on another player after agreeing to trade Michael Porter Jr. for Cameron Johnson on Monday.June 30: Pistons land LeVert and Reed in separate dealsDetroit Pistons agreed to a reported two-year, $29 million contract with guard Caris LeVert; agreed to re-sign center Paul Reed to a reported two-year, $11 million contractGradesLeVert: B- Reed: BThe Pistons had to be stunned by the news Sunday that Malik Beasley is under investigation by the United States District Attorney's office on allegations of gambling related to NBA games and prop bets. Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the Pistons were discussing a new three-year, $42 million contract for Beasley after he finished as the runner-up for the Sixth Man of the Year Award after he signed a one-year deal.Detroit pivoted to LeVert, who also has been among the league's top reserve guards in recent seasons. LeVert averaged 14.0 PPG and 5.1 APG in 2023-24 with the Cleveland Cavaliers before his playing time declined last season due to Ty Jerome's emergence.LeVert is a shooting downgrade compared with Beasley. LeVert is a career 34.5% 3-point shooter, albeit an improved one during his time in Cleveland (36%). LeVert will provide more ballhandling and on-ball defense, important skills that probably aren't as valuable as Beasley's shooting to a Pistons team that will presumably use Jaden Ivey in a reserve role next season.Detroit might not have a good option with Beasley unavailable. Nickeil Alexander-Walker, who landed with the Atlanta Hawks on Monday -- essentially replacing LeVert -- was probably the best alternative, but winning a bidding war for him might have required the Pistons to use cap space. Detroit can sign LeVert using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception, enabling the Pistons to re-sign starting wing Tim Hardaway Jr. using Bird rights.Additionally, Detroit is bringing back Reed, who served as the Pistons' backup center for much of last season. Reed's active defense makes him a reliable option in that role, and the price is reasonable for a team that is nowhere near the luxury tax.June 30: Capela heads back to Rockets on three-year dealHouston Rockets agreed to a reported three-year, $21.5 million contract with center Clint CapelaGrade: D+This move, which seemed logical a few weeks ago, was a surprise after the Rockets also extended backup center Steven Adams' contract. Adams and Capela seemed like an either/or proposition for Houston because the two players don't offer positional versatility, though starting center Alperen Sengun moved to power forward alongside Adams in the playoffs.The upside is that the Rockets can manage the minutes of both players. Adams did not typically see action in both ends of back-to-back games last season, and Capela averaged just 21.4 MPG -- his fewest since emerging as a starter in Houston nearly a decade ago.Adding Capela likely ensures that the Rockets will pay the luxury tax this season, the latest sign they're going for it after adding Kevin Durant via trade rather than trying to delay the start of paying repeater taxes toward the primes for Sengun and Amen Thompson. Capela's contract will likely push Houston to the edge of a hard cap at the lower luxury tax apron, limiting the team's flexibility to add salary midseason.The bigger issues with paying two backup centers will come later, when more of the Rockets' young players are on extensions. Houston might try to add salary before it gets more difficult because of apron restrictions, but that logic would make more sense with younger players than Adams and Capela, who both are more likely to hold their value.June 30: Bulls sign Jones to three-year dealChicago Bulls agreed to re-sign guard Tre Jones to a reported three-year, $24 million contractGrade: B+Jones quietly excelled in 18 games for the Bulls after being included in the trade that sent De'Aaron Fox to San Antonio and Zach LaVine to Sacramento. Jones averaged 11.5 PPG and 4.9 APG for Chicago, shooting 57% overall, 11-of-22 on 3s and 88% on free throws. This three-year deal takes Jones, 25, through his prime years.Jones has provided quality minutes as a starter with the Spurs, including 65 games in 2022-23. Still, this deal pays him much more like the backup he will likely be -- and not even at the top of the market, which is north of $10 million annually.One note to watch is how the Bulls handle the structure of this contract. Barring a max deal for restricted free agent Josh Giddey, Chicago isn't close to the luxury tax this season and has cap space aspirations next summer. It might be best for the Bulls to start Jones' contract high (around $8.2 million) and have it descend for 2026-27 to maximize their room, then go up again in 2027-28.June 30: Knicks plan to sign ClarksonNew York Knicks plan to sign guard Jordan ClarksonGrade: B-After agreeing to a buyout with the Utah Jazz, Clarkson will reportedly sign with the Knicks once he clears waivers. It has been a while since Clarkson has been on a contending team. He has stuck around as a veteran presence as the Jazz began rebuilding over the past three seasons.Even when Clarkson won the Sixth Man award in 2020-21, he was never an efficient scorer. He has continued to score with a true shooting percentage slightly lower than league average, and it will be interesting to see whether that improves playing alongside better creators in New York.But Clarkson is not a good shooter on the kinds of spot-up opportunities he's likely to get with the Knicks. Over the past three seasons, Clarkson has made 34% of catch-and-shoot 3s, according to GeniusIQ tracking, putting him in the 13th percentile among players with at least 250 attempts in that span.But the price is right. After the buyout, New York will surely pay Clarkson a small fraction of the $14.3 million he was set to make in Utah.June 30: Jerome headed to Memphis on a three-year dealMemphis Grizzlies agreed to a reported three-year, $28 million contract with guard Ty JeromeGrade: A-I had Jerome at the top of the tier of low-end starters and quality reserves available in free agency this summer, ranking him 15th overall. Jerome was a finalist for Sixth Man of the Year with the Cleveland Cavaliers, finishing third in the voting after averaging a career-high 12.5 points per game while shooting 52% from the field and 44% on 3s. For the Grizzlies to get him using their room midlevel exception is a coup.Admittedly, some of the luster came off Jerome's campaign during an ugly series against the Indiana Pacers. He shot a combined 2-for-22 in Games 2 and 3 as the Pacers upset the Cavaliers, while also becoming a target for Indiana on defense. Still, Jerome making less than $10 million per year is an overcorrection.Jerome's market was hurt in part by Cleveland's tax situation. Already over the second luxury-tax apron entering free agency, the Cavaliers couldn't bring back both Jerome and Sam Merrill without paying an exorbitant tax bill. Cleveland ended up with Merrill, who will make slightly less annually on a four-year deal.The Grizzlies need depth at point guard because of the time Ja Morant tends to miss, and with Cole Anthony reportedly headed elsewhere to create cap space, Jerome and Scotty Pippen Jr. give Memphis plenty of cover. Jerome also can play shooting guard, where the Grizzlies traded starter Desmond Bane in a deal that returned forward Kentavious Caldwell-Pope.Deep benches have been a hallmark of the Grizzlies in recent years. Adding Jerome should help ensure that continues.June 30: Pelicans sign Looney to two-year dealNew Orleans Pelicans agreed to a reported two-year, $16 million contract with center Kevon LooneyGrade: DThough it's early in the New Orleans Pelicans tenure of executive vice president of basketball operations Joe Dumars and senior vice president of basketball operations Troy Weaver, familiar patterns from their separate stints with the Detroit Pistons are emerging.In particular, like the Pistons under Weaver, the Pelicans have stockpiled centers without regard to maximizing value. Days after giving up a valuable first-round pick (the better of those from New Orleans and the Milwaukee Bucks next year) to move up to the No. 13 spot and draft Maryland center Derik Queen, the Pelicans made Looney their marquee addition of free agency.It's undoubtedly true that center was a weakness for New Orleans, which utilized rookies Yves Missi and Karlo Matkovic at the position most of this past season. Only the Phoenix Suns' center rotation rated worse by my wins above replacement player (WARP) metric. However, Missi and Matkovic showed progress, and at the respective ages of 21 and 24, they figure to improve.Now, the Pelicans have spent much of their limited resources addressing center without finding a clear upgrade. Looney is a reliable veteran with championship experience, but he averaged just 15 minutes per game last season for the Golden State Warriors. Looney made more sense as a minimum signing than for a substantial portion of the non-taxpayer midlevel exception. He also is a non-shooter, making Looney a difficult fit next to Zion Williamson in the frontcourt.Dipping into the non-tax midlevel means New Orleans is now hard-capped at the lower luxury tax apron. It was unlikely the Pelicans would push into the tax anyway, having never before paid it, but that leaves them with just $5 million in wiggle room to fill a remaining roster spot and make moves during the season. For the right addition, that restriction would have made sense. I don't think Looney was the correct target for New Orleans.June 30: Jones to Orlando on a one-year dealOrlando Magic agreed to a reported one-year, $7 million contract with guard Tyus JonesGrade: B+After upgrading at shooting guard by dealing four first-round picks for Desmond Bane, the Magic addressed their point guard spot too, signing the veteran Jones to a one-year deal. Jones projects as part of Orlando's second unit alongside 2023 lottery pick Anthony Black while playing a similar role to the one Cory Joseph played last season.Compared with Joseph, who ended up starting all five Magic playoff games after starter Jalen Suggs was injured, Jones is more of an offensive threat. Granted, that bar is set low. Joseph had a 13% usage rate and averaged just 4.2 assists per 36 minutes as something of a caretaker point guard for Orlando, which relied on forwards Paolo Banchero and Franz Wagner for playmaking.Jones brings better 3-point shooting (38% career) and shot creation, meaning the Magic will be in better hands if Suggs again misses time. Jones started 124 games over the past two seasons, though he probably is better suited for a high-end backup role.Having sacrificed money in favor of a starting job on a one-year, minimum deal with the Phoenix Suns last summer, Jones is getting paid more this time around -- nearly double the veterans minimum. Paying him $7 million using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception will take Orlando into the luxury tax, though the Magic still have enough room under the lower tax apron (about $7.5 million) to use more of the exception to fill out the roster if needed.June 30: Finney-Smith chooses RocketsHouston Rockets agreed to a reported four-year, $53 million contract with forward Dorian Finney-SmithGrade: AThe Rockets adding one of the best free agents to change teams after dealing for Kevin Durant to begin the offseason reminds me of summer 2017.That year, Houston added Chris Paul via opt-in and trade and structured the deal to have the non-taxpayer midlevel exception available to sign P.J. Tucker -- like Finney-Smith, an experienced 3-and-D role player. Tucker ended up starting as the Rockets won 65 games and took the defending champion Golden State Warriors to seven games in the conference finals.Finney-Smith helps Houston fill the void left by trading defensive stopper Dillon Brooks to the Phoenix Suns in the Durant deal. As compared to Brooks, whose three most frequent half-court matchups defensively included a center (Victor Wembanyama) and a point guard (Shai Gilgeous-Alexander) according to GeniusIQ tracking, Finney-Smith isn't quite as versatile.At this stage of his career, having Finney-Smith guard forwards is probably preferable to putting him on quicker guards. The Rockets can supplement Finney-Smith with All-Defensive first-team pick Amen Thompson, who proved to be one of the NBA's best point-of-attack defenders last season.Offensively, Finney-Smith fits better alongside Durant than Brooks would have in a different construction of the trade. With shot creation at four positions in the starting five (Durant, Thompson, All-Star center Alperen Sengun and point guard Fred VanVleet), Houston primarily needs floor spacing from the fifth spot in the lineup. Finney-Smith, a 38% 3-point shooter over the past six seasons who hit 41% beyond the arc last season, provides more of that than Brooks. Although Brooks shot a career-high 40% on 3s in 2024-25, he's at 35.5% for his career.There is some risk here that a four-year contract for Finney-Smith becomes a negative value by the end. That didn't prove the case with Tucker, who ended up helping the Milwaukee Bucks to the 2021 title in the final season of his four-year deal. Still, locking in more guaranteed money helps explain why Finney-Smith declined a 2025-26 player option for $15.4 million that would have paid more than his new average salary.On the plus side, the Rockets getting Finney-Smith for less than the entire value of the non-taxpayer midlevel exception could make it easier for them to avoid paying the luxury tax this season. If Finney-Smith's contract features 5% raises, Houston should end up about $3 million over the tax line, meaning moving Cam Whitmore or multiple minimum contracts midseason could allow the Rockets to dodge the tax.Whether Houston pays the tax is trivial this year but could have important implications down the road in terms of starting the clock on the repeater tax.For now, adding Finney-Smith gives the Rockets a rock-solid top seven that also includes forwards Jabari Smith Jr. (who struck a five-year rookie extension on Sunday) and Tari Eason. Houston supplements that group with center Steven Adams, a key contributor in double-big lineups in the playoffs and recent first-round picks Whitmore and Reed Sheppard. The Rockets also intend to re-sign their own free agents in Jeff Green, Aaron Holiday and Jae'Sean Tate, per ESPN's Shams Charania.All of that means Houston appears to have pulled off the rare feat of upgrading star talent with Durant while not sacrificing any depth. The Rockets are ideally suited to handle any time Durant will likely miss during the regular season and still rack up wins. So long as the Oklahoma City Thunder are healthy, the defending champs are rightfully the favorites to win it all again. As in 2018, however, I think Houston is the biggest threat to a repeat title for the Thunder.June 30: Lakers add LaRavia after losing Finney-SmithLos Angeles Lakers agreed to a reported two-year, $12 million contract with forward Jake LaRaviaGrade: B+I like LaRavia as a target for the Lakers, with the important caveat that they still must figure out who starts at center.A first-round pick by the Memphis Grizzlies in 2022, he saw the team decline his rookie contract option for 2025-26 before the start of last season. Subsequently, LaRavia enjoyed the best season of his career, shooting 42% on 3-pointers and boosting his true shooting percentage from .538 his first two years to .591.Although the Grizzlies traded LaRavia to the Sacramento Kings at the deadline, the declined option continued to restrict the Kings' ability to re-sign him. Sacramento was able to offer a maximum of $5.6 million, the value of that option, to LaRavia this season. The Lakers more or less matched that salary on a two-year deal.For the Lakers, the best part of adding LaRavia is his age. At 23, he is still coming into his own as a contributor; and if this is a straight two-year deal, the Lakers would be able to re-sign him using early Bird rights in the summer of 2027, when he'll be 25.Based on LaRavia's age and production, my SCHOENE projection system has him forecast just outside the top 20 free agents. If that's remotely accurate, $6 million per year should be a bargain. Because LaRavia's contract is too big for the biannual exception, it likely will have to come out of the Lakers' $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. That leaves the Lakers with about $8 million to spend, most likely on a center.Splitting the midlevel would help the Lakers' depth more than committing it all to a single player, which would leave them with the same number of reliable rotation players after seeing Dorian Finney-Smith strike an agreement with the Houston Rockets earlier Monday.June 30: Mavs fill PG need with Russell dealDallas Mavericks agreed to a reported two-year, $13 million contract with guard D'Angelo RussellGrade: B+From a value standpoint, it's hard to argue this move. Russell made an average of $18 million over the past two seasons and was on a max deal before that. Russell actually will make less in 2025-26 on this contract, which utilizes the taxpayer midlevel exception, than he did in the last year of his rookie deal.Of course, Russell's salary trending the wrong direction also reflects the difficulty of finding the right fit for his skill set. Russell is a high-volume shot creator (24% usage last season) who only scored with high efficiency during two seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers. Russell isn't effective playing primarily off the ball and no longer fits on a rebuilding team at age 29.All of that made Dallas an ideal destination. The Mavericks sputtered in the play-in tournament in part because they lacked an initiator with Kyrie Irving sidelined after a left ACL tear that should keep him out much of the 2025-26 campaign. Dallas started lineups with no true point guard down the stretch, relying on forward Naji Marshall to bring up the ball.The Mavericks certainly weren't going to do better in terms of pedigree than Russell, armed only with their taxpayer midlevel. (To even utilize that, Dallas had to agree to a multiyear deal with Irving that pays him less than a player option would have for 2025-26.) If the Mavericks catch Russell on one of the hot stretches he enjoyed with the Lakers, this could prove an enormous bargain.At the same time, there's always an expiration date with Russell. His limitations were exposed during two playoff runs with the Lakers, as Russell shot just 31% on 3s and was targeted defensively. The ideal scenario for Dallas is probably Russell carrying the team through the regular season before Irving returns in time for a playoff run.If Russell is able to rebuild his value, he'll likely decline a 2026-27 player option in favor of a stronger market in free agency while the Mavs move forward with Irving. So, there's a chance this is a mutually beneficial short-term marriage.June 30: Clippers re-sign Batum to two-year dealLA Clippers agreed to re-sign forward Nicolas Batum to a reported two-year, $11.5 million dealGrade: ABoth sides got a little something out of Batum declining his $4.9 million player option in favor of re-signing with the Clippers. Batum gets a slight raise this season, the 20% maximum the Clippers could offer using non-Bird rights without having to dip into their non-taxpayer midlevel exception.Meanwhile, the Clippers get a team option on Batum for 2026-27 that will give them some flexibility with how to handle next summer. The Clippers could have cap space if James Harden declines his 2026-27 player option. Alternatively, if the Clippers stay over the cap, they could exercise Batum's salary and use him as matching salary in a trade.Most likely, that would happen only if Batum decided to retire and got a golden parachute from the Clippers. He'll turn 37 in December but remains a key reserve who averaged 24.6 MPG for the Clippers in their seven-game first-round series against the Denver Nuggets. Batum's experience, shooting ability and defensive versatility will be valuable right up to when he calls it a career.The Clippers now have all eight players who saw at least 50 minutes of action against Denver under contract and will be filling in around them, presumably with another ball handler or a backup center.June 30: Harden, Clippers strike new two-year dealLA Clippers agreed to re-sign guard James Harden to a reported two-year, $81.5 million contractGrade: B-The Clippers and Harden struck a creative contract, but I'm surprised he commanded a raise in this free agent market, even coming off an All-NBA season.The 2025-26 player option on the contract Harden signed as an unrestricted free agent last summer was scheduled to pay him $36.3 million. Only the Brooklyn Nets have the cap space to make Harden that kind of offer without a sign-and-trade deal, and a return to Brooklyn seemed implausible for any number of reasons.Not only will Harden instead make a minimum of $39 million this season (assuming maximum 8% raises), but he also gets the benefit of an unorthodox player option for 2026-27. Per ESPN's Shams Charania, the player option is partially guaranteed, making the second season something of a mutual option.To make that legal, Harden's 2025-26 salary must be guaranteed for the same percentage. Presumably, that salary will fully guarantee days or weeks after the contract is signed, similar to the deal J.R. Smith signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers in September 2015. The player option also gives Harden the right to approve any trade this season.As with Smith, who declined his option after the Cavaliers won the 2016 title, the partial guarantee probably won't ultimately matter. Assuming Harden stays healthy and plays well during his age-36 season, either the Clippers will guarantee his 2026-27 salary or Harden will decline the player option and head into free agency next summer when more teams have cap space. A serious injury seems to be the only way Harden would exercise the option and be waived next summer.The upside is that giving Harden a raise doesn't really take anything off the table for the Clippers. With 12 players under contract, including Drew Eubanks and Jordan Miller on non-guaranteed deals, the Clippers are about $22 million below the lower luxury tax apron. That allowed them to re-sign forward Nicolas Batum after he declined a $4.9 million player option and still use their $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception.The Clippers should be able to add another contributor using the midlevel exception, perhaps either another ball handler or a more experienced backup center after the team drafted Yanic Konan Niederhauser with the No. 30 pick.June 29: Rockets' Jabari Smith Jr. gets five-year extensionHouston Rockets agreed to a reported five-year, $122 million extension with forward Jabari Smith Jr.Grade: Pass (extensions graded on pass/fail)Smith is the first 2022 first-round pick to agree on a rookie contract extension. As ESPN's Bobby Marks noted, that's unusual because max extensions like we expect to see for Orlando Magic forward Paolo Banchero and the Oklahoma City Thunder's duo of Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams (barring discounts) are typically the quickest extensions to get done.Per Marks, Isaiah Stewart's deal with the Detroit Pistons on July 11, 2023 -- five days after the conclusion of the negotiating moratorium period -- was the earliest non-max rookie extension in recent memory. The Rockets and Smith got a deal done before the moratorium period has even begun.For Smith, this locks in life-changing money ahead of a season where his role is uncertain. A starter for the first 188 games he played for Houston, Smith lost his job to Amen Thompson while he was sidelined for over a month by a broken bone in his right hand. Even in 18 games as a reserve last season, Smith averaged 28 minutes per game. (He actually scored more off the bench by virtue of stronger efficiency.)With the Rockets' deal for Kevin Durant and their ability to utilize the non-taxpayer midlevel exception, it's unclear what role Smith might play this season. He could fill the open spot in the starting lineup or get squeezed if Houston adds another forward in free agency. Either way, at 22, Smith is an important part of the Rockets' post-Durant future. We've yet to see Smith prove to be the kind of shot creator in the NBA that he was during the single season at Auburn which made him the No. 3 pick by Houston. In fact, his usage rate has dropped all three seasons to a career-low 16%. But Smith's combination of ability to space the floor (36% from 3-point range on almost six attempts per 36 minutes) and defensive versatility at 6-foot-11 gives him a floor of key rotation player on a contender.The upside scenario is Smith continues his development and makes this contract a bargain for the Rockets. Smith is younger than more than a third of the players drafted this week, including first-round picks Walter Clayton Jr., Nique Clifford and Yanic Konan Niederhauser. This extension pays Smith less annually than Trey Murphy, who signed the most comparable extension last year (four years, $112 million).The way Houston negotiated hard on Alperen Sengun's extension in particular has facilitated strengthening a contending core this season. The Rockets should have their non-taxpayer midlevel exception available to add to this group after dealing two starters (Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green) for Durant.This extension didn't take nearly as long as ones for Green and Sengun, which were signed just before the deadline. Still, it could be similarly beneficial for Houston.June 29: Randle stays with Wolves on three-year dealMinnesota Timberwolves agreed to re-sign forward Julius Randle to a reported three-year, $100 million contractGrade: BEssentially, this contract functions as a two-year, $69 million extension for Randle on top of his $31 million player option for 2025-26. In fact, based on maximum possible 8% raises, Randle's cap hit may come out almost identical to that figure.Getting Randle signed for three years gives Minnesota cost certainty about this core. The Timberwolves project right around the 2026-27 luxury-tax line without starting point guard Mike Conley Jr. under contract and will have more breathing room by 2027-28, when Donte DiVincenzo's contract expires and the cap figures to increase faster than year-to-year raises.For now, Minnesota is probably just about done with its 2025-26 roster, which surely won't include hotly coveted unrestricted free agent Nickeil Alexander-Walker. After getting new contracts done with their other two key free agents, Randle and Naz Reid, Minnesota has just enough room to fill out the roster with minimum contracts -- possibly team options for forward Josh Minott and center Luka Garza -- and stay below the second apron.Because the Timberwolves will be closer to the tax line with Rudy Gobert's salary decreasing in the first year of an extension, their tax bill will be more modest this season. Minnesota figures to start the season paying $20-30 million in taxes, with the ability to reduce that by trading away players at the end of the roster midseason.Compared to the Reid contract, I like the value better here for the Timberwolves. Randle is a two-time All-Star who played at that level over the first two rounds of the playoffs before a disappointing series against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the conference finals. Randle didn't likely have a market at this level in free agency this summer but could have done better a year from now when many more teams will have cap space.Making this a new contract rather than an extension allows the two sides to wipe out the incentives in Randle's current contract, meaning he's assured his full cap hit and unlikely incentives no longer affect Minnesota with regard to the luxury-tax apron.June 29: LeBron picks up $52.6M optionLos Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James exercises $52.6 million player optionGrade: N/AAt surface level, the explanation from ESPN's Shams Charania that James is exercising his 2025-26 player option while simultaneously contemplating his future with the Lakers is difficult to understand. If James might want to play elsewhere, why not become a free agent?Because this year's market is largely devoid of cap space, the rebuilding Brooklyn Nets are the only team that could offer James anything approaching his $54.1 million max salary as a free agent. If James is somehow to change teams this summer, it will almost certainly be by trade.A sign-and-trade would be possible if James were to decline his option, but that possibility is complicated by the fact that a team receiving a player via sign-and-trade is automatically hard-capped at the lower luxury-tax apron, limiting its moves to build out the roster. An opt-in and trade isn't subject to the same restrictions.For example, hypothetically the Golden State Warriors could now trade Jimmy Butler III (starting a max extension) to the Lakers for James and Bronny James and neither team would face a hard cap of any kind, allowing the Warriors to re-sign restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga.Setting James' cap number does clarify the Lakers' options in free agency. Essentially, the team will be choosing between re-signing forward Dorian Finney-Smith (who plans to decline a $15.4 million player option in favor of a longer contract, per Charania) and using the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception, presumably on a starting center. Going the latter route would hard-cap the Lakers at the lower apron and allow them to safely fill out the roster with minimum contracts while keeping a little wiggle room for in-season trades.June 29: Portis back to Bucks on three-year dealMilwaukee Bucks agreed to re-sign forward/center Bobby Portis to a reported three-year, $44 million contractGrade: C-Portis had to decide Sunday on a $13.4 million player option for 2025-26. Instead, he'll sign a new contract that should pay him a similar amount this season with two additional years at $30-plus million.I'm surprised the market was that high on Portis, who was a finalist for the Sixth Man award in both 2022-23 and 2023-24 but has never rated that well by advanced stats. Portis was not nearly as efficient a scorer last season, when his accuracy on both 2s (51%) and 3s (36.5%) was his lowest since signing with Milwaukee in 2020. Additionally, Portis missed nearly the entire second half due to a 25-game suspension for violating the NBA's anti-drug policy.To Portis' credit, he became coach Doc Rivers' most trusted option at center by the end of the Bucks' first-round loss to the Indiana Pacers. Portis played 44 minutes in Game 5, which went to overtime, and had a double-double of 14 points (albeit on 6-of-18 shooting) and 10 rebounds. With Brook Lopez an unrestricted free agent, Portis could be Milwaukee's starting center next year.Though Portis' contract would be on the cheap side for a veteran starter, I suspect playing that role would expose him defensively. Opponents shot 69% on attempts inside 5 feet with Portis as a primary defender, per GeniusIQ tracking on NBA Advanced Stats, putting him in the bottom 25 among all players who defended at least three such shots per game. By contrast, opponents hit just 59% of those attempts against Lopez.I'm also skeptical of how well Portis will hold his value over the life of this contract. He turned 30 in February and will be 33 by the final season of the deal, another player option. The quickness that has been a strength for Portis when defended by centers might not remain an advantage much longer.Every dollar counts for the Bucks, who are $27.5 million below the first luxury tax apron with nine players under contract, including non-guaranteed salaries for AJ Green, Andre Jackson Jr. and Chris Livingston. If Milwaukee wants to use its non-taxpayer midlevel exception to re-sign unrestricted free agents Kevin Porter Jr. and/or Gary Trent Jr., it will have a difficult time re-signing Lopez due to the resulting hard cap.If Portis wanted to exercise his player option, I would have welcomed him back and considered an extension down the road. Failing that, I probably would have preferred to let Portis test the market and focus on re-signing Lopez.June 29: Jaylin Williams to sign new three-year deal with OKCOklahoma City Thunder agree to re-sign center Jaylin Williams to a reported three-year, $24 million contractGrade: B+This deal is the latest example of the Thunder trying to manage their contracts to spend as much money now to have more flexibility down the road when extensions kick in for starters Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams. Those deals are the remaining business for the defending champs, whose roster is full.Because Oklahoma City held a $2.2 million team option for Jaylin Williams' 2025-26 salary, this essentially functions as a two-year extension for $22 million. By declining the team option and starting the contract now, the Thunder can maximize the amount of the total salary Williams gets this season.Starting the deal at its highest point and declining from there would leave Oklahoma City just under the luxury-tax threshold after Saturday's trade sending 2024 first-round pick Dillon Jones to the Washington Wizards to clear a roster spot and save money. That presumes the Thunder pick up a $3 million team option on guard Ajay Mitchell, who is in a different situation because he will still be a restricted free agent next summer. Williams would have been unrestricted.Although Williams wasn't part of the Thunder's rotation during the last two rounds of the playoffs, he has become a reliable option at center who took on an important role with starters Isaiah Hartenstein and Holmgren unavailable during much of the regular season.Williams posted three triple-doubles in nine starts, averaging 10.0 points, 8.0 rebounds and 4.9 assists. He could become a rotation fixture down the road if Oklahoma City has to move on from Hartenstein, whose $28.5 million 2026-27 salary is a team option, for financial reasons.June 28: Mitchell returns to Miami on two-year dealAgreed to re-sign guard Davion Mitchell to a reported two-year, $24 million dealGrade: BBy virtue of reaching 2,000 minutes played last season and achieving \"starter criteria,\" Mitchell was in a strong negotiating position as a restricted free agent.Because of starter criteria, Mitchell's qualifying offer was $9.4 million -- second highest among restricted free agents, after Josh Giddey of the Chicago Bulls. Even if no market developed for Mitchell, playing 2025-26 for the qualifying offer and becoming an unrestricted free agent next summer was a legitimate possibility.Instead, the two sides agreed on a deal that guarantees Mitchell more money but keeps him under contract for two years, which also means he can be included in a trade without having to consent.Mitchell could still be a bargain if he keeps shooting like he did after joining the Heat at the trade deadline. Previously a 34% career 3-point shooter, Mitchell shot 45% from deep with Miami and 7-of-14 in the playoffs, earning a starting role and averaging 31.6 minutes per game after the trade.Nicknamed \"Off Night\" for his effect on opposing guards, Mitchell has always been an elite point-of-attack defender, but his lack of offense limited him to a reserve role during three seasons with the Sacramento Kings, who traded him to reduce salary this time a year ago.I'm hesitant to read too much into a sample of around 100 3-point attempts, but we've seen the Heat work wonders with non-shooters in the past. This deal gives Miami a couple more years to figure out whether Mitchell's progress is legit and whether he can be a starting guard going forward.With Mitchell re-signed, the Heat are nearing the lower luxury-tax apron but still have the ability to go under the tax line by waiving forward Duncan Robinson. Presuming Robinson doesn't exercise an early termination option to test free agency, he'll be under contract for $19.9 million. However, just $9.9 million of Robinson's 2026-27 salary is guaranteed.June 28: Merrill gets new deal with ClevelandAgreed to re-sign guard Sam Merrill to a reported four-year, $38 million contractGrade: BAfter totaling just 350 minutes over his first three NBA seasons played with three different teams, Merrill has become an important fixture on Cleveland's outstanding bench units of the past two seasons.Always a premier shooter, Merrill has hit 39% of his career 3-point attempts and pushed his volume with the Cavaliers: 11.9 attempts per 36 minutes in 2023-24 and 9.5 last season. A better defender than he appears based on physical tools, Merrill maintained a key spot in the rotation with Darius Garland sidelined to start Cleveland's second-round playoff loss to the Indiana Pacers -- up until a neck strain sidelined him for the deciding Game 5.Previously on a minimum contract, Merrill had earned a big raise. Given the Cavaliers were $10 million over the second luxury tax apron after Saturday's deal for Lonzo Ball with just 10 players under NBA contract, that surely meant choosing between Merrill and fellow bargain reserve Ty Jerome.In all likelihood, Merrill's contract will come in lower than Jerome's. This deal starts around $8.5 million with maximum 8% raises, putting it around the value of the room midlevel exception and far less than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception that could be Jerome's market.Going out four years with Merrill could have some risk. Because he was drafted at age 24 after serving a Latter-day Saints mission prior to his career at Utah State, Merrill recently turned 29 and this deal takes him well into his 30s. Merrill's shooting ability is unlikely to wane but his defense might become an issue at some point.With Cleveland's second-apron limitations, replacing Merrill would have been difficult, and the team can plan for a two-year window of big spending before retrenching when several contracts expire after the 2026-27 campaign. In that context, signing Merrill for a smaller starting salary but a larger total amount probably made sense for the Cavaliers.June 27: Timberwolves and Naz Reid agree to new dealAgreed to a reported five-year, $125 million contract with forward/center Naz ReidGrade: C-In what looked like a difficult market for free agents, Reid found leverage to get an incredibly favorable contract.The Timberwolves now face a challenge to also re-sign starting forward Julius Randle (who, like Reid, holds a player option for 2025-26) and reserve guard Nickeil Alexander-Walker. Minnesota must make some choices about who to value, which started with paying Reid like a starting-caliber player over the span of his new contract.That's interesting because only one other team (the Brooklyn Nets) could make a similar offer to Reid, and because there's not a clear path to him becoming a starter in the short term if the Timberwolves bring back Randle.Unless the Nets were interested, Reid's market would presumably have been at the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel exception. That would have carried a max value of $60.6 million over four years, far less than Minnesota offered. Reid also had the option of exercising his $15 million player option for 2025-26 and taking his chances next summer, which should have been viewed as a good outcome by the Timberwolves.Assuming max 8% raises, Reid's salary for next season will bump up to $21.6 million. That leaves Minnesota about $33 million shy of the second luxury tax apron, including team options for forward Josh Minott and center Luka Garza. That could be enough to bring back Randle, whose 2025-26 option would carry a $31 million cap hit. Retaining Randle and Alexander-Walker, who should have a market near or at the non-tax midlevel, now seems impossible, barring a trade.I understand the Timberwolves prioritizing the two big men after drafting guards Rob Dillingham and Terrence Shannon Jr. in last year's first round. Minnesota also has 2023 second-round pick Jaylen Clark, who flashed at the defensive end in his rookie season after missing all of 2023-24 due to injury.Additionally, the Timberwolves are paying Reid through his prime years. He'll turn 26 in August and will be 30 at the end of this five-year contract. Still, I'm not convinced Reid is a starting-caliber player despite winning the Sixth Man award in 2023-24.A bench role suits Reid because of his defensive limitations, which were exposed by playing center more last season after Minnesota traded Karl-Anthony Towns. Lineups with Reid at center allowed a 116.3 defensive rating last season, per Cleaning the Glass, as compared to 103.0 when he played power forward. That's worth keeping in mind if you're projecting Reid as Rudy Gobert's eventual replacement at center.The advent of the second apron, plus steeper penalties for teams with large luxury tax bills, means overpaying key contributors is more costly than ever. Although Reid has been an indispensable part of the Timberwolves teams that have reached the past two conference finals, paying him like a starter is going to force them to sacrifice down the line. Given the market, I think Minnesota should have done better with this contract.June 25: VanVleet to sign new $50 million deal with HoustonAgreed to a reported two-year, $50 million contract with guard Fred VanVleetGrade: AThis deal, which will replace a $44.9 million team option the Rockets held for VanVleet in 2025-26, is some combination of Houston using its leverage well and/or being willing to spend even bigger in the future.It's certainly true that VanVleet would have had a tough time beating this offer on the open market. Only the Brooklyn Nets could even legally do so using cap space, meaning the Rockets' participation in a sign-and-trade would have been necessary for VanVleet to get more than the non-taxpayer midlevel exception to play for a contender as an unrestricted free agent.Still, the same will be true for virtually any free agent of note, and it's unlikely other teams will get this kind of bargain. Consider that VanVleet will make less next season than Kyrie Irving, who will start the year rehabbing an ACL tear. Yes, Irving had the leverage of a player option for 2025-26 on his contract, but he still added more new money ($76 million over the two years beyond 2025-26) than VanVleet.It's possible VanVleet could make up the difference now that he holds a player option for 2026-27. Houston is currently hard-capped at the second luxury-tax apron by virtue of aggregating salaries in the Kevin Durant trade. That restriction may not exist a year from now, which would allow the Rockets to potentially re-sign VanVleet to a bigger, longer deal in a summer where other teams will have ample cap space to pursue him.For the time being, getting VanVleet around $20 million less than his option sets Houston up to have access to its non-taxpayer midlevel exception. In a market where only the Nets will likely have more to offer, that makes the Rockets a player for a big-time free agent to complement Durant and their young core.Nickeil Alexander-Walker is the most obvious Houston target who would fit into a playoff rotation on the perimeter, having played that role for the Minnesota Timberwolves in back-to-back conference finals runs. Gary Trent Jr.'s shooting is another fit, while Ty Jerome would be a good value but might be duplicative of what the Rockets hope 2024 No. 3 pick Reed Sheppard will become.Wherever Houston lands, the ability to access the full midlevel should help Houston replace the slight depth lost in the Durant trade and strengthen the Rockets as championship contenders.June 24: Kyrie Irving declines player optionAgreed to a reported three-year, $119 million extension with guard Kyrie IrvingGrade: B+Irving had until the end of the day Tuesday to decide on a $43 million player option for 2025-26. Instead of exercising it, he declined it and will sign this extension, effectively adding two years and $76 million to his contract.The Mavericks had a degree of leverage because the Brooklyn Nets' trade on Tuesday potentially means no other team could offer Irving as much money in free agency. (In practice, the rebuilding Nets bringing Irving back three years after dealing him to Dallas might be politely termed a long shot.)At the same time, Irving could have picked up his option and targeted free agency next year, when it's possible he could have gotten a contract worth more annually -- and certainly a longer one. This seems like a fair compromise.Reducing Irving's starting salary to around $37 million has important implications for the Mavericks this summer. That leaves them about $7 million from the second luxury-tax apron with 13 players under contract, not counting a team option for backup point guard Brandon Williams.Had Irving picked up his option, Dallas would likely have been limited to offering minimum contracts, barring a money-saving trade. Now, the Mavericks could have access to the taxpayer midlevel to sign a ball handler as a free agent and fill the void left by Irving, who will be out much of 2025-26 after suffering an ACL tear in March.June 23: Mavs' Gafford gets three-year extensionAgreed to a reported three-year extension with center Daniel GaffordGrade: Pass (extensions for non-free agents graded on a pass/fail basis)The most interesting element of this extension is the timing. Conventional wisdom had it that Gafford could be a trade candidate this summer, given the Mavericks' crowded depth chart at center, where younger Dereck Lively II is the team's starter of the future and starting power forward Anthony Davis is also capable of -- and perhaps best suited for -- playing the 5.There's little question that Gafford merits a raise coming off the best season of his NBA career. Having excelled defensively in a platoon with Lively as Dallas reached the 2024 NBA Finals, Gafford got a chance to play extended minutes between when Lively went down with a stress fracture in his right ankle in January and his own knee sprain in February.During 11 full games in that span, Gafford averaged 15.0 PPG on 67% shooting, 10.3 RPG and 3.6 BPG, the last of which would have threatened Victor Wembanyama (3.8 BPG) for tops in the NBA. Typically just a finisher on offense, Gafford even created in the post with the team battling multiple injuries. His 52 post-ups last season was a career high, per GeniusIQ tracking, although Gafford's efficiency on those plays wasn't especially strong.Besides the limitations on Gafford's role with the Mavericks, a trade now also makes sense because this could be the peak of his performance. Gafford will be 27 in October, and while his size won't fade, Gafford might not remain such a strong above-the-rim threat as he nears his 30s.Based on those factors, it was important for Dallas to craft an extension with a maximum 20% raise in 2026-27 (a starting salary of $17.3 million) and 5% annual raises that fits restrictions on extend-and-trade deals. By virtue of apparently staying within that, the Mavericks can trade Gafford as soon as he signs the extension -- or, hypothetically, even before then.Having Gafford under contract an additional three seasons shouldn't hurt his trade value at all. This extension pays him barely more than the expected 2026-27 non-taxpayer midlevel exception of $15.5 million, and Gafford has easily outpaced that in terms of value thus far. From his perspective, locking in his deal a year ahead of time does take injury risk off the table. So I'd consider this move a win-win.The next question is which teams could be in the market for Gafford. He's an obvious fit for the Los Angeles Lakers, having demonstrated his comfort running pick-and-rolls with Luka Doncic, but that idea seems triggering for already aggrieved Dallas fans. Gafford would be a sensible target for the guard-heavy Phoenix Suns, though finding workable matching salary is a challenge unless the Suns get under the second apron.If the New Orleans Pelicans aren't convinced Yves Missi is a starting-caliber center at this stage of his development, Gafford would be a huge offensive upgrade. I'd also consider a return to Gafford's original team, the Chicago Bulls, and the San Antonio Spurs as wild-card possibilities.Of course, the Mavericks may just hold on to Gafford. After all, they spent much of the second half of last season with none of their three starting-caliber centers healthy, so there is value in having depth at the position. And it would be challenging for another would-be contender to offer the perimeter help Dallas seeks, meaning a Gafford trade would most likely need to involve at least three teams.June 14: Rockets, Adams agree to three-year extensionAgreed to a reported three-year, $39 million contract with Steven Adams Grade: BWe're off and running on the 2025 offseason with games still to play in the NBA Finals. Teams aren't allowed to negotiate new contracts with their own free agents until the day after the Finals end, but they can strike extensions with eligible players in the last year of their contracts at any point up to June 30.Acquired by the Rockets at the 2024 trade deadline while still recovering from season-ending PCL surgery, Adams initially served as a veteran mentor on a young team and a backup to All-Star center Alperen Sengun. His role expanded considerably in the playoffs, when lineups featuring both Adams and Sengun unexpectedly became key to Houston taking the Golden State Warriors the distance after falling behind 3-1 in the series.Whether alongside Sengun or as the team's lone center, Adams reached a level in the playoffs that we haven't seen since early in his career. Adams blocked 1.9 shots per 36 minutes, surpassing his best regular-season mark (1.7). And his 60% shooting was way up from 55% during the 2024-25 regular season. My wins above replacement player metric rated Adams the team's fourth-most valuable player in the series, ahead of starters Dillon Brooks and Jalen Green.Given that the size and strength that make Adams a dominant offensive rebounder aren't going anywhere, the kind of agility we saw against the Warriors will make him a valuable player for the Rockets as long as he stays healthy.Before the PCL injury that cost him the 2023 playoffs and all of 2023-24, Adams had been remarkably durable, playing 76 of 82 games in 2021-22. And Houston will surely be careful with Adams' workload. Although Adams was cleared to play both ends of back-to-back games midway through last season, the Rockets continued to give him one of the games off because of how he recovers after playing the night before.Bringing back Adams on a contract in the $13 million range -- a little less than the $14.1 million non-taxpayer midlevel that is the most other teams could have realistically offered -- does push Houston into the luxury tax if the team exercises Fred VanVleet's $44.9 million team option. And even if the Rockets waive two players with non-guaranteed deals (Jock Landale, at $8 million, and Nate Williams at the minimum), they'd edge over the lower luxury tax apron by filling out the roster in that scenario.Alternatively, Houston could decline the option and try to bring back VanVleet at a smaller starting salary on a longer-term deal that would guarantee him more money at age 31. That decision could be influenced by what other moves the Rockets have cooking. Their tax situation makes it seem unlikely Houston will add a free agent making more than the $5.7 million taxpayer midlevel, but the Rockets could make more substantial moves via trade.Per ESPN's Bobby Marks, Houston has until June 29 to decide on VanVleet's player option. Barring a blockbuster trade, VanVleet will almost certainly be back, meaning Adams' new contract gives the Rockets a chance to return the entire core that claimed the No. 2 seed in the West.",

The downside is the Bucks\u0026#39; eventual rebuild will be saddled by not controlling their own draft picks and by the cap hit for the Lillard stretch. Milwaukee might not be able to stretch players making appreciable salary for the next five years because of the CBA rule that limits teams to 15% of the current cap as dead salary after a stretch is completed.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe news is worse for the Pacers, who lost a key contributor to their Finals run in his late prime.

Toronto re-signed Poeltl to a four-year, $78 million contract the following summer and is now giving him nearly the largest possible raise off that contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTechnically, Poeltl could have added $88.5 million on a three-year extension after exercising a $19.5 million player option for 2026-27. This deal pays him nearly but not quite that amount, adding $84.5 million in new money for the total of $104 million after this season.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Raptors can point to Poeltl\u0026#39;s adjusted plus-minus impact as evidence of his value. According to xRAPM, from the co-creator of ESPN\u0026#39;s Real Plus-Minus (Jerry Engelmann), Poeltl rates 2.2 points per 100 possessions better than league average, \u003ca href=\"https://xrapm.com/\"\u003eputting him in the 89th percentile leaguewide\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere are two problems with applying that rating to Poeltl\u0026#39;s extension. The first is it\u0026#39;s unlikely the rest of the league values Poeltl as highly, so it\u0026#39;s certainly possible Toronto could have gotten him back as an unrestricted free agent next summer (or in 2027) for less money and it\u0026#39;s unlikely the Raptors would have been outbid.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe second concern is how Poeltl will age. He\u0026#39;ll be 32 when this extension kicks in for the 2027-28 season and 34 by the end of it. Already, Poeltl\u0026#39;s rim protection hasn\u0026#39;t rated as well since rejoining Toronto as it did with the \u003ca data-clubhouse-guid=\"8aef8547-32f5-0943-a1de-e734567674cc\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/sa/san-antonio-spurs\"\u003eSan Antonio Spurs\u003c/a\u003e. Opponents have hit better than 60% of attempts inside the restricted area with Poeltl as the primary defender over the past three seasons, per GeniusIQ tracking, as compared to 53.5% in 2020-21 and 56% in 2021-22.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom a bigger-picture standpoint, the Raptors continue to invest in a core that hasn\u0026#39;t yet proved capable of making the playoffs. Poeltl gives Toronto four starters under contract for a combined $145 million in 2027-28, and granting that one of them (\u003ca data-player-guid=\"735792ca-bca3-6bab-e2ed-68f39ccc7270\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3913176/brandon-ingram\"\u003eBrandon Ingram\u003c/a\u003e, acquired at the trade deadline) has yet to make his Raptors debut, it\u0026#39;s far from clear that this group is good enough to contend in the East.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven that context and the lack of urgency to extend Poeltl, I would have waited. This exact deal would not have been possible once the season started, but if Poeltl was willing to exercise his player option, Toronto could have executed an identical contract before the start of free agency next summer. In signing a deal that won\u0026#39;t kick in for two years, I think the Raptors are taking on too much risk for too little reward.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI\u0026#39;m much higher on the Mamukelashvili signing. He averaged 20.4 points per 36 minutes for the Spurs last season, including a 34-point outburst on 13-of-14 shooting against the \u003ca data-clubhouse-guid=\"61719eb2-11c3-4e3d-90c3-0a1319fd850b\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/ny/new-york-knicks\"\u003eNew York Knicks\u003c/a\u003e in March.

(Jackson was 17th in the voting, 13 points shy of making the third team.)\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing cap space to renegotiate Jackson\u0026#39;s 2025-26 salary upward allowed Memphis to make a more competitive extension offer. This structure presumably adds $10 million to Jackson\u0026#39;s current contract, allowing his starting salary to bump up to $46 million or so in 2026-27. That\u0026#39;s still shy of the max Jackson could have made as an unrestricted free agent next summer ($50 million, based on the NBA\u0026#39;s updated projection of a 7% cap increase), but getting more money now helps make up that difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAll told, Jackson is adding $217 million in new money, as compared to the projected $219 million other teams could have offered on a four-max in 2026 free agency. Locking in the security of a massive deal now in a place Jackson wants to play is probably worth the modest difference.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFrom the Grizzlies\u0026#39; perspective, this is still a huge win. They take the potential of Jackson leaving in free agency off the table, as well as the possibility of him qualifying for the supermax by making All-NBA next season.

Still just 24, Aldama figures to remain a key part of Memphis\u0026#39; rotation through the life of his contract.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eGiven the limited amount of cap space available this summer and Aldama\u0026#39;s modest qualifying offer ($5.9 million), it\u0026#39;s possible the Grizzlies could have squeezed him more on this deal. Aldama will make far more than the $44 million that is the most other teams could have offered over this span using the non-taxpayer midlevel exception.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe upside for Memphis is getting to structure Aldama\u0026#39;s contract in a favorable manner. I\u0026#39;d guess his contract will start at its highest point before descending, allowing the Grizzlies to stuff as much salary as possible on their books for this season. Memphis is nowhere near the luxury-tax line and has plenty of flexibility to use its $8.8 million room exception to add a contributor.

Having excelled defensively in a platoon with Lively as Dallas reached the 2024 NBA Finals, Gafford got a chance to play extended minutes between when Lively went down with a stress fracture in his right ankle in January and his own knee sprain in February.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eDuring 11 full games in that span, Gafford averaged 15.0 PPG on 67% shooting, 10.3 RPG and 3.6 BPG, the last of which would have threatened \u003ca data-player-guid=\"0e8844b2-d923-3926-82d2-f19a29d69490\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/5104157/victor-wembanyama\"\u003eVictor Wembanyama\u003c/a\u003e (3.8 BPG) for tops in the NBA. Typically just a finisher on offense, Gafford even created in the post with the team battling multiple injuries. His 52 post-ups last season was a career high, per GeniusIQ tracking, although Gafford\u0026#39;s efficiency on those plays wasn\u0026#39;t especially strong.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBesides the limitations on Gafford\u0026#39;s role with the Mavericks, a trade now also makes sense because this could be the peak of his performance. Gafford will be 27 in October, and while his size won\u0026#39;t fade, Gafford might not remain such a strong above-the-rim threat as he nears his 30s.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBased on those factors, it was important for Dallas to craft an extension with a maximum 20% raise in 2026-27 (a starting salary of $17.3 million) and 5% annual raises that fits restrictions on extend-and-trade deals. By virtue of apparently staying within that, the Mavericks can trade Gafford as soon as he signs the extension -- or, hypothetically, even before then.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHaving Gafford under contract an additional three seasons shouldn\u0026#39;t hurt his trade value at all. This extension pays him barely more than the expected 2026-27 non-taxpayer midlevel exception of $15.5 million, and Gafford has easily outpaced that in terms of value thus far. From his perspective, locking in his deal a year ahead of time does take injury risk off the table. So I\u0026#39;d consider this move a win-win.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe next question is which teams could be in the market for Gafford. He\u0026#39;s an obvious fit for the \u003ca data-clubhouse-guid=\"2876e98b-b9bc-2920-4319-46e6943f8be4\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lal/los-angeles-lakers\"\u003eLos Angeles Lakers\u003c/a\u003e, having demonstrated his comfort running pick-and-rolls with \u003ca data-player-guid=\"583794eb-0f38-9bbd-3e25-9dd33b7f83b8\" href=\"https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/3945274/luka-doncic\"\u003eLuka Doncic\u003c/a\u003e, but that idea seems triggering for already aggrieved Dallas fans.
