  "text": "Autumn Nations Series: England v New ZealandVenue: Allianz Stadium, Twickenham Date: Saturday, 2 November Kick-off: 15:10 GMTCoverage: Listen to live commentary on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, and follow live text commentary on the BBC Sport website and app.Centre Henry Slade will resume his starting role in England's midfield against New Zealand on Saturday despite playing only 54 minutes of club rugby this season.Slade had shoulder surgery in the summer and only made his comeback in Exeter's defeat by Harlequins last weekend.Elsewhere, Ben Spencer, whose previous six caps have all come as a replacement, comes in for the injured Alex Mitchell at scrum-half, with Bristol's Harry Randall on the bench.Tom Curry is included in the back row alongside Chandler Cunningham-South and Ben Earl, with brother Ben among six forwards replacements.George Ford, fit again after a quad injury, is also on the bench, but there is no place for Sam Underhill, who started both England's July defeats in New Zealand, in the matchday squad.Ellis Genge, who missed the summer tour with a calf injury, is back at loose-head prop and named as one of four vice-captains to back up skipper Jamie George.Second row and new Saracens captain Maro Itoje, Ford and Earl complete the on-pitch leadership group.\"We’re excited for the challenge of playing against one of the best teams in world rugby,\" said head coach Steve Borthwick.\"We’ll need to be accurate, keep our discipline, and maintain a level of intensity throughout the match, from the first whistle to the final moment.\"With just two games at Allianz Stadium in our last 15, it’s fantastic to be returning to play in front of our home crowd again.\"England drew 25-25 in their most recent Twickenham meeting with New Zealand in 2022. Although England famously trumped the tournament favourites at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, they have to go back to 2012 for their last win over the All Blacks on home soil. England: Furbank; Feyi-Waboso, Slade, Lawrence, Freeman; M Smith, Spencer; Genge, George (capt), Stuart; Itoje, Martin; Cunningham-South, T Curry, Earl.Replacements: Dan, Baxter, Cole, Isiekwe, B Curry, Dombrandt, Randall, Ford.Borthwick did have other options to fill midfield, with Saracens pair Alex Lozowski and Elliot Daly both in form and with game time under their belts, but has been keen to have Slade back as a key part of his side.The 31-year-old has formed a centre partnership with Ollie Lawrence and steers the backline in their new aggressive defensive system.Borthwick praised Slade's desire to get back into \"great shape\".“Sladey is a really important player for us. He’s an experienced Test match player and he’s in fantastic condition,” said Borthwick.“With the shoulder surgery he’s had, he’s been able to be run. He’s as fit as I’ve ever seen him.“He feels in great shape. He’s a player who is energised and he’ll go really well on Saturday.”Spencer, one of whose replacement appearances came in the 2019 Rugby World Cup final, gets his first England start at the age of 32.The Bath scrum-half told Rugby Union Weekly this month he would \"love the opportunity to show what I can do as part of the starting XV\" having been capped twice as a replacement against Japan and New Zealand in the summer.\"Ben has been around this England squad for a period of time now,\" said Borthwick.\"It is just about an understanding of how to play and he has been such a consistent performer for his club for so long. He performs in big games.\"Look at the Premiership final for Bath, I thought he was outstanding.\"Borthwick confirmed that Ollie Chessum will miss the entire autumn programme that also includes fixtures against Australia, South Africa and Japan after having knee surgery on Monday.The Leicester forward was tipped to start at blindside flanker until he was injured during last week’s training camp in Girona. The 24-year-old is expected to be fit for England's Six Nations campaign, which starts against Ireland on 1 February.Borthwick said Underhill was still regaining his best form for Bath following an ankle operation early in the season.\"When you have an ankle surgery you can't be on your feet and so much of Sam’s game is that constant work rate, particularly in defence,\" he said.\"But his link play in attack has developed. I've seen even from last week to this week a step forward, which is great.\"",
