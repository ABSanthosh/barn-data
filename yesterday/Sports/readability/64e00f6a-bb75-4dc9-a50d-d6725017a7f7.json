The two-time Euroleague first-teamer returns to the States and NBA. pic.twitter.com/4f75izENgM— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) July 1, 2025Former Wisconsin Badgers basketball star Nigel Hayes-Davis has agreed to a one-year contract with the Phoenix Suns, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania. The deal is fully guaranteed. It marks Hayes-Davis' first taste of NBA action since he played five games with the Sacramento Kings during the 2017-18 slate.The news arrives roughly one month after the Badger alumnus wrapped up a spectacular season with Fenerbahce Beko Istanbul in Turkey. Hayes-Davis capped off the 2024-25 EuroLeague campaign with an 81-70 victory over Monaco, securing him EuroLeague Final Four MVP honors and the club's first championship since 2017. Hayes-Davis' recent title followed another championship run last summer, when he pocketed a Turkish League Championship and MVP honor in Turkey’s Basketbol Süper Ligi Finals. The Ohio native averaged over 17 points per game to snag finals MVP honors throughout the series, which ignited his return to professional basketball in the United States.Between his time in Europe, the former Badger suited up alongside the USA Men's National Team during its exhibition schedule before the Olympic crew won gold at the 2024 Paris Olympics. Outside of practice, he played exhibitions in Las Vegas, London and Abu Dhabi alongside a bevy of NBA Hall of Famers, including now-teammate Devin Booker.Hayes-Davis reportedly drew interest from the Boston Celtics' head coach Joe Mazulla, who was spotted in Istanbul for the Bachesehir - Fenerbahçe game in early June. While the Celtics didn't bite, another franchise did.The former Wisconsin standout suited up in nine games for the Kings, Lakers and Raptors during the 2017-18 slate following his career in Madison, but he didn't experience as much success as he did in college. His European basketball journey appears to have rejuvenated his career, and now he will look to compete alongside players like Booker, Jalen Green, Bradley Beal, Dillon Brooks and Mark Williams.During his time in Madison, Hayes-Davis was named Big Ten Sixth Man of the Year (2014), a two-time third-team All-Big Ten (2015, 2017) honoree and an All-Big Ten first team selection in 2016. He, along with Frank Kaminsky and Sam Dekker, wound up in the 2015 NCAA title game against the Duke Blue Devils during one of the most memorable runs in franchise history.Contact/Follow @TheBadgersWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Wisconsin Badgers news, notes and opinion Facebook Twitter Email",
