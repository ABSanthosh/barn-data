  "text": "England captain Harry Brook's assessment that Joe Root \"is only getting better with age\" is likely to send shivers down the spines of bowlers all around the world. Root surpassed World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals during his epic 166 not out against West Indies in Cardiff, a title he also holds in Tests. He came to the crease in the first over, and withstood all of West Indies' pressure when England were on the ropes at 133-5 in pursuit of 309 to win. A 98-ball century was raised having barely broken a sweat, reaching it in style with a six and a four, before the Yorkshireman glided into the next gear in his stand of 143 with Will Jacks which saw the helpless bowlers at his mercy. \"He's unbelievable and he's only getting better with age as well,\" said Brook, who made 47 and added a counter-attacking 85 for the third wicket with Root, who stayed in his skipper's slipstream in a perfectly paced knock.\"He's someone I look up to, he's such an amazing player, such an amazing bloke. He works the hardest out of anyone I've seen.\"Nothing's ever right and he's always trying to get better - he's the perfect role model for any young cricketer out there.\"Upon reaching 42, Root bettered Morgan's tally of 6,957 runs and with typical modesty said it felt like \"a sign of getting old\" when asked about what the milestone meant - before adding there is plenty more in the tank as far as his future in the format is concerned, though he is still some way from reaching Sachin Tendulkar's record of 18,426.\"Until that desire, that want to turn up and get better every day and add to the group – the want to be not out at the end of a chase like that – when that's not a burning desire for me any more, it'll be time to stop,\" said 34-year-old Root.\"But that's not the case at the moment and doesn't feel like it's anywhere near the case. I will keep just trying to do my part in helping us win games and hopefully win series.\" Much of the second ODI belonged to West Indies: England spilled three catches inside the first 20 overs, missed two run out chances and then Jamie Smith, Ben Duckett and Jos Buttler all made ducks in the chase. But Root's class prevailed, his 18th ODI century almost certainly one of his finest. \"We are running out of things to say, he's just on this constant journey of ticking everything off before him,\" former England fast bowler Steven Finn told BBC Test Match Special. \"Now he's head and shoulders above the rest and the innings he played today signified his position in that. \"He was so determined to be there at the end and the way he read the situation, soaked up pressure, saw people fall around him - West Indies had no answer.\" Analysis by CricViz analyst Soham SarkhelTicking the strike overSince his debut in ODIs, only two batters have a higher non-boundary strike-rate than Root (minimum of 2,000 non-boundary runs). Off non-boundary balls, Root has a strike-rate of 59.89, England's Jos Buttler is second with 63.77 and at the top is South Africa's AB de Villiers (65.70).High controlSince the start of 2018, Root has a false-shot percentage of only 11.1% in ODIs. In matches between Full Member nations, only one batter in world cricket has a lower false-shot percentage than Root - New Zealand's Kane Williamson (11%).Great against spinRoot averages 70.3 against spin in his ODI career - the next highest English batter is Buttler (52). In ODI history, only five batters average higher against spin than Root for a minimum of 1,500 runs - Mike Hussey (Australia), MS Dhoni (India), Michael Bevan (Australia), Shai Hope (West Indies) and Babar Azam (Pakistan). Of these, only Dhoni has scored more runs against spin than Root, while none of them have scored at a higher strike-rate than Root's 90.Scores runs off good ballsIn his ODI career, Root averages 47.7 against deliveries in the channel outside off stump and scores at a strike-rate of 77 against them. The average right-handed batter averages only 33 on this line. When the ball is wider than that, Root cashes in on the width, scoring at an average of 94.5 and striking at 109.Master of the middle oversBetween overs 11-40, Root averages 66.6 at a strike rate of 87. Only two batters in world cricket have scored at an average and a strike-rate higher than Root's for a minimum of 2,000 runs – India's Virat Kohli (ave 70.7, S/R 93) and De Villiers (ave 68.9, S/R 97).Always evolvingIn ODIs until the end of 2015, Root had seven dismissals playing the reverse sweep at an average of just 7.4. Since the start of 2016, he has averaged 158 with the shot. Previously, he used to reach out well in front while playing the reverse sweep, with an average interception point of 2.10m from the stumps. Since the start of 2016, that has come much closer at 1.77m.",
