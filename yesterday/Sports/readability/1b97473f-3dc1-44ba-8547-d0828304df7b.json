  "text": "Cooper Kupp has spent his entire career with the Rams. (Brandon Sloter/Getty Images) (Brandon Sloter via Getty Images)Cooper Kupp's time with the Los Angeles Rams has apparently come to an end.Kupp shared on social media on Monday night that the Rams were looking to trade him \"immediately,\" and that they were \"working with me and my family to find the right place to continue competing for championships.\"Further specifics on the impending trade are not yet known.\"I don’t agree with the decision and always believed it was going to begin and end in LA,\" Kupp wrote, in part. \"Still, if there’s one thing that I have learned over the years: there are so many things that are out of your control, but it is how you respond to these things that you will look back on and remember.\"The announcement appeared to catch at least one of his teammates off guard.Kupp has spent his entire career with the Rams, who selected him in the third round of the 2017 draft out of Eastern Washington. He had 710 receiving yards and six touchdowns on 67 catches this past season, his eighth in the league.The Rams went 10-7 this past season and won the NFC West. They rolled over the Minnesota Vikings in their first playoff game, but fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in the divisional round. Kupp did not score in the playoffs, but he had six catches for 90 yards combined in their two games.AdvertisementKupp's best season in the league came in 2021, when he helped lead the team to its second ever Super Bowl win. He racked-up 1,947 yards and 16 touchdowns on 145 catches that campaign, all of which led the league. He also averaged an NFL-best 114.5 yards per game. The Rams beat the Cincinnati Bengals in the Super Bowl at their home stadium that season, and Kupp was named the game's MVP.The 31-year-old has two years left on his three-year, $80 million deal. He is owed $20 million next season and just shy of $20 million in 2026.Though he hasn't been anywhere near as good as he was during the Rams' Super Bowl campaign, Kupp is still undoubtedly capable of making an impact somewhere in the league for years to come. As for who wants to take his contract on at this point in his career, though, remains to be seen.",
