  "text": "The Buffalo Bills added to their defensive line by selecting South Carolina defensive tackle TJ Sanders with the 41st overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft.The Bills were impressed with the redshirt junior's play to make a massive swing up the board, making a trade with the Chicago Bears and moving up 15 spots to select the lineman.Sanders is a highly touted defensive tackler in this year's draft class. He can play various spots along the line, lining up as a one-gap and two-gap player. He was an effective part of the Gamecocks defensive line rotation, averaging 36 snaps per game.One of the major things that observers note regarding Sanders is his burst at the snap. He uses his hands well to win against opposing offensive linemen. In addition, Sanders moves extremely well for a player listed at 305 pounds. Buffalo gets one of the more explosive interior players with this pick. Sanders plays well against the run and pass, so it's expected that Buffalo will use him in a variety of situations and possibly different fronts throughout the year.Sanders played in 39 games in college, starting 16 games. He registered 109 tackles, 17.5 tackles for loss, 9.5 sacks, and six passes defensed during his time in South Carolina.The Bills needed to place a priority on their defensive line in this draft, and Sanders clearly addresses that need. Sanders should complement Ed Oliver well, as the newest member of the Bills should eat up some double-teams and help free space for the athletic Oliver. Also, Sanders' athleticism, with his size and power, will cause problems for opponents.In addition, Sanders could see time early, as Bills free agent signing Larry Ogunjobi will miss the first six games of the 2025 campaign due to a suspension. Furthermore, this pick helps give some long-term stability to the line. DaQuan Jones, at 33 years old, is entering the final year of his contract. Sanders should be a core piece of this line for quite some time.Bills Wire will continue to provide updates throughout the 2025 draft. Facebook Twitter Email",
