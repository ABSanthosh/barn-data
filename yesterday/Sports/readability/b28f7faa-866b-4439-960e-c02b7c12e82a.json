(Photo by Josh Lavallee/NHLI via Getty Images) (Josh Lavallee via Getty Images)Alex Ovechkin scored career goal No. 892 for the Washington Capitals on Wednesday night against the Carolina Hurricans, putting him four away from breaking Wayne Gretzky's all-time NHL record of 894.AdvertisementThe goal was a one-time scored at the end of a second period of a lopsided game against the Carolina Hurricanes, narrowing the deficit to 4-1 Jakob Chychrun and Dylan Strome both notched assists on the play.Gretzky and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman will both be in attendance at Capitals games from here on out to ensure they are present for Ovechkin's record-breaking goal.Ovechkin's goal was his 39th of the season, inching him closer to the 14th 40-goal season of his 20-year NHL career. He's currently tied for third in goals scored this season and will likely come up short in his bid for a 10th Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy.AdvertisementThe Eastern Conference-leading Capitals have seven games to play in the regular season.Capitals remaining scheduleFri, Apr 4: vs. Chicago, 7 p.m. ETSun, Apr 6: at Islanders, 12:30 p.m. ETThu, Apr 10: vs. Carolina, 7:30 p.m. ETSat, Apr 12: at Columbus, 7 p.m. ETSun, Apr 13: vs. Columbus, 6 p.m. ETTue, Apr 15: at Islanders, 8 p.m. ETThu, Apr 17: at Pittsburgh, 7 p.m. ETNHL top-10 in career goals1.
