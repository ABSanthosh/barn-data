  "text": "Braden Fiske was only teammates with Cooper Kupp for one season, but the 2024 second-round rookie already had built up a lot of admiration for the veteran receiver.Fiske told DJ Siddiqi of RG.org that he didn't start to build a relationship with Kupp until the end of the season, but he was disappointed when reports surfaced that the team planned to move on from him during the 2025 offseason.“As I’ve kind of learned, it’s the unfortunate side of the business—you never wanna see your brother get traded or released,\" Fiske said. “Being a young player, you’re always surprised by moves like that ‘cause you’re so new to the league, and in college, you’re so used to guys being there. ... Obviously, it was tough.”Fiske finished his spectacular rookie season with 8.5 sacks, 10 quarterback hits and two forced fumbles. He is poised to be a figurehead on the Rams' young defense alongside 2024 Defensive Rookie of the Year Jared Verse. And along the way, Fiske picked up some learnings from Kupp despite them playing on opposite sides of the ball.“I can’t really say enough good things about him,\" Fiske said. \"He really is one of the greatest humans I’ve been around, and just the way he carries himself, the way he goes about his work, the way he loves and takes care of his family. He really is top-notch. It sucks to see him go, but I’m excited to see where his journey takes him.\"Fiske isn't the only Rams player to effuse praise for Kupp. Receivers Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell already talked about how much they'll miss their fellow wideout.Kupp's absence will be felt in the locker room, but Fiske and the Rams will still get to see Kupp throughout the season after he signed with the NFC West rival Seattle Seahawks. Kupp will face his old squad twice a year in 2025 and as long as he remains with the Seahawks. The Rams, meanwhile, replaced Kupp with Davante Adams to play opposite Nacua. Facebook Twitter Email",
