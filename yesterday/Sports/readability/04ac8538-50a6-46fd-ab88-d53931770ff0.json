  "text": "Diontae Johnson, who was on his third team this season, has recorded four receptions for 30 yards since Week 8. (Photo by Brooke Sutton/Getty Images)Diontae Johnson has been claimed on waivers by the Baltimore Ravens one day after he parted ways with the Houston Texans, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.Johnson joined the Texans on Dec. 26 after being waived by the Ravens. He played one regular season game and one playoff game for Houston, recording three receptions for 24 yards in those two games.“Unfortunately, it didn’t work out,\" said Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans. \"We are onto the Chiefs.”Why would the Ravens bring Johnson back, especially if he's ineligible to play again this season? Johnson cannot technically join Baltimore until after the Super Bowl and since he's an unrestricted free agent this offseason he can potentially earn the Ravens an extra draft pick in 2026 if he signs with another team through the NFL's compensatory pick formula.The Texans were Johnson's third team this season after beginning the year with the Carolina Panthers before being traded to the Ravens on Oct. 29. He played seven regular season games with the Panthers and four with the Ravens before landing with the Texans following Tank Dell's season-ending injury.Johnson, 28, was acquired by Baltimore to bolster their receiver depth, but he was later suspended one game for refusing to enter their game against the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 13. He never played for the Ravens again after being waived on Dec. 20.Johnson played 16 snaps, according to Football Guys, during the Texans' 32-12 wild-card victory over the Los Angeles Chargers. Houston will face the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round on Saturday (4:30 p.m. ET; ABC).",
