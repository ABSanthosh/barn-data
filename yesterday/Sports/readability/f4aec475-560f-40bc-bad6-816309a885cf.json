  "text": "ESPNApr 2, 2025, 02:38 PM ETDefensive end Trey Hendrickson said Wednesday that he's disappointed and confused by Cincinnati Bengals executive Katie Blackburn's recent comments on his contract talks with the team.On Tuesday, at the NFL's annual meeting, Blackburn, the Bengals' executive vice president, said of Hendrickson, \"I think he should be happy at certain rates that maybe he doesn't think he'd be happy at. I think some of it is on him to be happy at some point, and if he's not, you know, that's what holds it up sometimes. So, you know, it takes him to say yes to something, and also, we have all the respect in the world for him.\"Hendrickson, who is looking for a new contract after posting 17.5 sacks each of the past two seasons, expressed his displeasure with those comments Wednesday in an appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\"\"First off, yesterday was April Fools' [Day] so I was traded to all 31 teams and had like a hundred different contracts. The one thing I was hoping was an April Fools' joke [was those comments]. Called my agent [Harold Lewis], found out it was not, and that was a little disappointing because the communication has been poor over the last couple of months,\" he said.Hendrickson said the Bengals have not communicated with his agent directly about his contract, saying that has \"been something that's been a little bit frustrating.\"\"We're on the D-end National Football League Street. The market value for that is going up like it did for wide receivers last year. Where I fit in that road is all up to discretion. We're willing to talk about those things. With the market continuing to go up, I'm not going to apologize for that, because I've been basically asking for the same thing every year, to be solidified as a Cincinnati Bengal for life.\" Trey Hendrickson Hendrickson, who is set to enter the final year of his contract, said the team told him in a meeting with his agent last year that something would get done with his contract this year, which he said was reiterated at the scouting combine in February.\"Open line of communication is always open with me and my agent, so if they have anything they'd like to discuss, we've been nothing but willing to listen,\" he said.Hendrickson, 31, is coming off his best season in the league. He led the NFL in sacks and was named to the All-Pro team for the first time in his career. Hendrickson also made the Pro Bowl for the fourth straight season. However, at $21 million, he ranks 10th among edge rushers in average annual salary, according to OverTheCap.com.Hendrickson's contract is the final hurdle remaining for the Bengals in an offseason when they also needed to address deals for wide receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. The Bengals took care of both of their star wide receivers last month, signing Chase to a four-year, $161 million extension and Higgins to a four-year, $115 million contract.\"Through this process, communication, when I say it's been poor, it's been, like, here and there,\" Hendrickson said. \"And respect to Ja'Marr and Tee. I don't want to take anything from all the great things they've accomplished in their careers. They deserve everything that they've gotten, and no doubt in my mind they're going to excel in the National Football League. I have a tremendous respect for both of them. But when it comes to my situation, it would have been nice to know in some ways, like, 'Hey we're going to put you in the queue,' no problem with me.\"He said that he's not looking to become the highest-paid defensive end or \"first in line\" to get a deal done but that with organized team activities set to begin later this month, there's an urgency to get something done.\"When you have things like OTAs coming and guys like Sam Hubbard, who's been a tremendous captain for our team last year, that leaves a vacancy for that and I'm excited to fill that, but how do we reach that before we get there. Those are the things that matter when you're talking about a Super Bowl. It's in the little things and the little details,\" Hendrickson said.Hubbard, also a defensive end, announced his retirement from the NFL last month after seven seasons with the Bengals.The Bengals had granted Hendrickson permission to seek a trade earlier this offseason, but so far there have been no developments on that front. Asked Wednesday whether he has a deadline in mind on when he needs to get a deal or, if it comes to it, force a trade, Hendrickson said he doesn't know whether he \"can put a time stamp\" on that.\"That's where to read what I read yesterday was confusing, like it's my decision. I would have been willing to sign three years ago, two years ago and this year. It was communicated to me we would get something done this year and reiterated with [director of player personnel Duke Tobin's] comments at the combine. I treat it like a house now; house value has gone up, it's the cost of living. In some ways life continues to go forward. I know I'm a football player. I'm training to be the best Trey Hendrickson I can be, and however that looks, whatever team, we can address that,\" he said.Regarding his contract, he said, \"There are things I'm willing to do and things I'm not willing to fudge on.\"\"I don't think I want to play for incentives that will be out of my control. I don't think I want to play on a short-term contract and see where it goes. I would like to be able to tell my wife, here's where we're going to build a family together,\" he said.He noted that the price keeps going up each year based on contracts signed by his peers the past few years. Just this year, Maxx Crosby and Myles Garrett have reset the edge rusher market with their deals.\"Three years ago, it was the Rashan Garys, the Montez Sweats; those guys were balling out. The next year it was the Brian Burns, the Josh Allen deals; they were balling,\" he said. \"Now it's getting to the point where guys with two years left on their deals, Maxx Crosby, Myles Garrett; guys with one year left on their deals, Danielle Hunter, myself, T.J. [Watt] and obviously Micah Parsons, he's an incredible athlete as well.\"I see that as that's the street. We're on the D-end National Football League Street. The market value for that is going up like it did for wide receivers last year. Where I fit in that road is all up to discretion. We're willing to talk about those things. With the market continuing to go up, I'm not going to apologize for that, because I've been basically asking for the same thing every year, to be solidified as a Cincinnati Bengal for life.\"ESPN's Ben Baby contributed to this report.",
