  "text": "ESPN News ServicesMay 20, 2025, 06:11 PM ETBoston Red Sox right-hander Walker Buehler, activated earlier in the day from the 15-day injured list, was ejected from his start against the visiting New York Mets in the third inning for arguing balls and strikes.After two balls to open up an at-bat by Juan Soto, Francisco Lindor stole second safely. After Lindor's slide, Buehler approached plate umpire Mike Estabrook, while yelling and pointing his finger. He was quickly ejected, and moments later, Boston manager Alex Cora was also ejected.It is the second consecutive game that the Red Sox will play without Cora. On Monday, he missed the series opener to attend his daughter's graduation at Boston College. He was replaced both nights by bench coach Ramon Vazquez.Cora shouted in Estabrook's face for a while, and first base umpire Laz Diaz eventually stepped in to keep the two apart. Cora made contact with Diaz as he continued to verbally let loose on Estabrook, then finally made his way to the clubhouse to cheers from Boston fans.Brennan Bernardino replaced Buehler and inherited the count on Soto. He proceeded to walk him on four pitches in a scoreless game.Buehler had not pitched for the Red Sox since April 26 because of right shoulder issues. He was scratched from his next start and ensuing tests revealed he had bursitis in the shoulder.Buehler, 30, pitched a three-inning simulated game Thursday and indicated he fared well and was ready to return.Although this outing was short, Buehler has now started seven games during his first season with the Red Sox. He entered Tuesday's game at 4-1 with a 4.28 ERA and 29 strikeouts against nine walks in 33⅔ innings.Boston optioned right-hander Nick Burdi to Triple-A Worcester in a corresponding move. The 32-year-old made two appearances and pitched 2⅓ scoreless innings for Boston.A member of the Los Angeles Dodgers organization until signing with Boston as a free agent last December, Buehler has undergone two Tommy John surgeries during his career, and the latter one in 2022 caused him to sit out the 2023 season and make his 2024 debut in May.Buehler last made it through a full season without issue in 2021 when he made a career-high 33 starts, which led the major leagues that season. He went 16-4 with a 2.47 ERA that season and was selected to the All-Star Game for the second time.The Dodgers selected Buehler with the 24th pick of the 2015 MLB draft.Information from Field Level Media and the Associated Press was used in this report.",
