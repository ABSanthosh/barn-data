  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. PostPocket is a simple tool, aiming to help users keep track of various links, posts, articles, videos, or anything from across the internet. It allows you to save everything in one centralized place. The app also has categorization, allowing you to keep all of your links sorted. The app is available on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Why PostPocket Obviously, many social media platforms have their own bookmarking features, allowing users to save posts they like for later. Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube all have their own version of a “bookmarking” feature. However, some platforms make it easier than others. Instagram, for example, requires you to crawl through a couple of menus to find your saved posts. Additionally, with all of the varying Twitter alternatives on the market, you might come across a post on one platform that you want to save, but can’t. Threads doesn’t offer a bookmarks feature, so it can be hard to find something later, especially if you’re liking a ton of posts. With all of that being said, there’s obviously a lot of fragmentation when it comes to saving things to view later, especially within apps. PostPocket aims to simplify things a bit. How it works PostPocket integrates within the share sheet of iOS, allowing you to quickly hit the share button in any app, then with just the tap of a button – you can start adding it to PostPocket. Once you’re in PostPocket (from within the share sheet), you can just save the post as is, or you can choose to apply a category, tag, or custom title in the moment. Categories give you an easy way to sort from within PostPocket, and tags allow for additional granularity within a category. PostPocket offers a ton to help keep your varying links organized. All of your data is also stored on iCloud, allowing it to easily sync across all Apple devices. That also means all of your links are kept private. Download PostPocket PostPocket is available for free on the App Store in a limited capacity, and you can purchase PostPocket+ for just $8.99 lifetime. There’s also a monthly plan for $0.99/month, if that interests you. PostPocket+ is ad free, enables tags, and allows you to import/export your data.
