  "description": "Macworld Black Friday is our favorite time of the year because when else could you see a brand-new MacBook Air laptop drop to a new best price? The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air is now available for $1,234 at Amazon, a solid $265 off its MSRP and a whopping $465 off the price just a month ago when the base model started with 8GB of RAM. This is a powerful laptop, especially thanks to the M3 chip, which is great for multitasking, creative work, or just having fun online. The laptop also comes with 16GB of unified memory, which is enough to help you run any app you want or swap from one app to another with ease. The model that’s on sale also features 512GB of storage, which is quite enough for most apps, files, and personal content we usually store. Our review of the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air concluded with a 4.5-star rating, and our editor praised the laptop’s outstanding performance, fantastic battery life, and balance between price, features, and quality. “Overall, the M3 MacBook Air succeeds in continuing in its role as the laptop for everyone,” the review reads. This, of course, is even better reflected in the discount we’re seeing ahead of Black Friday. The MacBook Air is perfect for your everyday workload, having fun streaming content, and anything else you want to do. So jump on the chance to get your very own MacBook Air with an M3 chip and 512GB for $1,234 at Amazon ahead of Black Friday. A 512GB MacBook Air M3 this cheap?Buy it now at Amazon",
