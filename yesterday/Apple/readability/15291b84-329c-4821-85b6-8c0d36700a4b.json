  "description": "Macworld Apple’s Magic Mouse doesn’t usually go on sale—and we’ve never seen it this low. Apple’s Magic Mouse with a Lightning port is available for an all-time low of $60 at Woot right now, a savings of $20 and 25 percent off its MSRP. That’s not just a great a discount—it’s the lowest we’ve ever seen. This isn’t the newest version of the Magic Mouse, but other than a Lightning port instead of USB-C, it’s identical to the one Apple sells. You probably already know that you need to flip it upside down to charge it, but that’s the same with the newer model. If you don’t have Lightning cables anymore, don’t worry because there’s a USB-C to Lightning cable included in the box. You won’t even have to charge it that often because the internal battery will last for about a month before it needs your attention again. Apple’s Magic Mouse with a super low profile that features a single clickable surface with two customizable buttons and a multi-touch area that you can use to scroll and swipe with ease. The sleek design also allows you to glide across the desk however you need. So go and order your Apple Magic Mouse for $60 at Woot while you can still get one. Apple gear always sells out fast and this one is a clearance item so it’s likely to go quickly, so hurry up before they disappear like magic.
