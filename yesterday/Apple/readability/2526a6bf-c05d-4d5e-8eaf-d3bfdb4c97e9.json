  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. VoicePen is a native app for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Vision Pro that transcribes your lectures, meetings, and any sort of speech into clear notes. All of the transcriptions run through OpenAI’s Whisper model, making it accurate and fast. It also offers more than just meeting transcriptions, and can be used for YouTube videos and other online content. Top features VoicePen supports recordings up to 2 hours, allowing you to transcribe pretty long meetings and classes. It even supports background recording, so you don’t need to have the app open the whole time. Afterwards, recordings are transcribed through OpenAI’s Whisper model, allowing for precise transcriptions. There’s also options for rewriting the transcription, allowing you to adjust its style for your tastes. There’s also folders for easy organization, and the app supports iCloud Sync, allowing for your same notes to be available across all of your Apple devices. VoicePen also has home screen widgets, live activities, and app intents with Siri. And, as mentioned earlier – it also supports uploads of online content. You can transcribe podcasts, YouTube videos, zoom recordings, and whatever else floats your boat. Download the app VoicePen is available for free on the App Store for devices running iOS 17, macOS Sonoma 14.0, or visionOS 1 and later. The free app is fairly capable, but for the full experience, including unlimited recordings and summarizations, you’ll need the premium subscription, which is available for $9.99/month or $44.99/year. Both plans offer free trials.
