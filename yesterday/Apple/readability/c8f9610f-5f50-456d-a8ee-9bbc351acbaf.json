  "text": "Instagram last month announced Edits, a new video editor app for mobile platforms that aims to compete with CapCut (owned by ByteDance, which is behind TikTok). Although Meta promised to launch the new app on March 13, it now appears that it will be released a bit later than expected. Edits app from Instagram coming later next month The pre-order page on the App Store for the new Instagram Edits app now says that the video editor is expected to launch on March 31, 2025 – two weeks later than the original date. There’s no word from Meta as to why the launch has been delayed. Edits was announced by Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri, who described the app as a tool for people who are “passionate about making videos” using their phone. According to the executive, the app is a “full suite of creative tools” and will offer features such as: A dedicated inspiration tab Another tab to keep track of your ideas A “much higher quality camera” for shooting videos “All the editing tools you’d expect” Ability to share drafts with friends and other creators Easy export to Instagram, and powerful insights for Reels content Based on screenshots, Instagram Edits will let users crop videos, combine multiple clips, add sounds and voiceover, create subtitles, and much more. The app will also have options to record videos directly from it, with resolution, frame rate, and color profile settings. Meta says Edits will let users export videos to other platforms with no watermark. Coincidentally or not, Edits was announced on the same day that TikTok and CapCut were banned in the US. Given that Instagram has the Reels platform that competes directly with TikTok when it comes to short vertical videos, it’s no surprise to see the Meta investing in its own video editor. Edits will be released first for iPhone, with the version set to be released “soon after.” Read also WhatsApp begins rolling out chat themes to everyone Threads now lets users share their custom feeds with others The return of ‘OG Facebook’ is a big Meta priority this year Telegram adds AI-powered sticker search and improved video player ChatGPT integration in WhatsApp now supports images and voice messages Best deals on Apple products Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
