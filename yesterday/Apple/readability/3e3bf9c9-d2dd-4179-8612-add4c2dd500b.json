As a whole, the iPhone 17 Pro is expected to introduce radical visual changes, with many sources claiming the device will feature a redesigned camera bump. We've also heard a lot about the materials and features of the iPhone 17 Pro, but there have been few claims about the color options Apple plans to offer. Now, leaker Majin Bu claims to have the details on the exclusive color that's expected to debut with Apple's 2025 flagship. In a post on their website, the leaker says that the iPhone 17 Pro will be available in \"YuangFeng Blue\" or Sky Blue, which would look similar to the recently introduced M4 MacBook Air and M3 iPad Air. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe leaker's use of \"YuangFeng Blue\" makes it obvious where their information comes from. Majin Bu often repeats rumors originally shared on Chinese social media, making various iPhone-related claims somewhat more accessible to an English-speaking audience. Bu's latest website post mostly consists of adjectives praising Apple's choice of color options. Still, it provides a few interesting details about the rumored Sky Blue color. Supposedly, \"sources close to the supply chain\" claim that the Sky Blue color has seen use on prototype units, and that it \"will be the star of the September 2025 launch event.\" Though Apple is reportedly testing two other color options â€” dark purple and green â€” Sky Blue is said to be the frontrunner. While Apple offered a similar color with the iPhone 13 Pro, which was available in Sierra Blue, the claims of a Sky Blue iPhone 17 Pro seem questionable. The only two devices currently available in Sky Blue are the iPad Air and MacBook Air, meaning that the Sky Blue color is not available on Apple's high-end product lines. By offering different color options on different \"tiers\" of devices, Apple keeps its standard and professional product lines visually distinct. This can be seen even with the current iPhone 16 range. If the latest rumor from Majin Bu turns out to be true, then the iPhone 17 Pro would be the only \"Pro\" device offered in the light blue colorway. It's far-fetched, but not impossible. Bu has been right about iPhone colors in the past. They said that the standard iPhone 15 would be offered in green, which did end up happening. Even so, Majin Bu's latest claims must be taken with a grain of salt, given the leaker's less-than-stellar track record. Previously, they claimed Apple would release a red iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus, which never materialized. The leaker also suggested the iPhone 13 Pro would be available in Rose Gold, which turned out to be inaccurate. Most notably, Majin Bu once shared a particularly outlandish iPhone design, with a camera bump resembling a fidget spinner. Again, Majin Bu sources their information from Chinese social media, and it comes from users of varying credibility. As a result, their claims are more often wrong than not, despite the occasional accurate \"leak.\" Bu's latest claims about the iPhone 17 Pro being available in Sky Blue have yet to be corroborated or debunked by other sources. Given the leaker's mixed track record, this rumor has earned the \"Possible\" score for the time being.",
