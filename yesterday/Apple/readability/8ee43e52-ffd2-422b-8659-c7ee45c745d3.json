Marvel Snap is a relatively popular digital card-collecting game. The game's publisher is Nuverse, a subsidiary of none other than ByteDance — the same company that owns the controversial social media platform TikTok, CapCut, and other applications. On January 19, 2025, the United States government enacted a blanket ban against all ByteDance applications, including both TikTok and Marvel Snap. As a result, the apps were no longer available to users in the United States, and they were both removed from the US App Store on iOS. On January 20, following a promise that he would keep TikTok from getting banned, President Trump signed an executive order delaying the TikTok ban by 75 days. Even so, neither Marvel Snap nor TikTok has returned to the App Store in the United States, even though both apps have resumed operation in the country. This means that users can still play Marvel Snap or watch TikTok videos if they still have the app downloaded. In a social media post on Monday, the developer of Marvel Snap, Second Dinner, announced that the game was once again available to users in the United States. The post revealed that Second Dinner is \"working to bring more of its services in-house\" and that it plans to partner with a new publisher. MARVEL SNAP is back online in the U.S. But to make sure this NEVER happens again, we're working to bring more services in-house and partner with a new publisher. This is the start of a new era for MARVEL SNAP.We know this probably leaves you with even more questions than— Second Dinner (@seconddinner) January 21, 2025 That being said, though, the announcement provided no details as to who this new publisher will be — if one is found at all. Second Dinner's social media post also said that Marvel Snap would enter a new era, presumably because it plans to find a new publisher. Though Marvel Snap has resumed operations in the United States, iPhone users still can't download the game from the iOS App Store. Unless Marvel Snap finds a new publisher, the situation will stay that way, as Apple has no plans to reinstate any ByteDance apps and risk a $5,000 per user fine.",
