  "text": "A release candidate build for iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 is now available for users enrolled in the beta testing programs. For users not in the beta testing programs, what this basically means is that the final versions of these system software releases is coming soon, perhaps even next week. macOS Sequoia 15.5 is expected to be mostly a bug fix update with some security patches, and no notable new features are anticipated. iOS 18.5 and iPadOS 18.5 are mostly focused on bug fixes and security patches as well, but also include some minor changes like in-app settings toggles for the controversial Mail Contact Photos feature (along with a toggle for the frustrating Mail Categories feature), the settings of which also remain in the Settings app because redundant redundancy is redundant, and who doesn’t want multiple settings toggles in multiple locations for the same setting? Additionally, it’s now easier to see AppleCare warranty information in Settings app. The biggest new addition to iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and watchOS is a new Progress Pride Flag wallpaper, which Apple says in a press release is made to “celebrate the strength and beauty of LGBTQ+ communities around the world”. There are also release candidate builds of watchOS, tvOS, and visionOS, if you bother with running those. The most recent stable builds of Apple system software are iOS 18.4.1, iPadOS 18.4.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4.1. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.5 Release Candidate Any iPhone or iPad actively enrolled in the beta testing programs for iOS and iPadOS can find the RC build by: Opening the “Settings” app Going to “General” and then head to “Software Update” Choose to download and install iOS 18.5 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 Release Candidate If the Mac is enrolled in the beta testing program you can find the RC build easily: Go to “System Settings” from the  Apple menu Go to “General” and then go to “Software Update” Choose to update and install MacOS Sequoia 15.5 You must restart the iPhone, iPad, or Mac to finish installation. When is the final version of iOS 18.5, iPadOS 18.5, and MacOS Sequoia 15.5 available for everyone? Apple has moved relatively quickly on the beta cycles of iOS 18.5, MacOS Sequoia 15.5, and iPadOS 18.5, and now that the Release Candidate (RC) build is available, the beta testing period is basically over. It’s likely that the RC build will match the final versions, which will be released in the near future, unless some critical bug or issue is discovered in the interim. While Apple doesn’t typically reveal it’s precise software update release schedule for system software, Apple did issue a press release for the 2025 Pride wallpaper and Apple Watch band, which mentions the Apple Watch 2025 Pride band will be available next week. It’s a good bet that if the new Pride watch band is available next week, these new versions of system software will also be available by then too.",
