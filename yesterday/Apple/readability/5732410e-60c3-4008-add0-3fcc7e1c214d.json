This new pro-level portable storage device was first shown off at CES 2025. Fortunately, it was only a short time before it went up for order. Apple was quick on the uptake of Thunderbolt 5 as the latest MacBook Pro and Mac mini support the stand. We had one of the latter on hand to test this out with. We a high amount of video and photo generation, we're always looking for new and diverse storage media. And Seagate-owned LaCie has always been on the top of our list. It's currently available in both 2TB and 4TB flavors and right now, we've been testing out the 2TB model. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeLaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: A familiar design LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: The SSD is small and portableOut of the box, er, gate, this looks like any other LaCie Rugged drive. While LaCie has introduced several form factors over the years, the Rugged line has always kept a familiar design They used to look like a metal box with a rubber bumper around the edge. Starting with the last generation, they evolved to utilize NVMe media and are now entirely covered in silicone with no visible metal. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: Comparing the USB-C Rugged SSD to the new Rugged Pro5 SSDIn fact, when you compare it to the last-gen USB-C or Thunderbolt 4 model, it's basically identical except in a new blue color. We are partial to the iconic orange, especially as the blue is more likely to show dust. You've got the LaCie logo on the top, with rounded edges that fits well into the palm of your hand. The underside has your serial number and regulatory details and \"Designed by Neil Poulton\" stamped into. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: The ports look the same, but the old one is USB-C while the new one is Thunderbolt 5, and is more resistant to waterEven though it looks the same — sans color change — it is a bit more durable than before. The resistance has increased from IP67 to IP68. Additionally, it's still able to withstand drops from up to three meters and can be even run over by a vehicle at up to 2 tons. We can confirm we did not test that last one! With IP ratings, the first number represents solids while the second is for liquid. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: This is easily a drive you'd feel safe taking into the field or to classSo, IP67 promises to stop all dust ingress and can be dropped into water up to a meter deep and be ok. IP68 can be in a meter of water for up to 30 minutes and still come out unscathed and working properly. We can confirm we've put LaCie drives through the wringer over the years without issue. That tough shell gives you the sense of durability. We've never used it, but LaCie also continues to offer its rescue data recovery service. When you get the drive, you receive 5 years included should anything go wrong and you need assistance getting your data back. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: The latest drive from LaCie is an easy win for those who need speedOf course, a certified Thunderbolt 5 cable is included in the box. It measures in at .3m, or roughly a foot. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: Speed \u0026 performanceLet's talk speed. As we mentioned, we are testing the LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD with the latest M4 Pro Mac mini. It has multiple Thunderbolt 5 ports, as does the latest-generation MacBook Pros. Thunderbolt 5 is also backwards compatible, so if you have an older model, it will still work. Just at slower speeds. LaCie, in its lab testing with ideal circumstances, got numbers of 6,700MBps and 5,300MBps for read and write speeds respectively. It's never really possible to hit those max numbers in the real world, but the speeds were still impressive. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: Blackmagic Disk Speed Test results for the Rugged Pro5 SSDBlackmagic gave us speeds of 4,757MBps read and 3,983MBps for write. When we ran AmorphousDiskMark with default settings of five passes of 1 GB and four tests. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: Our AnamorphousDiskMark results for the Rugged Pro5 SSDAt peak, it actually surpassed LaCie's speeds, yielding 7,012MBps and 5,451MBps on the read and write. But, as a fully enclosed drive, those numbers don't last long. The numbers dipped down towards the end of the AmorphousDiskMark test. We also transferred a large 100GB file to the SSD. This took a total of 52 seconds to transfer, which is strikingly fast. Even so, that averages to only 1,923MBps over the course of the whole transfer. Other Thunderbolt 5 SSDs will likely able to offer higher sustained speeds and large file transfers if they are all metal, as it will help keep the heat down. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: We also tested it with our Thunderbolt 4 MacBook ProJust for fun, we also tested this Thunderbolt 5 SSD on our M3 Max MacBook Pro which is only equipped with Thunderbolt 4. BlackMagic gave us 2,954MBps for the read speed and 2,566MBps for the write speed. As you can see, it's still a fast drive but the Thunderbolt 5 interface definitely affords higher performance. Personally, we're OK with that dip in sustained performance for the added durability and design. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: Should you buy it?We geek out about about storage devices probably more than your average user. We've been using LaCie drives for ages. There are these vivid memories we have, which are decades old at this point, of heading into the Apple Store — which at that point was a two-hour drive away. You'd be guaranteed to see the Geniuses walking around holding the raft-looking LaCie Rugged drives. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: We've collected quite a few LaCie drives over the yearsIt wasn't long before we bought our own, followed by many subsequent ones. We've got quite the collection now that shows the progression in the LaCie Rugged design. Frankly, we only have superficial problems with the LaCie Rugged SSD Pro5. Nothing related to performance. We'd love to see additional colorways, including bring back the eye-catching orange that LaCie is known for. The included Thunderbolt 5 cable also isn't color-matched like LaCie usually does. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: It works with the Files app on iPad too, just not at full speedWe have a pile of vibrant orange Type-C cables from all our other LaCie drives. Is it too much for a custom blue or orange one to be included here too? Again — these aren't real complaints and wouldn't preclude us from purchasing the drive. But with solid performance, support, and durability, it's hard to find things to criticize. LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: The box of the 2TB LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSDAs Apple creatives, it ticks all the boxes we need. It's eye catching, reliable, and fast. There aren't a lot of thunderbolt 5 drives on the market, so if you want the latest and greatest, it's worth checking out. Especially when you're looking at portable models. Sleek, durable, iconic design IP68 resistance to water, dust, and drops Super fast Thunderbolt 5 connection for the latest Macs 5 years of data recovery service included One of the very first to be releasedLaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: ConsBlue color shows dustLaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD rating: 5 out of 5 LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD review: Where to buyOrder the LaCie Rugged Pro5 SSD from B\u0026H starting at $329 for the 2TB model.",
