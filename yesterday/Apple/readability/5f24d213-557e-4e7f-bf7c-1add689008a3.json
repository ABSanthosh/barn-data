  "description": "Macworld Let’s say your best buddy–we’ll call him Pietro–uses an Android phone. To each his own, you say. The problem is, Pietro, who doesn’t own a TV and watches shows on his phone (like I said, to each his own) doesn’t subscribe to Apple TV+ because there’s no Android app for that. This means when you excitedly call Pietro after watching the latest episode of Severance that dropped on Friday, you can’t talk about it. Instead, you have to ask him how’s he doing, how the kids are, what he had for dinner, whatever. Ho hum. But today is your (or Pietro’s) lucky day. Apple has released the Apple TV app on Android and it’s now available on the Google Play store. It provides access to all Apple TV+ content, as well as MLS Season Pass. A subscription is required for Apple TV+, which costs $9.99/£9.99 per month; MLS Season Pass is an additional subscription fee, but does not require an Apple TV+ subscription (learn more about MLS Season Pass). Apple TV+ also offers TV shows and movies available to rent or buy but The Verge reports that you cannot access the store from within the Android app. Users on Reddit say that previously purchased shows can’t be accessed, either. The Verge also points out that the Apple TV app for Android is optimized for foldable phones, which Pietro loves to brag about (“Crease? That’s not a crease,” he likes to say). Google’s Dan Seifert posted that the app also has a themeable app icon, picture-in-picture support, as well as offline downloads. So your Android-using buddy really has no excuse for missing out on one of the best shows of the year and a bunch of other great Apple TV+ content. Unless the lack of casting support in the app is a dealbreaker. Then you’re just going to have to go back to chatting about the weather. thrilled to see Apple TV land on Android devices today!it's an excellent Android citizen too:themeable app icon: ✅PIP support: ✅offline downloads: ✅foldable posture support: ✅https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.atve.androidtv.appletv— dan seifert (@dcseifert.bsky.social) 2025-02-12T21:40:07.642227Z",
