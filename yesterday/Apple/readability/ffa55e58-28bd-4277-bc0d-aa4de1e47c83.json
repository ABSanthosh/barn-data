  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Fluro provides a delightful recap of everything you’d need to know in a day, all in a neat Mac interface with a special LED scroller. It delivers the weather, your calendar events, reminders, the news, and more – all with a pinch of nostalgia. What Fluro does First things first, Fluro helps you keep up with your day. It can read off the weather for your location (including upcoming days), keep you up to date with your calendar/reminders, and even read off headlines for the latest news. It also provides the date, time, and the music you’re playing. All of this is delivered through a nostalgic LED scrolling interface from the 80s and 90s: one that you can customize. You can change the font, color, and text scrolling speed. You can also reorganize the order in which items scroll, allowing you to set everything as you’d please. On top of that, you can customize which genre of news you’d like to focus on, in case you’d like to avoid certain topics. It also allows you to increase or decrease the number of articles that’ll scroll through. Fluro can serve as a neat tool for keeping up with headlines, the weather, and anything else that’d be relevant for your day. If you have a larger monitor or a second display to throw it on, its a neat app. Download Fluro Fluro is available on the App Store for $0.99 today only, and is normally available for $2.99. It’s a one time purchase, so you won’t have to worry about any subscriptions or additional paywalls – what you see is what you get. The app is available on Macs running macOS Sonoma and later.
