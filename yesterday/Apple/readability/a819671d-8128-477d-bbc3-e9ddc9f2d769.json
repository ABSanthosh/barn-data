  "text": "Apple is preparing to ship two new Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.2 beta shortly, at least according to two new backend references spotted by Aaron Perris on X. Apple Intelligence features The two features in question are Siri with ChatGPT, and Visual Intelligence for iPhone 16. Both of these features were expected “later this year”, which likely meant iOS 18.2 regardless. However, the additions to the backend are a good sign that nothing will be seeing a delay. Apple unveiled Siri with ChatGPT back at WWDC24, and it’ll allow Apple Intelligence users to tap into ChatGPT when asking more complex questions that require more real world or real time information, whereas Apple’s models will handle more of the personal context and simpler requests. Visual Intelligence, on the other hand, is a newer feature unveiled alongside the iPhone 16 lineup, and it’ll really bring the new Camera Control button to life. You’ll be able to point your camera at a poster and add those details to your calendar, use it to recognize real world items similar to Google Lens, and more. iOS 18.2 beta release The timing on this backend addition is a little interesting, given the fact that iOS 18.2 beta likely won’t be released until the very end of October at the earliest. Apple is expected to release iOS 18.1 to the public on October 28th, and normally the next beta follows just a few days after. It’s possible that the company will do the same thing they did with iOS 18.0 and iOS 18.1, and choose to run two beta tracks at the same time. That’s a little unlikely, but it could be a possibility for why these backend references suddenly showed up today. All we can say for certain is that iOS 18.1 RC is likely imminent, probably releasing to testers later this week. One way or another, we shouldn’t be too far out from our first iOS 18.2 beta. iOS 18.2 is expected to release to the public in December. Other Apple Intelligence features are also expected to be part of iOS 18.2, such as Genmoji and Image Playground.
