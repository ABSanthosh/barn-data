  "text": "News The Apple logo could be on the move in the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro. Photo: Apple The most significant design change to the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max might force a secondary modification. The large camera bar allegedly coming to the two premier models could push down the location of the Apple logo, according to a noted tipster. If true, the new location might cause problems for case makers and a bit of irritation for MagSafe users. Apple logo on iPhone 17 Pro could slide downward Hand wringing over the precise location of the logo on an iPhone might strike some people as unnecessary, but Apple is a company that sweats the details. Its design team absolutely wouldn’t slap the logo down somewhere near the middle of the device then head out to lunch. And so the expansion of the current camera hump in the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max into a wide camera bar — a change that’s appeared consistently in leaks for months — is apparently cause for designers to rethink the location of the Apple logo. “Currently located slightly off-center and below the camera module since the iPhone X, the Apple logo will be moved lower, toward the center bottom of the phone,” claims an unconfirmed report published Saturday by a tipster that goes by Majin Bu. iPhone 17 Pro design: logo moves lower.Here's why Full Article:https://t.co/xeC6d0oBeN pic.twitter.com/Q8QwkT56IL — Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) June 28, 2025 With the camera bar taking up much of the top rear of the device, the Apple logo will supposedly move to be centered in the open space below. Irritation for MagSafe users The change might turn out to be somewhat controversial… at least for regular users of MagSafe accessories. The wireless charging mat built inside the back of iPhone models can’t be seen from the outside. The easiest way to position a MagSafe accessory is to place it right on the Apple logo, as it’s in the center of the mat. But if Majin Bu is correct, the logo will move so it’s no longer at the center of the MagSafe charging mat. While hardly a huge inconvenience, the change will make attaching MagSafe accessories to an iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max less convenient. Makers of iPhone cases reportedly have more of a struggle. One of the highlights of clear plastic cases is that they show the Apple logo. But these also show the location of the MagSafe charging mat, and having the logo off-center in the circular mat looks odd. “Manufacturers of transparent cases, which design their products to highlight the Apple logo as a central element, are reevaluating their projects,” noted Majin Bu. Just note that this is currently only an iPhone 17 rumor. We won’t know the definite design until Apple announces it, probably in September.",
