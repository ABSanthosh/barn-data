You need the right combination of ports, portability, and charging power. With a large battery capacity, fast charging, and compactness due to a GaN design, the P3 Pro isn't a bad choice to bring on the go. Based in Queens, New York, InfinaCore has been making consumer chargers since 2020. InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger: Relatively portable with a square design.Out of the box, the P3 Pro comes with Type G, I, and C international adapters, which cover over thirty countries. It also comes with a cable and carabiner, which hook onto the strap that's on the P3. It has a matte finish and rubbery material, which contributes to the feeling of durability for travel. With a 10500 mAh capacity and 65W output, the P3 Pro serves well in situations where you can plug it in for a while and bring it with you later. Wireless is Qi2 with up to 15W output, and wired output is up to 65W. There's a fast-charging USB-C port, one in/out USB-C port, and a USB-A for other devices. There's also an LCD that automatically rotates with the P3 when you have it vertically or horizontally, depending on how you're using it. It displays the capacity of the battery, as well as the wattage of inputs and outputs. InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger review: In use as a battery.InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger - Specs Product Detail Spec Weight 11.5 oz Ports 2x USB-C, 1x USB-A Wireless Charging Qi2 15W Charging Adapters Types G, I, C Capacity 10500 mAh Maximum Output 65W InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger review: Can be put on a carabiner for travel. InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger - UseI've used the P3 Pro as a daily carry for the past few weeks, and it has not disappointed me. Three ports, as well as wireless charging in a portable format, make meeting most charging demands possible. It brought my iPhone 16 Pro from 30% to 50% in around twelve minutes on fast charging, and a 0-50% charge for iPhone only uses ~23% of the P3 Pro's battery. It runs out of battery much faster when charging my MacBook Pro, but that is expected. This use case is where LCDs on batteries truly shine. It means I'm never surprised about how the battery is doing because I see the status in real-time. And for the times you need to ration charging your phone, that can be very important when you're far away from home. I haven't traveled abroad using the P3 Pro, but I see its potential utility in airports, train and bus stations, and other places where you have limited charging space or few outlets. Due to the weight of the P3 Pro, it tends to fall out of outlets in places like buses during transportation, but this depends on your situation. InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger review: Use on the Amtrak!InfinaCore P3 Pro Charger - Great for the everyday and travelOverall, this is a satisfying portable charger/battery with a variety of features that make it a great travel charger. I've reviewed chargers that tend to lean toward relying on pure efficiency with GaN, but the P3 Pro is a reminder that there's more than just speed when having a genuinely useful charger. If you're planning a trip this year and don't have a permanent battery/charger solution, the P3 Pro is a pretty good choice.
