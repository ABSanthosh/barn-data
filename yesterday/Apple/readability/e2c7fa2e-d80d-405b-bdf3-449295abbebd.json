  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Rovelist is a simple habit tracker app with a clean design, home screen widgets, and an intuitive interface. It’s available on iPhone, and provides everything you’d need to stay motivated and on top of everything you need to get done regularly. Top features With Rovelist, you can track your daily habits with ease, making sure your important tasks never slip your mind. The app also offers habit analytics, providing insights on your habit completion – keeping you in the loop on how you’re doing. It offers a calendar view, allowing you to easily follow past and future habits, and offers reminder notifications so you never lose sight of your goals. On top of that, Rovelist lets you know when you’re on a streak, keeping you motivated with crushing your goals and everyday habits. You can also keep track of these goals from your home screen with its assortment of widgets. Habits don’t just need to be daily, though. You can customize task frequencies, that way you can complete them daily or monthly. Rovelist also celebrates when you’re doing well, with confetti when you reach a habit target, or reminders that you’ve had a perfect day if you check off all of your habits. Download Rovelist Rovelist is available for free on the App Store for iPhones running iOS 18 and later with some feature limitations. For the full experience, including unlimited habit tracking, you can purchase Rovelist Pro – which is available for $1.99/month, $12.99/year, or $24.99 lifetime.
