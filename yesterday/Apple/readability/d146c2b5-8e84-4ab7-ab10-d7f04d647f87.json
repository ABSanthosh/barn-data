  "description": "Macworld The best way to ensure there’s absolutely no way to lose your backpack, even when traveling, is to get this HyperPack Pro. Why? Because it comes with built-in Find My compatibility. Usually available for $200, this backpack just dropped to its best price yet of $150, a massive 25 percent discount. This is a 22L backpack that can fit any MacBook up to and including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which means you’ll have a ton of space inside. Of course, it’s not just for your laptop, and it will actually even fit anything you need to carry. This travel-ready backpack is prepared for all your adventures, as it includes an RFID theft protective pocket for your wallet, as well as an extra hidden lumbar pocket. The zippers interlock, too, so there’s no way someone will unzip these when you’re not paying attention. The fact that this is a laptop with a built-in tracker is the best part, however. Instead of buying a separate tracker, the entire bag acts as an AirTag. It has an IPX4 water resistance and it will ping just like your AirTag does when you use the app, while also issuing an alert when it’s out of range. You can even replace the battery when needed. That’s a dream combo if you ask us. So, if you’re going to invest in a backpack for your summer travels, get this HyperPack Pro for $150 while it’s still on sale. This $50 off backpack will tell you when you forget itBuy now at Amazon",
