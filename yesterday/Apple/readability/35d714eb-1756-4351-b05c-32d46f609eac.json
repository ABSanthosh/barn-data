Thursday's developer beta increases the build number to 7E5080a, up from the previous 7E5067b update, released in January 2025. This beta software release is available for AirPods 4 and AirPods Pro 2, both the USB-C and Lightning models. The software won't be released for AirPods Max or other non-H2 devices. Beta software updates are released periodically for nearly all of Apple's platforms, including AirPods. While beta updates for Apple's mobile and desktop operating systems are released much more frequently, developers still rely on beta software for AirPods to test new features before launch. With version 7B19, Apple introduced Hearing Health features to the AirPods Pro 2, which let users perform hearing tests or use the device as a hearing aid in cases of mild to moderate hearing loss. The subsequent 7B20 and 7B21 updates are still the latest firmware versions available to non-developers. Though the exact contents of Thursday's developer beta are unclear, the software likely includes bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements rather than new features. Apple has not provided any release notes for this beta software update. How to install the AirPods beta firmwareApple has made it relatively easy to download and install beta versions for iOS and macOS, but that's not the case for AirPods firmware updates. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe first step in the process is to have a registered developer account, which is now free. Once you do that, follow these steps: Ensure Developer Mode is enabled in Settings -\u003e Privacy \u0026 Security -\u003e Developer Mode. If it is enabled or after enabling it, go to Settings -\u003e Developer. Near the bottom, select Pre-Release Beta Firmware under AirPods Testing. Select which AirPods you'd like to enroll in the beta. You can watch the video above to see the process if you need any assistance. Be aware that sometimes the Developer Mode might not pop up as required in the process, which means connecting the iPhone to a Mac running the current Xcode beta.",
