  "text": "How-To Find your top songs with Apple Music Replay. Image: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Apple Music Replay is a great way to find your music stats for the past year: the most played songs, artists and albums in the last 12 months. Similar to Spotify Wrapped and the like, your annual Apple replay is a fun way to see what tracks you listened to most in 2024. (Fun fact: Apple usually publicizes Apple Music Replay in November, but it’s actually updated weekly and available throughout the whole year!) We’ll show you how to find it and how to share your top music of the year to your friends and social media. Oddly for this modern age, the Apple Music Replay feature isn’t available directly in the Apple Music app. It’s hosted separately on Apple Music’s webpage. Nonetheless, it’s easily available on all Apple devices — and a great way to look back at the top songs, artists and albums that defined your year. The year-end summary presents charts of your most-played tracks, albums and artists. It also creates a personalized 2024 Apple Music Replay mix, which you can listen back to in the future to reminisce. “The music we enjoy throughout the year becomes like a soundtrack, and it’s really fun to be able to go back and relive those meaningful and memorable moments over again,” said Oliver Schusser, Apple’s vice president of Apple Music and Beats, in a press release announcing Apple Music Replay revamp in 2022. Updated on Sundays, Apple Music Replay also includes “expanded music insights,” like the total number of minutes listened, the number of different artists and songs you played, and your top 10 playlists and stations. It also features a “milestone” tracker, which shows when you hit certain targets when using Apple Music, such as listening to 5,000 songs. How to find your Apple Music Replay Find your Replay here.Screenshot: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Apple Music Replay is available front and center in the Apple Music app during the month of December. It’s in the Home and New tabs along the bottom. That’ll take you directly to the site in Safari. Alternatively, you can visit replay.music.apple.com directly. Tap Jump In and you can sign in using your Apple ID. A quick authentication with Face ID (or Touch ID) will get you in. Browse and share your yearly stats Share your Apple Music Replay stats to friends and social media.Screenshot: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Scroll through the list to see such stats as your top artists, top songs, top albums and top genres through the entire year. You can also see how these changed month-by-month. You’ll also see your top playlists and radio stations and milestones for listening minutes. Finally, you can compare your top artist, song and album against last year’s stats. To share your music stats on social media, tap the Share button in the lower-right corner of any section. From the share sheet, you can send an image to a friend via Messages. You can also post to social media like Snapchat, TikTok or Instagram, or save it to your photo library. (To see the full list of available apps, scroll until you see the ⋯ More icon and then tap that.) How to find your Apple Music Replay playlist Get your annual playlist to reminisce in the years to come.Screenshot: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Scroll farther down on the page to get your annual playlist. Tap Open in Apple Music to find it and tap + in the top-right to add it to your library. You can listen back at any time in the future from the Library tab by tapping Playlists at the top. Replay playlists from years past appear at the bottom of the list. And don’t worry — it’ll continue to update in the final weeks of December to accurately reflect the whole year. This article on Apple Music Replay was originally published on December 2, 2021.
