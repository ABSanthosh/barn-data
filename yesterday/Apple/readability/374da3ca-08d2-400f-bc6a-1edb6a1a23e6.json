Fans are invited to see it at Apple Store locations around the world. Today, Apple released The Weeknd: Open Hearts, a breathtaking immersive music experience from the seven-time diamond-certified artist, available exclusively on Apple Vision Pro for a limited time. Open Hearts is captured in Apple Immersive Video, a remarkable 180-degree media format that leverages ultra-high-resolution immersive video and Spatial Audio to place viewers in the center of the action. Viewers journey alongside the artist on an electrifying sonic voyage as he weaves his way through a surreal, haunting cityscape. Fans are invited to see the immersive experience in its entirety — and enjoy the magic of spatial computing — by booking an Apple Vision Pro demo at their local Apple Store beginning tomorrow, November 15.1 Users can experience Open Hearts for free now with the Apple TV app on Apple Vision Pro. “Apple Immersive Video brings The Weeknd’s creative vision to life in an entirely new way with Open Hearts, a groundbreaking music experience available only on Apple Vision Pro,” said Tor Myhren, Apple’s vice president of Marketing Communications. “With Vision Pro, fans experience storytelling in ways that were not possible before: with immersive visuals and Spatial Audio that make them feel like they’re right in the middle of the action. This is an exciting leap forward in how music and technology come together to deliver memorable experiences for fans, and we’re proud to collaborate with The Weeknd to make it happen.” In the Apple Immersive music experience, viewers journey alongside The Weeknd on an electrifying sonic voyage as he weaves his way through a surreal, haunting cityscape. Open Hearts was directed by Anton Tammi and heavily inspired by Los Angeles’s iconic downtown skyline. Tammi also directed the official music video for Hurry Up Tomorrow’s lead single, “Dancing In the Flames,” which was shot entirely on iPhone 16 Pro Max by Erik Henriksson and edited on Mac. Apple Immersive Video revolutionizes the way fans enjoy music performances, and The Weeknd: Open Hearts is the latest installment in the growing catalog available on Apple Vision Pro for free. Concert for One, the next Apple Immersive music experience launching globally on Friday, November 22, invites fans to enjoy intimate performances from the world’s biggest artists.
