MacCleaner Pro Pros Impressive set of tools Good tutorial system Good level of configuration with the application’s modules Cons Occasionally awkward user interface Price When Reviewed: $74.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase); or $29.95/a year for 1 Mac (usually $14.95 a month) Best Prices Today: Free at Nektony (free 2 day trial)$74.95 at Nektony (one time purchase) MacCleaner Pro from Nektony (version 3.3 at the time of our latest review) is divided into a core app and several module apps, namely App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller, Disk Space Analyzer, Duplicate File Finder, Memory Cleaner, and Funter. The core app can perform an overall disk cleaning and help free up storage space by eliminating extraneous files.  The App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller module works well, and allows you to see the app you’re removing as well as its support files. This module has been improved compared to version 3, and now offers you easier access to startup programs and extension files, allowing you to enable, disable, or remove them. A Remaining Files feature allows you to chase down loose files, while an Open With feature lets you assign applications to open certain file types. With Duplicate File Finder it’s easy to specify file types to look for, such as audio and photo files, with an impressive level of precise control. Memory Cleaner module offers an easy interface to show which applications and processes are consuming the most RAM. Funter module finds hidden files within your operating system.  The Fast Cleanup option was able to clear up 11.4GB of drive space, most of these being application cache files, while the Deep Cleanup feature helped reclaim 65.4GB of drive space.  We did have some peculiar instances in which a reminder poped up advising us to clear disk space for a macOS Sonoma (which was already installed). On another occasion when we paused scanning after half an hour we saw a request for full access to the hard drive.  MacCleaner Pro is easy to install, runs well and has a good feature base. You can buy it on an annual or monthly subscription or as a one-time purchase. The free trial version is fully functioning for two days and will actually perform some of the tasks you need to do, rather than ask you to buy the full version. You can get MacCleaner Pro here.

MacPaw CleanMyMac X Pros Excellent cleaning tools for Mac storage Large toolset Easy to use Cons Updater feature missed some app updates Malware Removal is still producing mixed results Price When Reviewed: $89.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase); or $34.95/a year for 1 Mac (usually £39.95 a year) Best Prices Today: Free at MacPaw (free 7 day trial)$34.95 at MacPaw (one time purchase) CleanMyMac X is a catch-all utility designed to identify and clean out gigabytes upon gigabytes of unused system garbage. It grants you easy access to several handy utilities to clear up disk space, protect user privacy, optimize performance, update applications, uninstall software, and help prevent malware and adware. The modules include Smart Scan, System Junk, Mail Attachments, Trash Bins, Malware Removal, Privacy, Optimization, Maintenance, Uninstaller, Updater, Extensions, Space Lens, Large \u0026 Old Files, and Shredder. Among these you will find tools for file cleanup, malware removal, privacy cleanup, easy access to system extensions, the app uninstaller, and the ability to down multi-GB files you forgot to delete and a quick means of deleting them. Smart Scan is the overarching umbrella feature, hunting down extraneous files that can be deleted to clear drive space, performing a quick malware scan, and executing a speed test to look into optimization functions, such as freeing up RAM or quickly clearing system caches. The Disk Lens and Uninstaller offered a clear view as to which folders were consuming the most drive space and a quick means of removing applications.  I was able to recover more than 30GB of drive space as the program found unused files and disk images galore.  Our main criticism is that the developer overextends themselves by trying to be everything to everyone. Unfortunately, some features aren’t as good as others – particularly the Malware removal module and the Updater function, neither of which work as well as we hoped, even with the antivirus being updated to take advantage of the Moonlock Engine.  CleanMyMac X is easy to download and install, and features a bright, friendly user interface and it’s exceptionally easy to see what’s gobbling up the most space on your Mac’s hard drive. The features are well-integrated. The software costs can be purchased on an annual subscription or a one-time purchase for a 1 Mac license. There’s a free version available to download There is a free trial version available on the Mac App Store and from MacPaw’s website, but it restricts the app to only remove files up to a maximum of 500MB – and in the middle of deleting files it will demand you pay the license fee for the app. You can download that limited version and scan your Mac to see just now much space you can save before committing to buying the app. MacPaw is currently running a 30% discount for students – submit your university email address and receive a download code here.  You can get CleanMyMac X here. Read our full CleanMyMac X review 3. Cleaner One Pro for Mac Pros Quick, stable performance and a handy user interface. The modules work as advertised, and handle duplicate files and cleanup well. Good value for the asking price. Cons Page up and page down keys can’t be used for quick navigation. No free trial to test the software. Certain software elements require a subscription-based account to run. Price When Reviewed: $24.99 a year for 1 device (currently $19.99); or $59.99 a year for 5 devices (currently $29.99) Best Prices Today: $24.99 at Trend Micro Cleaner One Pro for Mac is easy to download and install. The software requires is available in both free and paid subscription-based tiers. For the free tier, the software offers basic scanning and no user limits while requiring no credit or debit card to be stored with Trend Micro. The Basic tier, requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, offers support for one device, access to additional tools, and easy uninstallation if desired. The Advanced tier requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, and offers support for five devices, macOS and Windows support, quick uninstallation, and access to additional tools.  You can purchase from Trend Micro, or via the Mac App Store and an iOS version on the iOS App Store.  Cleaner One Pro is designed around an assortment of modules including Smart Scan, which looks over your storage, diagnostics, and applications, Junk Files, Big Files, Disk Map, Startup Manager, Duplicate Files, Similar Photos, App Manager, and File Shredder. The modules performed well during testing, and were able to locate large files and duplicates to be disposed of. The Junk Files module found a variety of unused disk images and installers. An interface along the Menu Bar tracked memory usage, CPU usage, network usage, and hooked into Dropbox to help put files up on the cloud. There are some elements that require some attention. One annoyance was that you can’t navigate through module windows using the page up and page down keys, only a mouse will suffice. And we encountered a lack of communication from Trend Micro itself for product and technical questions, which was a concern.  Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and offers an elegant and easy to navigate user interface that lets you prune your Mac down effectively. This useful set of Mac cleaning tools comes at a good price, and if you’re looking for something reliable in this field, it’s worth your consideration. You can get Cleaner One Pro here.

Daisy Disk Pros Quickly scans storage and finds large files Graphical representation of storage File name previews Can check cloud storage Cons Some user-interface quirks Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Best Prices Today: $9.99 at Software Ambience (One time purchase) DaisyDisk incorporates a clean, fun, interesting user interface via which it sets out to help you visualize the data on your Mac and its local, network, and cloud-based volumes, map it out, see which files are taking up the most space, and help you free up gigabytes of drive space. DaisyDisk supports a number of file formats and file systems, as well as network volumes, virtual elements and disk images, and can mount and scan just about anything as long as the volume itself is operational.  DaisyDisk can also mount cloud-based services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Box. It was simple to add my Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Box accounts, and then connect and sift through them to see which ancient files could be readily put out to pasture to clear up space as needed. See our round-up of the best cloud backups for Mac. I was able to clear up dozens of gigabytes of space in the process. We did have some difficulties with Google Drive, which refused to allow DaisyDisk access, stating that the app was blocked and “This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access.” This appears to be a conflict between DaisyDisk’s developers and Google that has yet to be sorted out, and while some workarounds have been proposed online, there seems to be no quick solution to the conflict. DaisyDisk users are also currently unable to add and sort through Apple’s iCloud Drive accounts given Apple’s sandboxing of the environment. You can scan a local copy of your iCloud Drive contents using the “Scan Folder…” button but not the Web-based data, which is frustrating. In addition to being able to scan entire volumes at once, you can click the “Select Folder…” button and navigate to a custom folder.  With DaisyDisk it’s entirely up to your own discretion as to which files and folders to delete, with nothing more than a five-second countdown clock and time period in which to cancel the decision. Apple’s Disk Utility app can be accessed from the Menu bar to perform disk repairs on the fly.  Unlike so many apps you don’t have to sign up for a subscription package: the app retails for $9.99/£9.99, which is excellent value.  You can get Daisy Disk here. Read our full Daisy Disk review 5. Gemini 1.1 Pros Quick, reliable, and capable of finding multiple duplicate types Excellent search customization, including folders and external volumes Handy preferences and options, including whitelist creation Cons Lack of additional filters makes sorting located duplicates more tedious than it should be Could use a scheduling feature Price When Reviewed: From $19.95 for 1 Mac, annually Best Prices Today: Free at MacPaw (free 7 day trial)$19.95 at MacPaw (annually) Though not strictly a Mac cleaner, like other apps in this round-up, MacPaw’s Gemini 2 can certainly help you get back some disc space. It is a duplicate removal tool that focuses specifically on reducing the thousands of duplicate photos in your Photos library. It also hunts down duplicate files within Apple Music and across the macOS operating system. The app is available through Apple’s App Store and MacPaw’s SetApp application, which grants access to Gemini and other apps for $9.99 (£7.60) a month. It is easy to install and offers a seven-day free trial in exchange for either your credit or debit card information. The app includes scripts for easy scanning of the Photos library and your Music library, as well as custom folders and external volumes that can be chosen from a menu or dragged, dropped, and quickly scanned. Other features include Menu Bar elements, whitelists that can be created that are exempt from being scanned, and a Duplicate Monitor feature that helps compare files and heads off duplicates before they begin to pile up. In testing, Gemini 2 quickly sought out duplicates, offered the option to remove them, and eradicated them from our hard drive. This also applies to music files and other document types, and the Duplicate Monitor warns you about possible duplicates that have been carried over to your hard drive. However, there are some caveats, such as confusion about account registration and permissions after downloading and installing Gemini 2 from the App Store. MacPaw is urging its clients towards SetApp subscriptions, which offer full access to the company’s apps for a given rate per month. While Gemini 2 runs well, a scheduling feature for folder or volume scans would not go amiss. An improved filter for located duplicate items would be more helpful. Despite some minor hurdles, Gemini 2 is well-written, sharp, helpful, fast, works well with all kinds of duplicates, and lends a good feature set to the macOS operating system without being overbearing. It hones in on its tasks and performs them well enough to earn the trust of users. You can get MacPaw Gemini 2 from the Mac App Store or from MacPaw here. Read our full Gemini 1.1 review 6. Parallels Toolbox Pros Full suite of Mac tools Fully featured free trial Cons May be more than you require Price When Reviewed: $24.99 per year Best Prices Today: Free at Parallels Toolbox Free 14-day Trial $24.99 at Parallels (annually) Parallels Toolbox is a bunch of tools that can be used to perform various actions on your Mac – such as Download Video, Record Audio, Hide Desktop Files, Resize Image, Clipboard History, Find Duplicates, Free Memory, and even the ability to set alarms. Among all these tools is one that can be used to clean your Mac. Mac cleaning tools provided in Parallels Toolbox that could also be useful when cleaning a Mac include Clean Drive, Uninstall Apps, Find Duplicates, and Free Memory. The Clean Drive tool scans your drive and then lets you choose what to delete. You can delete applications by dragging them to the trash, but this doesn’t always completely delete them. Often files and folders can be left scattered around your system that were related to that now gone app. Parallels’s Uninstall Apps tool will remove apps and their associated files from your Mac. Similarly, you can run Find Duplicates to dig out any identical files – even ones that have different file names. Parallel’s Toolbox costs $24.99/£20.99 a year, but the free 14-day trial will actually delete files, free memory and do all those other useful things without you buying the app! You can get an overview of Toolbox’s various features, and download the seven-day trial, from the company’s website. You can get Parallels Toolbox here. Read our full Parallels Toolbox review 7. Nektony App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller Pros Simple user interface Free (with Pro upgrade) Cons Not as full-featured as alternatives Price When Reviewed: $14.95 a year for 1 Mac (usually $7.95 a month) Best Prices Today: Free at Nektony (free 3 day trial)$14.95 at Nektony (annually) Also from Nektony, is the simple and easy to use App Cleaner \u0026 Installer. This lightweight app is actually bundled with MacCleaner Pro (above), but this version focuses on clearing out the broken links, files, and other gubbins that get left behind when apps are uninstalled. It also, as the name suggests, allows you to uninstall apps cleanly from the get-go, and set which ones launch at start up.   There is a free version that does most of these tasks, but if you pay $9.99/£9.99 for the Pro upgrade you’ll also be able to remove system extensions, executable parts of files, and uninstall apps, plus the ads that adorn the free version disappear. Easy to recommend due to both its price and quality. You can get App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller here. 8. Onyx Pros Powerful toolset Versions for older Mac systems readily available Cons UI needs some time to learn Price When Reviewed: Free Best Prices Today: Free at Titanium Software (Donationware) There’s a reason Onyx from Titanium Software has been among the tools of choice for Mac techies for such a long time. It offers a great set of tools and an incredible level of customization. It’s also freeware, so you don’t have to pay a penny, although the developer Titanium Software appreciates donations. Onyx also combines a unique, bare-bones approach to its user interface while offering an incredible level of customization as to what files are affected during a repair. Onyx can repair permissions, rebuild databases, reorganize file structures, check hard disk structures, and restore indexes. It can even repaire Unix-level functions that would otherwise only be accessed through Terminal. The main downside is that it’s not all that simple to use and it’s easy to make errors. Luckily there are handy FAQ links on the Titanium Software website for common issues. There are versions of Onyx for each version of the macOS. You can get Onyx here. Read our full Onyx review 9. CCleaner Pros Impressive customization tools Excellent control over storage Cons User interface is a little clunky Price When Reviewed: $29.95 a year Best Prices Today: $14.99 at Macworld Software Store$29.95 at Piriform Software (annually) CCleaner from Piriform (acquired by Avast, which has subsequently merged with Norton) achieves what it sets out to do: help clean up gigabytes of cache files, internet history files, and locate and purge large files on your Mac, all with an impressive level of control. It’s easy to both analyze a hard drive to determine how much space certain files might be taking up. Options include Uninstall, Startup, Erase Free Space, Large File Finder, and Duplicate File Finder. You can customize which cookies you want to save or purge and chose between Normal file deletion,” which is faster or “Secure file deletion,” which takes longer. Our only nitpick is that the user interface makes it feel very much like a Windows port. In fact, CCleaner has had a similar look and feel for the better part of 20 years. It’s freeware, but there’s an option to pay for a professional version for $29.95/£25.95 a year. In 2017 CCleaner was used to distribute malware. Hackers had inserted malicious code in the legitimate program. This has been rectified. You can get CCleaner here. Read our full CCleaner review 10. Mac Keeper Pros Convenience of having multiple tools in one product Free version lets you access most of the features Cons Paid subscription is expensive Burdened with a bad reputation Price When Reviewed: $62.01 a year for 1 Mac (usually $95.40 a year) Best Prices Today: $62.01 at Clario (annually) We have to start by addressing the fact that MacKeeper doesn’t have the best reputation, although in recent years the company’s new owner – Clario – has tried very hard to rectify that. MacKeeper’s poor reputation wasn’t helped by the fact that it was difficult to uninstall an used scareware tactics to encourage people to upgrade to a paid version. Those issues should now be in the past. The software has received a good grade from AV-Test and has notarization from Apple, among other things, that should give users confidence. In terms of what it can do, MacKeeper offers 11 tools including an antivirus scanner, adware remover, a cleanup feature, a duplicate file finder, and a smart uninstaller. There’s also a memory cleaner, a software update tracker, and a startup item locator. You’ll also find a ID theft guard, a VPN, and an online ad blocker. There’s a free version, that gives you access to most of the tools, as well as a $5 a month for a year subscription. A subscription includes 24-7 tech support through which you can email, chat with, or talk to support staff. You can probably find individual products—and in some cases, more robust products—for each of the features in MacKeeper. But having all these tools under one roof makes for ease and convenience.  You can get MacKeeper here.

Gemini 1.1 Pros Quick, reliable, and capable of finding multiple duplicate types Excellent search customization, including folders and external volumes Handy preferences and options, including whitelist creation Cons Lack of additional filters makes sorting located duplicates more tedious than it should be Could use a scheduling feature Price When Reviewed: From $19.95 for 1 Mac, annually Though not strictly a Mac cleaner, like other apps in this round-up, MacPaw’s Gemini 2 can certainly help you get back some disc space. It is a duplicate removal tool that focuses specifically on reducing the thousands of duplicate photos in your Photos library. It also hunts down duplicate files within Apple Music and across the macOS operating system. The app is available through Apple’s App Store and MacPaw’s SetApp application, which grants access to Gemini and other apps for $9.99 (£7.60) a month. It is easy to install and offers a seven-day free trial in exchange for either your credit or debit card information. The app includes scripts for easy scanning of the Photos library and your Music library, as well as custom folders and external volumes that can be chosen from a menu or dragged, dropped, and quickly scanned. Other features include Menu Bar elements, whitelists that can be created that are exempt from being scanned, and a Duplicate Monitor feature that helps compare files and heads off duplicates before they begin to pile up. In testing, Gemini 2 quickly sought out duplicates, offered the option to remove them, and eradicated them from our hard drive. This also applies to music files and other document types, and the Duplicate Monitor warns you about possible duplicates that have been carried over to your hard drive. However, there are some caveats, such as confusion about account registration and permissions after downloading and installing Gemini 2 from the App Store. MacPaw is urging its clients towards SetApp subscriptions, which offer full access to the company’s apps for a given rate per month. While Gemini 2 runs well, a scheduling feature for folder or volume scans would not go amiss. An improved filter for located duplicate items would be more helpful. Despite some minor hurdles, Gemini 2 is well-written, sharp, helpful, fast, works well with all kinds of duplicates, and lends a good feature set to the macOS operating system without being overbearing. It hones in on its tasks and performs them well enough to earn the trust of users. You can get MacPaw Gemini 2 from the Mac App Store or from MacPaw here. Read our full Gemini 1.1 review Pros Full suite of Mac tools Fully featured free trial Cons May be more than you require Price When Reviewed: $24.99 per year Parallels Toolbox is a bunch of tools that can be used to perform various actions on your Mac – such as Download Video, Record Audio, Hide Desktop Files, Resize Image, Clipboard History, Find Duplicates, Free Memory, and even the ability to set alarms. Among all these tools is one that can be used to clean your Mac. Mac cleaning tools provided in Parallels Toolbox that could also be useful when cleaning a Mac include Clean Drive, Uninstall Apps, Find Duplicates, and Free Memory. The Clean Drive tool scans your drive and then lets you choose what to delete. You can delete applications by dragging them to the trash, but this doesn’t always completely delete them. Often files and folders can be left scattered around your system that were related to that now gone app. Parallels’s Uninstall Apps tool will remove apps and their associated files from your Mac. Similarly, you can run Find Duplicates to dig out any identical files – even ones that have different file names. Parallel’s Toolbox costs $24.99/£20.99 a year, but the free 14-day trial will actually delete files, free memory and do all those other useful things without you buying the app! You can get an overview of Toolbox’s various features, and download the seven-day trial, from the company’s website. You can get Parallels Toolbox here. Read our full Parallels Toolbox review 7. Nektony App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller Pros Simple user interface Free (with Pro upgrade) Cons Not as full-featured as alternatives Price When Reviewed: $14.95 a year for 1 Mac (usually $7.95 a month) Also from Nektony, is the simple and easy to use App Cleaner \u0026 Installer. This lightweight app is actually bundled with MacCleaner Pro (above), but this version focuses on clearing out the broken links, files, and other gubbins that get left behind when apps are uninstalled. It also, as the name suggests, allows you to uninstall apps cleanly from the get-go, and set which ones launch at start up.   There is a free version that does most of these tasks, but if you pay $9.99/£9.99 for the Pro upgrade you’ll also be able to remove system extensions, executable parts of files, and uninstall apps, plus the ads that adorn the free version disappear. Easy to recommend due to both its price and quality. You can get App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller here. 8. Onyx Pros Powerful toolset Versions for older Mac systems readily available Cons UI needs some time to learn Price When Reviewed: Free There’s a reason Onyx from Titanium Software has been among the tools of choice for Mac techies for such a long time. It offers a great set of tools and an incredible level of customization. It’s also freeware, so you don’t have to pay a penny, although the developer Titanium Software appreciates donations. Onyx also combines a unique, bare-bones approach to its user interface while offering an incredible level of customization as to what files are affected during a repair. Onyx can repair permissions, rebuild databases, reorganize file structures, check hard disk structures, and restore indexes. It can even repaire Unix-level functions that would otherwise only be accessed through Terminal. The main downside is that it’s not all that simple to use and it’s easy to make errors. Luckily there are handy FAQ links on the Titanium Software website for common issues. There are versions of Onyx for each version of the macOS. You can get Onyx here. Read our full Onyx review 9. CCleaner Pros Impressive customization tools Excellent control over storage Cons User interface is a little clunky Price When Reviewed: $29.95 a year CCleaner from Piriform (acquired by Avast, which has subsequently merged with Norton) achieves what it sets out to do: help clean up gigabytes of cache files, internet history files, and locate and purge large files on your Mac, all with an impressive level of control. It’s easy to both analyze a hard drive to determine how much space certain files might be taking up. Options include Uninstall, Startup, Erase Free Space, Large File Finder, and Duplicate File Finder. You can customize which cookies you want to save or purge and chose between Normal file deletion,” which is faster or “Secure file deletion,” which takes longer. Our only nitpick is that the user interface makes it feel very much like a Windows port. In fact, CCleaner has had a similar look and feel for the better part of 20 years. It’s freeware, but there’s an option to pay for a professional version for $29.95/£25.95 a year. In 2017 CCleaner was used to distribute malware. Hackers had inserted malicious code in the legitimate program. This has been rectified. You can get CCleaner here. Read our full CCleaner review 10. Mac Keeper Pros Convenience of having multiple tools in one product Free version lets you access most of the features Cons Paid subscription is expensive Burdened with a bad reputation Price When Reviewed: $62.01 a year for 1 Mac (usually $95.40 a year) We have to start by addressing the fact that MacKeeper doesn’t have the best reputation, although in recent years the company’s new owner – Clario – has tried very hard to rectify that. MacKeeper’s poor reputation wasn’t helped by the fact that it was difficult to uninstall an used scareware tactics to encourage people to upgrade to a paid version. Those issues should now be in the past. The software has received a good grade from AV-Test and has notarization from Apple, among other things, that should give users confidence. In terms of what it can do, MacKeeper offers 11 tools including an antivirus scanner, adware remover, a cleanup feature, a duplicate file finder, and a smart uninstaller. There’s also a memory cleaner, a software update tracker, and a startup item locator. You’ll also find a ID theft guard, a VPN, and an online ad blocker. There’s a free version, that gives you access to most of the tools, as well as a $5 a month for a year subscription. A subscription includes 24-7 tech support through which you can email, chat with, or talk to support staff. You can probably find individual products—and in some cases, more robust products—for each of the features in MacKeeper. But having all these tools under one roof makes for ease and convenience.  You can get MacKeeper here.

There’s also a memory cleaner, a software update tracker, and a startup item locator. You’ll also find a ID theft guard, a VPN, and an online ad blocker.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere’s a free version, that gives you access to most of the tools, as well as a $5 a month for a year subscription. A subscription includes 24-7 tech support through which you can email, chat with, or talk to support staff.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can probably find individual products—and in some cases, more robust products—for each of the features in MacKeeper.
