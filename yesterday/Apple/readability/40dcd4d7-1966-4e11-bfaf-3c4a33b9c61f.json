  "text": "iOS 18.3 is launching next week. It’s not particularly feature-packed, but the update will offer a significant moment for Apple Intelligence thanks to a bold Apple choice. Apple Intelligence is enabled by default in iOS 18.3 Apple has decided that iOS 18.3 is the right time to enable Apple Intelligence by default on all compatible devices. The company’s AI features first rolled out in iOS 18.1 in October, then got big upgrades in December with iOS 18.2. But before now, AI has always been opt-in. You had to explicitly turn it on. Now, Apple is making the bold decision to activate AI for all. The timing is especially significant due to another Apple Intelligence change in iOS 18.3. iOS 18.3 will temporarily disable one AI feature Tech companies stirring controversy with AI launches is nothing new, and Apple unfortunately hasn’t gone unscathed in that department. Recently, the company has come under fire for AI notification summaries that offer inaccurate news reports. Which is why, perhaps unsurprisingly, while iOS 18.3 is in one way a big show of confidence in Apple Intelligence, it also comes with a key safeguard. At the same time the masses get opted in to AI by default, Apple is turning off notification summaries for two app categories: News \u0026 Entertainment. It’s not often that an iOS update removes a feature that was previously available. But that’s exactly what will happen in iOS 18.3—at least temporarily. Apple plans to continue working to improve the accuracy of the feature, and restore it at a later date. In the meantime though, the sole feature that has so far proven a source for controversy for Apple Intelligence will be temporarily scaled back. Apple continues to approach AI with caution per stated principles This move reflects Apple’s continued caution around the area of AI. Throughout the early Apple Intelligence beta testing period, and even after iOS 18.1’s public launch, Apple put users on waitlists to ensure its AI tools were working properly. One of Apple’s ‘Responsible AI’ principles is to ‘Design with care.’ We take precautions at every stage of our process, including design, model training, feature development, and quality evaluation to identify how our AI tools may be misused or lead to potential harm. We will continuously and proactively improve our AI tools with the help of user feedback. iOS 18.3 serves as fresh evidence of this principle. Apple used an extended testing period before enabling AI by default for users. But even in making that bold move, Apple is pausing one of its AI features that isn’t yet working as intended. Will there be much pushback or controversy that comes from Apple Intelligence being turned on by default? We’ll have to wait and see. But for now, the time and the method for this move seem right. What do you think of iOS 18.3’s Apple Intelligence changes? Let us know in the comments.
