  "text": "Gamers everywhere are happy that Fortnite is back for iPhone and iPad users, but there’s no Mac client in sight (yet anyway). That doesn’t mean you can’t play Fortnite on the Mac though, because if you have an Apple Silicon Mac, and you’re comfortable running some mods and tweaks, you can get the iOS/iPadOS version of Fortnite running on MacOS with the help of two free tools, FnMacAssistant and Sideloadly. FnMacAssistant is an app that basically patches the Fortnite IPA file (for iOS and iPadOS) so that it can run in MacOS. Sideloadly is an app that basically lets you sideload apps onto a Mac, and in this case, you’d be sideloading Fortnite. Thus, by combining the two apps, and being comfortable with performing a tweak or two, you’ll have Fortnite running on the Mac. Get Sideloadly here from the developer Get the latest FnMacAssistant release here from Github Basically what you’re going to be doing is downloading both Sideloadly and FnMacAssistant, then using FnMacAssistant to download the Fortnite IPA file, and then with Sideloadly to sideload the Fornite app onto the Mac, attempting to run the game letting Fortnite.app crash, then using FnMacAssistant again to patch Fortnite for Mac so that it does not crash. FnMacAssistant will both download the Fortnite app to Mac, and patch it for you: Sideloadly is necessary to sideload Fortnite successfully, which will then crash on first launch, and then you run FnMacAssistant again to patch it: It might sound complicated but it’s really not, there are full instructions on the FnMacAssistant GitHub page. The bigger thing you will need to be comfortable with is using Sideloadly to submit your Apple ID and password to Apple through the app, and since that’s a third party app, whether or not you’re comfortable entering your Apple ID and password to a random application is up to you. If you’re not comfortable with that but you still want to play Fortnite on the Mac right now, you can simply create a new Apple ID that you don’t mind using as a throwaway for this purpose too. Hopefully in the near future a full Mac version of the Fortnite app will return again, but in the meantime if you’d like to play some Fortnite on the Mac, this little handy app combination will get the job done for you, and you’ll be playing the iPhone/iPad version on your Mac in no time at all. Happy gaming. And if this is all too much of a hassle, just enjoy Fortnite on your iPhone or iPad again for the time being!",
