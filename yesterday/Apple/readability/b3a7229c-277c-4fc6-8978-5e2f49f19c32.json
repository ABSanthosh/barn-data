  "text": "Following the expansion of Tap to Pay on iPhone to multiple more countries this morning, Apple has now officially launched Apple Pay in Puerto Rico, bringing support for cards issued by local banks. Apple Pay comes to Puerto Rico Although people in Puerto Rico could already use Apple Pay, the feature was limited to cards issued by US banks – given that Puerto Rico is a US territory. For instance, iPhone owners in Puerto Rico can even apply for an Apple Card, which is still only available in the United States. However, local banks in Puerto Rico were unable to support Apple Pay – until now. As noted by MacRumors, Banco Popular is the first bank in Puerto Rico to support Apple Pay. This means that Banco Popular cardholders can now use their eligible cards with Apple’s payment platform. With Apple Pay, iPhone and Apple Watch users can add their cards to the Wallet app to make contactless payments in stores. Apple Pay also works online across apps and websites. Apple Pay was launched in 2014 and is now available in dozens of countries around the world. It’s worth noting that Apple Pay is different from Tap to Pay, a feature that turns the iPhone into a payment terminal so that users can accept contactless payments. For more information on how to use Apple Pay, check out Apple’s website. Apple also provides a list of all the countries and regions where Apple Pay is supported by local banks.
