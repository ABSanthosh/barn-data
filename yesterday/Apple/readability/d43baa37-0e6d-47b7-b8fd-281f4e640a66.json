  "text": "Snapchat on Wednesday announced a new feature for its users – at least for some of them. Starting today, Snapchat Platinum (the platform’s premium subscription) members will have access to new AI-generated Lenses. Snapchat gets new AI Lenses For those unfamiliar, Snapchat Lenses are essentially AR filters available in the app, so that users can take photos and videos with these live AR effects. Thanks to artificial intelligence, the Lenses will now look even more realistic. Snapchat says it’s using an “in-house built generative video model” to power the new AI Video Lenses. Users will find three AI Video Lenses for now. Two of them, Raccoon and Fox, will “animate furry friends” by making them interact with the person. The other new AI filter called Spring Flowers generates a zoom-out effect as if the person is holding a bouquet of flowers. Snapchat Platinum subscribers can find the new Lenses in the carousel along with the other AR filters. Since generating videos with AI takes a while, users can continue browsing the app while the video is being processed. The company says that more AI Video Lenses will be added in the future. Coincidentally or not, Instagram announced in December that it has also been working on realistic AI-based filters, which will replace the current AR filters. However, Instagram is yet to release these AI filters to users. Snapchat is available for free on the App Store. It requires an iPhone or iPad running iOS 14 or later.
