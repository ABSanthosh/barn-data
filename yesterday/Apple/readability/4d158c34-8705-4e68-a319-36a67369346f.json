Photo: Apple TV+ The Apple TV+ dramedy Shrinking stayed among the top 10 most popular streaming series for another week, according to two ratings companies. And the sexy drama Disclaimer continues to pull in a large audience, too. Both have been among the most-watched series on streaming since they debuted. Shrinking is a hit for Apple TV+ … again Apple TV+ isn’t the largest of the streaming services — that honor goes Amazon Prime Video (with Netflix nipping at its heels). But Apple’s smaller service nevertheless manages to regularly produce hits by hiring top talent … like a beloved film star making the jump to the small screen. Shrinking season one found real success for Apple TV+, and when season two premiered on the streaming service, its audience from last year came back immediately. The comedy/drama starring Jason Segel and Harrison Ford as psychotherapists holds the No. 5 on the  Reelgood list of Top 10 TV shows the week of November 7 through 13. And it’s at the No. 6 spot on the JustWatch list of popular series for the week of November 4 through 10. A pair of Apple TV+ series did well with audiences last week: Shrinking and Disclaimer.Charts: JustWatch/Reelgood Estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. Apple’s official description of the series says: “Shrinking follows a grieving therapist (played by Segel) who starts to break the rules and tell his clients exactly what he thinks. Ignoring his training and ethics, he makes huge, tumultuous changes to people’s lives … including his own.” That could be the description for a drama, but the show generally plays with the premise for laughs. It’s a feel-good comedy with a dose of drama. The first six episodes of Shrinking season two can be enjoyed now, while the seventh is coming on Wednesday. Watch to catch up? Season one is ready to be binge-watched. Cate Blanchett’s Disclaimer stays a hit, too With so many big names involved in the Apple TV+ drama Disclaimer —Cate Blanchett, Kevin Kline, Alfonso Cuarón and more — there was enormous pressure on the series to find success. And it’s clearly delivering. Disclaimer holds the No. 6 spot on Reelgood’s popularity chart from last week. It sits at No. 9  on JustWatch’s list. If the series’ popularity piques your interest, the Apple TV+ summary says: “Acclaimed journalist Catherine Ravenscroft (Blanchett) built her reputation revealing the misdeeds and transgressions of others. When she receives a novel from an unknown author, she is horrified to realize she is now the main character in a story that exposes her darkest secrets and threatens to destroy her family. “As Catherine races to uncover the writer’s true identity, she is forced to confront her past before it destroys her life and her relationships with her husband Robert (Baron Cohen) and son Nicholas (Kodi Smit-McPhee). The ensemble cast includes Kline, Lesley Manville, Louis Partridge, Leila George and Hoyeon, and features Indira Varma as the narrator.” The seventh and final episode of Disclaimer is ready to be viewed on Apple TV+. The entire series is now ready to binge-watch. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming Disclaimer and Shrinking, plus many other series or films comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes much more, of course. There’s a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
