Photo: Cult of Mac Deals A significant chunk of the internet runs on advertising revenue, so it’s no surprise that you see a lot of ads. But let’s face it: Many sites are simply choked with banner ads, pop-ups and intrusive videos that drag down your speed and the overall experience. Well-reviewed ad blocker AdGuard can help. And it’s priced down to $9.97 for a very limited time. AdGuard: Your ticket to an ad-free internet It’s getting to the point that many of us don’t even remember what an ad-free internet page looked like. And there is no shortage of ad blockers on the market. But the proof is in the reviews for this particular tool. AdGuard earned 4.3 stars in ratings from more than 16,000 users in the App Store, largely because of how it lets internet citizens shift the balance of power. With AdGuard, you can surf the web the way you always wanted to — faster and safer. It automatically works behind the scenes to not just remove the pop-up ads that you see, but also the tracking bots that go with them. Say goodbye to video and banner ads, say hello to parental controls The same goes for video ads and banners. Plus, you can take advantage of parental controls to make sure kids stay clear of questionable content. See an ad that slipped through the cracks? You can report it with a single click. You can even get full readouts on the malware and trackers blocked by this powerful platform. AdGuard works on desktop (macOS and Windows) as well as mobile (iOS and Android). And these lifetime plans cover multiple pieces of hardware: up to three devices on the Personal plan or up to nine on the Family plan. Save on AdGuard with this limited-time deal Through December 15, you can take your pick of lifetime AdGuard plans starting at $9.97. That’s a massive 87% off the regular price of $79.99.
