Photo: Apple Apple Watch Black Friday deals are live, featuring some significant price drops on both the most- and least-affordable Apple Watches. The best deal is the entry-level Apple Watch SE 2 from just $169 (save $80). This is a great price for a great watch that boasts almost all the same features as its pricier siblings. It’s a great starter watch and perfect for kids (and you can track them with it). Meanwhile, the latest high-end Apple Watch Ultra 2 in sleek Black Titanium is also $80 off. Not to be left out, the brand-new Apple Watch Series 10 with its big beautiful screen is available at its best price to date on Amazon, starting at just $329.This post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. An Apple Watch is an awesome gift, and the entry-level SE models are surprisingly affordable starting at just $169 right now. The SE models are being discounted by Amazon only so far, and are priced at $80 off — a pretty good chunk of change. At the other end of the spectrum, the brand new Apple Watch Ultra 2 in Black Titanium is Apple’s most capable smart watch, but also the priciest. It rarely sees a discount, but right now it’s on sale for $719, which is $80 off. The natural titanium model is also on sale at Amazon for even less: It’s priced at $699, a saving of $99. Not to be left out, the brand new Series 10, which features the biggest screen yet in an Apple Watch, is also seeing discounts of up to $70. See below for more details.
