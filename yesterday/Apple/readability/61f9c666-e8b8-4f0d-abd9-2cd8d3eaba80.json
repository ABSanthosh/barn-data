  "text": "Apple is gearing up for a sweeping set announcements at WWDC, kicking off on June 9, as reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. We’ve been hearing about a significant redesign coming as part of iOS 19 for iPhone and iPad, as well as design updates for macOS 16 too. However, it turns out Apple’s ambitions are even greater. In the latest edition of his Power On newsletter, Gurman says that both watchOS and tvOS will also see significant redesigns, and visionOS will get some touch-ups as well. This means Apple’s new modern design language would touch all of Apple’s software platforms for its devices. Apple is aiming for a degree of consistency and unification across its operating systems. Users can expect more liberal use of transparency and glass-like materials, changes to navigation hierarchies inside apps, new icons, and more. You can see some of this hinted at in the WWDC artwork (pictured above), which features a glassy, reflective 3D icon of the Apple Park rainbow stage. Expect to see the same tones of translucency and glassy elements in the operating systems. While the Apple Watch software has been revamped several times, the operating system for Apple TV has stayed relatively unchanged since it was introduced in 2015. Right now, tvOS also feels pretty distinct from the visual design language employed on iOS. It sounds like that may be about to change as all the platforms looks’ are brought closer together in the biggest Apple OS visual overhaul since iOS 7. Much of the redesign is expected to be inspired by the visual style introduced with visionOS in the Apple Vision Pro last year. However, even that will see some UI ‘adjustments’ according to Gurman, as Apple looks to bring design harmony across all of its platforms. We’ll see this all officially unveiled in two weeks time. Stay tuned to 9to5Mac as we bring you full coverage from WWDC 2025. The main keynote kicks off at 10 AM Pacific Time on June 9.
