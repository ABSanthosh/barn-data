  "text": "It took a minute, but Apple has at last activated its official Threads account. And thanks to its massive Instagram presence, it instantly picked up nearly 5 million followers. Today’s move comes well after several Apple-related accounts joined Instagram’s alternative to X right out of the gate. Apple Music, Apple News, Apple Books, Shazam, and Beats by Dre were among the first to show up shortly after Threads launched in mid-2023, but the main @apple account remained absent until now. Instant 4.8 million following Despite having yet to post anything, Apple’s Threads debut already carries quite a bit of weight. The @apple account had over 4.8 million followers the moment it went live, thanks to Threads’ auto-follow feature for Instagram accounts. Given @apple’s massive Instagram presence, currently at over 34 million followers, the immediate boost isn’t surprising. What makes the move notable is obviously the broader context. Apple has long maintained a strong presence on X, to the point of facing criticism in recent years. Over there, it has nearly 10 million followers and continues to use the platform to promote events, ads, and product launches. The company has been quiet on alternative platforms like Mastodon, where only Phil Schiller, Apple Fellow and longtime marketing chief, maintains a personal presence. 9to5Mac’s take Apple’s arrival on Threads may not signal a full-on platform shift just yet, but it does show the company is at least willing to play in the broader social network field. Whether that translates into actual posts, or even full-on marketing campaigns, remains to be seen. Many companies have rushed to join new platforms, only to let them sit dormant after the initial wave of hype. Just today, The Telegraph published a story called “The Left is abandoning its online safe space“, to which social media consultant Matt Navarra noted: Still, with Meta continuing to push Threads as a more stable alternative to X and, at the same time, signals it’s finally ready to move beyond being Instagram’s sidekick, Apple’s quiet entrance is worth noting.
