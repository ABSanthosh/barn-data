  "text": "Earlier today, John Siracusa released a Mac app called Hyperspace. The app scans any folder on your Mac, identifying duplicates. When the scan is finished, you can review the results and choose whether to reclaim the unnecessary space taken up by the duplicates. Because of the way Apple’s APFS file system works on the Mac, Hyperspace’s deduplication of files doesn’t delete or move anything. How APFS does this is complicated and explained on the app’s website if you want to learn more, but to over-simplify a bit, APFS allows Hyperspace to eliminate duplicative data without changing the location of the files or their metadata. That means it’s a non-destructive operation, allowing you to reclaim drive space at no cost to your data’s integrity. The app has safety measures in place so system files aren’t affected, and users can label certain folders as ‘Source’ folders that will never be altered. You also have an opportunity to review the results of Hyperspace’s scan before the app does anything to your files. I took Hyperspace for a spin to see what it could find on my Mac Studio, which stores about 2.5 TB of data. The scan was impressively fast at around 30 seconds, identifying 4.04 GB of data that it could free up. That’s not a lot in the grand scheme of things, but it was also nice to know that I don’t generate a lot of duplicate files with my workflows. Hyperspace is free to download from the Mac App Store. The free version allows you to scan the folders on your system. However, to recover space, you need to subscribe for $9.99 per month or $19.99 per year, or purchase a lifetime license for $49.99. There are also options to purchase a single month license for $9.99 or a single year for $19.99.
