  "text": "Last year, when Apple announced iOS 18, the company revealed that some features like Apple Intelligence wouldn’t be available to users in the European Union due to regulatory concerns. Although iOS 18.4 enables Apple Intelligence in the EU, there’s still one feature that will remain unavailable there: iPhone Mirroring. iPhone Mirroring remains unavailable in the EU Apple on Monday released the RC (Release Candidate) build of iOS 18.4 to developers and beta testers. As mentioned above, the update is the first to add non-English languages to Apple Intelligence, while it also enables AI features for users located in the EU. Because of this, some users believed that the update would also enable iPhone Mirroring in the EU, but this didn’t happen. The feature remains unavailable in most European countries so far. For those unfamiliar, iPhone Mirroring is a feature that allows users to wirelessly view and control their iPhone screen from their Mac. According to a statement from Apple, the feature has been disabled for users in the EU due to “regulatory uncertainties” caused by the Digital Markets Act antitrust legislation. The company claims that the DMA’s “interoperability requirements” could force the company to “compromise the integrity of our products” in a way that puts users at risk. The company doesn’t say why Apple Intelligence will be launched in the EU, but not iPhone Mirroring. SharePlay Screen Sharing, a new way to let users share their screen on FaceTime, is also unavailable in the EU. iOS 18.4 will be officially released to the public in early April.
