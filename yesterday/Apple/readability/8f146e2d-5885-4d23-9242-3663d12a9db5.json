  "text": "Renders of what the iPhone 17 Slim could look like The iPhone 17 Slim will sport a new design and a 6.6-inch display, an analyst claims, as rumors about the slimline smartphone continue to circulate. The iPhone 17 Slim is anticipated to be a new thinner model in the range, set to arrive alongside other iPhone 17 models in late 2025. With the potential launch a year away, analysts and leakers are continuing to forecast what the new model will offer to consumers. A research note from Jeff Pu of Haitong International covers a number of areas that have been previously rumored. This includes the use of a 6.6-inch display for the new model, which will apparently take the place of the Plus model on the roster. Powering it will be an A19 chip, which Pu says will use the 3-nanometer process TSMC used to produce the A18 Pro in the iPhone 16 Pro models. It will apparently have 8GB of memory, not quite the 12GB the Pro models could get as Pu claimed in May. As for the construction of the slimline model, Pu proposes it will be made of aluminum. This should help an already thin device be much lighter than the titanium Pro models, but Apple will have to be careful to avoid any bend-related issues. The cameras will consist of a single 48-megapixel rear sensor, Pu expects, while the front will have Face ID support and a 24-megapixel camera. Pu adds that the model should have a brand-new design versus previous editions. While Pu is one of the more prolific Apple rumor circulators, accuracy isn't his strong point, as he has previously been wrong about Apple release timetables. However, his observations this time around seem to be in line with other rumors and commentary about the model.",
