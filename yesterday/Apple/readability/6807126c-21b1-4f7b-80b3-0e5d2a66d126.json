Photo: Cult of Mac Deals SpeedTutorAI is an AI homework helper app for iPhone and iPad that takes the possibilities of Siri and ChatGPT to new heights. You’ll get help with math problems, answers to your questions, and concise summaries of class lectures, all as if you were working with a real-life tutor. But you won’t pay real-world tutor fees. You can secure lifetime access to SpeedTutorAI with unlimited use for only $29.97. SpeedTutorAI, your AI-powered homework helper If you’ve seen Apple Intelligence in action, you know it’s fine for cleaning up photos, creating custom emoji and tweaking your writing. It can even transcribe lectures and such. However, students might be searching for specialized AI features — or own an older device that doesn’t even support Apple Intelligence. SpeedTutorAI works on iPhones and iPads running iOS 16/iPadOS 16 or later. And this AI homework helper offers some tools Apple Intelligence can’t currently match. Summaries of class lectures We all know the feeling of sitting through a lecture that’s an hour or longer, struggling to write down everything the professor says and comprehend even a fraction of it. Maybe you tried recording a lecture in Apple’s Voice Memos app and transcribing notes later, but that takes up so much valuable time. Just like Apple’s upgraded Notes app (if you have Apple Intelligence), the SpeedTutorAI app can record and summarize lectures or meetings, providing you with a transcript and concise summary. You may still want to take your own notes for memory retention, but you can compare them to what the AI homework helper picks up and reference the transcript when it’s time to study for the exam. Solve math and science problems This purpose-built AI homework helper also can give you a boost when it comes to math and science. SpeedTutorAI’s photo math solver feature lets you snap a photo of your homework problem and get step-by-step solutions with detailed explanations. It’s not just for math problems, either — you can try it with chemistry, physics, grammar and reading homework. AI study sessions Are you ever just a little confused about something you’re covering in class? Ideally, you’d hire a flesh-and-blood tutor, but the expense of that, plus your tuition, is a lot to handle. Instead, why not try SpeedTutorAI? You can ask this AI tutor practically anything. You can ask SpeedTutorAI to explain something complicated to you like you’re 5 years old for a simple explanation. Or you can pepper the AI helper with as many questions as you want about physics — even things you’d be nervous about asking in front of the whole class. Get 5-star AI homework helper app SpeedTutorAI for life Grab a lifetime subscription to SpeedTutorAI’s premium plan for just $29.97. That’s a 90% discount off the usual price of $299.97. The AI homework helper app works on iPhone and iPad. Customers must have a Google account to sign in with Google to redeem their promo code. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change.
