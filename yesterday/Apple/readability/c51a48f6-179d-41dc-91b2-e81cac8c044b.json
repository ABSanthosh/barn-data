  "description": "Macworld If the iMac is too small and underpowered for your needs, you’re probably in for a long wait for an iMac Pro. But you can build your own 27-inch beast with a savings of more than $400 on this bundle: Amazon is selling the M4 Pro Mac mini for $1,294 and the 27-inch Studio Display for $1,300, a total savings of $405. The M4 Pro Mac mini chip is a remarkably fast machine for such a tiny enclosure. It’s packed with 24GB of memory and 512GB of storage, which should be more than enough for all those apps and files you have to store on there. In our review, we gave this one a 4-star rating, praising its performance, multitude of ports, and of course, its tiny and quiet design. The Apple Studio Display is a drop-dead gorgeous 5K monitor that will fit in fantastically with all your Apple gear. At 27 inches, you have plenty of screen real estate to enjoy all the content you want to watch, as well as get work done. Plus it’s got a great six-speaker Spatial Audio system, a FaceTime camera with Center Stage, and three USB-C ports. We also gave this display a four-star rating in our review and loved the gorgeous design and excellent image quality. So there you have it: if Apple won’t sell an iMac Pro, you can build one yourself with an M4 Pro Mac Mini and the Apple Studio Display and save a few hundred bucks while you’re at it.
