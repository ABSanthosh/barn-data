  "text": "A new Bluetooth ID appeared in a database related to device syncing, and it may be a reference to the AirPods Pro 3 that are expected to launch in the fall. Apple is fairly careful to avoid inadvertent leaks, but it isn't immune to mistakes. A couple of small flubs occurred in 2025 already, one referencing AirPods Pro 3 directly and another stating AirPods Pro 2 or later. The latest tidbit was discovered by MacRumors in an undisclosed codebase. The codebase was updated and normally contains a list of Bluetooth IDs for accessories like AirPods and Beats headphones, but the latest update added an extra value. The identifier, 8239, doesn't belong to any existing product, so it could be for the unannounced AirPods Pro 3. AirPods Pro 2 are 0x2024 (8228), for example. All of these tiny leaks add up to seemingly confirm AirPods Pro 3 are at least imminent. Rumors point to late 2025, though a less reliable source also said 2026.",
