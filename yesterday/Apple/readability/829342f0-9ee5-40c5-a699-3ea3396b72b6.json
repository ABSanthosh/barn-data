For their Black Friday sale, its offering large discounts on a number of its smart cleaning products, making it a better time than ever to pick up a new vacuum for your household. Until December 2nd, you can score great savings on Dreame’s vacuums – and can save an additional 5% off using our exclusive promo code for our readers, DM9to55off. Robot Vacuums L10s Ultra The L10s Ultra is one of Dreame’s more affordable robot vacuums, featuring automatic mop cleaning and drying, automatic dust collection, and a robust vacuum with up to 5300 Pa of suction. It packs a lot of functionality at this lower starting price, and can even shine your floor with its built in mop – up to 2152 square feet. Plus, you only need to empty the base every 60 days, making it something you only need to think about a single digit number of times every year. Normally, the L10s Ultra is sold for $899.99, but during Dreame’s Black Friday sale, you can pick it up for just $399.99 on Amazon. Plus, you can save an additional 5% until December 2nd, using code DM9to55off. L10s Pro Ultra The L10s Pro Ultra takes things up a notch, featuring effortless edge recognition and smart mapping features to avoid obstacles in your home. It also features an even stronger vacuum, with up to 7000 Pa of suction. It’ll grab all of the small crumbs and debris from small crevices. It also automatically cleans the mop with up to 136 degrees of hot water, and can dry itself too. For Black Friday, you can pick up the L10s Pro Ultra for $549.99 on Amazon, down from its $999.99 starting price. You can also save an additional 5% using our code, DM9to55off. L20 Ultra Dreame’s L20 Ultra includes a number of quality of life features, including a larger 4.5L water tank, allowing it to operate on its own for longer. It also has a bigger battery for longer runtime, and can automatically remove the mop and clean it on its own, making it even easier for you. With their Black Friday sale, L20 Ultra is available for $599.99 on Amazon, $800 off from its original starting price. And as always, you can save an additional 5% with code DM9to55off. X40 Ultra X40 Ultra is Dreame’s highest end robot vacuum, offering the best of the best. It has 12000 Pa of suction, eliminating even the smallest bits of dust from your carpets. X40 Ultra also has an extendable side brush, allowing it to tackle wall corners and furniture legs. You also only need to recycle the bin every 75 days. Dreame thoroughly researched all of the pain points that consumers were having, and addressed all of them with this model – truly offering their best. For Black Friday, you can pick up an X40 Ultra for $999.99 on Amazon, down from the $1899.99 starting price. You can knock off an additional 5% with code DM9to55off. Wet \u0026 dry vacuums H12 Pro Dreame’s H12 Pro is a cordless vacuum, reducing one key point of hassle. It features an enhanced dual edged cleaning brush, making it easier to clean hard to reach places. H12 Pro also features a long run time, with up to 35 minutes of cleaning on one charge, and the 900mL water tank allows you up to 2150 square feet of cleaning before needing a refill. H12 Pro is available for $269.99 on Amazon during Black Friday sales, down $180 from original pricing. Plus, you can save an additional 5% with code DM9to55off.

It also features a self cleaning mode, allowing users to clean their dirty brush roller in just 5 minutes. The main highlight of the H14 is definitely its ability to lie flat at 180 degrees, allowing for cleaning in hard to reach areas. You can pick up Dreametech’s H14 for $299.99 on Amazon during Black Friday, $200 off the original starting price. Plus, save 5% with code DM9to55off for a limited time.
