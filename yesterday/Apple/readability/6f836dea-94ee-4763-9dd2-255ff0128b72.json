Next summer’s blockbuster, 28 Years Later, was shot entirely on an iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the first trailer looks fantastic. 28 Years Later trailer shows the potential for iPhone filmmaking 28 Years Later is the long-gestating sequel to the 2002 hit 28 Days Later. And per WIRED it was shot entirely on iPhone. The flick is a true Hollywood blockbuster, with a wide theatrical release planned for June 20, 2025. The film was directed by Academy Award-winning Danny Boyle, and stars actors like: Jodie Comer Aaron Taylor-Johnson Ralph Fiennes probably Cillian Murphy too And yes, Boyle used the iPhone 15 Pro Max (well, several of them) to shoot the whole thing. Not even the latest and greatest iPhone 16 Pro. How did it turn out? Judge for yourself. Here’s the trailer: 9to5Mac’s Take Shooting on iPhone seems like a good fit for a zombie thriller like this, where the desired look isn’t necessarily the most pristine. That said, the trailer is extremely impressive. This doesn’t look like an ‘iPhone movie,’ it just looks like a major Hollywood movie, period. What did you think of the 28 Years Later trailer?
