Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeIt's worth pointing out, though, that getting the game to run on Apple's adapter was no easy task, as the company's accessories feature restrictions prevent them from being used beyond their intended purpose. Audio and video output occurred on a connected Mac. Even so, this isn't the first time an enthusiast has managed to get Doom running on an unusual device, as developers often use the game to test the boundaries and capabilities of newly released hardware, some of which was never meant to run games at all. Stuff like refrigerators, keyboard keycaps, the Google Search bar, and even Microsoft Word have run the classic game. In 2016, for instance, Adam Bell managed to get the original Doom running on the MacBook Pro Touch Bar, a touch-sensitive strip with a small display that replaced the function keys on certain Apple laptops. Quake, another id Software game from 1996, was similarly ported to the Apple Watch in 2022. Doom is an iconic first-person shooter game launched in 1993. The game is archaic by today's standards, so it doesn't need a lot of power to run. Enthusiasts and developers have thus managed to get the game running on numerous different devices with ingenuity and creativity over the years.",
