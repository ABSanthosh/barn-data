The new-and-improved Beats Pill replaced the Beats Pill+, which Apple phased out in January 2022. Unlike many other Apple products, Beats audio accessories do not have a manual update method, with new firmware updates being installed automatically instead. The update is installed quietly in the background, and users aren't notified. Users can check the version number of their in-use accessory on an iPhone or iPad by going to Settings, then Bluetooth, then tapping the Info button next to the Beats device. Under macOS Ventura and later, users can open System Settings, then select Bluetooth, then click the Info button next to the accessory. Android users can update the firmware using the Beats companion app as long as their Android device is plugged into a power outlet.",
