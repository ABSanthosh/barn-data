  "text": "In the Apple Silicon era, MacBooks have become more affordable than ever – with brand new models starting as low as $649. With looming tariffs, these great deals could potentially be coming to an end very soon – so if you’re in the market for a new MacBook for any reason, now may be one of the best ever times to purchase. M1 MacBook Air Apple has launched 4 MacBook Airs since entering the Apple Silicon era, with the M1, M2, M3, and M4 chips. The M1 MacBook Air still utilizes a more familiar wedge design from the Intel era, although a lot of users might prefer that. The M1 MacBook Air, despite being four years old, remains an excellent laptop for its price. It boasts blazing fast performance thanks to the M1 chip, a stunning retina display (though with thicker bezels compared to the newer MacBook Airs), a great keyboard, up to 18 hours of battery life, and it doesn’t sound like an airplane that’s about to take off when you open it in public. Since the M1 MacBook Air is the oldest on this list, it’s also the cheapest. One caveat with the M1 MacBook Air is that it’s harder to find new ones with more than 256GB of storage, so if you need a lot of storage, you’ll have to buy a newer Air. On the bright side, it does remain to be the only Apple Silicon MacBook to come in a proper Gold color. You can buy the M1 MacBook Air for as low as $649 at Walmart in all 3 colors: Silver, Space Gray, and Gold. 13-inch MacBook Air (M1) with 256GB of storage, 8GB of memory: $649 at Walmart M3 MacBook Air In 2022, Apple introduced the redesigned MacBook Air with a thinner design, a bigger display with slimmer bezels, and reintroduced MagSafe. It also came in new Starlight and Midnight colors in addition to Silver and Space Gray, although Gold was no longer. This fresh new design was introduced with the M2 chip, and it’s lived on since. Unfortunately, M2 chip models have effectively been cleared out at every major retailer, so the deals will start with M3 chip models. Apple introduced an M4 chip model earlier this year, but as long as cutting-edge performance isn’t your priority, this model will suit you perfectly fine. Right now, you can secure up to $300 off, and there are configurations available with 512GB of storage. There are also deals available on the 15-inch version of the M3 MacBook Air. 13-inch models with M3 chip: 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $899 at Amazon ($200 off!) 13-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $999 at Amazon ($300 off!) 13-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 24GB of memory: $1199 at Amazon ($300 off!) 15-inch models with M3 chip (limited availability): 15-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 24GB of memory: $1399 at Amazon ($300 off!) Some deals require clipping an on-page coupon. Nonetheless, some of the best deals come in on higher trims, allowing you to get higher-end specs at a much more affordable price. M4 MacBook Air Last month, Apple announced a refreshed MacBook Air with M4 chip. This computer is mostly similar to the previous model, except it now features a new Center Stage webcam and a new Sky Blue color that replaces Space Gray. This computer also came in with a lower starting price, allowing for there to be some deal-like prices despite the computer being the latest and greatest. 13-inch models with M4 chip: 13-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $949 at Amazon 13-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $1069 at Amazon 13-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 24GB of memory: $1381 at Amazon 15-inch models with M4 chip: 15-inch MacBook Air with 256GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $1139 at Amazon 15-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $1364 at Amazon 15-inch MacBook Air with 512GB of storage, 24GB of memory: $1549 at Amazon While these prices are all under $100 off of the typical retail price, it’s still worth highlighting. With tariffs, price hikes on new Apple products could happen in the near future. 14-inch MacBook Pro Apple redesigned the MacBook Pro in 2021 with a brand new 14-inch miniLED display with ProMotion, more ports (most notably an HDMI port and SD card reader), as well as bigger batteries and better thermals. It also gained a 1080p webcam for the first time. Although the 14-inch MacBook Pro isn’t as affordable as the other MacBooks listed, if you want that amazing display and the extra ports, there are still some good deals to find. All of the models listed below are M4 and M4 Pro chip models, providing the latest and greatest performance and features. M4 chip models: M4 MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage, 16GB of memory: $1429 at Amazon ($170 off!) M4 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage, 16GB of memory: $1619 on Amazon ($180 off!) M4 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage, 24GB of memory: $1799 on Amazon ($200 off!) M4 Pro MacBook Pro with 512GB of storage, 24GB of memory: $1789 on Amazon ($210 off!)
