Cult of Mac‘s review of AirPods Pro 2 “a must-have for Apple users and a solid choice for anyone.” USB-C case, H2 chip and all the latest Apple tech As with the iPhone 15 lineup, Apple switched to a USB-C port on the AirPods Pro charging case last year.

The case also comes with one of Apple’s U1 chips inside. That, along with a tiny built-in speaker, makes the case easier to find. Plus, thanks to Apple’s H2 chip, AirPods Pro can automatically connect with other Apple devices logged into your iCloud account. Then you can seamlessly switch between them at will.
