  "text": "News iOS 18.4.1 squashes bugs, including one related to CarPlay. Screenshot: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac Wednesday brought system software patches to an array of Apple devices, all intended to fix bugs. This includes the release of iOS 18.4.1 to remove a bug that prevented some iPhone users from accessing CarPlay over a wireless connection. There are two important security fixes, too. Plus, Apple also made macOS 15.4.1, iPadOS 18.4.1, tvOS 18.4.1 and visionOS 2.4.1 available at the same time. But no equivalent watchOS update appeared. iOS 18.4.1, macOS 15.4.1 and more released Apple never stops developing its various operating systems and frequently releases large and small software updates for them. The big updates come with new features. The small ones are really just patches to fix small problems. Apple’s description for iOS 18.4.1 makes it clear that this comes with minor tweaks: “This update provides important bug fixes, security updates, and addresses a rare issue that prevents wireless CarPlay connection in certain vehicles.” And the iPadOS 18.4.1 note includes even less, staying simply, “This update provides important bug fixes and security updates and is recommended for all users.” The two security updates are critical, as these both come with the warning, “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on iOS.” Security weaknesses actively being used by hackers need to be closed ASAP, and these patches do that. How to patch your Apple devices iPhone and iPad users can install iOS 18.4.1 and iPadOS 18.4.1 directly by opening the Settings app and going to General \u003e Software Update. Alternatively, update your devices by connecting them to a Mac (or to a PC running iTunes). To download the macOS Sequoia update, go to Apple menu  \u003e About This Mac. Then click Software Update. Alternatively, install the new version from the App Store. (Note: At the time of this writing, Apple had not yet updated the version of macOS in the App Store. But it should happen soon.) And Vision Pro users might need the Cult of Mac guide on how to update visionOS.",
