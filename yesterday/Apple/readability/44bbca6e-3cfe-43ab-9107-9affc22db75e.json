  "text": "NewsTop Stories The iOS 18.1 release candidate means Apple Intelligence for iPhone is about a week away. Image: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac Apple gave developers access to the release candidates of iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15.1 on Monday. This is the last round of testing before introducing them to the public, which means Apple Intelligence will finally launch in about a week. Release candidates for tvOS 18.1 and visionOS 2.1 also went out. However, watchOS 11.1 RC is not yet available. iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1 and Apple Intelligence are almost here Release candidates are what Apple used to call golden masters, and give third-party software developers and other beta testers an opportunity to look over the final version of operating systems before they’re introduced to average users. An advantage of RCs is that they give us a sneak peek at the release notes revealing what features Apple thinks are most important. The one for iOS 18.1 says: “This update introduces the first set of features powered by Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that unlocks powerful new ways to communicate, work, and express yourself, all while protecting your data with an extraordinary step forward for privacy in Al. “This release also includes enhancements to Camera Control, the ability to capture spatial photos, record phone calls, and other features, bug fixes, and security updates for your iPhone.” As noted, the most important change in iOS 18.1 is the launch of the suite of AI-powered features dubbed Apple Intelligence. These are also coming to Mac and iPad through the macOS Sequoia 15.1 and iPadOS 18.1 updates, respectively. While these release candidates are currently exclusively for developers, public beta testers should get access to them in the very near future. Final versions coming next week The wait for the full versions won’t be long. Apple told multiple news sources that iOS 18.1 will be available next week. It gave some reviewers early access to a software update that allows AirPods Pro 2 to become hearing aids, and told them the feature would be out in a week or so. For example, the Wall Street Journal wrote: “Apple will release the features next week through a free software update. They require the $249 second-generation AirPods Pro and an iPhone or iPad running iOS or iPad OS 18.1.” And the exact date may be known, as well. Apple makes a habit of introducing the final versions of its operating systems a week after the release candidates go to developers. If that holds true again, then iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1, watchOS 11.1, tvOS 18.1 and visionOS 2.1 will all be out on Monday, October 28. That’s the date Apple Intelligence is rumored to launch, so it’s seems a virtual certainty. Bring on Apple Intelligence iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, macOS Sequoia 15.1 usher in Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-powered tools intended to make the computers more useful in everyday life. They can fix users’ grammar and repair images, as well as generate pictures based on user instructions. The capabilities will grow over time.
