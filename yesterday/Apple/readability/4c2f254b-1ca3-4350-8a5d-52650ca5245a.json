  "description": "Macworld Since last year, Android users with Windows 11 computers have been able to preview a new feature that lets them see their phone directly next to the Start menu, where they can easily access texts, calls, and send files. You could sort of do these things with iPhones as well, but not from the Start menu. Rather, you have to open the Phone Link app on your Windows PC to make it happen. Coming later this year (and available in preview build 4805 for those in the Microsoft Insider program) will be the ability to see your iPhone right next to the Start menu, just like Android phones. You can access your texts and calls, see battery percentage, and directly send files to your iPhone. Just as there is today when using the Phone Link app, there are some caveats. To connect to an Android phone you need only be on the same Wi-Fi network (and have the Connect to Windows app installed on it), but iPhones need a Windows 11 PC with Bluetooth LE. For Android phones, Phone Link lets you see and access the last 2,000 images on your camera roll, and messages can include images. You also get to see mirrors of your phone notifications and can make phone calls from your PC. However, when using an iPhone, Phone Link does not support images at all (in messages or otherwise) or group texts. You can see notification popups (but not really act on them) and make calls. In other words, Phone Link essentially lets your Bluetooth LE-equipped Windows 11 PC do the same stuff your car’s Bluetooth connection can (if you don’t have CarPlay). None of this is changing with the new build. What is new is the ability to see a little iPhone window right next to the start menu that shows battery life, the latest activity, messages, and quick access to sharing files. it’s not quite iPhone Mirroring, but if you don’t have a Mac, it’s the next best thing. For more information, check out the Windows Insider blog post announcing the feature.",
