  "text": "Ultra longtime Mac users may recall a fun Classic Mac OS application that placed a set of googly eyes into the Mac menu bar, and those eyes would follow your cursor around as you used the Mac. While the old Classic Mac OS days are long gone (sigh), you can still have a bit of fun and whimsy on your modern Mac with the aptly named Googly Eyes app. Googly Eyes lives in your Mac menu bar as a set of eyeballs whose pupils will follow your Mac cursor around as you use your computer, just like the old version of yesteryear. The little eyes even blink when you click the mouse/trackpad cursor. Is this going to revolutionize your computing experience? Probably not. But is it fun? Absolutely! And sometimes just being fun is good enough, right? So live a little, throw a set of googly eyes into your Mac menu bar, and enjoy having a little virtual set of eyeballs follow your cursor around on screen, kind of like a cats eyes watching a laser pointer. You can grab the free Googly Eyes app directly from the developer (scroll to the very bottom of the dev homepage) or from the Mac App Store, the app is the same regardless of which approach you take to download it though the App Store version makes it easier to receive updates. Grab Googly Eyes free from the Mac App Store Get Googly Eyes directly from the developer website You will need MacOS Sequoia 15 or newer to use Googly Eyes, so if you’re not on a modern version of MacOS you’ll have to live without them. Is that possible? Who knows, but maybe these fun Googly Eyes are reason enough to upgrade your MacOS system and install Sequoia, which overall is a pretty good operating system and in my humble opinion is better than Ventura, anyway. If you bother to read the App Store reviews you’ll see a comment or two about CPU usage, but in my experience with running Googly Eyes all day it mostly hovered around 0.6% CPU and maxed out around 5%, so it’s hardly putting a dent in anything, but if you’re trying to minimize render times or compile times, maybe you’ll want to hold out on Googly Eyes for that moment. Cheers to LowEndMac for the find, which, by the way, is a great site resource for Mac users with older Mac hardware who want to keep it in action as long as possible.",
