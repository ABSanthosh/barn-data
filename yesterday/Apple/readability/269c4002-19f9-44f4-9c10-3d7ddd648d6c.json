And if you’ve bought new AirPods 4, read on as we’ve put together a list of some of the best protective cases and lanyards for Apple’s wireless earbuds – now with Black Friday deals. Our friends over at 9to5Toys have all the latest details on the best Black Friday deals. Cases for AirPods 4 AirPods come in a charging case that also protects the earbuds when they’re not in use. However, some users may want to add extra protection with an external case, or simply want a decorative case. ESR, a popular accessory maker for Apple devices, has different cases for AirPods 4. One of them, Cloud, has a soft finish and a cleaner look, while the other (Orbit) is made of hard plastic and has a more detailed finish. ESR also has the Cyber series with a more rugged design for full protection. They’re available in a variety of colors. ESR Cloud Case for AirPods 4: $7.99 ESR Orbit Case for AirPods 4: $11.99 ($9.59 on Black Friday) ESR Cyber Case for AirPods 4: $13.99 ($11.19 on Black Friday) Another popular case for AirPods 4 is the silicone case made by ORNARTO, which covers the entire charging case with double-layer protection. The case is available in 17 beautiful colors and also comes with a lanyard. ORNARTO Case for AirPods 4: $9.99 If you’re looking for more fun-looking cases, DamonLight has an amazing game controller case for AirPods 4 that’s also shockproof and comes with a keychain.
