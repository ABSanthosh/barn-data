Apple Vision Pro is Apple's first spatial computing platform and an expensive one at that. Adoption of the platform has been glacial, and with it, the rollout of software and media that is native to the 3D mixed reality platform. It seemed obvious as we approached WWDC 2025 that Apple would update at least some, if not all, of its compatible apps to native ones. In case you weren't aware, a compatible app is one that runs on Apple Vision Pro in its unmodified 2D iPad or iPhone form. Apple bragged about how easy it would be for developers to use its systems to make apps become native. Toolbars, menus, and buttons would pop free from their 2D prison and float around the content. Too bad Apple seems unable to follow its own advice. Apple announced Apple Vision Pro during WWDC 2023 and WWDC 2025 just concluded, and the compatible app list hasn't budged. Here is the list of apps Apple makes that isn't currently native on the platform: Books Calendar Clock Home Maps News Numbers Pages Podcasts Reminders Shortcuts Stocks Voice Memos Funny enough, the number of compatible apps has actually increased since Apple Vision Pro launched in February 2024. The acquisition of Pixelmator means those apps are now part of Apple's compatible apps list. Apple's Vision Pro problemOpinions vary widely on the staff, but I'm a big fan of Apple Vision Pro. I spend significant time every week working or entertaining myself in the 3D space. For me, it's quite the compelling platform with an infinite canvas where you can just open windows, and now spatial widgets, and place them everywhere. Apple Vision Pro needs apps, and Apple should provide the templateThe new visionOS 26 is an excellent update that enhances how to utilize the platform. There are more collaborative options, permanently placed objects that survive restarts, and new gaming opportunities thanks to PSVR2 controller support. However, it seems neglectful to go into the third year of this platform existing in the public (June 2023 reveal, February 2024 launch), without touching this list of apps. Even if it were one or two, that would at least feel like progress was being made, but zero sends a wild message. What does it tell developers if the richest company in the world with near-unlimited resources can't spare time for the new platform? There has been some slight movement in the space for these apps, but only tangentially. Apple includes spatial widgets for Calendar, Clock, News, Podcasts, Reminders, and Stocks. There's even a Weather widget in spite of the app not even existing on the platform. Apple should set the example and make the best of native appsPerhaps Apple's introduction of these widgets is seen as their contribution to making native apps. They are a good in-between, I'll give them that, but it still seems odd. Apple should be showing developers how they'd approach a spatial podcast or weather app. They've normally used their own APIs as a chance to showcase what's possible and encourage developers to follow a standard. I'll be fair and say this is beta 1 of visionOS 26. Any number of things could change before the official release in the fall. And there's always the chance some new native apps could be introduced throughout the year. Let's just hope Apple makes some move in this space. If we get to WWDC 2026 and nothing has changed, I'm going to start doubting Apple's commitment to its platform.",
