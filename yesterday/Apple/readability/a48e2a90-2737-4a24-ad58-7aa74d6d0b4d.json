  "text": "Deals Make music in moments with this AI music generator. Photo: Cult of Mac Deals The Supermusic AI app gives you two ways to make music. If you have a basic idea for a song, you can describe it to the AI music generator. Then just answer a few questions about the type of track you want to create, and Supermusic will craft an original song for you. If you already have complete lyrics, even better. You can feed them into Supermusic AI to create a song around them. Keep in mind that this isn’t just a little tune. Supermusic AI generates lifelike vocals singing the lyrics you give it. Whichever way you create your songs, it only takes a moment before you can listen and share. And you can get a lifetime to Supermusic’s AI music-generating magic for just $39.97. Go from AI prompt to song in moments In the olden days, writing songs and producing music took hours, days, weeks, months — at a minimum. Steely Dan’s classic album Aja took more than a year’s worth of effort, but then it’s a classic from the days when record labels splashed out big bucks on impressive recording studios. These days, all you really need is a song idea, an iPhone and an AI music generator like Supermusic. Will your AI-assisted music make Apple’s Best 100 Albums list? While that’s unlikely, your AI track could top the charts once you share it to Supermusic’s dedicated leaderboard for AI musicians. The service’s leaderboards track the most played, liked and shared songs. And your AI collab might just climb the ranks. You don’t have to share your AI-generated music to the leaderboards, but you can post your songs directly to social media or send it straight to your friends. It’s a quick and easy way to make demos you can share with bandmates or potential collaborators. This AI music generator currently supports pop, country, EDM, rock and rap. And Supermusic might add new genres in the near future. Luckily, updates to the AI music generator app are included in this lifetime subscription. (Supermusic works with iOS 13 and above.)

Note: The Pro plan lets you create up to 100 songs per month. The Premium plan, available for $99.99, lets you generate 1,000 songs per month.
