Photo: Apple TV+ The crime drama Your Friends and Neighbors held onto its audience for a third week, appearing yet again on lists of the top 10 most popular series, according to a pair of companies that track ratings. The Apple TV+ show stars Jon Hamm as a very unusual thief. Plus, the Apple TV+ comedy The Studio also continues to pull a big audience. Jon Hamm and Your Friends and Neighbors starts with strong ratings Jon Hamm is an American actor best known for his iconic role as Don Draper in the critically acclaimed television series Mad Men. With his striking looks, commanding presence, and smooth charisma, Hamm brought complexity and depth to the suave but troubled advertising executive, earning him widespread praise and several awards, including a Primetime Emmy. Beyond Mad Men, Hamm showcased his talent in The Morning Show season 3 on Apple TV+. Hamm’s versatility, dry wit, and classic Hollywood charm have made him a standout presence in modern entertainment, and surely contributes to the success of his new series, Your Friends and Neighbors. The premise likely helps, too. In the show, Hamm plays Andrew “Coop” Cooper, who gets fired in disgrace from his high-paying job as a hedge fund manager and must resort to stealing from his affluent neighbors’ homes. There, Coop discovers that the secrets and affairs hidden behind those wealthy facades might be more dangerous than he ever imagined. Whether the success is caused by star power or good writing, the show got off to a strong start and has stayed consistently popular ever since. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series in the U.S. on streaming services, and Your Friends and Neighbors sits at No. 3 for the week of April 21 through April 27 (see chart). Rival service Reelgood put the show in the No. 4 slot on its list for top-rated series for the week of April 24 through April 30. A ratings service says Your Friends and Neighbors is still one of the most popular streaming series. And The Studio draws plenty of eyes, too.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. The first five episodes of Your Friends and Neighbors are ready to stream now. The next appears on Friday. The Studio gets high ratings skewering Hollywood While many of the highest-rated series on Apple TV+ are dramas and sci-fi, the streaming service offers plenty of comedies, too. One of Apple’s latest forays into the genre is The Studio, starring Seth Rogen, who also serves as co-creator, writer and director. This is the fifth week in a row that JustWatch placed the show on its top 10 list compiled from streaming ratings. The company put the series at No. 5 on its most recent chart (see above). The official Apple TV+ description says: “In The Studio, Seth Rogen stars as Matt Remick, the newly appointed head of embattled Continental Studios. As movies struggle to stay alive and relevant, Matt and his core team of infighting executives battle their own insecurities as they wrangle narcissistic artists and craven corporate overlords in the ever-elusive pursuit of making great films. With their power suits masking their never-ending sense of panic, every party, set visit, casting decision, marketing meeting and award show presents them with an opportunity for glittering success or career-ending catastrophe. As someone who eats, sleeps and breathes movies, it’s the job Matt’s been pursuing his whole life, and it may very well destroy him.” The Cult of Mac review says, “The Studio blends sharp industry critique with genuine appreciation for filmmaking. Through its clever storytelling, stellar performances, and exceptional production, the series offers viewers a rare glimpse into Hollywood — the good and the bad.” The first seven episodes of the series are ready to watch now. The next premieres on Wednesday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Your Friends and Neighbors and The Studio, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
