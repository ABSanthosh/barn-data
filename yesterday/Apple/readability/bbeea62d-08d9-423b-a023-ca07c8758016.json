Most of the laptop sleeves, such as the Leather MacBook Sleeve are completely plastic-free. Eugen Wegmann Even though it is made of high-quality leather and wool felt, the Leather MacBook Sleeve is quite simple overall. The back half consists of a thin piece of leather, the front of a thicker piece of felt, onto which another piece of thin leather is sewn, which acts as two small pockets. And that’s it. The sleeve comes in four color options: light grey (Classic) or dark grey felt (Black Edition) combined with black or brown leather. It is also available in different sizes for all possible MacBooks since the MacBook Air from 2010. Stability: zero. The Leather Macbook Sleeve can simply be rolled up, but at least it springs back into shape.Eugen Wegmann The sleeve has practically no structure of its own–you can easily roll it up if you want without breaking it. If you have the correct size, the sleeve fits very snugly around the laptop. No fastener on the sleeve, one edge is always open. Eugen Wegmann If you choose the wrong size (for example, the 16-inch version for a MacBook Air) then the sleeve will not only be baggy, but your MacBook may simply fall out, similar to buying trousers that are two sizes too big. Conversely, you should of course not choose the MacBook Air version for your 16-inch MacBook Pro. It simply won’t fit. The Leather MacBook Sleeve does not have a fastener either. As one long side is permanently open, there is of course practically no (splash) water protection. The two small pockets on the front are practical for storing cables, notes, and other small items, and even one of the smaller MacBook power adapters fits in quite well. Then it gets pretty cramped. The large 96-watt power supply unit from Apple, which is included with the more powerful MacBook Pro, just about fits, but the plug either hangs out of the bag or presses against the inside of the leather –not ideal in either case. Smaller, but thicker power supply units stretch the pocket quite a bit and wear out the leather in the long run. The two pockets cannot be closed either. Should you buy the Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve? The Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve is a high-quality, beautifully finished accessory that offers some protection for your MacBook from scratches and dents. You can carry your MacBook in style from meeting room to meeting room. But if you’re traveling you need something more robust and you’re probably better off with a different sleeve or bag.",

Eugen Wegmann has been writing for German sister site Macwelt since 2022 (previously for TechRadar). He wasn't always an Apple fan and looks at its products and antics with a healthy dose of skepticism, but also curiosity and optimism. In his private life, he still relies on Windows (because Apple is taking its time expanding the gaming platform). He has also been a fan of wireless in-ear headphones from the very beginning, and has tested dozens of models over the years.",

Conversely, you should of course not choose the MacBook Air version for your 16-inch MacBook Pro. It simply won’t fit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Leather MacBook Sleeve does not have a fastener either. As one long side is permanently open, there is of course practically no (splash) water protection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cdiv data-effect=\"slide\"\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"harber london macbook sleeve 2\" data-id=\"2506589\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_2.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" alt=\"harber london macbook sleeve 1\" data-id=\"2506592\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/harber_london_macbook_sleeve_1.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe two small pockets on the front are practical for storing cables, notes, and other small items, and even one of the smaller MacBook power adapters fits in quite well. Then it gets pretty cramped. The large 96-watt power supply unit from Apple, which is included with the more powerful MacBook Pro, just about fits, but the plug either hangs out of the bag or presses against the inside of the leather –not ideal in either case. Smaller, but thicker power supply units stretch the pocket quite a bit and wear out the leather in the long run. The two pockets cannot be closed either.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"should-you-buy-the-harber-london-leather-macbook-sleeve\"\u003eShould you buy the Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Harber London Leather MacBook Sleeve is a high-quality, beautifully finished accessory that offers some protection for your MacBook from scratches and dents. You can carry your MacBook in style from meeting room to meeting room. But if you’re traveling you need something more robust and you’re probably better off with a different sleeve or bag.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"link_wrapped_content\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003ch3\u003e\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve\t\t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv id=\"New\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/themes/idg-base-theme/dist/static/img/amazon-logo.svg\" alt=\"Amazon\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$84.13\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis article originally appeared on our sister publication \u003ca href=\"https://www.macwelt.de\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMacwelt\u003c/a\u003e and was translated and localized from German.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-ga=\"article-footer-author\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.macworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/author_photo_Eugen-Wegmann_1663241688-15.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=150\u0026amp;h=150\u0026amp;crop=1\" height=\"125\" width=\"125\"/\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eEugen Wegmann has been writing for German sister site Macwelt since 2022 (previously for TechRadar). He wasn\u0026#39;t always an Apple fan and looks at its products and antics with a healthy dose of skepticism, but also curiosity and optimism. In his private life, he still relies on Windows (because Apple is taking its time expanding the gaming platform). He has also been a fan of wireless in-ear headphones from the very beginning, and has tested dozens of models over the years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
