  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Sequel is an all in one app that makes it easy to keep track of all of the movies, TV shows, books, games, and more that you’d like to follow. It packs an intuitive interface and a number of delightful features to make it the ultimate media manager for your iPhone or iPad. Top features For one, Sequel offers an all-encompassing home interface, making it easy to find all of your movies, audiobooks, shows, games, and more. It still keeps everything organized, and offers unique interface elements tailored to each medium. Sequel also packs a special ‘Magic Lookup’ feature, which allows you to share lengthy articles and other web content regarding shows/movies/etc to Sequel, and the app will analyze it and save it for you.’ In the new 2.5 update, Sequel also offers the ability to open media in trusted sources, allowing you to swiftly learn more about something you have saved, or even purchase it. It also has all new layout options, making the interface more flexible than ever. You can even use Sequel to get notified about upcoming releases. Download Sequel Sequel is available for free on the App Store on devices running iOS 17 and later. It also has a native app on Apple Vision Pro. For the full experience, you can check out Sequel+ for $2.99/month or $19.99/year. You can track unlimited items and create up to five collections for free, but you’ll need Sequel+ for nicer features like Magic Lookup.
