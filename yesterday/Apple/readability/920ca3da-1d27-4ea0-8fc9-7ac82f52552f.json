  "text": "Apple has released updated MacBook Air and Mac Studio models with spec bumps, and a new color option for the MacBook Air. The MacBook Air gains the M4 chip and is now available in a new light blue color option that Apple calls ‘sky blue’. Meanwhile, the Mac Studio gains the M4 Max and M3 Ultra chip options. These updated Macs come a day after Apple spec-bumped the iPad Air to an M3 chip as well. M4 MacBook Air The MacBook Air is now available with an M4 chip with support for up to 32GB RAM, in either 13″ or 15″ display sizes. M4 MacBook Air also finally supports dual external displays, in addition to having the built-in internal display, a feature that many Mac users have wanted since the debut of the redesigned MacBook Air. Additionally, the new M4 MacBook Air features an improved 12 MP camera with Center Stage support, as well as support for Desk View. While the overall design is the same, the latest MacBook Air is now available in a fourth color option that Apple calls “sky blue”, and the prior colors of Midnight Blue, Silver, and Starlight, are still available as well. Space Gray is no longer available, however. You can check out the M4 MacBook Air press release if you’re interested in learning more from Apple. Pre-orders start today at $999, and the M4 MacBook Air will be released on March 12. Mac Studio with M4 Max \u0026 M3 Ultra Chips The updated Mac Studio is now available with M4 Max or M3 Ultra chip options, and the desktop Mac also boasts Thunderbolt 5 ports, a maximum of 16GB SSD storage, and up to 512GB of RAM. If you’re interested in learning more you can check out the new Mac Studio press release. You can pre-order the Mac Studio today with pricing beginning at $1,999, and it will be available on March 12.",
