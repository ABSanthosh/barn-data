The tech giant countersued Masimo for patent infringement in 2022, alleging Masimo copied Apple Watch features to use in its smartwatches.Apple also accused Masimo of using lawsuits at the ITC and in California to \"make way for Masimo's own watch.\"Masimo said Apple's patent lawsuit was \"retaliatory\" and \"an attempt to avoid the court in which the parties have been litigating their dispute.\" Sign up here.Reporting by Blake Brittain in Washington; Editing by Leslie Adler, Rosalba O'Brien and Lincoln Feast.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles., opens new tabBlake Brittain reports on intellectual property law, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, for Reuters Legal.
