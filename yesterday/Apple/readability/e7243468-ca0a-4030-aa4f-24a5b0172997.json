CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced iPhone 16e, a new addition to the iPhone 16 lineup that offers powerful capabilities at a more affordable price. iPhone 16e delivers fast, smooth performance and breakthrough battery life, thanks to the industry-leading efficiency of the A18 chip and the new Apple C1, the first cellular modem designed by Apple. iPhone 16e is also built for Apple Intelligence, the intuitive personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. The 48MP Fusion camera takes gorgeous photos and videos, and with an integrated 2x Telephoto, it is like having two cameras in one, so users can zoom in with optical quality. When outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage, Apple’s groundbreaking satellite features — including Emergency SOS, Roadside Assistance, Messages, and Find My via satellite — help iPhone 16e users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most.1 iPhone 16e will be available in two elegant matte finishes — black and white — with colorful cases available to accessorize. Pre-orders begin Friday, February 21, with availability beginning Friday, February 28. “iPhone 16e packs in the features our users love about the iPhone 16 lineup, including breakthrough battery life, fast performance powered by the latest-generation A18 chip, an innovative 2-in-1 camera system, and Apple Intelligence,” said Kaiann Drance, Apple’s vice president of Worldwide iPhone Product Marketing. “We’re so excited for iPhone 16e to complete the lineup as a powerful, more affordable option to bring the iPhone experience to even more people.” Available in a popular 6.1-inch display size, iPhone 16e features breakthrough battery life, fast performance, a 48MP 2-in-1 camera system, and a beautiful, durable design. A Beautiful and Durable Design with Breakthrough Battery Life iPhone 16e is built to last, featuring splash, water, and dust resistance with a rating of IP68; the Ceramic Shield front cover with an advanced formulation that is tougher than any smartphone glass; and the toughest back glass in a smartphone.2 The 6.1-inch Super Retina XDR display with OLED technology has an edge-to-edge design that is perfect for watching HDR videos, playing games, and reading crisp text.3 iPhone 16e has the best battery life ever on a 6.1-inch iPhone, lasting up to six hours longer than iPhone 11 and up to 12 hours longer than all generations of iPhone SE.4 And with Face ID enabled by the TrueDepth camera system, users can securely unlock their iPhone, authenticate purchases, sign in to apps, and more. iPhone 16e also offers convenient charging options, including both wireless charging and USB-C for easy connection to a wide range of accessories.

A close-up of the USB-C port on iPhone 16e. iPhone 16e is available in elegant matte white and black finishes with a splash-, water-, and dust-resistant design. iPhone 16e features the toughest back glass in a smartphone, and the brilliant 6.1-inch display is protected by the Ceramic Shield, which is tougher than any smartphone glass. iPhone 16e features USB-C, so the same cable can charge iPhone, Mac, iPad, AirPods, and other devices. Performance and Connectivity iPhone 16e is powered by Apple’s latest-generation A18 chip, which enables fast, smooth performance, incredible power efficiency, and Apple Intelligence. The 6-core CPU is up to 80 percent faster than the A13 Bionic chip on iPhone 11, handling both everyday and intensive tasks with ease — from simple workloads, to more demanding actions with Apple Intelligence. The 4-core GPU powers stunning graphics performance and unlocks next-level mobile gaming on the go, enabling graphically demanding AAA titles and hardware-accelerated ray tracing for more realistic lighting and reflections. The 16-core Neural Engine is optimized for large generative models and runs machine learning (ML) models up to 6x faster than A13 Bionic. The A18 chip enables fast, smooth performance and stunning graphics for next-level mobile gaming in titles like Infinity Nikki. Expanding the benefits of Apple silicon, C1 is the first modem designed by Apple and the most power-efficient modem ever on an iPhone, delivering fast and reliable 5G cellular connectivity. Apple silicon — including C1 — the all-new internal design, and the advanced power management of iOS 18 all contribute to extraordinary battery life. Built for Apple Intelligence iPhone 16e is built for Apple Intelligence, unlocking exciting new capabilities that make iPhone even more helpful and powerful. With the Clean Up tool, it’s easy to remove distracting elements in images, and natural language search in the Photos app allows users to search for just about any photo or video by simply describing what they are looking for. Clean Up in Photos, powered by Apple Intelligence, allows users to remove distractions from an image. Users can also explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, create the perfect emoji with Genmoji, and make their writing even more dynamic with Writing Tools. They can now type to Siri, and Siri is more conversational with the ability to follow along if users stumble over their words. Siri can also maintain context from one request to the next. With extensive product knowledge, Siri can answer thousands of questions about the features and settings of Apple products, so users can learn how to do things like take a screen recording or schedule a text message to send later.

Image Playground allows users to easily create fun and unique images, with concepts like themes, costumes, accessories, and places. Users can create their own unique Genmoji, making conversations with family and friends more fun and playful. With access to ChatGPT seamlessly integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can choose to access ChatGPT’s expertise without jumping between applications, so they can get things done faster and easier than ever before. In addition, users can access ChatGPT for free without creating an account, and privacy protections are built in — their IP addresses are obscured and OpenAI won’t store requests. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT. With Siri, users can choose to access ChatGPT’s expertise without jumping between applications. Apple Intelligence marks an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI and is designed to protect users’ privacy at every step. It starts with on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power Apple Inteligence run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Apple’s groundbreaking Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Access Favorite Features and Unlock Visual Intelligence with the Action Button iPhone 16e features the Action button, allowing users to easily access a variety of functions with just a press. Once customized in Settings, the Action button can be used to quickly open the camera or flashlight; switch between Ring and Silent modes; recognize music with Shazam; activate Voice Memos, Focus, Translate, and accessibility features like Magnifier; or use Shortcuts for more options. The Action button can even access in-app functionality like launching the camera in Snapchat, unlocking a car door with FordPass, tracking a child’s sleep schedule with Napper, and more. The Action button allows users to quickly access their favorite features. By default, it switches between Ring and Silent, or users can choose from a wide set of actions for even more convenience and versatility. The Action button on iPhone 16e also unlocks a new visual intelligence experience that builds on Apple Intelligence to help users learn about objects and places. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, identify an animal or plant, and more. Visual intelligence also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared. With the Action button on iPhone 16e, users can also access visual intelligence to learn about objects and places around them. A Powerful Camera System to Capture Any Moment The powerful 2-in-1 camera system on iPhone 16e is perfect for capturing everyday moments and important memories, including in Night mode and Portrait mode. Using computational photography, the 48MP Fusion camera takes super-high-resolution photos, so users can capture gorgeous images that balance light and detail. With an integrated 2x Telephoto, users have the equivalent of two cameras in one, and can zoom in with optical quality to get closer to the subject and easily frame their shot. And the front-facing TrueDepth camera with autofocus enables sharper close-ups and beautiful group selfies. The latest generation of HDR captures subjects and the background with true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have bright highlights, rich mid-tones, and deep shadows.

The front-facing TrueDepth camera takes gorgeous selfies and videos with great color and detail. iPhone 16e takes stunning videos with the ability to record in 4K with Dolby Vision up to 60 fps, and users can stop and restart a recording for more flexibility when capturing the moment. iPhone 16e also records video in Spatial Audio for immersive listening with AirPods, Apple Vision Pro, or a surround sound system, and enables more ways to edit video sound with Audio Mix. Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality. iPhone 16e can capture stunning 4K video at 60 fps in Dolby Vision. Groundbreaking Safety and Communication Capabilities iPhone 16e helps users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. Apple’s satellite features help users text via satellite when they’re outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. This includes Messages via satellite to text friends and family; Emergency SOS via satellite to connect with emergency services; and Roadside Assistance via satellite to reach a roadside assistance provider in case of car trouble. Users can also use the Find My app to share their location via satellite, reassuring friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid.

In Messages, users can use text effects to bring words, phrases, sentences, and more to life. Tapbacks expand to include emoji, Genmoji, or stickers, and now users can schedule a message to send later.

As part of Apple 2030, the company’s ambitious goal to be carbon neutral across its entire carbon footprint by the end of this decade, Apple is transitioning to renewable electricity for its manufacturing, and investing in wind and solar projects around the world to address the electricity used to charge all Apple products, including iPhone 16e. Today, all Apple facilities run on 100 percent renewable electricity — including the data centers that power Apple Intelligence. To achieve Apple 2030, the company is designing products with more recycled and renewable materials, which further drives down the carbon footprint. iPhone 16e features over 30 percent recycled content overall, including 100 percent recycled cobalt and 95 percent recycled lithium in the battery, 85 percent recycled aluminum in the enclosure, and more.7 Additionally, the main logic board and back glass of iPhone 16e are designed to be manufactured more efficiently, reducing the amount of raw materials needed. The packaging is also entirely fiber-based, bringing Apple closer to its goal of removing plastic from its packaging by the end of this year.8 iPhone 16e will be available in white and black in 128GB, 256GB, and 512GB storage capacities, starting at $599 (U.S.) or $24.95 (U.S.) per month for 24 months.

The latest generation of HDR captures subjects and the background with true-to-life renderings of skin tones, while ensuring photos have bright highlights, rich mid-tones, and deep shadows.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"iphone-16e-camera-features\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-d3c9a461d9581f37bbb12d9e4e6023b0\" href=\"#gallery-d3c9a461d9581f37bbb12d9e4e6023b0\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-d3c9a461d9581f37bbb12d9e4e6023b0\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA photo taken with the 48MP Fusion camera on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-bc01c7effeed35fd6e4f857270a2a847\" href=\"#gallery-bc01c7effeed35fd6e4f857270a2a847\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-bc01c7effeed35fd6e4f857270a2a847\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA photo taken using the 2x Telephoto with the 48MP Fusion camera on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-f07ae6ece358a45575bf135ee487c501\" href=\"#gallery-f07ae6ece358a45575bf135ee487c501\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-f07ae6ece358a45575bf135ee487c501\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA photo taken in Portrait mode on the iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-31f8e16a2765d9b0339be19f4ebc3159\" href=\"#gallery-31f8e16a2765d9b0339be19f4ebc3159\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-31f8e16a2765d9b0339be19f4ebc3159\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA photo taken at night using iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-4e6d09758e26272bc67614287e509eb2\" href=\"#gallery-4e6d09758e26272bc67614287e509eb2\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-4e6d09758e26272bc67614287e509eb2\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA photo taken in low light using iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-f9210535455b3b5ddfce995bd006f9fa\" href=\"#gallery-f9210535455b3b5ddfce995bd006f9fa\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-f9210535455b3b5ddfce995bd006f9fa\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eA selfie taken using the front-facing TrueDepth camera on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-d3c9a461d9581f37bbb12d9e4e6023b0\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-d3c9a461d9581f37bbb12d9e4e6023b0\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:fusion-camera\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eiPhone 16e features a custom 48MP Fusion camera to take beautiful photos and videos.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/article/Apple-iPhone-16e-48MP-Fusion-photography-250219.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -

Users can adjust their sound after capture to focus on the voice of the person on camera, make it sound like the video was recorded inside a professional studio, or position vocal tracks in the front and environmental noises in surround sound. With wind noise reduction, powerful ML algorithms automatically reduce unwanted noise for better audio quality.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \u003cdiv data-component-list=\"ScrollAnimationDefault AutoPlayVideo\"\u003e\n        \u003cdiv\u003eiPhone 16e can capture stunning 4K video at 60 fps in Dolby Vision.\u003c/div\u003e\n        \n            \u003ca aria-label=\"Download video: 4K video on iPhone 16e\" data-analytics-title=\"Download video - 4K video on iPhone 16e\" download=\"\" href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/videos/2025/autoplay/02/apple-iphone-16e-4k-video-with-dolby-vision-250219/downloads/Apple-iPhone-16e-4K-video-with-Dolby-Vision-250219.zip\"\u003e\n            \u003c/a\u003e\n        \n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n     \n     \n    \n    \n        \u003cdiv\u003e\n             \n                 \u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGroundbreaking Safety and Communication Capabilities\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n                 \n             \n                 \u003cdiv\u003eiPhone 16e helps users stay connected and get assistance when it matters most. Apple’s satellite features help users text via satellite when they’re outside of cellular and Wi-Fi coverage. This includes Messages via satellite to text friends and family; Emergency SOS via satellite to connect with emergency services; and Roadside Assistance via satellite to reach a roadside assistance provider in case of car trouble. Users can also use the Find My app to share their location via satellite, reassuring friends and family of their whereabouts while traveling off the grid. Crash Detection on iPhone 16e can detect a severe car crash and automatically dial emergency services if a user is unconscious or unable to reach their iPhone.\u003csup\u003e5\u003c/sup\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n                 \n             \n         \u003c/div\u003e\n \n\n    \n    \n    \n\n\n    \n    \n        \n        \n        \n            \u003cdiv role=\"group\" aria-label=\"gallery\" data-component-list=\"MixinGallery\" id=\"iphone-16e-emergency-services\"\u003e\n            \u003cnav role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                \u003cul role=\"tablist\"\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-76ed2f2456096dcab6f6f3e15745395f\" href=\"#gallery-76ed2f2456096dcab6f6f3e15745395f\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-76ed2f2456096dcab6f6f3e15745395f\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eMessages via satellite displayed on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-fb08b0775c8a8564358de47c4c0d96dc\" href=\"#gallery-fb08b0775c8a8564358de47c4c0d96dc\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-fb08b0775c8a8564358de47c4c0d96dc\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEmergency SOS via satellite displayed on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-9ef0bdcebc4284b3335f21b1f9e6debb\" href=\"#gallery-9ef0bdcebc4284b3335f21b1f9e6debb\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-9ef0bdcebc4284b3335f21b1f9e6debb\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eFind My app via satellite displayed on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-c2e7464af01f9aee9794f49751c3d0a4\" href=\"#gallery-c2e7464af01f9aee9794f49751c3d0a4\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-c2e7464af01f9aee9794f49751c3d0a4\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eRoadside Assistance via satellite displayed on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                        \u003cli role=\"presentation\"\u003e\n                            \u003ca id=\"gallery-dotnav-9a476baaf0e4a5b5fab5c93950abae84\" href=\"#gallery-9a476baaf0e4a5b5fab5c93950abae84\" data-ac-gallery-trigger=\"gallery-9a476baaf0e4a5b5fab5c93950abae84\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCrash Detection displayed on iPhone 16e.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n                        \u003c/li\u003e\n                    \n                \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003c/nav\u003e\n            \u003cdiv\u003e\n                \n                    \n                        \n                        \u003cdiv id=\"gallery-76ed2f2456096dcab6f6f3e15745395f\" aria-labelledby=\"gallery-dotnav-76ed2f2456096dcab6f6f3e15745395f\" data-gallery-item=\"\"\u003e\n                            \u003cfigure role=\"presentation\" data-analytics-activitymap-region-id=\"Gallery:messages-via-satellite\"\u003e\n                                \n                                \u003cdiv\u003e\n                                    \u003cdiv\u003eiPhone 16e offers groundbreaking satellite features, including Messages, Find My, Roadside Assistance, and Emergency SOS via satellite.\u003c/div\u003e\n                                    \n                                    \n                                    \u003ca href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/2025/02/apple-debuts-iphone-16e-a-powerful-new-member-of-the-iphone-16-family/article/Apple-iPhone-16e-Messages-via-satellite-250219.zip\" download=\"\" data-analytics-title=\"download image -
