If even the iPhone mini seemed oversized to you, maybe you’ll appreciate an incredibly small smartphone like the NanoPhone. Smaller than a credit card, this mini smartphone proves ideal for those moments when you need something extraordinarily compact, featherweight and fuss-free. Whether you’re traveling light, hitting the gym or just getting tired of lugging around a bulky device, the NanoPhone is your streamlined solution to staying connected without the extra weight. And you can get this teensy smartphone for a small price: just $99.97 (marked down from $199.99). Look how small this smartphone is When Apple released the iPhone 6 Plus a decade ago, the phablet’s overwhelming success pretty much marked the end of reasonably sized smartphones. A small but vocal group of iPhone owners wanted something more pocket-friendly, and Apple responded with the iPhone 12 mini. Unfortunately for fans of small smartphones, the iPhone mini flopped. Still, that doesn’t mean the mini smartphone should go extinct. Sometimes you just want the basics: no frills, no giant screen, just a simple, reliable way to stay connected without carrying a brick in your pocket. If you want a big screen and impressive processing power, you can always spring for an iPhone 16 Pro Max. But if you want something compact, you should check out the NanoPhone. It really lives up to the name. The NanoPhone measures 3.5 inches long and less than 2 inches wide. But don’t let its remarkably small size fool you. This tiny smartphone is fully functional and doesn’t skimp on performance. Thanks to 4G and Wi-Fi connectivity, you’ll zip through browsing, streaming and staying connected on social apps like WhatsApp and Instagram, all while enjoying smooth, reliable performance. Plus, you can snap a selfie or capture video with the NanoPhone’s front- and rear-facing cameras. Sorry, iPhone loyalists, this phone runs on Android 10. However, the overall look and feel of the NanoPhone is all iPhone — even if it’s about the size of a business card. A great option for travelers looking to pare back The NanoPhone seems especially well-positioned for travelers looking to lighten the load — or secure a backup phone in case you accidentally smash your iPhone or drop it in a river. Dual SIM support means you can separate your work and social life or juggle travel SIM cards on the road. And the NanoPhone’s durable construction makes this small smartphone a serious contender for your new favorite travel gear. There’s even a microSD slot that allows for expandable storage. That means you can load up your little phone with movies and games for dull layovers and cozy comfort watching. Save on the NanoPhone, a mini smartphone that costs just $99.97 Remember when smartphones were small enough to comfortably fit in your pocket? You can return to those glory days with this small smartphone that’s great for travel or as a backup. Get the NanoPhone on sale for $99.97 with free shipping. That’s a 50% discount off the regular price of $199.99. Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change. All sales handled by StackSocial, our partner who runs Cult of Mac Deals.
