  "text": "Infuse, a popular video player available for Apple devices, is getting a big update today. With the launch of Infuse 8, the app now features a new design, as well as a version for Apple Vision Pro. Read on as we detail everything that’s new with Infuse 8. What’s new with Infuse 8 video player One of the highlights of Infuse 8 is the addition of a new app made specifically for Apple Vision Pro. It runs natively on visionOS and lets users watch videos on the device’s massive virtual screen. According to the developers, support for 3D videos and immersive environments will be added soon with a future update. If you don’t have an Apple Vision Pro, Infusion 8 comes with other new features. The interface has been redesigned to make the app more minimalist and modern across all platforms. There are new playback controls with easy access to audio track and subtitle selection options, volume boost, and playback speed. The app has also been optimized for the latest Apple devices, such as the iPhone 16. “We took a big step towards handling these larger libraries with the addition of Direct Mode earlier this year and 8.0 builds on that same focus with an entirely revamped browsing infrastructure. This provides significantly better app performance and faster loading of lists and items on the home screen,” says James Abeler, founder of Firecore. Infuse 8 is now available for free on the App Store, and it’s compatible with iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Vision Pro. Some features require a paid subscription or a lifetime license. More details about infuse can be found on the app’s website.
