  "description": "Macworld Apple is opening a new store at the Worldcenter in downtown Miami, Florida later this month, but even if you don’t live in Florida, you can take part in the celebration. To mark the new store’s grand opening, Apple has made a new wallpaper to “Bring your device into full bloom.” The colorful artwork features an array of foliage in various colors with an Apple logo in dark teal at the bottom. The images are meant to mimic the store’s theme, which is “an oasis in the heart of the city, where nature thrives and creativity flourishes.” Apple has also released an Apple Music playlist that will presumably play throughout the store on opening weekend. The track list includes songs from Shakira, Gloria Estefan, and Becky G, and is also curated in the spirit of the store: Created from the ground up to reflect Apple’s values, Miami Worldcenter is Apple’s most sustainable store—centered on universal design principles, while creating an inviting space where everyone is welcome. In that spirit, we’ve put together a playlist featuring some of Miami’s favorite Latin music stars to help us celebrate the store’s opening. The wallpapers are available for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and can be installed by adding them to your Photos app and going to the Wallpapers tab in Settings (or System Settings on a Mac).",
