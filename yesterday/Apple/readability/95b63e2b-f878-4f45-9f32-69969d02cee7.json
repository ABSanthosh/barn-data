  "description": "Macworld Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day. We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time. Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight. We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. Power bank battery capacity The larger the laptop power bank’s capacity the more charges it will be able to give your MacBook. While nearly all laptop power banks give their battery capacity in milliamp hours (mAh) it’s more instructional to know the battery capacity in watt hours (Wh) as Wh provides a more accurate estimation of a battery’s energy capacity for devices with varying power requirements. A 13-inch MacBook Air has a battery capacity of around 50Wh. The 16-inch MacBook Pro’s battery is rated at nearly twice that—just under 100Wh. To find out the Wh rating of your MacBook, check our our list of all the MacBook battery capacities. In theory, a 100Wh power bank could recharge the smaller laptop twice and the larger one once. While it’s not quite that simple, you will certainly get more charge from a power bank with a higher Wh rating. Watt hours is also the measure used by airlines to determine whether you can carry the power bank onto a plane with you: see below our list of the best MacBook power banks for national and international in-flight battery regulations. Manufacturers are required to mark lithium-ion batteries with the watt-hour rating, but it’s often not clearly indicated on the packaging or on the power bank itself—look for some tiny writing on one side of the battery pack and you’ll eventually find the Wh rating. Don’t worry, we’ve done that for you in our recommendations below. You can calculate the number of watt-hours your battery provides if you know the battery’s nominal voltage (V) and capacity in ampere-hours (Ah), by using this calculation: Ah x V = Wh. If you know only the battery’s milliampere hours (mAh), divide that number by 1,000 to get the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, 1200mAh divided by 1,000 = 1.2Ah. Then multiply that number by the power bank’s voltage. Battery to laptop charging speed The speed at which a power bank can charge your laptop is important, especially if you are charging the MacBook while using it. Like any USB-C charger, look for the wattage at which the power bank can output power. A small laptop requires perhaps as little as 40W to keep it powered up. A larger MacBook might require 65W or 100W. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W. In technical terms, chargers and power banks have a USB PD (Power Delivery) rating. PD 3.0 has a maximum power output of 100W. PD 3.1 (useful for the 16-inch MacBook Pro) can output at 140W. The PD rating is assigned to each USB port (see below). That top-end MacBook can be charged at 100W, but it will take longer to charge. If you use a much lower wattage charger, or power bank, your MacBook battery might not fill up as fast because the laptop battery is being used by your applications. As such we haven’t looked at any laptop power bank rated at under 65W and make recommendations for each power bank we have tested as to which MacBook model it is best suited for. It is fine to use a 140W PD 3.1 charger or power bank on a smaller laptop—nothing untoward will happen as the power output is regulated by the laptop being powered. Indeed, you can safely charge your AirPods case with a 140W charger even though it won’t take more than 5W. Total power output A power bank with multiple ports will also have a maximum total output, which is how much power all the ports can give out together at one time when each is connected to a different device. A power bank might have two ports each rated at 100W, but if the total power output is 100W then that power will be shared between the ports. Look for a total power output that means the power bank can handle charging multiple devices at the same time at full speed. Power input Power Input is the wattage at which the power bank itself can be charged via a USB-C charger. Again, the more watts, the faster the charge up to the power bank’s full capacity. USB ports A power bank needs at least one USB port to carry the power from itself to the device being charged. USB ports today come in two basic varieties: old-school rectangular USB-A and modern reversible USB-C. You will get the fastest charge using USB-C at the power bank end. At the MacBook end, the USB-C end of the cable will connect with the MacBook’s Thunderbolt port, which is identical to USB-C in looks and basic operation. Thunderbolt is backward compatible with USB-C. Look for power banks with multiple USB ports so you can charge more than one device at a time: more than one laptop, or a laptop plus a phone or two, or your AirPods case and Apple Watch. A USB-A port might be useful if you need to power-up a device whose charger uses the older standard; for example, a Fitbit. Power vs portability There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. Our sister site PCWorld.com has tested the best of these much larger portable power stations. As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below. There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop. Power bank safety Batteries can present a fire risk in certain circumstances, such as rapid overheating (a process called thermal runaway), overcharging and exposure to high temperatures. As such we recommend only power banks from trusted, premium manufacturers with a long record of producing safe, high-quality products. You will find cheaper power banks, but we believe that the safety of the device you are charging, your home or office, plus your bag if carrying it around with you, are paramount. If you want to take your power bank on a plane, there are also regulations to abide by—or you’ll be leaving it at the Security Desk. See below the chart of our favorite laptop power banks for international airline rules on permitted power banks and batteries. Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2025? We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W (using Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable) so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack. Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) – Best overall MacBook power bank Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power 170W input 250W total output 3 powerful ports Dedicated app Price When Reviewed: $179.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $168.44 View Deal $179.99 View Deal Anker $179.99 View Deal $179.99 View Deal $189.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $168.44 at Walmart Electronics$179.99 at Amazon$179.99 at Anker View more prices from B\u0026HBest Buy Close × Best Prices Today: Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) – Best overall MacBook power bank Retailer Price $168.44 View Deal $179.99 View Deal Anker $179.99 View Deal $179.99 View Deal $189.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Battery capacity: 99.56WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 250WPower Input: 170WUSB ports: 2x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-A (65W PD 3.0).Dimensions: 6.4 x 2.2 x 2 inches (16.2 x 5.7 x 5cm)Weight: 23.3oz (659g)Airline compatible: Yes The Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.56Wh). Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Although the power bank ships with a 140W-capable cable, Apple allows fast-charging only using its proprietary charging cable. Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 28 minutes. An iPhone 14 could be charged four and a half times over if using all of the power bank’s battery capacity. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with a little battery power remaining in the pack. There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. While it has a maximum total output of 250W you can’t fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at the same time—when using the two USB-C ports at the same time one runs at 140W and the other at 100W, which is still powerful enough to fast-charge one laptop and still charge another simultaneously. When using all three ports, one USB-C will have 140W potential, the other USB-C can charge at up to 92W and the USB-A port at 18W, which is enough to fast-charge an iPhone. You can recharge the power bank itself in under 40 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 170W—faster than any other laptop power bank we have tested. This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it. The Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank is available in either black or gold colors. In reality, the “black” color is more of a metallic gray. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight. It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here. Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us. There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W. The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

The cable, which is 27.6 inches (70cm) long fully outstretched, wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s a spare USB-C port at the bottom, so can charge only two devices simultaneously compared to three or more from some of the other battery packs tested here. At 15.1oz (429g) it’s lighter than the Anker 20000mAh power bank, which weighs 18.7oz (529g). It’s available in either Black or Silver Gray. The USB-C ports (60W output and input, 65W total output) aren’t as powerful as the 20K Anker, which has a 100W port, a 200W max output and 100W input, but if you aren’t after top-line speed this is the lightest and most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) it’s not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus. It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower. (We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.) The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

It doesn’t feature that power bank’s 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and the same 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. It’s a great option for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. As the maximum power output is 200W, you could simultaneously charge two MacBooks at 100W. Using all three ports, you can power a MacBook at 100W, another at 60W and still have 40W over for a third MacBook or any other device. Like its big sibling, the Anker 200W 20000mAh Power Bank features a clear display but doesn’t work with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the Anker 200W 20000mAh Power Bank can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports. Available in either gray (Anker calls it black) or gold. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

Despite its somewhat confusing name, the Cuktech 15 has a 20K (20000mAh) battery that managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 60% power. That’s not as impressive as the Baseus 20K Power bank reviewed above but at under $50/£50 it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery pack that we trust. You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 15 around 3.5 times. You double-click the power button to enter low-power mode for devices such as a smartwatch or headphones. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 20W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh (130W) – Lightest 20K laptop power bank Pros Compact and lightweight Decent battery capacity 3 ports Informative display Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $99.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $99.99 at Amazon Battery capacity: 72WhFastest Power Output: 100WTotal Power Output: 130WPower Input: 65WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 1x USB-C (30W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (22.5W PD 3.0).Dimensions: 5.2 x 2.1 x 2 inches (13.1 x 5.4 x 5.1cm)Weight: 16.9oz (480g)Airline compatible: Yes Ugreen’s equivalent to the Anker Prime 20000mAh Power Bank is the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh. The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter even though its dimensions are closely aligned. Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged. The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out 200W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the ANker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W). However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced more competitively than the Anker Prime 20000mAh, and that weight difference may be important to you. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

The compromise is its 65W USB-C ports, but these are fine for the MacBook Air and the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro. It’s also fine for larger MacBooks unless you need the fastest charging. It should charge a MacBook Air to about 70% battery capacity. It’s also a great option for iPhone users, as it can power up an iPhone 14 or 15 Pro twice over. If your MacBook Air just needs a small power boost, and you want to keep your iPhone going, this is a great compact option. Maximum simultaneous output is 130W, using both USB-C ports, so you can power two MacBooks at 65W each at the same time. There’s no USB-A port if you still need the old USB standard. The smart display shows you how much battery capacity is remaining in the power bank. Unlike the other Anker Prime laptop power banks, the 12000mAh model is available in the gray color only—no gold for the budget-conscious. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh (210W) – Budget 140W laptop power bank Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power 110W input 210W total output Price When Reviewed: $114.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Not Available at Amazon Battery capacity: 90WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 210WPower Input: 110WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-C (45W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (30W).Dimensions: 6.3 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches (16 x 5.5 x 5.5cm)Weight: 22.4oz (636g)Airline compatible: Yes The Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 140W PD 3.1 power bank looks a lot like the Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, in a tall format with an informative smart display. As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W. An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch. Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output. The Alogic Ark has a smart display screen that shows you how fast devices are charging, remaining battery capacity, and how long it will keep charging at the current speed. It’s a well-priced laptop power bank so you might be happy to choose the Ark over an alternative that can pump out more power at one time. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank.

It is slim (1.8cm) and almost square rather than a rectangular obelisk. This makes it easier to slip into the laptop compartment of a backpack or case. There are four ports: two 100W USB-C, and two 30W USB-A. The 20000mAh capacity is enough to charge a 13-inch MacBook Air from zero to 100% once, with about 5% remaining. The Blade HD also recharges via either of the two USB-C ports—although at 65W it’s slower than others reviewed here. In our tests it reached 90% after just 90 minutes and is fully charged after just under two hours—batteries always take longer to fill the last part of the charge. Like other laptop power banks, it features a smart display, but this one is harder to read than the others tested here. It provides information about the capacity percentage, voltage, and current, as well as the approximate time for the charging process, but the practical benefit of the display would be even greater if the power was displayed in watts and not in a combination of volts and amps. Baseus makes good products but can be let down by a confused product lineup. As well as the “Blade HD“, there is also a “Blade” with very similar specs and price but slightly longer (6.4 vs 5.3 inches). As far as we can tell, only the Blade is available in the U.K. while the smaller Blade HD is available in the U.S. and E.U. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

In fact, it has a lower battery capacity, lower power output and lower power input., plus two fewer USB ports. It is, however, remarkably slim—even slimmer than the Blade HD—and lightweight, and it’s a great fit for the MacBook Air. Like the Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, reviewed above, it can connect to a basic app to show you much the same data as you’ll see on its smart display. The display is small but easier to read than on the Blade HD. It’s available in blue, silver or orange colors, and you can pick one of these colors for the display via the app. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Sandberg Survivor Powerbank 27000 PD65W – Most robust power bank for MacBook Pros Large battery capacity Robust IP66 shell 3 ports Flashlight Cons Chunky More USB-A than USB-C Price When Reviewed: $122.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Sandberg $122.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $122.99 at Sandberg Battery capacity: 99.9WhFastest Power Output: 65WTotal Power Output: 65WPower Input: 60WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (65W PD 3.0); 2x USB-A (18W)Dimensions: 6.6 x 3.3 x 1.7 inches (16.8 x 8.5 x 4.2cm)Weight: 28.4oz (804g)Airline compatible: Yes Outdoor adventurers and in-the-field professionals need devices that are stronger than softy office desk jockeys and occasional airport travelers, and the Sandberg Survivor boasts a tough !P66 shell that is impervious to water and dust. As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again. Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection. 65W is great for the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, but more powerful versions of the 14-inch Pro will prefer a 100W charger. The power will recharge even a 16-inch MacBook Pro, but slower than with a 100W or 140W power bank.

We think the slab shape works better for portability, while the more vertical Anker shape looks good when sitting on your desk. Offering 140W PD 3.1 via one of its USB-C ports, it is ideal for fast-charging the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Maximum power output, however, is only a little over 140W so there’s not much power left if you want to charge another device at the same time. There’s not enough battery to fully recharge Apple’s top-end MacBook Pro, but it gets very close when recharging our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro. It is closest to the 27650mAh Anker prime power bank, and while having a little lower battery capacity it is nearly a quarter of the weight so is easier to carry around with you. The Ugreen battery pack can charge the same number of devices (three) as the Anker, but the Anker can pump out 250W of power simultaneously while the Ugreen is limited to 145W. The Anker is also much faster to re-charge itself, with 170W power input compared to Ugreen’s 65W. The display is not as smart as those on other laptop power banks reviewed here, showing just the remaining percentage. That said, this is the key statistic you’ll be interested in rather than more detail on power input and output wattages. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

This power bank should have enough juice in it to fully recharge a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. This model has a 100W power output so is less able for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, although it would still offer enough recharge to give even that laptop a few more hours of usage on the road, although with a total 100W, it’s limited to also charging other devices at the same time as a larger laptop. This one is a useful option when portability is the main aim, as at 419g it’s the lightest laptop power bank with a decent battery capacity. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Ugreen Which spare batteries and power banks can you take on a plane? When damaged, short-circuited or overheated, batteries can catch fire and explode, so there are regulations in place to ensure safety onboard commercial aircraft. If you are lucky you’ll find a charging point at the airport, but we know these are usually already taken. Many plane seats also have a USB port, but it’s often old-school USB-A where most chargers these days use the more modern, powerful and reversible USB-C connector. You’d be wise to carry your own USB-C wall charger, which you can use if your plane seat includes a regular AC power socket. Remember that you might need a travel adapter depending on the nationality of the airline. Most national and international batteries in flight regulations allow for lithium-ion batteries up to 160Wh, if permitted by the individual airlines. U.S. TSA and FAA battery and power bank regulations The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) states that any “spare (uninstalled) lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, must be carried in carry-on baggage only”. Both TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) state that “with airline approval”, passengers may also carry up to two spare larger lithium-ion batteries (101–160Wh). TSA requirements apply to both air carriers and airports, and the FAA requirements only apply to commercial airlines. U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) battery and power bank regulations Up to two “spare batteries for portable electronic devices containing lithium-ion batteries exceeding a Watt-hour rating of 100Wh but not exceeding 160Wh when carried for personal use are allowed for carry-on baggage and on one’s person. They are not permitted in checked (hold) baggage.” European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) battery and power bank regulations The European Union regulations are stricter: “If the Wh is higher than 100 but not higher than 160, you will need an approval from the operator to carry the item”. EASA also states that “power banks should not be connected or providing power to a device while on board the aircraft”. So you can carry the power bank with you but not actually recharge your phone or laptop while on the plane.",

  "text": "Image: Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day. We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time. Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight. We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. Power bank battery capacity The larger the laptop power bank’s capacity the more charges it will be able to give your MacBook. While nearly all laptop power banks give their battery capacity in milliamp hours (mAh) it’s more instructional to know the battery capacity in watt hours (Wh) as Wh provides a more accurate estimation of a battery’s energy capacity for devices with varying power requirements. A 13-inch MacBook Air has a battery capacity of around 50Wh. The 16-inch MacBook Pro’s battery is rated at nearly twice that—just under 100Wh. To find out the Wh rating of your MacBook, check our our list of all the MacBook battery capacities. In theory, a 100Wh power bank could recharge the smaller laptop twice and the larger one once. While it’s not quite that simple, you will certainly get more charge from a power bank with a higher Wh rating. Watt hours is also the measure used by airlines to determine whether you can carry the power bank onto a plane with you: see below our list of the best MacBook power banks for national and international in-flight battery regulations. Manufacturers are required to mark lithium-ion batteries with the watt-hour rating, but it’s often not clearly indicated on the packaging or on the power bank itself—look for some tiny writing on one side of the battery pack and you’ll eventually find the Wh rating. Don’t worry, we’ve done that for you in our recommendations below. You can calculate the number of watt-hours your battery provides if you know the battery’s nominal voltage (V) and capacity in ampere-hours (Ah), by using this calculation: Ah x V = Wh. If you know only the battery’s milliampere hours (mAh), divide that number by 1,000 to get the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, 1200mAh divided by 1,000 = 1.2Ah. Then multiply that number by the power bank’s voltage. Battery to laptop charging speed The speed at which a power bank can charge your laptop is important, especially if you are charging the MacBook while using it. Like any USB-C charger, look for the wattage at which the power bank can output power. A small laptop requires perhaps as little as 40W to keep it powered up. A larger MacBook might require 65W or 100W. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W. In technical terms, chargers and power banks have a USB PD (Power Delivery) rating. PD 3.0 has a maximum power output of 100W. PD 3.1 (useful for the 16-inch MacBook Pro) can output at 140W. The PD rating is assigned to each USB port (see below). That top-end MacBook can be charged at 100W, but it will take longer to charge. If you use a much lower wattage charger, or power bank, your MacBook battery might not fill up as fast because the laptop battery is being used by your applications. As such we haven’t looked at any laptop power bank rated at under 65W and make recommendations for each power bank we have tested as to which MacBook model it is best suited for. It is fine to use a 140W PD 3.1 charger or power bank on a smaller laptop—nothing untoward will happen as the power output is regulated by the laptop being powered. Indeed, you can safely charge your AirPods case with a 140W charger even though it won’t take more than 5W. Total power output A power bank with multiple ports will also have a maximum total output, which is how much power all the ports can give out together at one time when each is connected to a different device. A power bank might have two ports each rated at 100W, but if the total power output is 100W then that power will be shared between the ports. Look for a total power output that means the power bank can handle charging multiple devices at the same time at full speed. Power input Power Input is the wattage at which the power bank itself can be charged via a USB-C charger. Again, the more watts, the faster the charge up to the power bank’s full capacity. USB ports A power bank needs at least one USB port to carry the power from itself to the device being charged. USB ports today come in two basic varieties: old-school rectangular USB-A and modern reversible USB-C. You will get the fastest charge using USB-C at the power bank end. At the MacBook end, the USB-C end of the cable will connect with the MacBook’s Thunderbolt port, which is identical to USB-C in looks and basic operation. Thunderbolt is backward compatible with USB-C. Look for power banks with multiple USB ports so you can charge more than one device at a time: more than one laptop, or a laptop plus a phone or two, or your AirPods case and Apple Watch. A USB-A port might be useful if you need to power-up a device whose charger uses the older standard; for example, a Fitbit. Power vs portability There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. Our sister site PCWorld.com has tested the best of these much larger portable power stations. As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below. There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop. Power bank safety Batteries can present a fire risk in certain circumstances, such as rapid overheating (a process called thermal runaway), overcharging and exposure to high temperatures. As such we recommend only power banks from trusted, premium manufacturers with a long record of producing safe, high-quality products. You will find cheaper power banks, but we believe that the safety of the device you are charging, your home or office, plus your bag if carrying it around with you, are paramount. If you want to take your power bank on a plane, there are also regulations to abide by—or you’ll be leaving it at the Security Desk. See below the chart of our favorite laptop power banks for international airline rules on permitted power banks and batteries. Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2025? We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W (using Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable) so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack. Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) – Best overall MacBook power bank Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power 170W input 250W total output 3 powerful ports Dedicated app Price When Reviewed: $179.99 Battery capacity: 99.56WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 250WPower Input: 170WUSB ports: 2x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-A (65W PD 3.0).Dimensions: 6.4 x 2.2 x 2 inches (16.2 x 5.7 x 5cm)Weight: 23.3oz (659g)Airline compatible: Yes The Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.56Wh). Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Although the power bank ships with a 140W-capable cable, Apple allows fast-charging only using its proprietary charging cable. Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 28 minutes. An iPhone 14 could be charged four and a half times over if using all of the power bank’s battery capacity. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with a little battery power remaining in the pack. There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. While it has a maximum total output of 250W you can’t fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at the same time—when using the two USB-C ports at the same time one runs at 140W and the other at 100W, which is still powerful enough to fast-charge one laptop and still charge another simultaneously. When using all three ports, one USB-C will have 140W potential, the other USB-C can charge at up to 92W and the USB-A port at 18W, which is enough to fast-charge an iPhone. You can recharge the power bank itself in under 40 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 170W—faster than any other laptop power bank we have tested. This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it. The Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank is available in either black or gold colors. In reality, the “black” color is more of a metallic gray. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro. Read our full Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) review Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank (300W) – Best high-capacity MacBook power bank Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power 300W total output Carry handle 5 powerful ports Cons Larger and heavier than most Price When Reviewed: $199.99 Battery capacity: 153WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 300WPower Input: 140WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (140W PD 3.1), 2x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 2x USB-A (22.5W).Dimensions: 6.3 x 5.7 x 3 inches inches (16 x 14.5 x 7.6cm)Weight: 3.6lb (1.65kg)Airline compatible: Yes (with carrier approval) The Ugreen 48000mAh 300W Portable Power Bank is the missing link between a laptop power bank and a full-blown power station. It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight. It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here. Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us. There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W. The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro. Read our full Ugreen 48000mAh 300W Portable Power Bank review Baseus Free2Pull Power Bank with Retractable USB-C Cable 65W – Most convenient laptop power bank Pros Large battery capacity Integrated retractable USB-C cable Lightweight Cons Only one spare USB-C port U.S. only Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Battery capacity: 74WhFastest Power Output: 60WTotal Power Output: 65WPower Input: 60WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (60W PD 3.0) built-in cable; 1x USB-C (60W PD 3.0).Dimensions: 6.1 x 2.8 x 1.3 inches (15.5 x 7.2 x 3.4cm)Weight: 15.1oz (429g)Airline compatible: Yes The performance is impressive—we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to a respectable 84%, not far off the 100% from the higher-capacity Anker 27650mAh power bank—but what we love about this laptop battery pack is its handy 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable USB-C cable that means you don’t have to carry one with you when you take the power bank walkies. The cable, which is 27.6 inches (70cm) long fully outstretched, wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s a spare USB-C port at the bottom, so can charge only two devices simultaneously compared to three or more from some of the other battery packs tested here. At 15.1oz (429g) it’s lighter than the Anker 20000mAh power bank, which weighs 18.7oz (529g). It’s available in either Black or Silver Gray. The USB-C ports (60W output and input, 65W total output) aren’t as powerful as the 20K Anker, which has a 100W port, a 200W max output and 100W input, but if you aren’t after top-line speed this is the lightest and most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) it’s not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus. It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower. (We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.) The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Anker Prime 20000mAh Power Bank (200W) – Best mid-range laptop power bank Pros Compact size Decent battery capacity 3 powerful ports 200W total output Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Battery capacity: 72WhFastest Power Output: 100WTotal Power Output: 200WPower Input: 100WUSB ports: 2x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (65W PD 3.0).Dimensions: 4.9 x 2.1 x 2 inches (12.7 x 5.5 x 5cm)Weight: 18.7oz (529g)Airline compatible: Yes The Anker Prime 20000mAh Power Bank is a recommended laptop power bank that is lighter and smaller than the top-end Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, but boasts the same number of USB ports. It doesn’t feature that power bank’s 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and the same 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. It’s a great option for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. As the maximum power output is 200W, you could simultaneously charge two MacBooks at 100W. Using all three ports, you can power a MacBook at 100W, another at 60W and still have 40W over for a third MacBook or any other device. Like its big sibling, the Anker 200W 20000mAh Power Bank features a clear display but doesn’t work with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the Anker 200W 20000mAh Power Bank can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports. Available in either gray (Anker calls it black) or gold. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Cuktech 15SE 85W 20000mAh Power Bank – Best budget 20K laptop power bank Pros Compact size Decent battery capacity 3 ports 200W total output Cons Lower recharge than rivals in tests Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Battery capacity: 73.44WhFastest Power Output: 65WTotal Power Output: 85WPower Input: 65WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (65W PD 3.0); 1x USB-C (33W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (33W).Dimensions: 6 x 1.7 x 2 inches (15.2 x 5.2 x 4.4cm)Weight: 17.4oz (492g)Airline compatible: Yes The Cuktech 15 laptop power bank we tested might not perform to the same degree as more expensive rivals but offers great value for money. Despite its somewhat confusing name, the Cuktech 15 has a 20K (20000mAh) battery that managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 60% power. That’s not as impressive as the Baseus 20K Power bank reviewed above but at under $50/£50 it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery pack that we trust. You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 15 around 3.5 times. You double-click the power button to enter low-power mode for devices such as a smartwatch or headphones. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 20W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh (130W) – Lightest 20K laptop power bank Pros Compact and lightweight Decent battery capacity 3 ports Informative display Price When Reviewed: $99.99 Battery capacity: 72WhFastest Power Output: 100WTotal Power Output: 130WPower Input: 65WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 1x USB-C (30W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (22.5W PD 3.0).Dimensions: 5.2 x 2.1 x 2 inches (13.1 x 5.4 x 5.1cm)Weight: 16.9oz (480g)Airline compatible: Yes Ugreen’s equivalent to the Anker Prime 20000mAh Power Bank is the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh. The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter even though its dimensions are closely aligned. Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged. The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out 200W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the ANker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W). However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced more competitively than the Anker Prime 20000mAh, and that weight difference may be important to you. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Read our full Ugreen Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh 130W review Anker Prime 12000mAh Power Bank (130W) – Best budget compact laptop power bank Pros Compact size, lightweight Affordable 130W total output Cons Lower battery capacity than most 65W fastest output 65W input Price When Reviewed: $89.99 Battery capacity: 43.2WhFastest Power Output: 65WTotal Power Output: 130WPower Input: 65WUSB ports: 2x USB-C (65W PD 3.0)Dimensions: 5.3 x 2.2 x 1.4 inches (13.3 x 5.5 x 3.3cm)Weight: 14.8oz (360g)Airline compatible: Yes Smaller still than the Anker Prime 20000mAh Power Bank, the little(ish) Anker Prime 12000mAh Power Bank is more portable—smaller and lighter—than its fellow Prime battery packs. The compromise is its 65W USB-C ports, but these are fine for the MacBook Air and the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro. It’s also fine for larger MacBooks unless you need the fastest charging. It should charge a MacBook Air to about 70% battery capacity. It’s also a great option for iPhone users, as it can power up an iPhone 14 or 15 Pro twice over. If your MacBook Air just needs a small power boost, and you want to keep your iPhone going, this is a great compact option. Maximum simultaneous output is 130W, using both USB-C ports, so you can power two MacBooks at 65W each at the same time. There’s no USB-A port if you still need the old USB standard. The smart display shows you how much battery capacity is remaining in the power bank. Unlike the other Anker Prime laptop power banks, the 12000mAh model is available in the gray color only—no gold for the budget-conscious. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh (210W) – Budget 140W laptop power bank Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power 110W input 210W total output Price When Reviewed: $114.99 Battery capacity: 90WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 210WPower Input: 110WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-C (45W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (30W).Dimensions: 6.3 x 2.2 x 2.2 inches (16 x 5.5 x 5.5cm)Weight: 22.4oz (636g)Airline compatible: Yes The Cuktech 20 Power Bank 25000mAh 140W PD 3.1 power bank looks a lot like the Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, in a tall format with an informative smart display. As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W. An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch. Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro. Alogic Ark 27000mAh Power Bank – Budget 140W laptop power bank Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power 140W input Price When Reviewed: $119.99 Battery capacity: 97.2WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 140WPower Input: 140WUSB ports: 2x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-A (22.5W).Dimensions: 6.1 x 2.1 x 2 inches (15.5 x 5.3 x 5cm)Weight: 22.4oz (635g)Airline compatible: Yes This is another column-shaped laptop power bank with a high-capacity. The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output. The Alogic Ark has a smart display screen that shows you how fast devices are charging, remaining battery capacity, and how long it will keep charging at the current speed. It’s a well-priced laptop power bank so you might be happy to choose the Ark over an alternative that can pump out more power at one time. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro. Sandberg Survivor Powerbank 27000 PD65W – Most robust power bank for MacBook Pros Large battery capacity Super rugged IP66 shell Flashlight Cons Chunky More USB-A than USB-C Price When Reviewed: $122.99 Battery capacity: 99.9WhFastest Power Output: 65WTotal Power Output: 65WPower Input: 60WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (65W PD 3.0); 2x USB-A (18W)Dimensions: 6.6 x 3.3 x 1.7 inches (16.8 x 8.5 x 4.2cm)Weight: 28.4oz (804g)Airline compatible: Yes The rugged Sandberg Survivor isn’t as slim as portable as other similar-capacity laptop power banks, but if you are taking your laptop off-road, this IP66-rated power bank is uniquely built to last and safe from water and dirt that would see off lesser power banks. As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air or any adventurer’s laptop Read our full Sandberg Survivor Powerbank 27000 PD65W review Baseus Laptop Powerbank PD 100W 20000mAh – Slimmest power bank for MacBook Pro Cons No display in watts 65W input Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Battery capacity: 74WhFastest Power Output: 100WTotal Power Output: 100WPower Input: 65WUSB ports: 2x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 2x USB-A (30W).Dimensions: 5.3 x 5.3 x 0.7 inches (13.4 x 13.4 x 1.8cm)Weight: 445gAirline compatible: Yes The Baseus Blade HD Laptop 20000mAh Power Bank is a different design to most other laptop power banks. It is slim (1.8cm) and almost square rather than a rectangular obelisk. This makes it easier to slip into the laptop compartment of a backpack or case. There are four ports: two 100W USB-C, and two 30W USB-A. The 20000mAh capacity is enough to charge a 13-inch MacBook Air from zero to 100% once, with about 5% remaining. The Blade HD also recharges via either of the two USB-C ports—although at 65W it’s slower than others reviewed here. In our tests it reached 90% after just 90 minutes and is fully charged after just under two hours—batteries always take longer to fill the last part of the charge. Like other laptop power banks, it features a smart display, but this one is harder to read than the others tested here. It provides information about the capacity percentage, voltage, and current, as well as the approximate time for the charging process, but the practical benefit of the display would be even greater if the power was displayed in watts and not in a combination of volts and amps. Baseus makes good products but can be let down by a confused product lineup. As well as the “Blade HD“, there is also a “Blade” with very similar specs and price but slightly longer (6.4 vs 5.3 inches). As far as we can tell, only the Blade is available in the U.K. while the smaller Blade HD is available in the U.S. and E.U. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

In fact, it has a lower battery capacity, lower power output and lower power input., plus two fewer USB ports. It is, however, remarkably slim—even slimmer than the Blade HD—and lightweight, and it’s a great fit for the MacBook Air. Like the Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, reviewed above, it can connect to a basic app to show you much the same data as you’ll see on its smart display. The display is small but easier to read than on the Blade HD. It’s available in blue, silver or orange colors, and you can pick one of these colors for the display via the app. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Sandberg Survivor Powerbank 27000 PD65W – Most robust power bank for MacBook Pros Large battery capacity Robust IP66 shell 3 ports Flashlight Cons Chunky More USB-A than USB-C Price When Reviewed: $122.99 Battery capacity: 99.9WhFastest Power Output: 65WTotal Power Output: 65WPower Input: 60WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (65W PD 3.0); 2x USB-A (18W)Dimensions: 6.6 x 3.3 x 1.7 inches (16.8 x 8.5 x 4.2cm)Weight: 28.4oz (804g)Airline compatible: Yes Outdoor adventurers and in-the-field professionals need devices that are stronger than softy office desk jockeys and occasional airport travelers, and the Sandberg Survivor boasts a tough !P66 shell that is impervious to water and dust. As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again. Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection. 65W is great for the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, but more powerful versions of the 14-inch Pro will prefer a 100W charger. The power will recharge even a 16-inch MacBook Pro, but slower than with a 100W or 140W power bank. Read our full Sandberg Survivor Powerbank 27000 PD65W review Ugreen 25000mAh Power Bank (145W) – Power in a portable package Pros Large battery capacity 140W (PD 3.1) charging power Portable shape Price When Reviewed: $119.99 Battery capacity: 90WhFastest Power Output: 140WTotal Power Output: 145WPower Input: 65WUSB ports: 1x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (22.5W).Dimensions: 6.3 x 3.2 x 1.1 inches (16 x 8.1 x 2.8cm)Weight: 17.7oz (503g) As well as its oblong Nexode laptop power banks, Ugreen offers an alternative slab shape in the form of the Ugreen 25000mAh Power Bank. We think the slab shape works better for portability, while the more vertical Anker shape looks good when sitting on your desk. Offering 140W PD 3.1 via one of its USB-C ports, it is ideal for fast-charging the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Maximum power output, however, is only a little over 140W so there’s not much power left if you want to charge another device at the same time. There’s not enough battery to fully recharge Apple’s top-end MacBook Pro, but it gets very close when recharging our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro. It is closest to the 27650mAh Anker prime power bank, and while having a little lower battery capacity it is nearly a quarter of the weight so is easier to carry around with you. The Ugreen battery pack can charge the same number of devices (three) as the Anker, but the Anker can pump out 250W of power simultaneously while the Ugreen is limited to 145W. The Anker is also much faster to re-charge itself, with 170W power input compared to Ugreen’s 65W. The display is not as smart as those on other laptop power banks reviewed here, showing just the remaining percentage. That said, this is the key statistic you’ll be interested in rather than more detail on power input and output wattages. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

This power bank should have enough juice in it to fully recharge a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. This model has a 100W power output so is less able for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, although it would still offer enough recharge to give even that laptop a few more hours of usage on the road, although with a total 100W, it’s limited to also charging other devices at the same time as a larger laptop. This one is a useful option when portability is the main aim, as at 419g it’s the lightest laptop power bank with a decent battery capacity. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Ugreen Which spare batteries and power banks can you take on a plane? When damaged, short-circuited or overheated, batteries can catch fire and explode, so there are regulations in place to ensure safety onboard commercial aircraft. If you are lucky you’ll find a charging point at the airport, but we know these are usually already taken. Many plane seats also have a USB port, but it’s often old-school USB-A where most chargers these days use the more modern, powerful and reversible USB-C connector. You’d be wise to carry your own USB-C wall charger, which you can use if your plane seat includes a regular AC power socket. Remember that you might need a travel adapter depending on the nationality of the airline. Most national and international batteries in flight regulations allow for lithium-ion batteries up to 160Wh, if permitted by the individual airlines. U.S. TSA and FAA battery and power bank regulations The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) states that any “spare (uninstalled) lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, must be carried in carry-on baggage only”. Both TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) state that “with airline approval”, passengers may also carry up to two spare larger lithium-ion batteries (101–160Wh). TSA requirements apply to both air carriers and airports, and the FAA requirements only apply to commercial airlines. U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) battery and power bank regulations Up to two “spare batteries for portable electronic devices containing lithium-ion batteries exceeding a Watt-hour rating of 100Wh but not exceeding 160Wh when carried for personal use are allowed for carry-on baggage and on one’s person. They are not permitted in checked (hold) baggage.” European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) battery and power bank regulations The European Union regulations are stricter: “If the Wh is higher than 100 but not higher than 160, you will need an approval from the operator to carry the item”. EASA also states that “power banks should not be connected or providing power to a device while on board the aircraft”. So you can carry the power bank with you but not actually recharge your phone or laptop while on the plane.

To find out the Wh rating of your MacBook, check our our \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2340098/intel-apple-silicon-macbook-pro-air-battery-capacities-watt-hours.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003elist of all the MacBook battery capacities\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn theory, a 100Wh power bank could recharge the smaller laptop twice and the larger one once. While it’s not quite that simple, you will certainly get more charge from a power bank with a higher Wh rating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWatt hours is also the measure used by airlines to determine whether you can carry the power bank onto a plane with you: see below our list of the best MacBook power banks for national and international \u003ca href=\"#which-spare-batteries-and-power-banks-can-you-take-on-a-plane\"\u003ein-flight battery regulations\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eManufacturers are required to mark lithium-ion batteries with the watt-hour rating, but it’s often not clearly indicated on the packaging or on the power bank itself—look for some tiny writing on one side of the battery pack and you’ll eventually find the Wh rating. Don’t worry, we’ve done that for you in our recommendations below. You can calculate the number of watt-hours your battery provides if you know the battery’s nominal voltage (V) and capacity in ampere-hours (Ah), by using this calculation: Ah x V = Wh.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you know only the battery’s milliampere hours (mAh), divide that number by 1,000 to get the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, 1200mAh divided by 1,000 = 1.2Ah. Then multiply that number by the power bank’s voltage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"battery-to-laptop-charging-speed\"\u003eBattery to laptop charging speed\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe speed at which a power bank can charge your laptop is important, especially if you are charging the MacBook while using it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLike any USB-C charger, look for the wattage at which the power bank can output power. A small laptop requires perhaps as little as 40W to keep it powered up. A larger MacBook might require 65W or 100W. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn technical terms, chargers and power banks have a USB PD (Power Delivery) rating. PD 3.0 has a maximum power output of 100W. PD 3.1 (useful for the 16-inch MacBook Pro) can output at 140W. The PD rating is assigned to each USB port (see below).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThat top-end MacBook can be charged at 100W, but it will take longer to charge. If you use a much lower wattage charger, or power bank, your MacBook battery might not fill up as fast because the laptop battery is being used by your applications.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs such we haven’t looked at any laptop power bank rated at under 65W and make recommendations for each power bank we have tested as to which MacBook model it is best suited for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt is fine to use a 140W PD 3.1 charger or power bank on a smaller laptop—nothing untoward will happen as the power output is regulated by the laptop being powered. Indeed, you can safely charge your AirPods case with a 140W charger even though it won’t take more than 5W.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"total-power-output\"\u003eTotal power output\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA power bank with multiple ports will also have a maximum total output, which is how much power all the ports can give out together at one time when each is connected to a different device.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA power bank might have two ports each rated at 100W, but if the total power output is 100W then that power will be shared between the ports. Look for a total power output that means the power bank can handle charging multiple devices at the same time at full speed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"power-input\"\u003ePower input\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003ePower Input is the wattage at which the power bank itself can be charged via a \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/819438/best-macbook-usb-c-charger.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eUSB-C charger\u003c/a\u003e. Again, the more watts, the faster the charge up to the power bank’s full capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"usb-ports\"\u003eUSB ports\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eA power bank needs at least one USB port to carry the power from itself to the device being charged. USB ports today come in two basic varieties: old-school rectangular USB-A and modern reversible USB-C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou will get the fastest charge using USB-C at the power bank end. At the MacBook end, the USB-C end of the cable will connect with the MacBook’s Thunderbolt port, which is identical to USB-C in looks and basic operation. Thunderbolt is backward compatible with USB-C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLook for power banks with multiple USB ports so you can charge more than one device at a time: more than one laptop, or a laptop plus a phone or two, or your AirPods case and Apple Watch. A USB-A port might be useful if you need to power-up a device whose charger uses the older standard; for example, a Fitbit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"power-vs-portability\"\u003ePower vs portability\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. Our sister site PCWorld.com has tested the best of these much larger \u003ca href=\"https://www.pcworld.com/article/610961/best-portable-power-stations.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003eportable power stations\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668978/best-magsafe-portable-battery-packs-and-power-banks-for-iphone-12-and-13.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ebest power banks for iPhone\u003c/a\u003e. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"power-bank-safety\"\u003ePower bank safety\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBatteries can present a fire risk in certain circumstances, such as rapid overheating (a process called thermal runaway), overcharging and exposure to high temperatures.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs such we recommend only power banks from trusted, premium manufacturers with a long record of producing safe, high-quality products. You will find cheaper power banks, but we believe that the safety of the device you are charging, your home or office, plus your bag if carrying it around with you, are paramount.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you want to take your power bank on a plane, there are also regulations to abide by—or you’ll be leaving it at the Security Desk. See below the chart of our favorite laptop power banks for international airline rules on permitted power banks and batteries.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"which-power-bank-is-best-for-your-macbook-in-2025\"\u003eWhich power bank is best for your MacBook in 2025?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W (using Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable) so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W)\" id=\"anker-prime-27650mah-power-bank-250w-best-overall-macbook-power-bank\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) – Best overall MacBook power bank\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/b2c-contenthub.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/07\\/Anker-Prime-27650mAh-Power-Bank-250W-Front.jpg?quality=50\\u0026strip=all\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product-chart-item__image\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) \\u2013 Best overall MacBook power bank\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) \\u2013 Best overall MacBook power bank\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" alt=\"Anker Prime 27,650mAh Power Bank (250W) – Best overall MacBook power bank\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Anker-Prime-27650mAh-Power-Bank-250W-Front.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"1200\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003ePros\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLarge battery capacity\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e140W (PD 3.1) charging power\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e170W input\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e250W total output\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e3 powerful ports\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003eDedicated app\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$179.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBattery capacity:\u003c/strong\u003e 99.56Wh\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFastest Power Output:\u003c/strong\u003e 140W\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTotal Power Output:\u003c/strong\u003e 250W\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePower Input:\u003c/strong\u003e 170W\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUSB ports:\u003c/strong\u003e 2x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-A (65W PD 3.0).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDimensions:\u003c/strong\u003e 6.4 x 2.2 x 2 inches (16.2 x 5.7 x 5cm)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeight:\u003c/strong\u003e 23.3oz (659g)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAirline compatible:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://anker.pxf.io/c/321564/1543954/18023?subId1=1-1-2395511-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anker.com%2Fproducts%2Fa1340-250w-power-bank%3Fvariant%3D45307568390308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-1-2395511-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"anker\"\u003eAnker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank\u003c/a\u003e is one of the most powerful laptop power banks that you can match with your MacBook. It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.56Wh).\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAttach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Although the power bank ships with a 140W-capable cable, Apple allows fast-charging only using its proprietary charging cable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 28 minutes. An iPhone 14 could be charged four and a half times over if using all of the power bank’s battery capacity.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with a little battery power remaining in the pack.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. While it has a maximum total output of 250W you can’t fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at the same time—when using the two USB-C ports at the same time one runs at 140W and the other at 100W, which is still powerful enough to fast-charge one laptop and still charge another simultaneously. When using all three ports, one USB-C will have 140W potential, the other USB-C can charge at up to 92W and the USB-A port at 18W, which is enough to fast-charge an iPhone.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can recharge the power bank itself in under 40 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 170W—faster than any other laptop power bank we have tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own.

The power will recharge even a 16-inch MacBook Pro, but slower than with a 100W or 140W power bank.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2520559/sandberg-survivor-powerbank-27000-pd65w-review-outdoors-power-for-your-macbook.html\" score=\"4\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tSandberg Survivor Powerbank 27000 PD65W review \t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"Ugreen 145W 25000mAh Power Bank\" id=\"ugreen-25000mah-power-bank-145w-power-in-a-portable-package\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUgreen 25000mAh Power Bank (145W) – Power in a portable package\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/b2c-contenthub.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2024\\/07\\/Ugreen-145W-25000mAh-Power-Bank.jpg?quality=50\\u0026strip=all\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product-chart-item__image\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: Ugreen 25000mAh Power Bank (145W) \\u2013 Power in a portable package\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Ugreen 25000mAh Power Bank (145W) \\u2013 Power in a portable package\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\" alt=\"Ugreen 25000mAh Power Bank (145W) – Power in a portable package\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Ugreen-145W-25000mAh-Power-Bank.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"1600\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003ePros\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLarge battery capacity\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003e140W (PD 3.1) charging power\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cli\u003ePortable shape\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$119.99\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBattery capacity:\u003c/strong\u003e 90Wh\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFastest Power Output:\u003c/strong\u003e 140W\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTotal Power Output:\u003c/strong\u003e 145W\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePower Input:\u003c/strong\u003e 65W\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUSB ports:\u003c/strong\u003e 1x USB-C (140W PD 3.1); 1x USB-C (100W PD 3.0); 1x USB-A (22.5W).\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDimensions:\u003c/strong\u003e 6.3 x 3.2 x 1.1 inches (16 x 8.1 x 2.8cm)\u003cbr/\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeight:\u003c/strong\u003e 17.7oz (503g)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs well as its oblong Nexode laptop power banks, Ugreen offers an alternative slab shape in the form of the \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.ugreen.com\u0026amp;xcust=1-1-2395511-1-0-0-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/2395511/best-laptop-power-banks-for-macbook.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-1-2395511-1-0-0-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"ugreen\"\u003eUgreen 25000mAh Power Bank\u003c/a\u003e.
