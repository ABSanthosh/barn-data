Photo: Cult of Mac Deals Whether you use a Mac or any other operating system, there is a universal truth we all know: Editing PDFs can be one of the most frustrating tasks on earth. The top-rated UPDF Pro app can make working with the file format easier, and lifetime subscriptions are on sale for just $47.97 (regularly $149.99). That’s the best price on the web — and more than two-thirds off the regular price of this excellent PDF editor. UPDF PDF editor lets you work with PDFs more easily than ever Whether you deal with PDFs for work or college, using the format can prove challenging if you don’t use the right software. Enter UPDF Pro: an all-in-one answer to the age-old PDF problem. This easy-to-use PDF editor allows you to edit PDFs on various operating systems and devices, including Macs, iPhones, Windows PCs and Android devices. You can add and delete text; change fonts; crop, rotate and delete images — even add links and watermarks to PDFs. This might not sound huge for anyone who doesn’t deal with PDFs regularly. However, for people who know what it’s like to want to face-plant the desk every time a change is needed on a PDF, it’s a total game changer. A PDF editor that lets you add passwords and convert PDFs to Word, Excel and more Besides editing documents to suit your needs, UPDF Pro also lets you add passwords to protect confidential information. And it can convert PDFs to other file formats like Word, Excel and PowerPoint in just a click.  Another great feature this app brings is annotation. That allows you to easily bookmark pages, highlight text and add stickers and notes throughout your PDFs. For those who deal with long documents for work, are gathering references, or are studying large texts, it’s not just an improvement but a necessity. UPDF Pro comes highly rated by both customers and experts, with a high 4.6 out of 5 rating on the Mac App Store. Meanwhile, a review by The Windows Club highlights that UPDF Pro will work across all your devices. “Unlike other PDF editing software, you don’t need to buy a separate license for Windows or Mac,” the reviewer wrote. “Instead, you will only have to purchase the license once, and it can be used across all the supported platforms.” Save on a lifetime UPDF Pro subscription For all its popularity, the PDF format can make editing documents a nightmare. UPDF Pro can help. And for a limited time, you can purchase a lifetime subscription for just $47.97 (regularly $149). Buy from: Cult of Mac Deals Prices subject to change.
