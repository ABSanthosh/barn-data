  "text": "In September, I wrote about two interoperability proceedings commenced by the European Commission (EC) against Apple. As I wrote then: In a nutshell, the EC is unhappy with connectivity between iOS and third-party devices and plans to tell the company how to comply. The second part requires Apple to set up a process for third parties to request connectivity with iOS. Late yesterday, the EC published two follow-up documents requesting input from EU citizens and companies on the interoperability proceedings. DMA.100203 seeks feedback on these technical aspects: The effectiveness of the measures in practice: if implemented, will the proposed measures result in effective interoperability with iOS for each feature The completeness of the measures: if anything else is needed to ensure effective interoperability for the relevant feature Feasibility of the measures: would there be any difficulties or obstacles in implementing each relevant proposed measure in your connected device or app Timelines: is the proposed timeline for Apple to implement each proposed measure achievable? Under DMA.100204, the EC is requesting input on the following: Is the mapping of existing frameworks adequate to provide developers with prior information to submit a request and to obtain interoperability? Are the proposed timelines adequate to establish a timely and predictable process that takes into account the specificities of the varying technical needs? Are the proposed measures on communication and feedback allowing adequate developers’ involvement in the process? Are the transparency measures allowing developers to be sufficiently informed about the process and its outcome? Would the proposed process ensure a fair treatment of the requests and accountability for Apple’s decisions? Are the proposed measures adequate to ensure that the request process delivers interoperability solutions that are effective and future-proof? The deadline for commentary on both EC requests is January 9, 2025. In response, Apple published a document yesterday explaining how it believes Meta and other companies will “weaponize interoperability,” undermining user privacy and security. As Apple puts it (emphasis in original): If Apple were to have to grant all of these requests, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp could enable Meta to read on a user’s device all of their messages and emails, see every phone call they make or receive, track every app that they use, scan all of their photos, look at their files and calendar events, log all of their passwords, and more. This is data that Apple itself has chosen not to access in order to provide the strongest possible protection to users. Interoperability is shaping up to be the field where the fight over opening up more of iOS and iPadOS will be fought. There are places where third-party devices, like many wearables, are at a disadvantage when connecting to iOS. However, deep system-level interoperability necessarily raises potential privacy and security concerns. This isn’t going to be an easy balance to strike, and a lot is at stake, which is why I expect these EC proceedings to be the biggest DMA story of 2025.
