  "text": "iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus were fantastic smartphones in 2016 and 2017, but they did experience a so-called “Loop Disease” in some instances. For that reason, a class action lawsuit was filed years ago and eventually approved last year. A year later, former iPhone 7 customers are starting to receive their settlement payments. The amounts appear to be around $200 per claim filed. That’s not a bad payday for former iPhone 7 users in 2025. Of course, those payments come from a $35 million settlement that best rewards the attorneys who brought the class action suit forward. The deadline to participate in the class action suit ended last summer. For its part, Apple admitted no wrongdoing and denied the allegations while agreeing to the settlement. Loop Disease was allegedly caused by putting pressure on a certain part of the iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus. The symptoms included degraded audio quality, including during FaceTime calls, and more. Actual payments received depend on whether a participant paid for a repair related to the issue. Customers who experienced the issue but didn’t pay for a repair are expected to receive less. The top payment amount was said to be $350 at the time. Last fall, customers of MacBooks with butterfly keyboards similarly began receiving payment as part of a separate settlement.
