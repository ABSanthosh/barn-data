  "text": "Throughout the ongoing wildfires, California officials have relied on emergency alerts to communicate with citizens. This system is an important way for officials to communicate with citizens instantly across iPhone and Android devices. On Thursday evening, however, a wildfire evacuation alert went out to everyone in Los Angeles – even though it was only meant for a subset of residents. Shortly after 4 p.m. PT on Thursday, an emergency alert was sent to all iPhone and Android users in Los Angeles County instructing people to evacuate: NEW: This is an emergency message from the Los Angeles County Fire Department. An EVACUATION has been issued in your area. Remain vigilant of any threats and be ready to evacuate. Gather loved ones, pets, and supplies. Continue to monitor local weather, news, and the webpage alertla.org for more information. The alert quickly caused chaos on social media, with LA County residents questioning the legitimacy of the evacuation order. Around 20 minutes after the alert was sent, Los Angeles County took to X to say it was only meant to be sent to residents of Calabasas and Agoura Hills: An evacuation order for residents near the Kenneth Fire currently burning in West Hills was mistakenly issued Countywide. This alert was only intended for residents of Calabasas and Agoura Hills. After 22 minutes, an updated emergency alert was sent to all LA County residents: “Disregard last evacuation warning. It was for Kenneth Fire Only.” According to CBS News, the mistake was due to a “technical error.” Officials urge residents to visit the LA County website for the most up-to-date information on wildfires currently burning. This isn’t the first time a false emergency alert has caused panic. In 2018, people in Hawaii woke up to a terrifying emergency alert on their iPhones about an inbound ballistic missile threat. This alert ended up being due to a failed “drill.” Lead image via Elana Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
