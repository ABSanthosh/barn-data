  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Wheels aims to be your all-in-one digital skate journal, allowing you (presuming you’re a skater) to track all things skating. It helps track your rides, your skateboards, and offers a clean interface to manage it all. Highlights With Wheels, you can start tracking a ride with just one tap, making it incredibly simple. Once you’re in a ride, Wheels will passively track your speed and distance, giving you an overview of your travels without needing to look at your phone mid-ride. The app has a sweet dashboard for monitoring your stats, and contains graphs to compare to previous rides. It also offers a live activity, allowing you to easily keep up with your skate session from your lock screen and Dynamic Island. There’s home screen and lock screen widgets as well. On top of ride management, theres also board management, allowing you to track mileage, maintenance needs, and more across your boards. Wheels also offers weather data in its analytics, putting everything you’d need to know for your comparisons right in your fingertips. It levels up your skating journey. Inspiration The developer behind Wheels, Trevor Piltch, is a university student. He built this app between classes to solve real problems for skaters, and says this project is a passion project that bridges tech and skateboarding culture. Download Wheels Wheels is available for free on the App Store, offering the full experience with no ads. The app does offer a Tip Jar if you’d like to support!
