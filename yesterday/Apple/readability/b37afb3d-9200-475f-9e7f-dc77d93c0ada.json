  "text": "Rumors suggest that Apple has been working on a new generation of the HomePod mini, which is expected to be introduced later this year. Even so, the company didn’t want to wait and has now quietly updated the current HomePod mini. But instead of hardware improvements, Apple has changed the box of its smart speaker. HomePod mini now has a new white box As noted by Parker Ortolani, the HomePod mini is now shipping in new boxes. While the original box shows illustrations of the HomePod from the side and top, the new box now has the Apple logo on top and the stylized HomePod mini logo on the other side. However, Apple has made another intriguing change. The new box is all white, whereas previously Apple had colored boxes that matched the color of the HomePod mini. The product was introduced in space gray and white, with a different box for each color. In 2021, Apple launched new blue, yellow, and orange colors for the HomePod mini. Each color also had its own tinted box. Now the HomePod mini box matches the HomePod 2 box, which is also white regardless of which color you choose. It’s unclear why exactly Apple changed this aspect of the box, especially when there’s a new HomePod mini model planned for this year. Interestingly, this isn’t the first time Apple has changed something about the current generation HomePod mini. In July last year, Apple replaced the space gray version of the speaker with a new midnight version. The colors look almost identical, with Midnight having a slightly bluish tint. HomePod mini costs $99 in the US, while the bigger HomePod 2 costs $299.
