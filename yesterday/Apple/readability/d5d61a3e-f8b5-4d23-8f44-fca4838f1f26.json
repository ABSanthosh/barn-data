  "text": "For anyone who grew up with a Gameboy Color in hand and a love for Pokémon, the Gamebaby case brings all that nostalgia right to your iPhone. As someone who still gets excited about retro gaming, this new accessory is a game-changer (literally). With physical buttons that snap onto your phone, the Gamebaby transforms your iPhone into a retro Gameboy-like device, perfect for playing classics through the Delta emulator. Let’s dive into how this works and why it’s a must-have for retro gamers. Gamebaby specs \u0026 design The Gamebaby case is a two-piece design that consists of a two panels, one with physical buttons and the other panel for the top of your phone. The physical buttons replicate the classic Gameboy layout with a D-pad, A/B buttons, Start/Select, and even shoulder buttons for more advanced games. The case itself is slim enough to remain portable yet sturdy enough to offer solid protection for your device. The front piece is removable, allowing you to switch between gaming mode and regular phone use seamlessly. It does not require Bluetooth or cables or WiFi, its simply uses a material on the inside of the case that iPhone screens can respond to. This makes it light weight, easy to use and keeps the price low. How it works The magic really happens when you pair the Gamebaby with the Delta emulator app. By using a custom Gamebaby skin in Delta’s settings, you can map the physical buttons perfectly to your favorite Gameboy games. Whether you’re revisiting Pokémon Yellow or Zelda: Link’s Awakening, the Gamebaby brings those titles to life with authentic controls. Delta is my absolute favorite gameboy emulator for iOS. I have used it for years, even before Apple let it on its App Store, and the best part is that it is completely free. Delta allows you to load ROMs from classic consoles like Gameboy, Gameboy Color, and Gameboy Advance. With the Gamebaby case, you no longer have to rely on touchscreen controls — you get the tactile feedback that makes gaming more enjoyable. Pricing \u0026 availability The Gamebaby case is currently available for pre-order through BitmoLab’s official website. In terms of timeline they plan on releasing it in the first half of 2025. The Gamebaby currently is going through pre-orders and has early bird pricing of $24.99 with final retail pricing being $39.99. As of right now they are only offering models for the iPhone 15 Pro Max and the 16 Pro Max. I am sure as time goes they will offer it for more models! So, for $25 this case is a no brainer for anyone looking for physical buttons to add to their iPhones for GBA emulation! For those who grew up dreaming of catching Pokémon on a handheld console, the Gamebaby offers a chance to relive that experience — now on your iPhone. It’s not just a case; it’s a trip down memory lane with a modern twist! Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
