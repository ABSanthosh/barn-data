There's a lot of tech that has benefited from miniaturization and foldability over the years. I grew up familiar with the convenience of a Nintendo DS, and today people can enjoy the advantages of foldable phones. The Aurzen ZIP successfully applies this design solution to a projector that can fit in your hand, pocket, or bag. Aurzen has been making projectors since 2022, their first product being the Boom 3. I've reviewed a handful of projectors of different sizes, but the Aurzen ZIP is the smallest by a long shot. With no need to plug it into the wall or set up the remote, you can grab it out of the box, turn it on, and use it immediately. The process for connecting over AirLink is simple; you turn on the ZIP, follow the instructions to connect your device, modify your audio source, and use. This makes it very simple to connect all your mobile devices across different brands. Aurzen ZIP Projector review: View of the front, featuring the lens and Aurzen's slogan.My review unit, as an early version, did not have the dual-sided mount, HDMI dongle, or stand with a battery that's advertised in the prelaunch announcement. In theory, all of these are highly complementary accessories that would elevate the main product. A projector this small does have some inherent design drawbacks, like only having 100 ANSI lumens of brightness and a 720p image. However, there is a switch on the side to turn up the brightness on the ZIP, which also drains the battery faster. The battery, based in the lowest part of the trifold, only has 5000 mAh capacity, allowing for a claimed hour and thirty minutes of use before needing to charge through USB-C. There's volume and power buttons on the side of the top part of the trifold, and five buttons on the back for menu navigation, focusing, and keystone correction. Most of the time I didn't need to use these buttons since the ZIP automatically focuses and operates through screen extending or mirroring. Aurzen ZIP Projector review: The ZIP folded featuring the five buttons on the back.Aurzen ZIP Projector - Specs Product Detail Spec Display Technology DLP Resolution 720p Light Source LED Brightness (ANSI Lumen) 100 Focus \u0026 Keystone Auto Throw Ratio 1.09:1 Contrast Ratio 300:1 Speaker Dual 1W Connector Type-C Battery Capacity 5000 mAh Content System AirLink Mirroring Supporting Devices Android, Windows, iOS, MacOS Size 84 x 78 x 26 mm Aurzen ZIP Projector review: For reference, this is what 100 ANSI lumens look like on a wall mid-day.Aurzen ZIP Projector - UseIn my use of the ZIP, I've used it to binge shows, as a second monitor for my MacBook, and even for meetings in rooms with no large screens available. The trifold design forms a \"Z\" shape, not just as a gimmick, but as a creative choice that supports the ZIP in both landscape and portrait orientations. Each hinge has a range of ninety degrees, so you can point the ZIP at the ceiling if you feel like watching a show in bed. However, the fan can get pretty loud, so I'd recommend having noise-canceling headphones on or positioning the projector more than a few feet from your ears. Luckily, the small speakers on the ZIP tend to overpower the fan noise. Since those speakers are small, they don't push a lot of noise, so the device you use to project to the ZIP or headphones tends to be a better bet. The ZIP also automatically adjusts its picture using the automatic keystone and focusing, so you can turn it on first, and then worry about how it'll look on your projection surface later. Since projection time is only an hour and a half, portable batteries become very useful when using the ZIP to keep it alive throughout use. Any movies, TV binging, or long-term event requires wiring it up to a power source. Aurzen ZIP Projector review: Using the ZIP with my phone tripod worked very well.It's also small enough to attach to a phone tripod, which helps a lot with getting your projection set up on a wall. And for something so small, it still throws a pretty large picture, even if it's capped at 720p. This is also the only projector I've seen advertised as being great for using short-form video apps like TikTok due to its support for projecting in portrait. I've tried this on Instagram, but it's strange to use a projector for doomscrolling. The plastic body has held well over the weeks, and the moving parts don't seem to wear down the ZIP too much. Still, I wonder if it can have the same longevity as larger projectors. Aurzen ZIP Projector review: The hinges are useful for projecting on the floor or ceiling.Aurzen ZIP Projector - Very innovative, with expected drawbacksPutting a projector into a pocketable item is impressive, even if there are inherent design drawbacks. For example, a slightly bigger version could help with airflow and circulation. To reemphasize, I couldn't test with the HDMI dongle, so I have yet to see how the ZIP will work with consoles and TV boxes. If it works well, I can see the ZIP being a great entertainment gadget for traveling or for portable setups. I found the main strength of the ZIP to be a gadget that could solve creative problems. I loaned it to a friend to help them with an art project and used it to go over meeting details with groups. Despite the drawbacks, using the ZIP was still fun and interesting after my first impressions. I imagine this technology being used in-store and commercial settings for advertising, portable presentations, workshops, and more. The price is steep for something still in the experimental phase, but the potential audience that could find this useful enough to buy is there. Aurzen ZIP Projector Pros Incredibly portable Easy wireless connection Trifold design emphasizes features and stability Aurzen ZIP Projector Cons Only 100 ANSI lumens Low capacity battery Maximum 720p resolution Rating: 3.5 out of 5Where to buy the Aurzen ZIP Projector The Aurzen ZIP Projector is currently available for pre-order on the Aurzen store for $329.99 (18% discount until April 1st, 2025).
