  "description": "Macworld Hands down, the cutest charger you can get for your iPhone right now is this Ugreen Uno 2-in-1 model that will smile at you while your phone is charging. Normally $70, it’s now available for $44 at Amazon, a 37% savings and a great price for an adorable desk accessory. This tiny charger features a foldable magnetic platform that allows you to adjust the viewing angle up to 70 degrees so your phone can lie flat or at an angle to use Standby mode, check notifications, or scroll your Instagram feed while charging. Underneath the magnetic stand, you’ll find a 5W charging mat for your AirPods. But our favorite part of this charger isn’t its versatility or 15W charging speed. It’s its adorable personality: While charging, the tiny screen on the front of the Ugreen Uno displays a tiny happy face, which changes expressions as the device reaches 100 percent. So, if you want to clear up your desk of wires and have some fun with one of the most adorable charging stations we’ve ever seen, the Ugreen Uno 2-in-1 is on sale for $44 at Amazon. Just note, you’ll need to be an Amazon Prime member to get the best price. If you’re not subscribed yet, you can try the service free for 30 days and still get the lowest price. That's a massive discount for a 2-in-1 chargerBuy now at Amazon",
