Image credit: Apple Apple has dropped the price of the 2024 Major League Soccer season pass from $14.99 to free for Apple TV+ subscribers, or $9.99 for non-subscribers. As the 2024 season winds down, Apple is offering both the remaining matches as well as interviews, previous games, and other features for the remainder of the season. There has been a lot of focus on Lionel Messi's debut US season, along with other stars like Riqui Puig. Apple previously made a surprise offer to make Messi's first MLS playoff debut free on Apple TV+ for both subscribers and non-subscribers on October 25. Messi plays for Inter Miami CF, and his presence is said to have doubled subscriptions to the MLS Season Pass compared to the previous year. The usual price of the MLS season pass is $14.99 per month. It was reduced to $9.99 per month in early September for non-subscribers, in an effort to lure more sports fans to the service. The current offer will automatically renew at full price when the 2025 season kicks off, unless cancelled. Apple TV+ is available on a wide variety of platforms, including most recent-model smart TVs, along with PlayStation and Xbox, as well as Roku and the Amazon Fire Stick. It's also accessible on the web. The 2024 season still has games playing from November 1 through November 3. The last games in the 2024 season are being played on November 8 to November 10. The final matches of the season will be Columbus vs New York, and Seattle vs Houston.",
