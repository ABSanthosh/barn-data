  "text": "The second beta versions of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS Sequoia 15.3, are now available for users participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. There are also second beta versions of watchOS 11.3, tvOS 18.3 and visionOS 2.3, if you’re a developer testing software for those devices and operating systems. While the prior updates to these OS versions focused on additional Apple Intelligence features, it appears these beta versions are focused more on bug fixes and other general improvements. The exception to that is MacOS Sequoia 15.3 beta includes support for Genmoji creation on the Mac. The latest beta updates are available now with the typical software update distribution systems. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.3 Beta 2 iOS 18.3 beta 2 can be downloaded directly from the Settings app if you’re actively enrolled in the beta program: Open “Settings”, and then go to “General” Go to “Software Update” Select to update to iOS 18.3 beta 2 / iPadOS 18.3 beta 2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 2 MacOS 15.3 beta 2 is available via Software Update: Go to the  Apple menu and select “System Settings” Go to “General” and then to “Software Update” Choose “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.3 beta 2 Installation will require a reboot as is typical with installing any system software update. When will iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS Sequoia 15.3 be released for everyone? Apple typically goes through several beta versions before issuing a final version to the general public. With the second beta being available now, it’s reasonable to assume the final version of iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3, and MacOS Sequoia 15.3 could be available sometime later in January or February. The latest current stable builds of system software are presently macOS Sequoia 15.2 for Mac and iOS 18.2.1 and iPadOS 18.2.1 for iPhone and iPad.",
