Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. 16-inch M4 MacBook Pro: Same design but faster internals Apple unveiled the M4 MacBook Pro lineup in late October. Despite the same exterior design, Apple’s new laptop lineup brings a big jump in performance and efficiency thanks to the M4 chip. The M4 Pro packs a 14-core CPU and a 20-core GPU, making it twice as fast as its non-Pro sibling. It also benefits from 75% more memory bandwidth, ensuring smooth system performance even under heavy loads. Impressively, even with such significant performance gains, the M4 Pro MacBook Pro lasts up to 24 hours — a few hours more than its predecessor. If you are always on the go, there’s no better laptop to buy than the 16-inch MacBook Pro. It packs powerful internals, long battery life, and a beautiful 120Hz ProMotion display. You can even configure the screen with a nano-texture glass to reduce reflections. However, this option is only available if you order the laptop directly from Apple. As we noted in our M4 Pro MacBook Pro review, there’s no reason that you will not like this laptop. Great value for money from a premier Apple laptop In a move very unlike Apple, the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro ships with 24GB of unified memory. That’s 8GB more than the M3 Pro model came with. Despite significant performance improvements and additional memory, the M4 Pro MacBook Pro costs the same as its predecessor. That makes its $2,499 price tag a lot more attractive. But with this Amazon deal, you can save an additional $260, making it an even better buy. If you plan to run LLMs or have more demanding workloads, you should check out this additional 16-inch M4 MacBook Pro deal. Amazon slashed the price of the 48GB model by 9% to $2,629. Buy from: Amazon 16-inch MacBook Pro with M4 Pro Apple's flagship laptop packs a roomy 16-inch 120Hz display, powerful internals with 24GB memory, and all-day battery life.",
