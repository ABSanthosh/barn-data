  "text": "The “Hide My Email” feature on iPhone is incredibly useful, allowing you to create random unique email addresses that forward to your real email address inbox. This feature can help protect your privacy by allowing you to sign up for apps or services without sharing your real email address, while enhancing security from phishing attempts, and also reducing spam. Hide My Email is a very useful feature, but for some users, they may be aware of the feature but have no idea how to use it, and trying to find or access the feature is a challenge in and of itself. That’s what we’re going to address here. Accessing and Using “Hide My Email” on iPhone and iPad There are two primary ways to access and use the Hide My Email feature on iPhone or iPad. The first, which is arguably the easiest and simplest when it works as intended, is to simply use the “Sign in with Apple” feature, then choose to Hide My Email during the signup process of a new app or service from your iPhone or iPad. This is very streamlined and it’s by far the easiest, but not all apps or signups will offer the Sign in with Apple feature. The second, which requires a little digging in the Settings app, is to manually create a new “Hide My Email” address manually though the Settings app on iPhone or iPad. This is accomplished through Settings \u003e your name \u003e iCloud \u003e Hide My Email, and then going through the process of adding a new generated email address, and is a fairly straight forward way to use the Hide My Email feature in iOS and iPadOS, if you know where the setting is anyway. Searching Settings for “Hide My Email” Returns Nothing on iPhone? If you open the Settings app and use the “Search” feature, you might think that you could type in “hide my email” and find the feature in Settings this way. Searching for a feature or exact match keyword in Settings and expecting to find that particular feature or search match is not necessarily the case, however. Perhaps not being able to find some Settings by searching in the Settings app is a bug, or perhaps it is intentional, but do not rely exclusively on the Search feature to find Settings on iPhone or iPad, let alone the “Hide My Email” feature. Can’t Find Hide My Email? Paid iCloud Required If you can’t locate anything to do with “Hide My Email”, it’s important to remember that this particular feature requires a paid iCloud subscription, or what Apple calls iCloud+. Without a paid iCloud plan, Because of how important device backups are, and how laughably chintzy the free iCloud plan storage is (5GB? Come on), almost every iPhone user should be paying for iCloud if for no other reason than to be able to properly backup your device to iCloud. Where is the “Hide My Email” Settings Panel on iPhone and iPad? Open the “Settings” app on your iPhone or iPad, then tap on your name at the top of the Settings list. From there, tap on “iCloud”, then scroll down until you can select “Hide My Email” to access the ability to create a new hidden email address, or to view and manage existing Hide My Email addresses. Going directly through Settings like this is the most consistent way to use the feature, since not every signup or service will offer the Sign in with Apple method that is very streamlined but not always available. – Do you use the Hide My Email feature on your iPhone or iPad? Were you able to locate the settings and feature on your device? What do you think of this capability to hide your email address with randomly generated aliases like this?
