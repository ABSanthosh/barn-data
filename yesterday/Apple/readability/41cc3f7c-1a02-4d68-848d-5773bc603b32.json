  "text": "News The fanciest version has wood trim in both colors (white or black). Photo: Keychron The new premium Keychron K4 HE mechanical keyboard combines a 96% layout with customizable actuation for Mac power users. The new keyboard integrates Hall effect technology into the popular K4 design. That creates a versatile option for users who demand precision and customizability for both productivity and gaming. “The K4 HE is a game-changer for professionals and gamers who demand precision and flexibility in their keyboard setup,” Paul Tan, COO of Keychron, said Tuesday in a press release. “With Hall effect technology, users can now customize their typing experience like never before, ensuring every keystroke meets their exact needs.” A fancier version of the popular Keychron K4, the new K4 HE maintains the space-efficient 96% layout that has made the original K4 a favorite among Mac users. But the new keeb introduces Hall effect (HE) switches that transform the typing experience through unprecedented customization possibilities. They boast adjustable actuation points, or the distance the key must travel when pressed to register the keystroke. You can fine-tune these from an ultra-sensitive 0.2mm to a more deliberate 3.8mm in precise 0.1mm increments. For Apple ecosystem users, the keyboard offers native macOS compatibility with dedicated keycaps and function keys mapped to macOS operations. The keyboard includes multi-device Bluetooth connectivity. That’s essential for users who work across MacBooks, iMacs and iPads throughout the day. Broad connectivity and high polling rate The Keychron K4 HE mechanical keyboard’s connectivity options make it particularly valuable for Mac users with hybrid setups. The inclusion of 2.4GHz wireless with a 1000Hz polling rate ensures gaming-grade responsiveness. Bluetooth provides seamless switching between multiple Apple devices. The USB-C wired connection offers a charging solution that matches the ports on current Mac hardware. For Apple users who value aesthetics alongside functionality, the premium Narra wood edition offers a natural rosewood finish that complements the aluminum and space gray color schemes common in Apple’s design language. This luxury option provides a sophisticated alternative to the standard aluminum frame for those looking to elevate their desk setup. Keychron K4 HE mechanical keyboard pairs brings battery life and RGB backlighting Keychron optimized the new keeb’s battery life for all-day use. That helps make the K4 HE suitable for professionals who need reliable performance during long workdays on their Macs. The keyboard also includes RGB backlighting with multiple effects. And you can control them without additional software, a nice plug-and-play feature. The K4 HE bridges the gap between gaming keyboards and professional typing tools, and appears to excel at both in the Apple ecosystem. While Apple’s Magic Keyboard offers a slim profile and seamless integration, many Mac power users have turned to mechanical keyboards for a more satisfying typing experience and customization options. Keychron’s K4 HE is available now through the company’s website starting at $135 for the standard aluminum version. The premium Narra wood edition commands a slightly higher price point — another $10, at $145. The keyboard does not appear to be on Amazon yet. Buy from: Keychron",
