Apple added Visual Intelligence with iOS 18.2 and you'll need an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro to use it. Sorry, iPhone 15 Pro users. It's filed under the umbrella of Apple Intelligence features. It's one of the few Apple Intelligence features that is exclusive to the iPhone 16 family. This AI feature uses the camera on your iPhone to scan the environment and provide information. If that feels a little abstract - don't worry, we're about to show you a bunch of demos in and out of our studio to show how it can help you. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeHow to use Visual IntelligenceTo activate Visual Intelligence, you press and hold the camera control on the lower-right side of your iPhone. That compares to a short press that opens the Camera app. Your phone will vibrate as the camera opens with a sleek and colorful animation. You'll see a new interface that shows a live feed of the camera with an \"ask\" button, a \"search\" button, and a capture button in the center. Let's start with the most basic of uses. Open Visual intelligence, point it at something, and snap. Visual Intelligence can help identify cordsThen you can get information from chatGPT about what you're looking at or you can do a Google image search to learn more about it. For example, we can take a photo of all these different cables we have in the studio. Each time, Visual Intelligence is able to identify which ones they are and provide some basic information about them. You can even ask follow up questions to get more information on the cables you scannedIf you happen across a cable you don't know much about, you can ask a follow up question for more information. Like this detailed breakdown of what a DisplayPort cable can do. We also have this old GameBoy Color lying around. A quick scan with Visual Intelligence and we can ask what year it was released. Those both get you information via ChatGPT. Alternatively, you can use an image search. After scanning a DualSense controller, we got results on where to buy itWhen we scanned a Playstation 5 DualSense controller, we could see this specific colorway. We then could jump right into the Walmart app to buy it. Using Visual Intelligence with textOutside of asking questions or searching photos, it can also aid with text and numbers. Visual Intelligence can summarize or read text aloudWhen you point it at a block of text, new buttons appear that are context aware. You can either generate an AI summary or have your phone read it aloud. If you happen to be traveling and it detects text in another language, a translate button will appear. When you tap it, it snaps a photo and replaces the text on the image with your default language. Translating a restaurant menu unto EnglishWe tested it by translating a Spanish restaurant menu. It's great because there is no need to use any other apps and it worked automatically. Lastly with text and numbers is solving equations. Something that would have been great when we were still in school. Visual Intelligence can solve math problems with step-by-step resultsYou don't even need to type it in - just scan it with visual intelligence and ask it to solve it for you. It even broke down all the different steps for us in our example equation. Scanning food itemsWhile it wasn't entirely specific, Visual Intelligence also helped with gathering macros from your food. Like the other demos, we just pointed it at our plate and it identified the food and gave us rough ranges for what we were eating. It's just a rough estimate, but Visual Intelligence gave us nutrition info on our popcornWe had a small handful of popcorn and we asked Visual Intelligence how many calories it was. It told us a handful like that had a range of calories, based on the type and how it was cooked. If you combine that range with what you know of the popcorn (SmartPop, air popped, movie theater style, et cetera), you can get a decent idea of the actual value. Carb counting would be huge if more accurateSimilarly, we took a photo of a glazed donut and asked how many carbs it contained. Once more, it gave us a range of possible carbs. Features like these could be critical to certain users. Like newly-diagnosed type 1 diabetics, which are usually children, who may not be great yet at carb counting. Hopefully this gets a bit better to be more accurate as the AI models improve. Identifying plants and animalsWith iOS 18.3, Apple added some new features to Visual Intelligence. Visual Intelligence can now identify plants and animals automatically. Identifying our kitchen houseplant with Visual IntelligenceWhen we pointed it at a plant in our kitchen, a bubble appeared at the top with the plant's name as soon as it recognized it. If you tap the bubble, it shows you additional information from Wikipedia. Works with animals too, though of course if you're doing a dog, you have to have somewhat of a purebred. No AI will be able to accurately deduce a dog's pedigree just based on a photo. Our dog isn't a pure flat coat retriever, but there is a chance there is some mixed in thereOur pup, Brooklyn, was labeled a flat coat retriever. While she may have some retriever in her, she's not a purebred flat coat by any means. Other, more generic animals would likely be better suited for this. Or at least general identification. Scheduling appointmentsAlso coming in iOS 18.3 was scheduling appointments. This works with everything from marquee signs, posters, or handwritten notes. While in NYC, we could scan the front of a theater to add opening day for a show into our calendar. When back at home, we could also scan a note for date night posted by our fridge. Date night! Added to the calendar quickly with Visual IntelligenceYou do have the chance to edit the calendar appointment prior to saving it. Best of all, when you view it in the Calendar app, the source photo is also attached for reference. Restaurants and businessesOur favorite feature for Visual Intelligence though is using it with buildings, businesses, and restaurants. There's a huge array of features, depending on the business. Visual Intelligence was handy to look up monuments while we traveled in New York CityLandmarks are easily identified with Visual Intelligence. You can see their name, when constructed, and more useful facts. If you see a business, you can point your phone to get all relevant business information. It can show the store hours, website, phone number, and more. Use Visual Intelligence to get information on businessesWhen you scan a restaurant, photos of the food can be displayed, the menu, and you can place an order. Assuming the restaurant supports reservations, online food orders, and the like. Restaurants can show the hours, food photos, the menu, reviews, payment options, and even can help you schedule a reservation or place an orderWe tested it out in a small town and found we could get the hours at the local coffee shop while the pizza place let us pull up the menu and place an order for carryout. Visual Intelligence is only getting betterApple Intelligence as a whole has had a bit of a slow rollout, but Apple clearly believes in it. More and more features have been added, like what we saw here with Visual Intelligence. It's taken a little get used to, the new button and all, but once we've started using it, it's become very useful. We'll likely see more use cases emerge as Apple continues to iterate on Apple Intelligence.",
