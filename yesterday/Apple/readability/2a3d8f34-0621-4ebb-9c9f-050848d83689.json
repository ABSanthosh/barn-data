  "description": "Macworld WWDC25 kicks off in less than a week, and we’re going to get our first look at the new iOS, macOS, and watchOS features that’ll land on our devices later this year. Rumors suggest there are tons of changes in store, including a universal user interface across all Apple operating systems and a new naming scheme. But the biggest changes could be for the iPad. Ever since Apple rebranded iOS on the iPad as iPadOS, there have been a handful of exclusive tablet features each year, but this year might bring some real sweeping interface changes that bring it closer to the Mac. Here are the five most exciting features expected to arrive in iPadOS 19. A futuristic vision iPadOS 19 will reportedly pack a significant UI overhaul, offering your tablet a new look at least partially inspired by visionOS. The design refresh will likely feature translucent, glass-like elements and retire the solid buttons that have been prevalent since iPadOS arrived in 2019. We expect said redesign to spread across iOS, macOS, watchOS, and even tvOS, which will streamline Apple’s devices with a familiar, matching appearance. So, if you’re working on your Mac and iPad simultaneously, locating the same icons and menus on both devices should become simpler. And to tie it all together, Apple is also rumored to be jumping all monikers to 26 to make sure everyone knows which version they should be running. Imminent Mac-ification When power users requested proper multitasking support on the iPad, Apple pacified them with Stage Manager back in iPadOS 16. In theory, it’s a neat feature, letting you resize apps, stack windows, or place apps side by side. In practice, Stage Manager isn’t very intuitive, and most users have stuck with the more predictable Split View and Slide Over tools. For iPadOS 19, Apple is said to be working on Mac-like productivity features that elevate the existing multitasking experience on the tablet. These could include Stage Manager 2.0, a more flexible window management system that unshackles some of the current restrictions. Those with a connected Magic Keyboard may also receive a menubar on their iPad for the first time. It all sounds very exciting for iPad users and could finally move the tablet out of its iPhone shadow. iPadOS 19 will reportedly bring some important Stage Manager updates.Foundry More AI? Aye! Last year, Apple kickstarted its serious AI efforts when it released iOS and iPadOS 18.1. Those builds packed the very first batch of Apple Intelligence features, letting users generate text, summarize content, reduce interruptions with a new Focus mode, etc. Apple followed that up with subsequent AI updates, including image generation capabilities and the ChatGPT integration. While iPadOS 18.4 was initially set to introduce Siri 2.0, Apple pushed the feature to a future update, and some reports suggest Apple may have to rebuild the entire project from scratch. So, at some point during the iPadOS 19 cycle, we should expect Siri on the iPad to gain on-screen content awareness and support for advanced in-app actions. The virtual assistant should also be able to pull personal data from your calendar, notes, messages, and emails when you inquire about past events. iPadOS 19 will reportedly bake Google Gemini into the system as an alternative to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The OS will also reportedly have a feature that uses artificial intelligence to reduce energy consumption and predict how long a full battery charge will take. Elsewhere, iPadOS 19 may provide AirPods users with a live translation feature, similar to that on Google’s Pixel Buds, as well as an AI-powered health coach to guide interested users by offering lifestyle tips. And we expect a lot more AI goodies to be baked in, even if the big Siri overhaul is delayed yet another year. Thinking outside the Xbox Every couple of years, Apple promotes some AAA games on stage in an attempt to establish its devices as proper gaming platforms. While the game libraries on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV are rapidly expanding, they’re nowhere as abundant as those on PCs and consoles—and they’re definitely not taken as seriously (by gamers and developers alike). To further appeal to gamers, Apple will reportedly reveal a new gaming app for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and tvOS. The preinstalled app on iPadOS 19 could house users’ installed games, Game Center leaderboards, the Arcade storefront, and more. Whether this new strategy actually plays out remains to be seen. But if it does, the iPad could become a killer gaming device to rival Steam Deck.  Arabic calligraphy will reportedly be one of the Apple Pencil’s new tricks in iPadOS 19.Foundry Pencil it in According to rumors, iPadOS 19 and the Apple Pencil will support calligraphy designed for the Arabic script as well as cater to MENA users with a new bidirectional software keyboard. This would make it easier for certain multilingual folks to quickly switch between the Arabic and English languages and write in their native language. What about hardware? Other iPadOS 19 perks could include revamped Health, Home, and Translate apps, in addition to cross-device sync for captive Wi-Fi network login credentials. There’ll also be a slew of new accessibility tools designed for those with alternative needs. But apart from the new software, you may be wondering if WWD25 will feature any iPad-related hardware announcements. Well, the iPad, iPad mini, and iPad Air were all recently refreshed, so new iterations for these particular models are off the table. Conversely, the iPad Pro’s last upgrade occurred more than a year ago—in May 2024. While the iPad Pro M5 is reportedly in the works, it’ll likely launch towards the end of this year. It wouldn’t completely shock us if the M5 and the iPad Pro debuted at WWDC, but we’re not betting on it. But there will definitely be enough iPadOS changes to make your tablet feel like it’s new. You’ll be able to download the first iPadOS developer beta after the main WWDC25 keynote concludes on Monday, or if you’d rather wait till the stable launch, Apple will ship the finished version in mid-September.

But if it does, the iPad could become a killer gaming device to rival Steam Deck. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;wp-block-image size-large\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;wp-image-2801105\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: Macworld written in Arabic on an iPad Air\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Macworld written in Arabic on an iPad Air\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\" alt=\"Macworld written in Arabic on an iPad Air\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=300%2C200\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=768%2C512\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=1200%2C800\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=1240%2C826\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Macworld-written-in-Arabic-on-an-iPad-Air.jpg?resize=150%2C100\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eArabic calligraphy will reportedly be one of the Apple Pencil’s new tricks in iPadOS 19.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFoundry\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"pencil-it-in\"\u003ePencil it in\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAccording to rumors, iPadOS 19 and the Apple Pencil will support \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2787205/ipados-19-will-reportedly-unlock-calligraphy-support-for-apple-pencil.html\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2787205/ipados-19-will-reportedly-unlock-calligraphy-support-for-apple-pencil.html\"\u003ecalligraphy designed for the Arabic script\u003c/a\u003e as well as cater to MENA users with a new bidirectional software keyboard.

While the iPad Pro M5 is reportedly in the works, it’ll likely launch towards the end of this year. It wouldn’t completely shock us if the M5 and the iPad Pro debuted at WWDC, but we’re not betting on it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut there will definitely be enough iPadOS changes to make your tablet feel like it’s new. You’ll be able to download the first iPadOS developer beta after the main WWDC25 keynote concludes on Monday, or if you’d rather wait till the stable launch, Apple will ship the finished version in mid-September.
