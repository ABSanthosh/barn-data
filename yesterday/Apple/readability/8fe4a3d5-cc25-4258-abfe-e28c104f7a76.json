  "description": "Macworld As we head into a new year, Apple has outlined some of its plans for its Fitness+ service. The new content will kick off on Monday, January 6, and includes the following new and updated workouts: Progressive strength training: A three-week program that starts with Progressive Overload (Week One), Time Under Tension (Week Two), and finally Dynamic Power (Week Three). It’s designed to be repeated with higher weights as you build strength. Strength, Endurance, and Agility for Pickleball: For some reason, pickleball is the country’s fastest-growing sport. And this program, featuring professional pickleball champion Catherine Parenteau, is designed to up your game. Yoga Peak Poses: Similar to a one-on-one instructional session, with each highlighting a single peak pose. Introduction to Breath Meditation: Five different 10-minute meditations guiding you through different breath meditation techniques. New Time to Walk episodes: The Apple Watch Time to Walk feature gets eight new episodes, kicking off with Adam Scott on January 13 as a tie-in to the second season of Severance. Apple Fitness+ will also continue its rotating lineup of Artist Spotlight music tie-ins and special guest instructors, including choreographer Alex Wong’s dance workout. Additionally, Apple has announced a collaboration with running, cycling, and hiking app Strava. Enhanced integration means that when you share a Fitness+ workout with Strava, you’ll see rich details about it in Strava and can share it with the Strava community. Existing Strava subscribers will be able to get three months of Fitness+ for free, and Strava athletes will appear as guest trainers on Fitness+ throughout the year.",
