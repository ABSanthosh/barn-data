  "text": "News Apple TV+ goes up against tough competition. Image: Cult of Mac The Apple TV+ share of the U.S. streaming market stayed at 7% in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to an analysis. That’s the same share Apple TV+ achieved in Q4 2023, though up slightly from where it stood two years ago. Still, the service seems to have settled solidly into the “also ran” category in the battle for streaming supremacy. But it’s a role Apple itself seems comfortable with. Apple TV+ market share not growing, not shrinking Apple TV+ certainly produces hits. Its sci-fi series Silo stayed on the list of top 10 most-watched streaming series during the entire run of season two. Severance — which returns Friday — is turning into a phenomenon almost as big as Ted Lasso. And those are only some examples out of many. These successes aren’t enough to launch the service into the upper strata of the streaming market. They are keeping Apple TV+ in the game, though. As noted, Apple TV+ held 7% of the U.S. streaming market in Q4 2024, according to a report released Thursday by JustWatch. That’s down slightly from the 8% the service controlled in Q3, but there’s no change year-over-year. The top banana in U.S. streaming at the end of 2024 was Amazon Prime Video with 22% of the market, though Netflix was nipping at its heels with 21%. These two have held the top spots for years, occasionally trading places. Max hit 13% last quarter. Disney + controlled 12%, Hulu came in at 11% and Paramount+ achieved 9%. Peacock sits at a lowly 1%. Still a player in the streaming game While its 7% share falls well behind the leaders, it’s hardly a sign that Apple TV+ is down and (almost) out. Anyone who thinks that’s too small a share of the market to matter should consider it’s about how much of the PC market is made up of Mac desktops and laptops. And Apple’s been successful with those for decades. The big question isn’t the exact number of subscribers, but whether there are enough to cover the cost of producing new original content. Word came last summer that the company plans to reduce how much money it pours into Apple TV+, hopefully to make it financially sustainable long-term. A subscription to Apple TV+ costs $9.99 per month. That cost didn’t go up in 2024, unlike the prices of many rivals. At the same time, the iPhone, iPad and Mac applications used to access exclusive Apple TV+ series and films also point users to rival services. Apple takes a cut of any revenue generated by these links, but it’s a sign that the company isn’t trying to dominate the market. In contrast, it’s hard to imagine Netflix pointing its subscribers to Prime Video, or vice versa.",
