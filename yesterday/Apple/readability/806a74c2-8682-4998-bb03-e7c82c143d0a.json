It’ll have a square 7-inch display, support Apple Intelligence, and essentially serve as a command center for all things Siri and HomeKit. While this product was on track to launch this spring, numerous issues have pushed that timeline. Now, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman – it may finally launch later this year. Apple smart home hub To recap, here are some of the key rumored specs for this new smart home hub: 7-inch square display with thick bezel Camera at the top Rechargeable built in battery A new Apple operating system: homeOS Heavy focus on video applications like FaceTime Support for many Apple apps StandBy-inspired dashboard Easy ability to control your smart home Apple Intelligence support One of the biggest reasons for this product getting delayed so heavily was because of Apple’s failed AI push. The product relied heavily on Siri and App Intents, which were supposed to all come to fruition by iOS 18.4. However, because of technical challenges, that didn’t end up being the case. In fact, they’re so behind that Apple themselves announced the delay – stating that the new Siri features with Apple Intelligence will roll out “in the coming year.” Earlier this year, Apple started an internal testing program for select employees, where they could take the product home and get a feel for it. Either way, previous reports indicated that this product might not launch until 2026. If Apple can pull things together by the end of the year, that would be wonderful. Robotic device On top of the smart home hub, Apple is also planning a more advanced smart home display with a robotic arm and “unique AI personality.” However, that product has also been subject to delays. According to Gurman, this product will launch a “year or two later.” He also describes this product as a “major priority at Apple.” Though, to meet this tight timeline, Apple has apparently “pulled some bolder features” from the robotic home hub. Gurman mentions they may reappear in future hardware upgrades. No further details were given.
