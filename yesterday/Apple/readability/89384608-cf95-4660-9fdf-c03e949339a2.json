Photo: Asus In a market where premium displays often command premium prices, Asus just made waves with its new ProArt Display PA27JCV, launching at an eye-catching $799 price point. The 27-inch 5K monitor aims to challenge the status quo of high-end displays. But Mac users should weigh its advantages against its limitations. “Build quality is what you’d expect; it’s plastic, it creaks and wobbles, but the panel is super bright and crisp,” said Cult of Mac writer D. Griffin Jones, who acquired the monitor and plans to review it soon. Asus ProArt Display PA27JCV 5K monitor Aside from the relatively affordable $799 price — compare that to the $1,600 Studio Display (also 27 inches with 5K resolution) — the new display‘s standout feature is undoubtedly its 5120 x 2880 resolution, delivering 218 pixels per inch. For Mac users accustomed to Retina displays, this pixel density ensures text and images remain razor-sharp, offering 77% more workspace than traditional 4K monitors, according to Asus. Despite its budget positioning, the monitor doesn’t skimp on premium features. It boasts HDR10 support with VESA DisplayHDR 500 certification. That may not match the HDR performance of Apple’s 6K Pro Display XDR, but you can’t have everything for $800. On the plus side, Asus monitor’s LuxPixel anti-glare coating promises to reduce reflections while maintaining image clarity, a welcome feature for bright office environments. Pro-grade color performance Creative professionals will appreciate the monitor’s factory-calibrated color accuracy, with a Delta E\u003c2 rating out of the box. The display covers an impressive 99% of DCI-P3, 95% of Adobe RGB, and 100% of sRGB color spaces, matching the color standards that Mac users expect from their devices. An intelligent ASUS Light Sync system automatically adjusts brightness and color gamut based on ambient lighting conditions, similar to Apple’s True Tone technology. Top features at a glance: Calman Verified 5K display offers 99% DCI-P3, 95% Adobe RGB and factory-calibrated Delta E\u003c2 color accuracy. Asus Light Sync solution with ambient light and backlight sensors ensures reliable color performance. Built-in Auto KVM enables effortless switching between two connected laptops or PCs with a single keyboard and mouse. Connectivity options include DisplayPort over USB-C with 96-watt Power Delivery, DisplayPort, HDMI and a USB hub. Possible connectivity concerns for some However, the PA27JCV’s port selection may give some Mac users pause. With only a single HDMI 2.1 port, users needing multiple HDMI connections might find themselves constrained. The inclusion of DisplayPort over USB-C with 96-watt Power Delivery does partially compensate, offering a clean single-cable solution for MacBook users. Additional connectivity includes a standard DisplayPort 1.4 and a USB hub featuring one USB-C and three USB-A ports. At $799, the Asus ProArt Display PA27JCV represents an intriguing value proposition for Mac users seeking a 5K display without breaking the bank. While it can’t match Apple’s premium displays in every aspect, it delivers professional-grade color accuracy and sharp visuals at a fraction of the cost. The limited HDMI connectivity might be a dealbreaker for some, but the comprehensive color coverage and USB-C integration make it a worthy consideration for budget-conscious creative professionals in the Apple ecosystem. The monitor is available through B\u0026H Photo or Asus for $799. In select regions, Asus sweetens the deal by including a complimentary Adobe Creative Cloud subscription. Buy from: B\u0026H Photo",
