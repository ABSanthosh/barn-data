  "text": "With iOS 18.2, Apple has introduced a new option that lets iPhone users set third-party apps as the default for calls and messages. Now WhatsApp has finally released an update to support this API, which means that users can choose WhatsApp to be the iPhone’s default app for calls and texts. Set WhatsApp as default calling/messaging app As first noticed by WABetaInfo, the latest version of WhatsApp for iOS enables support for the option to choose default apps. When you choose a new app as your default, it is automatically used for related actions. In this case, if you tap on a phone number, the iPhone will use WhatsApp to call it instead of the iOS Phone app. Although the option to choose default iOS apps was developed as part of the changes required by the European Union, Apple ended up making the feature available to everyone. In addition to changing default apps for calls and texts, iPhone users can also choose other default apps for email, call filtering, web browser, translation, passwords, payments (only in some regions), and keyboards. In the EU, users can change the default maps app as well. The feature is now being rolled out to all WhatsApp users – not just beta users.  WhatsApp is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you update to the latest version of the app to get access to the new features.
