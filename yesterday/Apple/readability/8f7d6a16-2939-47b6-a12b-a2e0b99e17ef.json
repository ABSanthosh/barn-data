  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Pestle is a recipe manager for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. It offers a number of unique features, including the ability to easily import recipes from anywhere, meal planning features, and more. It makes every recipe easily achievable. Pestle highlights One of Pestle’s best features is the ability to easily import recipes from any website. This is noteworthy, because many recipe websites will feel cluttered and not necessarily get to the point. With Pestle’s import feature – you can get straight to the point. You can also import recipes by using the share sheet on iOS, making it super convenient to use. Another cool feature is its discover system. The app learns where you save recipes from, and suggests future ones from the same sources, keeping you in the loop with the latest ideas. Last but not least, it also has meal planning features, easily allowing you to save up to 14 days of recipes ahead of time – helping you keep your life organized. Pestle also supports iCloud Sync, keeping everything consistent across your varying Apple devices. New 2.0 update Pestle 2.0 adds two big features – TikTok support, and support for recipe notes. Using an on device AI model, Pestle is now able to save recipes from TikTok by transcribing the captions and processing it on device, and its able to do all of that in under a second. If you happen to see a cool recipe on TikTok, Pestle will now be able to save it fast and privately. It also now supports importing recipe notes from websites. Many popular recipe websites will include useful notes from the author, and now with 2.0, Pestle will capture those as well – providing even more context for what you’re cooking. And as always, it includes a number of useful bug fixes and improvements, if you happen to be an existing user. Download Pestle Pestle is available for free on the App Store for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision Pro. You’ll need to be running iOS 16.2, watchOS 10.5, visionOS 1, or macOS 13.3 and later. You can also unlock the full feature set with Pestle Pro, which is available for $2.99/month, $24.99/year, or $39.99 lifetime.
