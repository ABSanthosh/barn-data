  "text": "News MLB star Shohei Ohtani wears the upcoming Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 earbuds during batting practice. You can wear them soon. Photo: Beats After months of Apple giving teasing glimpses of PowerBeats Pro 2, the fitness-oriented wireless earbuds will launch next week, if a report from a generally reliable source turns out to be accurate. They’ll allegedly be a significant milestone for Apple: its first earbuds with built-in heart-rate monitoring. More Apple earbuds with health-related features Apple made wireless earbuds a “must-have” product with the original AirPods, and now builds on that legacy by transforming its wearables with health-related features. That started when a software upgrade in October turned AirPods Pro 2 into genuine medical-grade hearing aids. And now apparently PowerBeats Pro 2 will continue the trend. Those wearing these truly wireless headphones will be able to monitor their heart rate, according to a tip sent to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. This would save athletes from needing to wear an Apple Watch for access to this health-monitoring feature — just a pair of earbuds. Though an iPhone will surely be necessary to see the data collected. Other features coming to the next top-tier PowerBeats include “the same H2 chip as the AirPods, better noise cancellation, and new colors, including an impressive orange,” said Gurman. A collection of Apple employees regularly leak information to the Bloomberg reporter, allowing him to make frequently accurate predictions about future iPhone, Mac, iPad and accessory releases. PowerBeats Pro 2 launch date: February 2 Apple has made no secret of PowerBeats Pro 2. It dropped multiple teasers of athletes — including MLB star Shohei Ohtani — wearing them over the past few months. But Cupertino kept the technical details on the down low. The launch date also remained unknown. Until Sunday… maybe. Sources inside Apple told Bloomberg that the PowerBeats Pro 2 debut on Tuesday, February 11. The fitness-oriented wireless earbuds should cost $250. That’s the same list price as the AirPods Pro 2, though these can be picked up on sale for $169.",
