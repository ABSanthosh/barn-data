  "text": "Bloomberg has just reported that Apple is gearing up to launch the new iPhone SE 4 very soon, perhaps as soon as next week. In the same report, Mark Gurman also revealed that iPad Air and MacBook Air stocks in Apple Stores around the world have been “dwindling,” which could be a hint at more new products coming soon. Apple to launch new iPads and Macs soon Rumors about new iPads and Macs coming soon are nothing new. In fact, we’ve been hearing about updated iPad and MacBook Air models for a while now. Although it’s unclear that these products will arrive alongside the iPhone SE 4 in the coming days, Gurman says that the inventory of “iPad Air and MacBook Air has been dwindling at Apple retail stores.” Usually, a product running low on stock in Apple Stores is a strong indication that a new version is coming soon. Apple is expected to put its latest M4 chip in both the new iPad Air and MacBook Air. Other than that, no major hardware or design changes are expected for this year’s models. The company is also rumored to be working on the iPad 11, a new version of its entry-level tablet. It also won’t have any major changes apart from a faster chip, potentially the same A17 Pro as the iPad mini 7 – which will enable Apple Intelligence support on the most affordable iPad for the first time. That said, those considering buying a new iPad or MacBook should probably wait for these announcements. Also according to the report, Apple won’t be holding an event to launch the iPhone SE 4 (and perhaps the new Macs and iPads too). In recent years, the company has chosen to publish short videos introducing new devices after unveiling them on its website, so it’s likely that the same will happen again.
