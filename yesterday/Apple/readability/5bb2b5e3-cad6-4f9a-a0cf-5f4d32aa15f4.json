A four-pack of these essential Bluetooth trackers are at their all-time lowest price on Amazon and Best Buy right now. This record-low price means you can currently pick up a four-pack for $69.99 — less than $18 apiece. Don’t sleep on this deal. Best Buy’s AirTags sale ends soon, and if your order now, you can still get them in time for the holidays. AirTags make a great gift for the Apple user who has everything. Even if they already have AirTags, they can attach another one to something else.This post contains affiliate links. Cult of Mac may earn a commission when you use our links to buy items. AirTag sale: Lowest price ever at Amazon and Best Buy Attach Apple’s tracker to anything that gets misplaced frequently. If it goes missing, you can open the Find My app on your iPhone and be directed to its exact location. You can play a sound from AirTag’s tiny speaker to alert you to its location. No more wandering around the house searching. That makes the gizmo a great gift for someone who’s absent-minded. Maybe it’s your spouse, or it could be your child who’d lose their head if it wasn’t permanently attached. This AirTag sale makes it affordable to buy a bunch to hand out to friends and family members. Find anything from keys to luggage And it has another trick, too. I keep an AirTag (or a similar tracker) on my keys, my cat, my backpack … even a casserole carrier I take to parties. I very rarely lose things, but I do sometimes leave them behind. With a tracker tag attached, my iPhone alerts me that I left my casserole dish at my sister’s house before I get out of her neighborhood. AirTags are great for tracking luggage, and multiple airlines now support them. Or you can attach one to your bike. And here is why AirTags make the perfect gift for just about everyone. I go into much more detail in my review of Apple’s essential AirTag trackers. This AirTag sale knocks nearly 30% off If you lose an item outside your home, you can activate Lost Mode on your AirTag. This feature sends notifications when the AirTag is detected on the Find My network and lets you include a message with your contact information, such as your phone number or email address. AirTags are powered by regular CR2032 coin batteries, which are included and easy to pick up almost everywhere. AirTag batteries typically last about a year before needing replacement. With an IP67 rating, AirTags are water- and dust-resistant, and are pretty durable. The regular price for an AirTag four-pack is $99, but Amazon and Best Buy’s AirTag sale is 29% off. That puts the cost down to just $18 per AirTag — that’s an unusually good deal on the product. And it’ll be delivered in time for Christmas if you’re an Amazon Prime member. Or you can order online at Best Buy, and pick them up at a nearby store. Get a 4-pack from: Amazon or Best Buy If you prefer to buy just one tracker, Amazon has a single AirTag on sale for $24 (5% off), and Best Buy is selling single AirTags for $24.99 ($4 off). Get one from: Amazon or Best Buy We originally published this AirTag sale post on December 20, 2023. We updated the pricing.",
