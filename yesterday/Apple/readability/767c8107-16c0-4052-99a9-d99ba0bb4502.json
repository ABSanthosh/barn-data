  "text": "Don’t use Apple Intelligence? Don’t care to have Apple Intelligence write your emails for you or instantly create a business plan or any of the handy writing and summary tools? Whether you’re on an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, if you recently updated to the latest versions of system software, then you’ll find that Apple Intelligence is enabled by default. That might be great for people who use the Apple Intelligence features, but if you don’t, or don’t care for the AI tools, you might care less for the potential and more for some additional storage on your device. If you’re not an Apple Intelligence user, you can recover 7GB of storage on iPhone, iPad, or Mac by simply disabling the feature. How to Recover 7GB Storage and Disable Apple Intelligence on iPhone \u0026 iPad Open the “Settings” app on iPhone or iPad, then go to “Apple Intelligence” Toggle the setting OFF to disable the feature, this will delete the Apple Intelligence assets from the device and recover 7GB of storage space on iPhone or iPad How to Recover 7GB Storage and Disable Apple Intelligence on Mac Open the “System Settings” app from the  APPLE menu, then select “Apple Intelligence” Toggle the setting OFF to disable Apple Intelligence, which will then delete the related assets and models freeing up 7GB of storage space Again, if you use Apple Intelligence, you won’t want to do this, since obviously turning the feature off on your device will disable it and prevent you from using the writing tools, summarization features, and generating features, but if you have no interest in artificial intelligence or Apple Intelligence, or perhaps you don’t care for Apple’s implementation of it, you might as well save some disk space. You can always use ChatGPT or another AI app that has a much smaller storage footprint as well, or simply use an AI tool on the web to take up virtually no space in comparison. Heads up to MacRumors for noticing this little trick via Apple’s support page.",
