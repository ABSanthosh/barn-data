The latest in an occasional AppleInsider series, exploring the world of Apple-related crime. Left-behind AirPods, and iPhone, catch Ferrari thief A car thief in Connecticut stole a $575,000 Ferrari, but was caught after the owner left a pair of AirPods in the car, which police tracked to a gas station. According to WFSB, one of the thieves then fled the car, but left behind his iPhone. A 22-year-old man was arrested and charged with larceny of a motor vehicle. Six sought for \"sudden group theft\" at Ontario Apple Store Police in Halton, Ont., are seeking six people who wore masks while they committed a \"sudden group theft\" of Apple products at the Mapleview Shopping Centre Apple Store on October 3. According to Inside Halton, the suspects took iPhones and iPads, grabbing them off of shelves and tables. A man in Utah who had $6,500 tools stolen from his work truck found them — and a lot more — by following an AirTag. According to KSL, Mark Cox followed the AirTag to a residence, demanding the tools back. The \"kid\" claimed not to know what he was talking about, and when Cox threatened to call the police, the tools were returned. But that wasn't the end. Police, who knew that house well, received a warrant and recovered more stolen merchandise. One 26-year-old man was arrested on several counts of possession of stolen property, but the investigation remains open. Woman chased iPhone thief in London An 18-year-old American woman in London had her iPhone stolen and chased the thief \"for one mile in my Prada boots\" in London's Soho neighborhood. During the chase, she ran into a group of police officers, who apprehended the man. According to Yahoo News, Ariana Roy posted about the chase to TikTok. The thief was later found guilty and sentenced to 11 weeks in jail. Tourist has iPhone, Rolex stolen back to back A British tourist vacationing on the island of Mallorca had his iPhone stolen and then his diamond Rolex taken minutes later. According to Metro, the two unrelated thefts occurred after the man left a bar in the Mediterranean city of Palma.

FBI still hasn't unlocked Eric Adams' phone, prosecutors say In November of 2023, nearly a year before he was indicted on corruption charges, New York Mayor Eric Adams had numerous devices, including two iPhones and an iPad. In early October, after the indictments, The New York Post reported that the FBI has still not been able to get into the mayor's personal phone. Per the newspaper, one of the prosecutors in the case said in a court hearing that the inability to crack the phone is a \"significant wild card\"in the case. That phone was handed over to investigators the day after the November 2023 raid, but Adams claimed that he had changed the passcode and had forgotten the new one. New Hampshire \"porch pirate\" caught on camera A New Hampshire man who ordered the new iPhone 16 Pro Max had the delivery stolen off his porch and caught the theft on his Ring camera. According to WMUR, police said they are \"trying to figure out how thieves know when iPhones are being delivered.\" Man in Florida accused of selling stolen iPhone to Walmart kiosk A 44-year-old man in Marion County, Fla., is accused of selling a stolen iPhone to an ecoATM kiosk at a Walmart.

A subsequent check found that the man claimed he had owned the iPhone since September 2023 and provided his thumbprint. The man was charged with grand theft over $300 but less than $5,000 and dealing in stolen property and is scheduled for a court appearance at the end of October. iPhone porch theft scheme busted in Oklahoma Police from Oklahoma City and nearby Edmond busted members of a \"porch pirate\" ring that stole nearly $7 million worth of electronics in a sting operation. According to OKC Fox, the two suspects arrested are part of a national porch pirate ring.
