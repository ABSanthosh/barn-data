  "text": "News And you thought your backyard shenanigans already annoyed the neighbors. Photo: Nebula The advanced new Nebula X1 4K smart projector features triple-laser light projection and the first liquid-cooling system in the industry, Nebula said Wednesday. Calling it “the ultimate backyard projector,” the Anker subsidiary hopes the device will revolutionize backyard entertainment with innovative features and easy setup. Nebula X1 Smart Projector with industry-first liquid cooling system As Nebula’s most advanced system, the new Nebula X1 Smart Projector builds upon the previous Cosmos series with significant technological advancements aimed at delivering an exceptional cinematic experience beyond what many projectors can do, the company said. Easy setup with intelligent adaptation Whether you’re setting up in the backyard or on glamping trip, Nebula X1 brings the entertainment.Photo: Nebula Nebula X1 Smart Projector introduces an innovative auto-setup system powered by a built-in micro gimbal that allows the projector to tilt up to 25 degrees, finding the optimal placement regardless of surface. That mechanical flexibility, combined with the device’s optical zoom capabilities, enables projection on screens up to 200 inches in size from distances between 13 and 22 feet. Nebula X1’s AI Spatial Adaptation technology handles everything from real-time autofocus and keystone correction to obstacle avoidance, screen fit, optical zoom adjustment and even ambient light compensation. And you can activate all of them with a single button press on a remote control. The system also includes an eye guard feature that protects users if someone walks in front of the projector beam. Professional-grade display technology With its triple-laser light engine delivering 3,500 ANSI Lumens and 4K Ultra HD resolution, the X1 offers exceptional brightness suitable for both daytime and nighttime outdoor viewing on displays up to 300 inches. The projector boasts both ISF and TÜV display certification, validating its professional-grade image quality. The X1 employs Dolby Vision technology to optimize overall image quality. And the proprietary NebulaMaster Image Processing Engine ensures natural-looking images with accurate colors through its RGB laser system. This sophisticated processing allows for a 5000:1 native contrast ratio and an impressive 56,000:1 dynamic contrast ratio. That provides rich detail in both bright and dark areas, Nebula said. Unlike many competitors that use plastic lenses prone to yellowing and deformation, the X1 features a premium 14-element glass lens array that maintains clarity and prevents degradation over time. Immersive audio experience An accessory pack sold separately provides microphones, satellite speakers and more. Hello, karaoke!Photo: Nebula Understanding that sound is crucial to the viewing experience, Nebula equipped the X1 with four internal speakers (two 15-watt drivers and two 5W tweeters) along with dual passive radiators. And for even more immersive experience, Nebula offers optional wireless satellite speakers. They transform the system into a powerful 4.1.2 audio setup with 160W of combined output. Each wireless satellite speaker contains multiple drivers and provides up to 8 hours of battery life with IP54 dust and water resistance rating, making them suitable for outdoor use. When satellite speakers are connected, the X1’s internal speakers automatically switch to subwoofer mode, enhancing the bass response. Revolutionary cooling and practical design Perhaps the most innovative feature of Nebula X1 Smart Projector is its industry-first liquid cooling system, similar to high-end desktop computers. This approach improves heat dissipation by 15 percent while reducing the projector’s footprint by 30 percent compared to fan-only models. The cooling system operates at just 26dB (measured at 1 meter), about as loud as a whisper. The projector also features a retractable handle that rises with a single push and stows away when not needed. That makes it easy to carry around. Running on the Google TV platform with built-in Netflix integration, the X1 provides access to over 700,000 movies and TV episodes across more than 10,000 apps. For additional connectivity, it offers dual HDMI ports, including one with eARC compatibility for external devices like gaming consoles or Blu-ray players. Pricing and availability The Nebula X1 Smart Projector will be available for purchase starting May 21 for $2,999 on seenebula.com and Amazon. A “backyard accessory pack” including two wireless satellite speakers, a carrying case and two wireless microphones will cost $999, or you can get it bundled with the X1 for a total of $3,298 through June 20.",
