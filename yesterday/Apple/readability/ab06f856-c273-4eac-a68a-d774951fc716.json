  "text": "Code in the latest iOS 18.3 developer beta indicates that Apple is working on an entirely new system application, one dedicated to event scheduling. Here's what we know about it. On Tuesday, Apple released the second developer beta of iOS 18.3. While the update itself didn't introduce any noteworthy features, it appears the software contains references to an as-of-yet unreleased internal application. Originally discovered by 9to5mac, the app is known as \"Invites.\" The website claims it originally found evidence of this app in an iOS 18.2 beta, but that all references to it were removed with the release version of iOS 18.2. Now, the \"Invites\" app has apparently resurfaced with Tuesday's iOS 18.3 developer beta. The app is likely to offer similar functionality to the existing Calendar application, which received a substantial upgrade in 2024 with the launch of iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia. The new and improved Calendar now lets you schedule reminders from within the application. It appears as though Apple has plans to continue its improvements to Calendar-related features through the unreleased \"Invites\" app. The new built-in reminders system in Calendar makes task management easier\"Invites\" could offer a new way of scheduling and organizing meetings or in-person events, as the application is said to be compatible with iCloud, which lets users sync their data across multiple Apple-branded devices. There are seemingly no details as to which new features the app contains, though, but we know that it communicates with a previously unused daemon in iOS 18 — GroupKit. While it's tough to say exactly what the app will be able to do, Apple may want to make the meeting scheduling process more intuitive with it. With iOS 18, you can schedule reminders from two separate applications, and a new \"Invites\" app could mean the same thing for meetings and events. Given the name, it's likely that the \"Invites\" app will feature a clean user interface dedicated solely to events, meetings, and invitations. This means that \"Invites\" has the potential to feature an overview of a user's scheduled events, along with a list of invitees who confirmed their attendance. Apple may even offer integration with Apple Intelligence, letting users add so-called Genmoji to invitations. This is all hypothetical, though, assuming the app ever sees the light of day. Apple often changes in-development applications ahead of launch, as features get modified or scrapped entirely. In 2024, for instance, Apple renamed its Web Eraser feature for Safari to the less-threatening Distraction Control, after receiving complaints from multiple publishing associations. It remains to be seen whether or not the unannounced \"Invites\" application will even receive a full release, but until then, the iOS Calendar app or third-party solutions will have to suffice for all event-scheduling needs. iOS 18.3 is still early in its beta testing phase, so there's a chance the app could debut in the coming months, though this seems unlikely.",
