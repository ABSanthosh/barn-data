  "text": "NewsTop Stories It's not like it's going to get any less weird, right? Photo: Apple TV+ Watching the new Severance season two trailer, below, my excitement for the new episodes became one with my grim determination to watch the entire first season again before the undoubtedly bizarre new scenes of workplace hell start streaming on January 17, 2025. Never before have I force-marched myself through a whole TV series season as a matter of preparation. But this funny-yet-unnerving workplace psycho-thriller deserves and demands it. Severance season 2 trailer scales new heights of workplace weirdness “Their work will be remembered as one of the greatest moments in this planet,” intones the voiceover at the start of the new season trailer. And later we see an unfamiliar man saying the line. He looks like an Amish farmer from the late 1800s who somehow stumbled into a corporate conference room, so he’s probably from Lumon Industries HQ on planet WTF. And he’s probably talking about our friends in the sinister company’s Macro Data Refinement department on the Severed Floor. That’s where employees have separate work (“innie”) and non-work (“outie”) consciousnesses, thanks to the supposedly voluntary Severance brain surgery. Apple TV+ press materials for the trailer get in on the fun, referring to the “unsevered minds” of director and executive producer Ben Stiller and creator, writer and executive producer Dan Erickson. And they riff on a bizarre-o corporate Patricia Arquette line from season one: “A virtual handshake is available upon request.” This trailer follows an earlier teaser trailer. Season 2 picks right up on the weirdness What, the Macro Data Refinement crew takes an offsite meeting in Russia? This Apple TV+ image makes it look that way.Photo: Apple TV+ The show’s season two trailer packs in plenty of action, showing the four main Lumon-employee characters urgently trying to figure out why they’re “heroes” rather than goats after their decidedly disobedient behavior in season one. And speaking of goats, yes, they’re back. If you watch the show, you probably remember the goats. “What you all did is one of the most painful moments in the history of this company,” says manager Mr. Milchik, gravely. “But the four of you have become what’s known as the face of Severance reform,” he adds, breaking into a playful grin as he hands over a heavily redacted newspaper page showing the headline, “Innies Blow the Whistle.” But of course that just freaks out our heroes. They urgently compare notes on their season one escape efforts. And they plot anew. Here’s the more-or-less unhelpful show and season description from Apple TV+: In Severance, Mark Scout (Scott) leads a team at Lumon Industries, whose employees have undergone a severance procedure, which surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Mark finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. In season two, Mark and his friends learn the dire consequences of trifling with the severance barrier, leading them further down a path of woe. Watch the Severance season 2 trailer: Accomplished management and employees cast The Emmy and Peabody Award-winning workplace thriller comes from executive producer and director Ben Stiller, creator and executive producer Dan Erickson and Fifth Season studio. It stars Emmy Award nominee Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Tramell Tillman, Zach Cherry, Jen Tullock, Michael Chernus, Dichen Lachman, Emmy Award winner John Turturro, Academy Award winner Christopher Walken, and Academy and Emmy Award winner Patricia Arquette. New series regulars Sarah Bock and Ólafur Darri Ólafsson appear in the second season. Stiller executive produces and directs five episodes this season. Other directors:  Uta Briesewitz, Sam Donovan and Jessica Lee Gagné. Season two executive producers also include John Lesher, Jackie Cohn, Mark Friedman, Beau Willimon, Jordan Tappis, Donovan, Caroline Baron, Richard Schwartz, Nicholas Weinstock. And in addition to starring, Scott and Arquette serve as executive producers. Other achievement awards Severance season one received acclaim from fans and critics alike. It boasts a 97% critics’ Fresh rating (and 88% viewer rating) on Rottentomatoes.com. The AFI Awards winner landed 14 Emmy Award nominations, including Outstanding Drama Series, Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series (Stiller), Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series (Scott) and Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. It also won these awards: Oscars for Outstanding Music Composition for a Series and Outstanding Main Title Design Writers Guild of America Awards for Best New Series and Best Drama Series The series also received award nominations from the Screen Actors Guild, Producers Guild and Directors Guild.
