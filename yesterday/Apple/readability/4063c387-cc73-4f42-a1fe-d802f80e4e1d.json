  "description": "Macworld Most of the gadgets we buy don’t come with power adapters anymore, so, it’s particularly great when we find awesome deals, especially when it’s one made by Apple: The compact dual-USB-C port power adapter is down to $39 right now, an impressive $20 discount from its $59 MSRP and the best price we’ve seen. This 35W power adapter has Apple’s well-known sleek design and foldable prongs, which means it’s fantastic when traveling too. It has enough juice to charge a MacBook Air, iPad, or iPhone, so you won’t have a need to carry anything else. The charger doesn’t come with a cable, however, so you’re going to have to get one of those separately. Like this two-pack of 6.6-foot cables from Iniu for under $10, 38 percent off. These cables can reach a max charging of 240W, so you’ll be able to use them with higher chargers too. The cables are also built to resist plenty of bending due to their braided design. So, go grab the 35W Apple charger and a two-pack of USB-C cables for less than $50.
