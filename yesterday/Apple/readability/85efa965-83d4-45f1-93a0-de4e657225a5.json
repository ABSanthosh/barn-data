  "text": "The second beta versions of iOS 18.2, MacOS Sequoia 15.2, and iPadOS 18.2 are now available for users participating in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. The new betas continue to focus on additional Apple Intelligence features, expanding beyond the writing tools, smart replies, and summary features what was initially introduced in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1. The latest betas add additional AI features like ChatGPT integration, Genmoji for custom Emoji, Image Playground for image generation, and more. Non-AI features include some refinements to Settings app, Personal Hotspot support when using iPhone Mirroring, a new Find My sharing feature, and the Mac gains an optional weather widget for the menu bar. How to Install iOS 18.2 beta 2 and/or iPadOS 18.2 beta 2 Installing the latest beta is simple: Open “Settings” and then to “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.2 or iPadOS 18.2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 beta 2 Updating the latest Mac beta is simple: From the  Apple menu, choose “System Settings” Go to “General”, then “Software Update” Choose “Update Now” to install the latest beta of MacOS Sequoia 15.2 When will iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 be released? Apple usually goes through several beta versions of system software before releasing a final version, suggesting the final release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 is still quite a ways out. It’s likely that the system software updates will be released before the end of the year, which is in line with Bloomberg reports that Apple is aiming for a December timeline.",
