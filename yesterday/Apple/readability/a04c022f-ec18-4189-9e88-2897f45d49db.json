  "description": "Macworld There’s no question that AirPods Pro 2 are the best earbuds Apple makes, and they keep getting better with awesome new capabilities such as the Hearing Aid and Hearing Protection features added in iOS 18.1. They’re frequently on sale, and we always say they’re worth paying a little extra for if you can afford it. But the latest sale on Amazon’s U.S. store is so good you don’t really have a decision to make. It’s not uncommon to find these earbuds on sale for less than $200, but the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are currently $154, which is the lowest price we’ve ever seen. They’re actually less expensive than the AirPods 4 with ANC right now and bring a ton of additional features, including the aforementioned hearing aid capabilities. Yes, the unquestionably superior product costs the same. While you’re grabbing this deal, you might want to pick up a set of Comply foam ear tips as well. They greatly improve the fit and comfort of AirPods Pro 2 and I never use mine without them. In our review of AirPods Pro 2, we praised the audio quality and features, with 2X noise cancellation and Precision Find My. And they’ve only gotten better since then with a steady stream of updates—and we suspect even more are on the way as Apple Intelligence continues to grow. So go grab a pair for this insanely low price and get yourself a pair of earbuds that keep on giving. Buy AirPods Pro 2 for $95 off at Amazon",
