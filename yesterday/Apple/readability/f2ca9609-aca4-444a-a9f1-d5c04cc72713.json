  "description": "Macworld As people start to use the OS 26 betas that Apple released at WWDC last week, people are finding unannounced features that are nice little additions. The latest was first pointed out on X by Sankew06, who discovered that iOS 26 offered to autofill a verification code sent to their Gmail app. Even though Sankew06’s post shows a screenshot displaying a code sent to the Gmail app, the system seemingly works with any non-Apple email and messaging app, including WhatsApp. Foundry In iOS 18 and earlier, the autofill function only works with Apple’s Mail and Messages apps. If you’re using a non-Apple email app, for example, you have to navigate to the app, open it, find the message with the code, open it, copy the code, navigate back to the app asking for it, and then paste it in manually. So, if you don’t use Apple’s apps, life will get a lot easier with iOS 26. Last week, a similar feature in macOS 26 was discovered, where verification code autofill works in Google Chrome. Currently, verification codes only work with Apple’s Safari browser. Why the change of heart from Apple? Perhaps the company has decided to respond to the feature request by developers and users. Or perhaps Apple’s recent orders from the European Union to open up its interoperability have caused the company to take more proactive measures. Whatever the reason, users benefit. We’re certainly not going to complain.",
