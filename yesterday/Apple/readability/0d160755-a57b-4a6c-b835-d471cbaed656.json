  "text": "One of Apple's top executives has called the delay of the new, more personalized Siri \"ugly and embarrassing\" and vows to \"ship the world's greatest virtual assistant\" at some point. Apple has been facing significant challenges in deploying one of its most highly advertised Apple Intelligence features: an enhanced, personalized Siri. The company had heavily promoted it at both WWDC and the September iPhone event. And it still airs most of the commercials that reference it. However, it didn't show up at launch. But, as we've learned, the feature is facing some serious hang-ups. While it was initially expected to roll out in iOS 18.4, it looks like it may not be coming until iOS 19. If it even shows up then. While Apple's been slammed by the media for the delay, the company isn't exactly going easy on itself either. Robby Walker, Apple's senior director of Siri and Information Intelligence, called an all-hands-on-deck meeting to address the issue, as sources told Bloomberg. Walker doesn't have a concrete time frame for when the enhanced Siri will finally launch. The company may be aiming for iOS 19, but the senior director has his doubts. \"We have other commitments across Apple to other projects,\" Walker reportedly said, citing new software and hardware initiatives. \"We want to keep our commitments to those, and we understand those are now potentially more timeline-urgent than the features that have been deferred.\" As it turns out, the enhanced Siri was delayed because the company found that it only works properly about two-thirds of the time. He urged the team to make more progress so that when the feature finally debuts, it will meet customer expectations. He believes that there is enough personal accountability to go around, referencing both his boss, head of AI John Giannandrea, and software chief Craig Federighi. However, it doesn't seem like anyone's getting fired just yet. Walker told staff they should feel proud for getting as much done as they had. He commended them for pouring their \"hearts and souls into this thing.\" At the same time, he allegedly seemed to think it was unfair that Apple heavily promoted a feature that wasn't ready. He showed examples of the technology working during the meeting to underscore just how much progress they'd made. Many team members are feeling burnt out, and Walker says that his team is entitled to some time away to recharge before diving back into the project. Regarding the delay, Walker reminds staff that Apple holds itself to a higher standard. He points out that Apple's competitors have launched virtual assistants in worse states. That wouldn't be good enough for Apple. Walker ended the meeting by saying Apple would \"ship the world's greatest virtual assistant.\" What he considers that to be is unclear, and not disclosed in Friday's report. Apple has faced myriad challenges during its artificial intelligence push. Not only did Apple arrive relatively late to the game, but it also released features at a glacial pace. It's hardly an ideal situation for a company that insists Apple Intelligence will bolster lackluster post-pandemic sales. In fact, poor performance could wind up doing the opposite. Poor Siri has taken the brunt of the criticism, as it has for the better part of a decade. Delays aside, it's also unfortunate that Siri is getting notably worse than it used to be.",
