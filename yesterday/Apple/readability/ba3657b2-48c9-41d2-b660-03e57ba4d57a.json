  "text": "After rolling out Tap to Pay on iPhone to users in the United Arab Emirates and Chile, Apple today also introduced Apple Pay in Egypt. The news was confirmed by Apple and comes after the company expanded its payment platform to Uruguay last week. Apple’s website in Egypt was updated on Tuesday with mentions of Apple Pay. The company also told the local press that Apple Pay is being launched in the country with three partner banks: National Bank of Egypt, Banque Misr, and the Commercial International Bank (CIB). According to a report from Egypt Today, more Egyptian banks will begin rolling out Apple Pay support to their customers “in the coming weeks.” With Apple Pay, iPhone and Apple Watch users can pay contactlessly in stores. All they need to do is register their supported credit and debit cards in the Apple Wallet app. At the same time, Apple Pay also works with some apps and websites, so customers can easily check out with just a few taps. Apple Pay on the web is also available for the Mac and iPad. Apple Pay is currently available in more than 80 countries around the world. In November, Apple had already expanded the platform to banks in Paraguay.
