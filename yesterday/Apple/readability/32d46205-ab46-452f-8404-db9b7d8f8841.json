  "description": "Macworld As is tradition, Apple released beta versions of its new operating systems to developers on the first day of WWDC on June 9. Beta 1 is for developers only–the public beta will begin in July, probably after two or three developer-only betas. Updated June 13: Apple updated beta 1 for developers today, though the version number has only changed the last letter (from 23A5260n to 23A5260u). This is still “beta 1” and there are likely no new features, just a critical bug or security flaw fixed. What’s in the latest beta The first beta release of iOS 26 has everything Apple demonstrated in its WWDC keynote: Liquid Glass, the new Phone app and features, the new Camera and Photos experience, and more. You can read all about all the new features in our iOS 26 superguide. There are plenty of bugs and unrefined areas, as you would expect with the first beta release of a major new operating system update. Not everything is working as it should, and it is not advised to run this version of the OS unless you’re a developer or have a high tolerance for buggy or unoptimized software. iOS 26: How to install the public beta The public beta is not yet available, but is expected to begin in July. If you want to be among the first to test iOS 26, you can sign up for the public beta test. Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. iOS 26: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. You don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta, a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 26 superguide.",
