Starting from July 24, Disney Plus subscribers can enter the \"Containment Room\" environment, reports ABC News. Set aboard the USCSS Maginot, it will contain interactive elements, expanding the show's universe and providing an appropriate place for users to be while they watch the premiere. Along with the show, Apple Vision Pro owners will also be able to enjoy more content using their headset. Digital extras including panoramic super-resolution set images will be available, as well as Spatial Photos and a companion podcast. The Disney+ app was one of the first available third-party apps that was optimized for the Apple Vision Pro at the device's launch. Since then, the app has expanded its use of the hardware, including adding new immersive environments and even a story from Marvel's \"What If?\" franchise.",
