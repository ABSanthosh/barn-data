Apple already has a number of satellite-based services for communications when you're using an iPhone in a dead zone. Newer models of the iPhone have Emergency SOS via Satellite and Roadside Assistance via Satellite, as well as the ability to use Messages via Satellite. While the Apple Watch doesn't offer satellite-based functionality at the moment, the next update to the Apple Watch Ultra could add Messages via Satellite. According to sources of Bloomberg, there are plans to include the feature in the Apple Watch Ultra 3 in 2025. Under the plan, the Apple Watch Ultra will enable users to send messages while out of cellular and Wi-Fi range. This can be especially useful for Apple Watch Ultra users, who may use the rugged smartwatch while deep off-grid or at sea, and out of 5G range. It's likely that, especially in some more hazardous pursuits, users may not necessarily have their iPhone with them. Having the feature on the Apple Watch could lead to more people leaving their iPhones at home base, instead of risking damage just to maintain communications. Adding the feature would also make the Apple Watch Ultra the first major smartwatch to offer satellite communications. The sources also say that the long-rumored blood pressure monitoring feature could finally arrive in 2025. However, along with glucose sensors, it's a feature that has been delayed in the past. There were rumors that blood pressure could land in 2024, but the Apple Watch Series 10 arrived without it. Reports claimed the feature hadn't worked reliably enough for a public release, even when it's limited to just detecting hypertension.",
