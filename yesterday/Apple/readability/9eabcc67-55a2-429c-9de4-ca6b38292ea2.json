  "text": "News So your OS names are going to seem to leap forward to 26 soon. Photo: Rajesh Pandey/Cult of Mac Apple may switch all OS version numbers to years and roll out the name changes at WWDC25 on June 9, according to a new report. The iPhone giant will reportedly move from version numbers to a year-based system that will bring consistency across all its products for the first time. Starting with releases expected around September 2025, Apple will rebrand its software names using “26” designations — iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26 and visionOS 26 — according to sources familiar with the plans who requested anonymity, according to Bloomberg. So the much-anticipated new iOS 19 might come out as iOS 26. Apple declined to comment on the rumored plans. Why Apple will make the switch The current naming system has created confusion among users and developers, with different operating systems using disparate version numbers that don’t align. For example, the most recent releases include iOS 18, watchOS 12, macOS 15, and visionOS 2 — numbers that reflect when each platform first launched rather than their current generation. By adopting year-based naming, Apple aims to create a more cohesive brand experience that makes it easier for users to understand which software versions work together across their devices. The company is also planning fresh user interfaces across all platforms under an internal project called “Solarium,” designed to ensure a more consistent experience when switching between iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV and Vision Pro. Following industry precedents Apple’s approach mirrors strategies used by other major technology companies, Bloomberg said. Samsung switched to year-based naming for its Galaxy S smartphone line in 2020, jumping from the Galaxy S10 to Galaxy S20. Microsoft pioneered this approach in the 1990s with Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows 2000. However, Apple plans to use the upcoming year rather than the current one — similar to how automakers market next year’s car models. This means software launching in September 2025 will carry the 2026 designation, with subsequent releases expected to use “27” branding. Major feature updates coming Beyond the naming changes, Apple is planning significant functionality improvements. The iPad will receive a more Mac-like experience to enhance productivity capabilities, while the company opens its AI models to third-party developers for the first time. New features include live translation for AirPods and Siri, eye-scrolling controls for Vision Pro, AI-powered health features, intelligent battery management, bidirectional Arabic-English keyboards and a digital calligraphy tool for Apple Pencil users. Apple previously experimented with year-based naming for its iWork and iLife software suites in 2007, though that system was eventually discontinued.",
