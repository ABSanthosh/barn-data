It's 2025 and you can't throw a mechanical switch without hitting a new keyboard manufacturer, and the options are nearly unlimited. Ranging from large to small, lightweight to heavy, and boasting a staggering array of bells and whistles, consumers are spoiled for choice. Companies compete for the attention and dollars of consumers by producing excellent keyboards. While many have become recognized brands around the world, Keychron continues to stand out as a company determined to overwhelm consumers with options. The Keychron K15 Max is one of the latest releases, and has undergone an extended test drive, auditioning for a permanent position in my workspace. Keychron K15 Max review: Inside the boxThe K15 is a 75-percent low-profile mechanical keyboard with an Alice layout. Connectivity includes a 2.4 GHz dongle, and wired connections. Keychron K15 Max review - The boxThe keyboard ships in a black box with a metallic logo. The keyboard and accessories are packaged in heavy foam cutouts for maximum travel safety. Inside the box: K15 Max keyboard Quick start guide USB-A to USB-C cable Extension Adapter USB 2.4 GHz dongle Hex driver Keycap and puller tool Extra keycaps (for Mac or Windows configurations) PCB Stabilizers ManualKeychron K15 Max review: Build QualityThe K15 is a 75 percent low-profile mechanical keyboard with a metal case. Even at the reduced size, the weight is noticeable. Like with all Keychron keyboards, the K15 is beefy and incredibly study. There is nothing about the keyboard, switches, cables, or tools that conveys cutting corners on materials or construction. Keychron K15 Max review - The knob and macro keysKeychron only offers the K15 in black, and this feels like a missed opportunity. With the wide variety of color options across other Keychron keyboards, it's surprising to review one that does not offer black or white options at a minimum. The K15 ships with low-profile Gateron MX 2.0 Magnetic Nebula switches as standard, and these are the only switches available for the K15 on the Keychron website. The back of the keyboard features a single USB-C port for charging the internal battery or using the keyboard in wired mode. Keychron K15 Max review - Rear selection switchesThere are two switches on the back left side of the keyboard. One switch allows you to switch between Bluetooth and cable connection types, while a second switch toggles between default Mac and Windows configurations. Keychron K15 Max review: CustomizationThe K15 offers Keychron's low-profile double-shot PBT keycaps. There are three colors for switch options: Red, Blue, and Brown. Red refers to the linear switches, while the Brown and Blue variants refer to \"Tactile\" and \"Clicky\" profiles. Your choice of switch depends on how you want your typing experience to feel and to sound. Keychron also offers three variations for backlighting on the K15: White, RGB, and RGB (Hot-swappable). Keychron K15 Max review - RGB is available, and customizableThe lights are bright and clean, making their use a pleasant experience. At least, compared to some manufacturers' keyboard backlighting, which radiates enough light to illuminate a small town. There's also the Keychron Launcher, a web-based tool that allows you to change everything from key-mapping to the internal RGB lights. It's also where you set up custom macros. The Keychron Launcher requires you to connect the K15 to your computer with the provided USB-C cable for customizations. Once set up and configured, you can return to the freedom of wireless use. Previous versions of the Keychron Launcher did not play well with Mac and several browsers at all. The latest version of the Keychron Launcher works very well with macOS and browsers. It is nice to see a manufacturer address quality of life issues and take steps to make their products work across multiple platforms. Keychron K15 Max review: In useThe K15 was used for 10 days prior to writing this review, and it was a challenging experience. This is primarily due to the use of an Alice style layout which divides the keyboard in half, separates them, and angles them inward. This is not my daily use style of keyboard, and I admit that I struggled against many years of muscle memory. I am a quick typist on any given day, and I use key commands for Adobe apps and the Mac OS as second nature. The moments where I reached for letters without looking, or allowed my hand to autopilot key combos in rapid succession only to miss the right keys, were a hassle. Keychron K15 Max review - Alice layout can take time to master. This is not the keyboard's fault. It is simply years of muscle memory becoming an obstacle that could be overcome with time. I love low-profile keyboards, and the K15 is one of the quietest mechanical keyboards I have ever used. This is a compact keyboard, and I absolutely love the tactile feel of the keys and the satisfying non-sound from the keys while typing. The volume adjustment push knob on the K15 is a simple quality of life feature that's unexpectedly lovely. The clickable knob made muting quick and easy. The compact size of the K15 has the same footprint as a Mac Magic Keyboard. The heavier weight of the keyboard also prevented movement while working. Keychron K15 Max review: A good niche keyboardThe overall quality of the K15 is amazing, and it is a good low-profile mechanical keyboard. The retail price of $109 falls into the range of most basic mechanical keyboards on the market. Anyone curious about the K15 is not taking a huge financial risk with their purchase, in the way they would with a $200 or higher keyboard. Keychron K15 Max review - You get some height adjustment with this release. I have tested many Keychron mechanical keyboards, and I love the consistent build quality, weight, and potential for customization in its products. However, the K15 lacks case options beyond black, the same drawback Keychron has with most of its keyboards. The Alice style layout is also a problem for me, personally. But if you love that layout, the K15 is an excellent keyboard that deserves your attention. Keychron K15 ProsQuiet tactile keys Small workspace footprint High build quality Excellent customization options in softwareKeychron K15 ConsAlice-style key layout Case color options are limitedScores are hard. If you hate the Alice layout, this keyboard is absolutely not for you. Seriously, in that case, it's a 2 out of 5, tops. But, if you're looking for the sometimes-spendy ergomonic fit that the K15 Max provides, this is an excellent keyboard at a great pricepoint. Rating 4 out of 5 - assuming that you need an Alice layout. Avoid if you don't. Where to buy the Keychron K15 MaxThe Keychron K15 is available on the Keychron website for $109.99 with RGB backlighting. White backlighting is available for $99.99, while hot-swappable RGB is $119.99.",
