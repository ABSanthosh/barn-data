Video games are a part of our everyday lives. From the time of Pong to audio/visual modern-day spectacles, games are more ingrained in our daily routines and pop culture than ever before. Among the myriad options to choose from in a sea of titles and themes, occasionally, one game or game series will catch the eye of gamers and become a mainstay in an industry. Some games become breakout hits, and with that notoriety comes an increase in player base, improvements, earnings, and cross-promotional events. Ugreen is a popular consumer electronics company based in China with a long history of manufacturing a range of peripherals with overall good reviews, and is a recognized brand. So, when we heard about it, it wasn't surprising that a large brand like Ugreen partnered with the wildly popular action role-playing game developer MiHoYo/HoYoverse to create a special crossover event with its flagship title: Genshin Impact. Ugreen sent over the new Ugreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Mystery Box for me to take a look at. What is Genshin Impact?Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game released in 2020. It features anime-style graphic design and an open world environment that leans heavily on fast-paced action, magic, and character swapping. The game takes place in a fantasy world named \"Teyvat\" filled with magic, monsters, gods, and political intrigue. The main story follows your character, called \"The Traveler\", as an explorer looking for your lost sibling. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Mystery Box - The character the box celebratesDuring your adventures, you meet a cavalcade of interesting characters in a wide variety of shapes, sizes, backgrounds, and expertise. Some of these characters will join your party and help with missions along the way, offering their own stories, mysteries, and interactions with The Traveler. Genshin Impact is a free-to-play game that is monetized through a \"Gacha Game\" — a loot box based on Gachapon machines — system. Thsi is a system where real money can be exchanged for in-game random boxes containing items like weapons, armor, and cosmetics to improve the attributes of your characters and change their appearance. Genshin Impact is updated frequently with new content, and is currently available on iOS, Android, PlayStation 4, Windows, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Review: Inside the boxThe UGreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Box arrived in a beautiful box adorned in Genshin Impact style graphics and Ugreen branding, with the playable character Kinich as the focus of all the graphics on the packaging and the items inside. I love attention to detail, and packaging that goes above and beyond to make products feel special, and this box feels special. Inside the Ugreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Mystery BoxInside the box, Ureen includes a Nexode Power Bank, a Nexode Charger, a MagFlow Magnetic Wireless Charger, a Kinich Pop Socket, and a USB-C to UBC-C cable. Everything in the box is Genshin Impact branded, with the colors and themes of Kinich visualized on every piece. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Review: SpecificationsNexode Power Bank: 100w Output. 65W Input. 20000mAh Capacity. Nexode Charger: 140w MagFlow Magnetic Wireless Charger: 15W (phone). 5W (earbuds). USB-C to UBC-C cable: 100W. 40 inches. Out of the box, all the Ugreen x Genshin Impact peripherals feel good and look good. None of the pieces feel cheap or easily breakable. I can be rough on peripherals due to being incredibly clumsy, so items that feel sturdy make me happy. The weight of the Nexode Power Bank is particularly impressive. The display screen on the power bank is bright and easy to read. While the power bank isn't hefty or cumbersome, it is heavy enough that I feel like I could drop it and not immediately break it. To test the power bank, I allowed my iPad to reach single digits of battery life remaining and plugged in the Nexode. Just as advertised by Ugreen, I had a 50 percent charge in roughly 30 minutes and a full charge in about an hour with zero issues. Recharging the power bank took approximately two hours. This power bank is not intended for marathon sessions and heavy lifting. But, it feels good for short trips, conventions, or emergency charging when outlets are unavailable. The Nexode Charger is exactly what you expect from a wall charger, and it is a quality charger that I would be happy to have in my travel bag. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Mystery Box - Nexode ChargerThe USB-C to USB-C cable is great, and I love the neon green color. There are too many instances where I lose a charging cable in the dark, in a bag, or on a desk, and normalizing neon charging cables is something I did not expect, but I love. I plan to find more neon cables and give my aging eyes a break. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Mystery Box - Magflow Wireless ChargerThe Magflow Wireless Charger is a good wireless charger, assuming you've got a nice MagSafe case on your iPhone. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Review: Great for fans, but better options exist for high-demand usersWhile Ugreen is known for its peripherals and has considerable brand awareness, it doesn't have the best reputation for quality. I have read several reviews questioning the overall quality of Green's products, calling their build quality and long-term durability subpar. Ugreen x Genshin Impact Kinich Mystery Box - The included Pop SocketIn my experience, Ugreen's hardware has been solid. I own several Ugreen peripherals, and I have never had an issue with any of them. Their products feel durable. While I would not throw their power banks off a roof, I feel certain that it could withstand travel and day-to-day use. This is a great set of peripherals that would be welcome in any Genshin Impact fan's home. The pieces are sturdy, pretty, and functional. And really, that's what you want in a set of charging peripherals. Ugreen x Genshin Impact ProsExcellent appearance Fun branding for Genshin Impact fans Sturdy, high-quality build Great for travelUgreen x Genshin Impact ConsLow capacity for larger tasksRating: 4 out of 5Where to buy the Ugreen x Genshin Impact PeripheralsPricing for the Nexode Power Bank in this range is $89.99, with the Nexode Charger costing $39.99. The MagFlow Wireless Charger sells for $59.99 with the Genshin Impact branding, and the cable is $9.99. The Ugreen x Genshin Impact peripherals are available on the Ugreen website. At the time of publication, the MagFlow Wireless Charger is also available on Amazon for $59.99.",
