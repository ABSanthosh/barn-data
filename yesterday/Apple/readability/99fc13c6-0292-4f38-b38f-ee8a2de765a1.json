  "text": "Narwal is the global leader in smart home vacuums, and its well-considered range means there’s a perfect model for every home. Amazon Prime Day isn’t just offering discounts on the complete line-up, but the lowest prices ever seen on the company’s robot cleaners and smart cordless vacuum. New models for 2025 Narwal launched two all-new models this year, and both are included in the sale. Freo Z10 The Freo Z10 is a new premium robot model, combining a high-performance vacuum and mop. This offers an incredibly powerful 15,000Pa hyper-suction motor, which lab tests showed delivered an unbeatable 99% particle removal rate on hardwood floors. Pet hairs are no challenge to the Z10 thanks to the unique DualFlow Tangle-Free System – a combination of side and roller brushes specifically engineered to avoid hairs clogging the system. MopExtend and EdgeSwing Technology mean that the mop can reach underneath toe kicks for true edge-to-edge cleaning. Advanced 3D mapping ensures the entire home is cleaned as quickly and efficiently as possible, and the AI-powered base station is as advanced as the robot. It empties the robot after each cleaning cycle, uses hot water to wash and then dry the mops, and can go 120 days before it needs to be emptied.  MSRP: $1099.99, save $450 with a Prime Day price of just $649.99  Freo Pro If your needs aren’t quite so demanding, the new Freo Pro is a mid-range robot model designed to combine the smarts and performance needed in most homes, at an affordable price. The 8,500Pa suction motor offers the power needed for a deep clean, and offers the same DualFlow Tangle-Free System as the Z10. Vacuuming is supplemented with a high-pressure dual-scrubbing mopping system, and AI DirtSense to ensure that the right power is applied for each area. As with the Freo Z10, the system includes a base station with automatic washing and drying of the mops. MSRP: $699.99, save $340 with a Prime Day price of just $359.99  Other models The Freo Z Ultra was Narwal’s 2024 flagship model. It features the world’s first dual RGB cameras in a robot vacuum, backed by AI chips. The combination allows the Z Ultra to avoid obstacles and messes in real-time while executing adaptive, ultra-quiet cleaning strategies. Plus, this model features a 120-day self-emptying base for hands-free convenience. MSRP: $1,499, save $650 with a Prime Day price of just $849.99  The S20 Pro which sold out within one month of its launch, is an all-in-one cordless vacuum that features advanced AI, powerful suction, self-cleaning capabilities, and ultra-quiet performance. With DirtSense technology, extended battery life, and 180° flat-reach, it’s built to handle heavy dirt and spills in any home, ensuring robust dirt removal in just one pass. MSRP: $499.99, save $160 with a Prime Day price of just $339.99  The Freo X Ultra delivers 8,200 Pa suction with tangle-free tech and DirtSense for efficient cleaning and obstacle avoidance. The all-in-one base station handles self-cleaning, drying, and dust storage for up to seven weeks, ensuring a low-maintenance experience. MSRP: $899.99, save $470 with a Prime Day Price of just $429.99 Finally, the Freo X Plus is the brand’s budget-friendly tangle-free vacuum and mop combo, providing efficient and quiet cleaning with 7,800Pa suction motor, ultra-quiet dust emptying, up to 7 weeks of storage, tri-laser obstacle avoidance, and voice-command integration for a precise, hands-free experience. MSRP: $399.99, save $125.45 with a Prime Day price of just $274.54  Don’t miss the the lowest prices ever seen on the company’s robot cleaners and smart cordless vacuum this Prime Day!
