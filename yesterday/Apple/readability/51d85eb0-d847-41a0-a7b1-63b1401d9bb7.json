Photo: Humane/Cult of Mac A lesson Apple and other device makers should learn from the failure of the Humane AI Pin is that while voice control can have a role, it needs to be a very limited one. It’s simply not practical for people to talk to their computers except in special circumstances. I hope the developers at Apple for Siri and HomePod took notes while Humane cratered. Goodbye Humane AI Pin The creators of the Humane AI Pin — a group of Apple veterans — seem to have watched a few too many Star Trek episodes. They looked at the combadge from TNG and set out to recreate it with current technology. They came up with a pin that users wore on their chest that gave them easy access to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The device used a combination of voice control and hand gestures, and the gizmo included a laser that could project text onto the user’s palm. Although reviewers tried very hard to like the product, they just couldn’t. Criticism flowed like lava over Pompeii, with disastrous results for the company. Humane announced Tuesday that its servers will be shut down at the end of February, turning the $700 AI Pin into rubbish. HP bought its CosmOS software. Touchscreens: So much better than voice control While the Humane AI Pin offers users more technical problems than features, those could have been overcome. What couldn’t be fixed is its basic design flaw: it tried to replace a touchscreen with voice commands. I use voice commands many times every day to control the lights, temperature, music, etc. in my smart home. It’s a convenient system… when I’m alone. When I have friends over, it becomes a hassle. I’d need to hush people from talking so I could order Siri turn up the living room lights, for example. Of course, I don’t do this — I pull out my iPhone to make the adjustment. That’s because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands. And I recently took a roadtrip with a couple of friends. One of them sat in the backseat and kept giving her iPhone voice commands, like “Send a text to Mary” and then dictating the text. It was kind of irritating for the rest of us in the car. That’s because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands. We don’t want to listen to other people’s conversations. There’s no better proof than the guy in France who got fined €200 for making a call on a speakerphone in a train station. And listening to people talk to their computers would be even worse. Imagine the cacophony on a train or coffee shop full of folks all talking to AIs via their smartphones. Instead, everyone quietly scrolls on a touchscreen, not bothering everyone around them. That’s because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands. Learn the right lesson I joked earlier that the founders of Humane watched too many Star Trek episodes, but maybe they didn’t watch enough. While Kirk and Picard sometimes talk to their ships’ computers, it’s only in special circumstances. The officers on the bridge of the Enterprise use consoles and screens — they don’t all talk to the computer. That’s because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands. Humane didn’t understand this, which is why the AI Pin cratered. The whole concept for the device was bad. But I think Apple does understand — it explains the reports of a HomePod with a large touchscreen. That’ll be in addition to support for voice commands, which the current versions already offer. But Humane’s fall is not good news for the AI-enhanced version of Siri expected in the spring. While a smarter Siri is certainly welcome, better ways to interact with our iPhones via voice commands are not going to be a game-changer. That’s because, when other people are around, touchscreens are better than voice commands. I know I used that phrase five times, but repetition plays a key role in learning. And it’s a lesson that Apple and other companies truly need to learn.",
