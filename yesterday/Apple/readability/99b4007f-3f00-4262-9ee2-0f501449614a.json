  "text": "I recently wrote about Karo, a new iPhone app from developer Mustafa Yusuf that helps people create to-do lists and assign tasks to others. Starting today, Mac users can also try out Karo with a native version for macOS. Yusuf is also behind Tasks, another to-do app that I’ve already written about here on 9to5Mac. However, while Tasks is focused on more complex lists and projects, Karo is simpler and aimed at delegating tasks to other people, such as friends and family. And the app’s interface is designed to look like you’re simply using a chat app. And this is probably the most exciting part of the app, because I often need to remind someone by message about tasks to be done – and these messages end up getting lost in long conversations. With Karo, you simply select a contact and initiate a “chat.” Everything you type creates a new task to be completed. If the other person also has the Karo app, they’ll see the task right in the app. But Karo isn’t limited to users who have the app installed. For those without it, tasks can be sent via iMessage, WhatsApp, or any other messaging platform you choose. The recipient gets a link to view and mark the task as complete – all without needing to install Karo. This makes it especially useful when working with people who don’t use iPhones, for example. Once the task is marked complete, you’ll receive a notification, and the task will update automatically in the app. Karo was first designed to work with the iPhone, but the latest update to the app comes with a Mac version too. Users will find all the same features of the iOS version in the macOS app, including options for setting deadlines and reminders. You can also attach files to each task, use AI to help you manage larger tasks or take a quick look at your to-do list from the Home Screen widgets. Karo is available to try for free on the iOS and Mac App Store. However, after the trial period, it requires either a subscription or a lifetime license. It’s worth noting that the subscription is valid for both iOS and macOS versions.
