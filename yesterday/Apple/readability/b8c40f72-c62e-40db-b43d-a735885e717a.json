Here's what to expect, and when to expect it. Over the years, we've heard various claims surrounding Apple's foldable display ideas, most of which have to do with a supposed iPhone Fold that's said to be in the works. The iPhone will likely receive the technology first, so it only makes sense that the iPad and MacBook would follow suit. The idea itself is not far-fetched, with Apple's own patents indicating that the company was at least considering a foldable iPad-type device at one point. More recently, however, leakers and analysts alike have all chimed in with claims of technical specifications and supposed release dates, and they have a lot to say. MacBook with a foldable display — Apple's patents and initial rumorsBack in 2018, Apple was granted a patent for a dual-display device similar to an iPad or MacBook, with a large screen and a hinge in the middle. Similarly, in 2020, another patent detailed flexible batteries that could be used alongside \"flexible displays\" in a future iPhone or iPad. Patents from as far back as 2018 indicate that Apple has explored the idea of a foldable iPad.More specific rumors about foldable iPads began popping up two years later. In February 2022. Ross Young of Display Supply Chain Consultants claimed that Apple would release a device with a 20-inch foldable display in 2026 or 2027. Shortly thereafter, a separate report seemingly corroborated these claims, with a third rumor saying the same thing in December 2022. In July 2023, a report revealed that Samsung and LG were working on displays for Apple's foldable products, and the claim was later reiterated. Supposedly, the 20-inch device with a foldable 4K/UHD screen was supposed to be a MacBook. When folded, the lower half of the screen could be used as a trackpad and keyboard, though external accessories were allegedly also usable with the device. Following multiple claims of a 20-inch MacBook with a foldable display, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested in May 2024 that an 18.8-inch variant was also in development. In August of the same year, the analyst added that the larger 20-inch design was scrapped. Months after Kuo's claims, a display roadmap shared on December 5 mentioned an Apple foldable device out in 2028, equipped with a foldable OLED and RGB Tandem display, and an 18.8-inch size. Foldable iPad Pro, or a new type of MacBook?The 18.8-inch foldable device appears to be on track for a 2027 or 2028 release date, according to two separate reports published in December 2024. Analyst Jeff Pu, meanwhile, believes the device will launch in late 2025. Apple could present its 18.8-inch foldable device as a new iPad Pro model.The 18.8-inch screen is practically the same diagonal measurement you get if you put two 13-inch iPad Pro displays next to each other, and measured, corner-to-corner. Most users would find it difficult to carry a tablet with a giant, almost 20-inch screen, so it ultimately makes sense that Apple wants to implement foldable display technology. What remains to be seen, however, is whether or not the device will be a MacBook Pro, an iPad, or perhaps some sort of hybrid. The latter seems especially unlikely, given that Apple has repeatedly insisted it has no plans to merge the Mac and iPad platforms. A super-sized foldable iPad would have a variety of use cases. It would effectively deliver a much larger iPad workspace than anything Apple currently has to offer. As such, it would likely appeal to graphic designers, particularly if the device supports the Apple Pencil Pro. Foldable displays would allow for a more versatile MacBookThe foldable device could also be presented as a more modern version of the MacBook, where a digital keyboard and trackpad would replace physical mechanisms and hardware components. In this case, Apple's approach would be somewhat similar to the failed Microsoft Courier and Surface Neo, as well as the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Apple's 18.8-inch foldable could very well be a new MacBook, with the lower half of the display acting as a versatile input device.A 2018 Apple patent suggests the company was considering a \"keyless keyboard\" for future products, so the idea of a MacBook with a foldable display seems plausible. The iPhone maker previously tried to revamp the MacBook keyboard by implementing the so-called butterfly mechanism with its 2015 12-inch MacBook models. Though the butterfly keyboard was eventually abandoned, Apple might achieve its goal of improving the MacBook's input devices through a foldable display. This would allow for greater versatility. Physical keyboards only serve a singular purpose, but app developers could offer custom input layouts for MacBooks with foldable displays. Graphic designers might use the lower area of the screen with a stylus, while games might offer unique digital button configurations that mimic real-world controllers. Under-display Face ID was also rumored for the device. In terms of processing hardware, Apple's 18.8-inch foldable will reportedly feature the M5 system-on-chip. This means the device could still be a MacBook or an iPad Pro, as Apple's current M4 chip is available on both platforms. The foldable iPad Pro will likely be expensiveAccording to analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple plans to use crease-free panels for its 18.8-inch foldable iPad Pro or MacBook. This will reportedly require a higher specification design, both for the panel and the hinge mechanism. Apple is said to be working on a foldable iPad-type device, with a screen size of 18.8 inches - image credit AppleInsiderThe panel itself could cost anywhere from $600 to $650, with another $200 to $250 for the hinge. Kuo claims that the bill of materials for the device could rival that of the Apple Vision Pro. The cost will be passed on to the end consumer, meaning that the 18.8-inch foldable device could have a relatively high price tag. Still, Kuo believes that shipments could surpass those of the $3500 Apple Vision Pro, possibly exceeding 1 million units. The same analyst claimed the iPhone fold would be priced between $2000 and $2500, so it's no surprise that the 18.8-inch foldable will also be expensive. A smaller foldable iPad might arrive firstThough it remains to be seen exactly how Apple will present its 18.8-inch foldable, rumors suggest a smaller device will fit neatly into the iPad product category. With a supposed display size of 7 or 8 inches, the foldable product will reportedly replace the iPad mini. Apple is reportedly testing folding iPads in two different sizes.In January 2023, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that a foldable iPad would debut in 2024, a statement that was echoed by two separate reports. Even Samsung chimed in, saying that Apple's first foldable would likely be a 2024 tablet. Two credible leakers, however, disagreed — and they were right. 2024 came and went with no foldable iPad release or announcement of any kind, but we did get some more rumors. In February of 2024, a supply chain monitor claimed that a foldable iPad would launch in 2026 as a replacement for the existing iPad Mini line. The current iPad Mini has a display size of 8.3 inches, while the alleged foldable device is expected to feature an 8-inch display. In August of 2024, there was a rumor that Apple would launch two foldable products in late 2026 — a foldable iPhone and iPad. The analyst that made the report still believes this to be the case, as he repeated his previous claims in March of 2025. An 8-inch iPad with a folding display might replace the existing iPad mini line.Though there have been no specific claims about the processing hardware of the smaller foldable iPad, it could include an A18 Pro chip, or possibly an M-Series Apple Silicon system-on-chip. For reference, the current iPad mini 7 features Apple's A17 Pro chip, also found in the iPhone 15 Pro. In terms of connectivity, Apple could opt to use a proprietary modem. While the company introduced the C1 with the debut of the iPhone 16e, a next-generation product would most likely be equipped with the more modern modem technology such as the C2 modem. The C1 notably lacks mmWave support. When will Apple release its foldable products?The rumors about Apple's foldable products have been all over the place. Some have even suggested that the company scrapped its folding display projects entirely. Apple's various foldable products could roll out over a two or three year period.That being said, however, it appears as though Apple has three major products planned for the near future: An 18.8-inch foldable iPad Pro or MacBook, with an M5 chip, under-display Face ID An 8-inch foldable iPad, which would replace the iPad mini An iPhone with a folding displayIf current rumors are to be believed, Apple might release a foldable iPhone and iPad in late 2026, and then follow up with a folding iPad Pro in 2027 or 2028. On the other hand, the company might not even enter the foldable market until 2027, according to a December 2024 report. Ultimately, still it remains to be seen exactly if and when Apple will unveil its first foldable product. Time will tell if that device is an iPad, iPhone, or MacBook — we might even get all three at some point in the future.",
