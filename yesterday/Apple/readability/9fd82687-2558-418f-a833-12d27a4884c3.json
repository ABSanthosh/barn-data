  "text": "Apple announced today that later this month, Sabih Khan is taking over for Jeff Williams as the company’s Chief Operating Officer. According to Apple’s press release, Williams will continue to oversee the company’s design team, Apple Watch, and health initiatives. Later this year, Williams plans to retire, at which point Apple’s design team will report directly to Tim Cook. Cook had this to say of Williams: Jeff and I have worked alongside each other for as long as I can remember, and Apple wouldn’t be what it is without him. He’s helped to create one of the most respected global supply chains in the world; launched Apple Watch and overseen its development; architected Apple’s health strategy; and led our world class team of designers with great wisdom, heart, and dedication. I am and will always be beyond grateful for his numerous contributions to Apple over the years and his loyal friendship. Jeff’s true legacy can be seen in the amazing team he’s created and, while he’ll be greatly missed, he leaves the work of the future in incredible hands. Of Khan, Cook said: Sabih is a brilliant strategist who has been one of the central architects of Apple’s supply chain. While overseeing Apple’s supply chain, he has helped pioneer new technologies in advanced manufacturing, overseen the expansion of Apple’s manufacturing footprint in the United States, and helped ensure that Apple can be nimble in response to global challenges. He has advanced our ambitious efforts in environmental sustainability, helping reduce Apple’s carbon footprint by more than 60 percent. Above all, Sabih leads with his heart and his values, and I know he will make an exceptional chief operating officer. Khan isn’t someone who is probably familiar with a lot of readers, but he’s worked alongside Williams throughout his tenure at Apple. Williams said of Khan: I’ve had the pleasure of working closely with Sabih for 27 years and I think he’s the most talented operations executive on the planet. I have tremendous confidence in Apple’s future under his leadership in this role.” I’ve always enjoyed Jeff Williams’ Apple Watch and health initiative presentations, which he’s delivered with a relaxed confidence for years. Apple’s press release doesn’t say who will lead its Apple Watch program or health initiatives, but I’m sure we’ll hear more on that front later this year.
