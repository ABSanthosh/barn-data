  "text": "With the recent re-launch of Fortnite on iOS and Apple’s rumored new gaming app for iOS 26 – now is a better time than ever to pick up a game controller for your iPhone. I’ve been testing out the ELO Vagabond for quite some time, and it’s certainly a compelling offering. It also supports iPad mini, if a handheld gaming experience on a larger display is up your alley. First things first, this controller has full-size joysticks. That puts it at a big advantage compared to other options on the market like the Backbone One. The joysticks are also surrounded by LED rings for aesthetics, and certainly adds a nice bit of flair to the product. Said joysticks are also hall effect joysticks, making them less prone to drifting over time than traditional joysticks. On top of that, the A/B/X/Y and shoulder buttons are satisfyingly clicky. I personally prefer clicky buttons, so this is a welcome touch. ELO Vagabond offers full size hall-effect triggers too, if you’re into that. There’s also two custom mappable buttons on the back. The controller also features a passthrough USB-C port and headphone jack, conveniently allowing you to charge your phone mid game, and also utilize wired audio without a dongle. In short, if you’re looking for a full size MFi-certified game controller for your iPhone (or iPad mini!), the ELO Vagabond is one of the best choices on the market. It comes in at $99, making it the same price as the more popular offering, the Backbone One. Sure, it’s definitely a larger form factor – but the fact that you’re getting full size buttons, joysticks, and triggers is worth the fact that it takes up slightly more space in your bag. Not to mention the fact that this is one of few products on the market that supports the iPad mini. Similar to the Backbone, ELO also offers an intuitive app for launching all of your games and managing the controller in one place. You can currently pick up an ELO Vagabond on Amazon for just $99. Also, it has some incredibly nice packaging. Certainly goes above and beyond for its price point.
