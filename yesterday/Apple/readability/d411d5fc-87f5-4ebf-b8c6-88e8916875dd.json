  "text": "Apple only just revealed the C1 modem with iPhone 16e on Wednesday, but there's already a rumor about the C2 being tested internally. Apple has spent years trying to distance itself from Qualcomm and use its own in-house modem. The company has finally landed on the C1 modem used in iPhone 16e, calling it a \"platform for generations.\" According to a report from MacRumors sourced from an accurate leaker that uses a private account on X, Apple is already working on the future of the C-series platform. The leaker called it the C2 and shared it has the identifier C4020. No other details were shared beyond the modem's existence. Apple will use the C1 in upcoming devices like the rumored iPhone 17 Air (or Slim). Rumors suggest that the C1 won't be used in the other iPhone 17 models. Presumably, the C1 would also be used in an iPhone 17e that would release early in 2026. The C2 could be destined for the iPhone 18 lineup, iPads, or even Macs. C1 lacks some features that Qualcomm's modems offer, like mmWave 5G. Apple is likely working to ensure feature parity with Qualcomm modems as it brings the C-series modems to other devices. This C2 rumor is being rated likely since Apple is usually working years ahead on future generations of products. The included identifier and alleged accuracy are enough to suggest this is a reliable rumor.",
