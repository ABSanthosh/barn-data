For the past two iterations, Apple's iPhone SE has maintained a dated look, with thick bezels and a Touch ID Home button that make it virtually indistinguishable from an iPhone 8. All of that is set to change quite soon, as the budget-friendly iPhone SE is going to receive its first major redesign in years. Alongside its new design, the iPhone SE 4 will gain a variety of new hardware features, many of which are carry-overs from more recent iPhone models. With every iPhone release, however, it becomes difficult for the average person to know what to expect with the fourth-generation iPhone SE. To remedy the situation and provide our readers with insights about the upcoming device, AppleInsider has spoken to people familiar with internal designs and pre-production prototypes of the iPhone SE 4. The individuals we spoke to have provided countless details about the iPhone 16 range ahead of launch. Leaving no stone unturned, however, we have also decided to provide an outline of everything rumored for the fourth-generation iPhone SE, even though many of the claims made about the device outright contradict each other. The rumor cycle of the iPhone SE 4 has been chaotic, more so than those of standard iPhone models. Initially, it was rumored to be a relatively straightforward update, derived largely from the design of the iPhone XR. Then it was suggested that Apple was testing its new in-house modem with the device, after which the project was supposedly canceled and subsequently brought back. Here's everything we know about the iPhone SE 4 so far, and how the different rumors stack up against each other. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe iPhone SE 4 will echo the standard iPhone 14Apple's next-generation budget-focused iPhone will receive a significant design refresh. Rather than resembling the massively outdated iPhone 8, the fourth-generation iPhone SE will feature a design derived almost entirely from the base model iPhone 14. The iPhone SE 4 will likely be based on the standard iPhone 14, with minor changes.In practice, this means that the iPhone SE 4 will have the same overall dimensions as the iPhone 14, with an aluminum housing made of the same alloy. This information comes from people familiar with the matter, who have spoken to AppleInsider and accurately revealed details about prior Apple hardware releases. For the fourth-generation iPhone SE, Apple plans to use a modified version of the iPhone 14 chassis, with minor changes such as room for the USB-C port, replacing the previously-used Lightning. USB-C has been the standard connector for iPhones since the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro, so its inclusion in the iPhone SE 4 is an obvious choice, as it ensures compliance with EU regulations. Given that the device is largely based on the existing, base model iPhone 14, the fourth-gen iPhone SE will gain an OLED panel and support for Face ID, both of which have never been available on the iPhone SE until now. Some pre-production prototypes also featured an Action button in place of the mute switch, though it is unclear if the final mass production units feature this change, as Apple tested multiple hardware configurations. While all signs, including prototypes, point to the phone heavily resembling Apple's base model iPhone 14, that hasn't stopped unreliable leakers from claiming otherwise. Some have said the device will use a modified iPhone 16 chassis, and there's even a bizarre claim of an alleged \"iPhone 16E\" marketing name, which would seemingly phase out the iPhone SE branding. An unlikely scenario in any case. iFace ID coming via iPhone 14-style notch, Dynamic Island unlikelyWith the introduction of a 6.1-inch OLED display, Apple will finally phase out Touch ID on the iPhone SE. As a replacement, the iPhone SE 4 will feature a more modern form of biometric identification, known as Face ID. This information comes from people familiar with Apple's pre-production designs and prototypes. The fourth-generation iPhone SE is expected to feature a notch rather than Dynamic Island.The fourth-generation iPhone SE will most likely feature a notch near the top of the display, where the TrueDepth Camera and associated Face ID sensors are located. This will give the device a look similar to the standard iPhone 14 and iPhone 13, with a smaller notch compared to the iPhone 12. Unlike the iPhone 15 and iPhone 16, the new-and-improved iPhone SE is not getting Dynamic Island. Apple wants to make its low-end iPhone visually distinct from its flagship models, while also saving on further development costs by re-using iPhone 14 components and designs. Though some have claimed the iPhone SE 4 will indeed ship with Dynamic Island, the overall consensus is that the device will feature a notch. The people we spoke to, along with reliable leakers, and multiple different dummy units all suggest that Apple's budget-oriented phone will be equipped with a notch rather than Dynamic Island. One rear camera, with an impressive 48 MPAnother notable difference compared to the iPhone 14 can be seen in the rear camera availability of the iPhone SE 4. The device will feature a single rear camera on the back rather than two. Though the iPhone SE 4 is getting a new 48 MP camera, its position will be similar to the one on the iPhone SE 3.This means that Apple has created a custom backplate for the fourth-generation iPhone SE. According to people familiar with the matter, the company experimented with at least five different designs for the backplate and rear camera bump. Even so, the device was always supposed to feature only one rear camera. The flash module, meanwhile, will be on the right side. Leaked cases show a horizontal cutout for the camera, which may mean it won't have a camera bump, but one lens jutting from the back. This is consistent with the designs Apple tested, AppleInsider was told. The device is meant to include a 48 MP image sensor, developed under the codename Project Portland. Multiple different reports have indicated that the new-and-improved iPhone SE will feature a 48 MP rear camera, leaving little room for doubt. Apple Intelligence, finally on the iPhone SEWith the fourth iteration of the iPhone SE, Apple will likely usher in support for its latest suite of generative AI tools. Known as Apple Intelligence, the software is currently available for devices with an A17 Pro or newer chip, or iPad and Mac products with an M1 or newer Apple Silicon system-on-chip. Apple Intelligence will most likely be available on the iPhone SE 4 straight out of the box.Apple Intelligence offers a variety of AI-powered utilities, which were made available via the iOS 18.1 and iOS 18.2 updates. With Apple Intelligence, it's possible to edit text, remove objects from photos, summarize conversations, categorize emails, and generate imagery, all through AI. Apple's artificial intelligence features are available across the entire iPhone 16 range, from powerful iPhone 16 Pro featuring the A18 Pro to standard iPhone 16 with its A18 chip. The iPhone maker wants to ensure that Apple Intelligence is available across different product tiers rather than being exclusive to \"Pro\" models, as is evidenced by the iPad mini 7, which uses the A17 Pro chip from the iPhone 15 Pro. The iPhone SE 4 is expected to use the same A18 chip found in the base model iPhone 16, which partially serves as a means of bringing Apple Intelligence to the entry-level iPhone. This would allow the phone to compete and better position itself against similarly priced Android phones that include Google Gemini or similar generative AI software for the end user. The iPhone SE 4 will not get Visual Intelligence, as the device more than likely won't feature the Camera Control button.The popularity and overall prominence of artificial intelligence features has increased dramatically over the past few years. Naturally, consumers expect a new phone to offer generative AI features in some capacity. Apple's CEO Tim Cook himself even said that Apple Intelligence influenced iPhone 16 sales, and that the device performed better in markets and regions where the company's AI features were made available. Apple's iPhone SE 4 is expected to ship with iOS 18.3 pre-installed, so users will likely have access to Apple Intelligence features immediately after purchasing the device. This assumes, of course, that the device will be equipped with the A18 chip. It would be a logical choice for the iPhone SE, given that people will likely hold onto the device for years, all while expecting new software features. New modem, older iPhone 14 batteryWhile not definitive, there is a strong possibility that the iPhone SE 4 might reuse the battery of the existing iPhone 14. This seems like an obvious upgrade, given that the device is heavily based on the standard iPhone 14, with only minor differences between the two. The iPhone SE 4 could feature Apple's \"Sinope\" project, an entirely new 5G modem.Pre-production units of the iPhone SE 4 are known to have used the same A2863 battery found in the standard iPhone 14. The A2863 battery has a capacity of 3279 mAh, which is 1250 mAh more than the 2018 mAh battery of the third-generation iPhone SE. This could lead to a significant increase in battery life compared to the previous iteration of the iPhone SE — another potential selling point for the device. Nonetheless, it's worth pointing out that the iPhone 14 battery was used on pre-production prototypes of the fourth-generation iPhone SE. Apple often tests multiple hardware configurations ahead of launch, so there are no guarantees that the final product will use the same battery. There's also talk of a new 5G modem, developed in-house by Apple under the project codename \"Sinope\" with the intent of replacing the existing Qualcomm modems found in current iPhone models. AppleInsider is familiar with the project, and there's a good chance it will debut with the device, though benefits for the end user are unclear, if there even are any. iPhone SE 4 release date, availability, and priceAs for pricing, the current third-generation iPhone SE can be purchased brand new for $429. Multiple rumors suggest that Apple wants to maintain a price point below $500, which would ultimately make sense for a budget-friendly device like the iPhone SE. AppleInsider was told that the device could be available in white and black color options, with the latter being internally referred to as \"Midnight\" in some instances. This information comes from people familiar with pre-production prototypes, however, and may not reflect the final units, though it does align with colors seen on dummy units. Apple could announce the fourth-generation iPhone SE as soon as the week of February 14, 2025, while the first units are expected to reach customers later in the month. It's possible that there will be no dedicated launch event for this device, and that it will make its debut via a simple press release instead. Previous rumors have all said that the device would be available in early 2025, so the timing makes sense in that regard.",
