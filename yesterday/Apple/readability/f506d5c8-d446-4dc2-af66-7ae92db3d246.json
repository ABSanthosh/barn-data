Photo: Try Dry If you’re considering taking part in Dry January, check out these sober apps to help you quit alcohol for the month — and maybe longer. Dry January is a monthlong challenge to abstain from alcohol for the first 30 days of the year. Popular in the United Kingdom and growing worldwide, it’s a great way to reset after the boozy holiday season, giving people a chance to focus on health and well-being. A lot of people get guidance and support using Dry January apps, aka apps to drink less alcohol, which can also help cut back drinking anytime during the year. Sober apps: Supportive apps to drink less alcohol Cutting back on alcohol — or cutting it out entirely — packs plenty of benefits. Drinking can hurt both physical and mental health. Recent studies suggest no amount of alcohol is beneficial to health, contrary to long-standing beliefs. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy even called Friday for new warning labels on alcoholic beverages due to the cancer risk associated with drinking. And obviously, booze costs money — all the more so during pricey nights out at bars and restaurants. Sobriety apps for iPhone and iPad, like the ones below, take many factors into account and attempt to motivate you to drink less. And all eight sober apps below are free, though many offer in-app purchases or premium features.
