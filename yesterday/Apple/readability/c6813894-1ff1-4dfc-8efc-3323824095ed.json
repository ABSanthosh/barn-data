  "text": "Friends don’t let friends buy a new MacBook Air right before a newer MacBook Air comes out, right? That’s mostly true, but two exceptions. There are currently two very good MacBook Air models that you can purchase brand new that are both incredible values. M1 or higher First is the oldest MacBook Air that’s still sold. That would be the M1 MacBook Air that currently goes for $649 (regular $699) from Walmart. If you’re buying a MacBook Air that’s older than this model, then make sure it costs well below $649. That’s because it still uses an Intel chip and not Apple silicon, meaning performance and features just won’t be the same. While it’s far from state-of-the-art, the M1 MacBook Air exclusively sold through Walmart is your most affordable ticket to an Apple laptop. M2 if base model If budget allows, however, the M2 MacBook Air is worth careful consideration at its current sales price of $799 (regular $999). This model features the current MacBook Air design with MagSafe charging, the blackish-blue Midnight color option, and most importantly, double the RAM. That’s thanks to Apple doubling the base RAM from 8GB to 16GB last fall, likely to support future Apple Intelligence features more easily. For this reason, we love Apple Intelligence. While Apple will sell you an M2 MacBook Air for $999, we only recommend buying at this point if you can take advantage of a $200 off discount. M3? Wait for M4 Everyone else should wait for these reasons: If you care about the performance difference between M2 and M3, you should wait for the M4. We already know what kind of performance it provides since the M4 has been out for a while now. If you want to increase your storage or RAM from the base 256GB and 16GB, you should wait. You’re already paying Apple upgrade prices so budget isn’t a big factor. Hold out for the M4 configurations. If you want a 15-inch MacBook Air, definitely wait. Apple only sells the 15-inch MacBook Air with the M3 chip, and Apple doesn’t discount its products just because new hardware is about to replace it. So there you have it. On a budget? Don’t wait to upgrade. The deals today are as compelling as ever. Want the latest and greatest, upgraded specs, or a bigger screen? Hold out for the M4 MacBook Air. It’s just around the corner. Best MacBook Air accessories Apple 35W Dual Port USB Power Adapter for recharging your MacBook Air and your iPhone, iPad, or AirPods at the same time. An inexpensive MacBook Air sleeve for keeping the scratches on the shiny aluminum finish between uses. Or a transparent snap-on case that stays on without making your MacBook Air thick and heavy. Want to keep your keyboard looking pristine? Using a keyboard cover will prevent your keys from turning shiny after a few months of usage.
