  "text": "Alongside iOS 26 and Apple's other next-gen operating systems, WWDC saw the debut of Xcode 26, which contains references to an unreleased Apple Vision Pro model. On June 9, Apple previewed its latest assortment of operating systems, all of which share the same \"26\" version number and \"Liquid Glass\" design language. Shortly after the keynote, Apple rolled out the first developer betas of iOS 26 and Xcode 26. Xcode is an application used by developers to create third-party applications for Apple platforms. As such, it includes operating system and device names, but it appears as though Apple accidentally included the name of an unreleased product with Xcode 26. On Tuesday, after a mention of the unreleased AirPods Pro 3 was discovered in iOS 26 beta code, something similar was found in the latest beta release of Xcode. According to 9to5mac, Xcode 26 refers to the current Apple Vision Pro as the \"Apple Vision Pro 4K.\" The new name is used for the original Apple Vision Pro, which was previewed at WWDC 2023 and became available to end consumers in February 2024. \"Apple Vision Pro 4K\" appears alongside the simple \"Apple Vision Pro\" moniker, suggesting that Apple is considering another, possibly cheaper model as part of the range. Multiple reports over the years have suggested that a low-cost version of the Apple Vision Pro is in the works. It's expected to feature a brighter yet lower resolution screen than the current model. In September 2024, one report suggested that displays with 1500 pixels-per-inch were tested. For reference, the current Apple Vision Pro features a 3800ppi display, which Apple rounds up to 4K. An October 2024 rumor suggested the cheaper \"Apple Vision\" headset would cost around $2000, with a planned release date of 2026. Apple's consumer-oriented headset might be equipped with an A-Series chip, much like those used in the iPhone, according to the same source. The device may even rely on iPhone or Mac tethering to keep the cost low. Of course, Apple also has plans for a direct successor to the current Apple Vision Pro, which will reportedly feature the as-of-yet unreleased M5 chip. It could use titanium instead of aluminum, with rumors of a dark blue color option. Separately, the iPhone maker is said to be working on smart glasses for 2026, with rumors of the planned \"Apple Glass\" device going as far back as 2015.",
