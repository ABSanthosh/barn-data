Designed with both style and sustainability in mind, this collection adds a sophisticated touch while embodying our dedication to eco-conscious living. Check out the collection. Flashier features like camera upgrades, faster performance, and bigger screens usually take the spotlight when it comes to iPhone. However, Apple’s smartphone has evolved with powerful safety tools over the years. Here’s a look at 6 safety features that offer real peace of mind with iPhone 16 and how you test them out or make sure thye’re enabled. While the features below aren’t exclusive to iPhone 16, they’ll be new for anyone upgrading from an iPhone 13, 13 Pro or earlier. iPhone 14 and 14 Pro were the first devices to get capabilities like Emergency SOS via satellite and Roadside Assistance via satellite with two years of access included for free. Then in fall 2023, Apple extended that so both iPhone 14 and 15 users will have the emergency services included for free until fall 2025. iPhone 16 users will have those features until fall 2026. Meanwhile features like Crash Detection, Safety Check, and Stolen Device Protection are included with modern iPhones and iOS with no subscription. Let’s dig in. Emergency SOS – with and without satellite Emergency SOS on iPhone has been available for many years but the more recent enhancement has been Emergency SOS via satellite. That means even if you don’t have WiFi or cellular service, you can request help from emergency services (in supported countries). While hopefully you’ll never need to use this feature – Apple has built a demo into iOS for iPhone 14, 15, and 16 so you can practice using the feature before you need it in a real-life situation. Read our full guide below how how to try it out. Roadside Assistance via satellite Beyond calling emergency services, Apple has partnered with AAA and Verizon to deliver Roadside Assistance when you’re without a connection. This is another good one to learn about ahead of needing to use the feature – check out all the details in our full post: Messages via satellite Expanding on Emergency SOS and Roadside Assistance via satellite, Apple launched Messages via satellite with iOS 18 that lets users stay in touch with friends and family in the event you don’t have WiFi or cell service. Shortly after launching, this feature saved lives during Hurricane Helene. If you find yourself in this situation, iPhone 14 or later will prompt you in the Messages app to connect to a satellite to send a message. Learn more about how this works: Crash Detection This feature is automatically enabled on iPhone 14, 15, and 16 (Apple Watch 8 and later too). But you can double-check it’s turned on by heading to Settings \u003e Emergency SOS \u003e Crash Detection. In the event a severe car crash is detected, “your iPhone or Apple Watch sounds an alarm and displays an alert.” If you don’t respond in 20 seconds, your device automatically calls emergency services. But keep in mind this does require a WiFi or cellular connection to work. In the years since it debuted, we’ve seen a number of scenarios where the feature has saved lives. Safety Check This feature is available for any iPhone running iOS 16 or later. It’s primarily aimed at those at risk for domestic abuse or similar. Safety Check for iPhone lets users immediately revoke location access others have – including apps – and also walks users through a security review. You can find this features in Settings \u003e Privacy \u0026 Security \u003e Safety Check or read our full guide below for all the details: Stolen Device Protection In early 2024, we got a new safety feature for iPhone called Stolen Device Protection. The launch came after there was a rise in iPhone thefts in public places like bars. The great thing about the feature is there’s very little downside to the user experience while providing a great boost to security. If you don’t have it turned on or want to double-check, head to Settings \u003e Face ID \u0026 Passcode \u003e Stolen Device Protection. Do you have a favorite iPhone safety feature? Have any of these saved the day for you? Share your expereince down in the comments!
