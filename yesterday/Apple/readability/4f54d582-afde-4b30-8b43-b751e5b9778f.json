  "text": "Apple has issued the release candidate build for iOS 18.2, MacOS Sequoia 15.2, and iPadOS 18.2, for all users that are involved in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. RC, or Release Candidate builds, are typically the final version of a beta before it gets released to the general public, indicating the final releases of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 are imminent. Aside from the usual bug fixes and security enhancements, these upcoming software updates are focused on bringing new Apple Intelligence features to compatible devices, including Image Playground AI image generation capabilities, and ChatGPT integration. This will be the second route of AI features introduced to the Apple operating systems, with a variety of handy writing tools and summarization features being available at the moment. Some other new features will be included as well, including the ability to share devices in Find My, a weather widget for the Mac menu bar is available, iPhone Mirroring can be used with Personal Hotspot, and a handful of other small changes and adjustments. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.2 RC If you’re already in the beta program for iOS/iPadOS, you will find getting the RC build is simple: Open “Settings”, and then go to “General” Select “Software Update” Choose to update to iOS 18.2 / iPadOS 18.2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 RC If you’re enrolled in the Mac beta testing program, the RC build is available in Software Update as usual: Go to the  Apple menu, then go to “System Settings” Select “General”, then go to “Software Update” Select to “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 When will iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 be released for everyone? This is the RC build for beta users, which typically indicates a final version will be available to all users in the near future, possibly this week or next. Of course nobody knows the exact release cycle except for Apple, but this is a reasonable guess. MacOS Sequoia 15.2 release notes Release notes included with the RC build of Sequoia 15.2 are as follows: This update introduces new features powered by Apple Intelligence, the personal intelligence system that unlocks powerful new ways to communicate, work, and express yourself, all while protecting your data with an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI.
