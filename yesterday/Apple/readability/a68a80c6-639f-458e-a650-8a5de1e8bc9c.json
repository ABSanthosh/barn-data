  "description": "Macworld The MacBook Pro is a fantastic laptop at a great price, but it starts to get really expensive once you start to add RAM and storage. Today’s sale helps a lot: Amazon is selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro with 1TB of storage and 24GB of RAM for $1,79, an impressive discount of $250 and the best price we’ve ever seen for this configuration. The laptop comes with a gorgeous 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, which looks great in any lighting situation. The M4 chip is accompanied by 24GB of memory, a speedy combo that will easily handle any tasks you need to complete, including video and photo editing. The 1TB SSD is the max you can get, too, so enjoy all that space. When we reviewed the M4 MacBook Pro, we gave it a near-perfect 4.5-star rating. We loved the laptop’s overall performance, as well as the 12MP Center Stage camera upgrade, and appreciated the extra Thunderbolt 4 ports. Our biggest gripe with Apple’s laptops has always been the expensive upgrade costs and this sale certainly helps with that. So stop wasting time and get your order in for the $1,749 M4 MacBook Pro with 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage before this discount vanishes into thin air.
