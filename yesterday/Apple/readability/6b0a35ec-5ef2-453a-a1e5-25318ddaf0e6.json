  "text": "A new survey of game developers shows significant interest in the Vision Pro for gaming, with big growth expected from soon-to-be made visionOS games. Here are the details. Game developer survey reveals plans for new visionOS games As published by GamesBeat, a recent Game Developers Conference survey sought to gauge engagement from developers with Apple’s new spatial computing platform. The data points to big growth coming soon. Here’s what it says: Although only 8% of VR/AR developers are currently making games for Apple vision OS, the platform looks to be growing its foothold. Almost one-fifth (18%) of respondents say their next games will be on the platform, and one-fourth are interested in Apple’s VR headset. These three data points are all interesting in their own ways. First, it’s a bit surprising that 8% of VR/AR game developers are currently working on a visionOS project. We certainly haven’t seen much from their efforts yet, as Vision Pro gaming options have been scarce so far. That number is encouraging to hear. Second, the fact that 18% of respondents confirmed their next game would be on Vision Pro shows how much growth we should see soon. The final question is especially relevant too, especially when comparing visionOS interest to that of other platforms. Notably, 26% of respondents said that visionOS was of high interest to them as a game developer, while only 25% said the same for PlayStation VR2—a platform that might be about to bolster Apple’s Vision Pro efforts. The survey involved over 3,000 game developers in total, a sizable group that provides a solid glimpse into what creatives in the gaming community are planning. What do you think of the Vision Pro gaming survey results? Let us know in the comments.
