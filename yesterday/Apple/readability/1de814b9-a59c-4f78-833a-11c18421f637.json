The app has a long history of questionable privacy policies. Apple and Google fined in Brazil over FaceApp As reported by UOL, Judge Douglas de Melo Martins ruled this week that both Apple and Google were responsible for distributing FaceApp, which is accused of “improperly collecting sensitive data” from its users. The judge believes that the photo editor app violates the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet, a law that regulates the use of the internet and digital platforms in the country. Under Brazilian law, platforms are prohibited from “massive and improper collection of personal data” without users’ consent. Apart from not complying with the law, the app also doesn’t provide terms of use and privacy policy translated into Portuguese. In addition to the fine, the judge’s decision also orders Apple and Google to pay compensation of R$500 (US$82) to each person in Brazil who has downloaded and used FaceApp since June 2020. In response, Apple said it has no control over FaceApp’s terms of use and privacy policy as it is “distributed and maintained by a third party.” Apple also argues that the data was collected in accordance with “international standards.” Google also opposes the decision with similar arguments, claiming that it only distributes apps through Google Play and is not responsible for FaceApp’s terms of use. For the judge, both companies “play an active role in the consumer chain, providing infrastructure and conditions for the operation of FaceApp.” He believes that Apple and Google contributed to the app infringing Brazilian laws. Apple and Google can still appeal the decision in court. For those unfamiliar, FaceApp is a popular image editor app that lets users transform and tweak their photos with aging effects, skin smoothing, accessories, and much more. The app has gone viral among teenagers. In 2019, FaceApp was accused of storing users’ photos on its servers without consent. The FBI also said the app was a “potential threat” because of its ties to Russia. FaceApp is still available on the App Store and is free to download – although it does offer in-app purchases that cost up to $100.
