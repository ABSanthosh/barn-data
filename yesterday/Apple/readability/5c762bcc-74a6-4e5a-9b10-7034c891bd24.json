  "text": "Apple recently announced a new generation of the Mac mini, which introduced a new and much more compact design. We’ve already seen some tidbits about what’s inside this Mac mini, but iFixit has now shared its traditional teardown showing even more details about how Apple built its most compact Mac ever. iFixit tears down the new Mac Mini From the start, iFixit praises how easy the Mac mini is to disassemble despite having a much more compact design. The bottom plate is held on by clips that can be detached without causing any damage. The first thing users will see after removing the bottom plate is the CMOS battery, which can be easily replaced just by removing two screws. By removing a few other screws, users can access the wireless module cables and then remove the inner plate that gives access to most of the internal components, such as the speaker and the large fan that takes up half of the Mac’s space. Apple has redesigned the thermal management of the new Mac mini so that the fan keeps the computer cool by drawing air from the base and circulating it through the components before expelling it. Interestingly, the version with the M4 Pro chip has a larger copper heatsink than the base M4 version. As previously reported, the new Mac mini has a replaceable storage module. However, upgrading isn’t exactly easy since the module is proprietary, but it is possible. iFixit successfully swapped modules between two Mac minis and it worked. One thing to keep in mind is that the M4 Pro version has a larger storage module, so you can’t use it in the M4 version and vice versa. The USB-C ports and the headphone jack on the front can also be removed, but the same can’t be said for the ports on the back. The logic board is protected with a copper layer for better heat dissipation, and unsurprisingly, the M4 chip has RAM soldered onto it. Even so, iFixit gave the new Mac mini a 7 in its repairability score. According to the company, the Mac’s main components are easily replaceable, which makes it easier for users to keep their computer running for years if something stops working. iFixit said the new Mac mini has a “bright and repairable future ahead.” The new Mac mini is now available in stores with prices starting at $599.
