The first betas of the .2 releases arrive now despite iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and MacOS Sequoia 15.1 not debuting until next week, though they just landed as Release Candidate builds. The new betas include new Apple Intelligence features like ChatGPT integration, Genmoji to generate custom emoji, Image Playground to generate AI images, and more. Apple Intelligence continues to have strict system requirements, with iPhone requiring an iPhone 15 Pro or better, while a Mac must have an M1 chip or better, and an iPad must have either an M1 or A17 Pro chip or better. How to Install iOS 18.2 beta 1 and/or iPadOS 18.2 beta 1 Getting the first beta of iOS/iPadOS 18.2 is easy if you’re enrolled in the beta programsl: Open “Settings”, then go to “General” Go to “Software Update” Choose to to iOS 18.2 or iPadOS 18.2 How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 beta 1 If your Mac is enrolled in the beta program, 15.2 beta is available via software update: From the  Apple menu select “System Settings” Go to “General” and then go to “Software Update” Choose “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.2 If you haven’t yet joined the Apple Intelligence waitlist you must do that System Settings \u003e Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri to find the appropriate setting. When will new Apple Intelligence features with iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2 be available? Apple Intelligence is first going to be included in iOS 18.1, iPadOS 18.1, and macOS Sequoia 15.1, which are expected to launch on October 28. iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and MacOS Sequoia 15.2 with the next array of Apple Intelligence features will come later, after Apple goes through their typical several rounds of beta testing. It’s not clear what the timeline is for release, but it’s likely to be towards the end of the year.",
