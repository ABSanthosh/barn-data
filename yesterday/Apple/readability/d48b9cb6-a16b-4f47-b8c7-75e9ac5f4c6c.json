  "text": "According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, multiple Apple product launches are around the corner. This includes a new M4 MacBook Air model, as well as new iPad Air and entry-level iPad models. The MacBook Air announcement is ‘imminent’, while the iPad models are slightly later. There have been a couple major Apple product announcements rumored for this spring. Now that the iPhone 16e has launched, it’s time to think about what’s next in the pipeline. Some of those products include iPad Air, iPad 11, and MacBook Air M4 – which should all be refreshed in the near future. Gurman reports that stock is dwindling for the existing entry-level iPad and M2 iPad Air models, highly suggesting that a refresh is around the corner for these iPad models. We also saw stock begin to dwindle for iPhone SE 3 models ahead of the iPhone 16e refresh. As a refresher, iPad 11 is expected to largely be an Apple Intelligence refresh, bringing the A17 Pro chip to Apple’s cheapest iPad. iPad Air is expected to receive some internal improvements, including possibly an M3 chip and new Magic Keyboard. All of these products will be refreshed this spring, although some sooner than others. There’ll be a Mac-related announcement as early as this coming week, according to Gurman. This is likely to announce the new M4 MacBook Air. iPad announcements are also coming, but likely not within the next few days, according to his report.
