The cycle of praise, in-person attention, and financial contribution continues on inauguration day as Silicon Valley's biggest names offer congratulations on Elon Musk's social media platform. Apple CEO Tim Cook is no different, posting on X after his in-person appearance at the ceremony.

The big tech CEOs share their excitement for innovation and American-based ingenuity. Congratulations to President @realDonaldTrump and Vice President @JDVance on Inauguration Day. We look forward to working with the administration to drive continued innovation and jobs for future growth across our great nation.— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) January 20, 2025 Apple itself remained mostly absent from dealing with President Trump directly in his first term. President Trump famously visited a Mac Pro assembly plant and was gifted a Mac Pro in 2019. So far, Tim Cook has taken a more personal approach by attending in-person meetings and dinners, and even contributed $1 million of his own money to the inauguration fund. Apple did not contribute to that, but Cook has apparently promised heavy investment in the United States. While President Trump has attributed this investment to his reelection, it is more directly related to the CHIPS act signed by President Biden in 2022. Apple is increasing chips made in the US thanks to plants built in Arizona by TSMC. Every presidency requires a different strategy, and Tim Cook knows this. It remains to be seen how dealings will be handled in President Trump's second term.",
