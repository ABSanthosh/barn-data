  "description": "Macworld Apple announced on Monday that the USB-C-equipped AirPods Max will soon get an update that was inexplicably left off the USB-C model: Users will be able to play lossless audio and ultra-low-latency audio through a wired connection. The new feature will be in a firmware update when iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and macOS Sequoia 15.4 are released next week. To use the 24-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio and ultra-low-latency audio, the headphones must be connected to the audio source through a USB-C cable. When Apple updated the AirPods  Max with USB-C last September, the new USB-C port was enabled only for charging. The Lightning-equipped AirPods Max are not included in the feature update. The new lossless audio support can be used with Personalized Spatial Audio for “a more sonically accurate, uncompressed, and immersive experience,” according to an Apple press release. Lossless audio is a key feature for audio producers, while ultra‑low latency audio is key for gaming and live streams. Apple notes that AirPods Max will become “the only headphones that enable musicians to both create and mix in Personalized Spatial Audio with head tracking.” Apple also revealed a new 1.2-meter USB-C to 3.5mm audio cable for $39/£39/CA$55/AU$65 and is now available in the Apple Store. The cable can be used to connect AirPods Max to standard headphone audio ports found on devices, airplanes, Macs, and other devices. The cable can also be used with iPhones and iPads to connect to an audio-in port in a car or on speakers. Apple has established that it will regularly update AirPods with new features through firmware updates. Last October, Apple released hearing health features for the AirPods Pro 2 along with the iOS 18.1 update. You can learn more about new and upcoming AirPods features and releases in the Macworld AirPods guide. USB-C to 3.5-mm Audio Cable (1.2 m) Price When Reviewed: $39 Best Prices Today: $39 at Apple",
