  "text": "News An application highlighting games on iPhone and Mac is on the way. Photo: Gemini/Cult of mac A new cross-platform application developed by Apple will call attention to games on iPhone, Mac and even Apple TV, according to an unconfirmed report from Tuesday. It’ll replace the current Game Center, track users’ in-game achievements, give players a way to communicate with other gamers, and more. New gaming app from Apple on the way Players spent $93 billion on mobile games in 2024, a figure that dwarfs the $52 billion spent on console gaming or the $42 billion in PC gaming. A majority of that mobile gaming spending happened on iPhones, which means Apple took a cut of the proceeds, but Cupertino is constantly trying to increase its revenue, and that means getting more people to play games. That’s the likely reason for a new gaming application coming soon to iOS, macOS, iPadOS and tvOS. “The new app will feature editorial content from Apple about new titles, offer access to the App Store’s game section, and promote Arcade, the company’s $6.99-a-month subscription offering,” Bloomberg reported Tuesday. Say good-bye to Game Center Apple’s new gaming app will reportedly replace Game Center. This is unlikely to be controversial, considering many iPhone and Mac users are probably completely unaware that Game Center is tucked away in Settings. Like Game Center does now, the upcoming app will show gamers the achievements they’ve earned in various games, as well as compete on leaderboards. It’ll serve as a central collection point for these, spanning across titles and a user’s different devices. And there are a huge number of games to choose from. Of course, there are casual games like Monopoly Go!, but Apple has made a push to bring console-quality titles to its platforms. The new Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown can be enjoyed on iPhone, Capcom brought multiple Resident Evil games to iOS, there’s the brilliant NBA 2K25, plus a whole lot more on Apple Arcade. Coming in June … sort of The leak from Apple insiders to Bloomberg doesn’t include the name of the upcoming app, but it’ll probably be something logical like “Apple Games,” considering the same company put out Apple Music, Apple Sports, Apple Podcasts, etc. Expect the new software to be part of iOS 19, macOS 16, iPadOS 19 and tvOS 19 when they’re all unveiled during the keynote address of WWDC25 on June 9.",
