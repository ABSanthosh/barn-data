  "text": "According to a tweet from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple will be performing some “merchandise/floor marketing updates” at its retail stores next week. While specific details aren’t confirmed, Apple is likely launching the new Black Unity Apple Watch band for 2025. In the past, Apple has announced these new bands around mid-late January, and put them on sale around a week later. Apple hasn’t yet announced the new Black Unity Apple Watch band this year, and that’s the most likely announcement. MacRumors contributor Aaron Perris recently discovered references to the unreleased watch band within tvOS 18.3 code, suggesting that the launch is right around the corner. Apple began launching Black Unity Apple Watch bands in 2021, and its remained an annual tradition since then. The bands tend to feature a red, green, and black color way. In recent history, they’ve also been accompanied by a new watch face. Given the fact that Apple released the release candidate of iOS 18.3 last week, its a fairly safe guess that the limited-time watch band is around the corner. Apple is also rumored to announce the new MacBook Air with M4 chip before the spring, but I wouldn’t count on that being next weeks announcement.
