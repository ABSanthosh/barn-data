  "text": "A Bloomberg report last year revealed that Apple has been working on a new smart doorbell to compete with Ring products. Although the device is still in the early stages of development and won’t come to the market anytime soon, a new rumor suggests that Apple’s doorbell will feature MagSafe. Rumors about Apple’s smart doorbell The leaker known as Kosutami posted a tweet about “MagSafe on your door” earlier today. The tweet quotes another about Apple’s rumored smart home doorbell. “Hint: there’s something Apple ringing on your door,” the leaker said. “More hint: MagSafe on your door, it rings,” he added. The purpose of having MagSafe in a smart home doorbell remains unclear. It could enable better convenience for recharging the battery, although accessories like this can usually be used for months on a single charge. Apple currently sells many HomeKit-compatible smart locks in its store. According to Mark Gurman’s report, Apple is considering partnering with smart lock manufacturers to integrate its doorbell with them rather than offering a full package. Apple’s smart home doorbell is expected to have Face ID to identify people and unlock the door in seconds. As a result, the doorbell could unlock HomeKit-enabled smart locks. Unfortunately, it will be a long time before we see this product in the stores. Gurman says it won’t be available “before the end of next year at the earliest.” In addition to this doorbell, Apple has been secretly working on other smart home products. For instance, the company is expected to announce this year a brand new “HomePad” – a single device that combines a HomePod with an iPad. 9to5Mac found references to this product in the first beta of iOS 18.4 released last week.
