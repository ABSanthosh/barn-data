  "text": "Today, Apple announced upcoming changes to App Store pricing and developer proceeds. New tax adjustments will take effect immediately in Brazil, and additional pricing updates will roll out in multiple regions over the next few months. Brazil: new tax hits foreign developers As of May 16th, Apple is modifying developer proceeds in Brazil to reflect the introduction of a tax known as CIDE, which stands for Economic Domain Intervention Contributions. The new 10% levy will apply to developers based outside of Brazil and will be deducted from their earnings from paid apps and IAP. Furthermore, starting June 2, if the developer hasn’t selected Brazil as their base storefront in App Store Connect, prices will automatically update in the country to reflect this new tax. Similarly, pricing in Kazakhstan will also be adjusted due to local economic conditions. However, if the developer has either Brazil or Kazakhstan set as their base storefront, prices will remain unchanged. Apple notes that these updates won’t affect auto-renewable subscriptions, nor will any regions where developers manually manage prices instead of using Apple’s automated pricing system. Europe: consent now required for subscription price hikes Starting on August 4, Apple is introducing a new policy for auto-renewable subscription price increases in Austria, Germany, and Poland. Beginning on that date, all subscribers in those countries must explicitly consent to a price increase. If they don’t opt-in, the subscription will automatically lapse at the end of the current billing cycle. Apple will notify users weekly until the user takes action or the subscription ends. It’s worth noting that any subscription price increases scheduled before August 4 will still follow the current notification policies, even if the subscription renews after that date.
