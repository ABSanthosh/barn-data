  "text": "Apple released iOS 18.4 beta on Friday, with a number of unique new features. Some of the new features include Priority Notifications with Apple Intelligence, a new Food section in the Apple News app, and more. However, there was another smaller change that went under the radar, one that has to do with CarPlay – particularly on larger displays. CarPlay in iOS 18.4 can now include a third row of app icons – up from two. This means that CarPlay will now better take advantage of larger built-in car displays. However, it isn’t available on every vehicle. The third row of icons only appears on larger car displays, and it isn’t quite clear what the threshold is. Just know that it isn’t there for everyone. MacRumors notes that it’s present on the Toyota Tundra, which can be equipped with an up-to 14-inch display. This is a very welcome change. Cars have been including larger and larger displays over time, and CarPlay hasn’t necessarily scaled quite well to that change, and CarPlay 2 is still nowhere in sight. This offers a happy middle ground for those with larger displays, and makes the experience a lot more usable. Now there’ll be less of a need to fiddle with multiple home screen pages.
