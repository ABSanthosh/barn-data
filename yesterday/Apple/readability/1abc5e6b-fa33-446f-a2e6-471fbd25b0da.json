  "description": "Macworld If you want headphones that are better and (a lot) more affordable than the AirPods Max, the fantastic Beats Studio Pro are 49% off at Amazon. That means you can get them for $180 rather than their regular $350. In our 4.5-star review of the Studio Pro, we gave the headphones our Editor’s Choice award, appreciating how lightweight they are, the excellent battery life, and the clean audio. “Even if they weren’t $200 cheaper, we’d recommend these over the AirPods Max,” reads the review. These headphones were built to deliver rich audio with a deep bass. They also come with Adaptive Noise Cancellation so you can block out the world around you and focus on work reading, or whatever it is you’re doing. You can also switch to Transparency mode to hear your surroundings, which is useful when you’re in public, crossing the street, or you have to mind your safety. The Beats Studio Pro can keep you company for up to 40 hours of play time, which means you won’t have to charge them up very often. If you have a portable power bank on you, you can even charge them on the go if need be. A 10-minute charge will give you another four hours of playback. Don’t miss out on the chance to get yourself one of the best headphones out there, especially when they’re as low as $180 at Amazon. Jam out with BeatsGet it at Amazon",
