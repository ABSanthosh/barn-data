  "description": "Macworld If you plan to buy a major technology device in the next couple of months, you might have difficulty finding it in stock. According to Reuters on Monday, the Trump administration’s tariff policy will lead to shortages of consumer electronics in the U.S. Pegatron Chairman T.H. Tung told Reuters that product shipments have been disrupted because of the erratic nature of the Trump tariff policy. While some tariffs with countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, and India have been paused, U.S. importers are not ramping up shipments, instead waiting to see if the tariffs are repealed altogether. Pegatron is a Taiwan-based supplier to Apple and other major tech companies. “Within two months, shelves in the United States … might resemble those in third-world countries, where people visit department stores and markets only to find empty shelves, all because everyone is waiting and seeing,” Tung told Reuters. The timing could affect families buying devices for students going back to school in the fall. Reuters’ report does not specifically address how Apple and its stores may be affected, but Pegatron is a major supplier of iPhones, and Apple can’t stockpile devices that haven’t been released yet. Recent reports said that Apple rushed 600 tons of iPhones to the U.S. in March due to looming tariffs, but the iPhone 17 could see constraints when it launches in September. Apple has been contacted for comment, and this article will be updated if we hear back. But Apple isn’t the only electronics company, and there’s no telling how other companies will be affected. It’s possible that the third-party item you’ve had your eye on may not be available at your local retailer in the next few months. So if you want something, act fast.",
