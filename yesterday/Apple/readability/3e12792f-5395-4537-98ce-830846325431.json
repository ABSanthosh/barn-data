  "description": "Macworld Apple has started a service program to specifically address a problem that owners of the M2 Mac mini may be having. According to Apple, “a very small percentage” of these Mac minis have an issue where they will no longer power on. Eligible devices can have service done to fix the issue by Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. The affected Mac minis were manufactured between June 16, 2024 and November 23, 2024. To see if your Mac mini qualifies, Apple has a website where you provide your Mac mini’s serial number: check if your Mac mini is qualified for service. Qualified devices can be brought in for service at an Apple Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, though owners will have to bring the Mac mini into the shop, since mail-in service is not available for desktop Macs. The service for this specific problem is free, but the customer may have to pay for any additional repairs that are necessary to implement the fix. The M2 Mac mini first hit the market in January 2023 and was replaced by the M4 Mac mini in October 2024, so the affected models were manufactured towards the end of the M2 Mac mini’s cycle. Apple also offered an M2 Pro Mac mini at the same time as the standard M2; while Apple’s website refers only to the M2, it’s likely that this is a general reference to the M2 chip series and that the M2 Pro model is also involved in the service program.
