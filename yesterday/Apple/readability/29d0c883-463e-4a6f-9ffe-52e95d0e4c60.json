  "text": "Apple Intelligence launched just a few months ago, but a lot more additions are expected soon in iOS 18.4 and beyond. Now, a new memo leak has given us insight into Apple’s two main internal priorities for its AI efforts this year. Revamping Siri and improving AI models are top priorities Earlier today, Mark Gurman reported that Apple was moving a key executive—Kim Vorrath—into its AI division and giving her responsibility for “whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.” That news came from a leaked memo by Apple’s AI head John Giannandrea. Another interesting blurb from the memo was shared, though—one that outlines Apple’s internal priorities for AI this year. Gurman writes at Bloomberg: This year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company’s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo. Apple’s AI priorities for 2025, it seems, are: Rebuilding the core tech behind Siri, and Making improvements to existing AI models It’s nothing revolutionary, but that sort of speaks to Apple’s general bent toward progressive iteration and improvement. Internal focus aligns with current Apple Intelligence shortcomings Gurman has previously reported that Siri is undergoing a big behind-the-scenes transformation into ‘LLM Siri,’ which is targeted to ship in spring 2026—perhaps in iOS 19.4. That project sounds like exactly what Giannandrea says is Apple’s big focus for the year. The second area of focus makes sense too. Improving the company’s AI models is a clear need when considering the recent issues around notification summaries. While they’re a great feature when they work properly, these summaries can regularly include errors. As a result, Apple is temporarily disabling them in iOS 18.3 for select app categories. Presumably, until the backing AI model can be brought up to par. What do you think of the reported Apple Intelligence focus this year? Let us know in the comments.
