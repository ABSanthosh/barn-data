The company said in a new repair notice that it has determined that \"a very small percentage\" of Mac minis with M2 chips manufactured between June 16 and November 23, 2024 are affected. Owners who are experiencing the issue can use a Serial Number checker page on Apple's website to determine if their Mac mini is eligible for repair. If it qualifies, the repair will be done free of charge. The serial number can be determined by checking the underside of the device, or checking the original product packaging. It can be retrieved from the \"About This Mac\" Apple menu item — but this is not likely an option if you're impacted by the issue. Should a user's Mac mini have a serial number that qualifies it for the program, they can schedule and appointment with any Apple Authorized Service Provider or Apple Retail Store. If there is not an AASP nearby, contact Apple Support for further repair options. The new repair program is available for qualifying Mac mini models for three years after the first retail sale of the unit, according to Apple. The company notes that the worldwide program does not extend the standard warranty coverage of a user's Mac mini. The Mac mini as a whole recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.",
