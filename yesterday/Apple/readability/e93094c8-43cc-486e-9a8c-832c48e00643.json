  "text": "Apple has released the first beta version of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4, for users enrolled in the beta testing programs for Apple system software. The new beta updates look to add some additional features to Apple Intelligence for all eligible devices, add the polarizing Mail Categories feature from iPhone to iPad, along with various other smaller changes and refinements to the various operating systems, as well as the usual assortment of bug fixes. How to Install iOS/iPadOS 18.4 Beta 1 Users participating in the beta testing programs for iOS/iPadOS can find the latest beta build in the Settings app: Open “Settings” on iPhone or iPad, then go to “General” Choose “Software Update” Select to update to iOS 18.4 beta or iPadOS 18.4 beta How to Install MacOS Sequoia 15.4 beta 1 Mac users enrolled in receiving beta updates will find the new beta in Software Update: From the  Apple menu, choose “System Settings” Choose “General” and then “Software Update” Choose to “Update Now” to install MacOS Sequoia 15.4 The MacOS Sequoia 15.4 beta is quite large at 15GB, and requires a restart to finish installing as usual. When will the final version of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4 be released to everyone? It is unclear what the timeline is for releasing the final versions of iOS 18.4, iPadOS 18.4, and MacOS Sequoia 15.4, but Apple usually goes through several beta releases before issuing a final version to the public. This could suggest a possible March timeline for release, though only Apple knows the precise schedule.",
