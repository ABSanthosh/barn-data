Image Credit â€” iFixitThe new MacBook Air, with an M4 system-on-chip, was announced on March 5, 2025. Though the laptop features an upgraded 12MP front camera with center stage support and is available in a new Sky Blue color option, it's practically identical to the M3 MacBook Air.

The battery on the M4 MacBook Air is held in place by the same stretch release tabs found in the previous generation. While the iPhone 16 range features a special type of adhesive that can be released with electricity, this change hasn't yet made its way to the MacBook Air. Subscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeSubscribe to AppleInsider on YouTubeThe Touch ID power button, however, remains as difficult to remove as ever, as the laptop's entire top case must be disassembled before it can be taken out. The same goes for the keyboard of the M4 MacBook Air. Though the laptop doesn't appear to have any significant structural or design changes, Apple has published a repair manual for the recently released MacBook Air. In theory, anyone should be able to replace parts on their MacBook Air, but sometimes that doesn't quite work. iFixit swapped the logic boards between two identical M4 MacBook Airs and experienced calibration issues with the ambient light sensor. Despite using Apple's System Calibration tool, and both laptops being fully operational, the display's True Tone feature could not be activated. Though the M4 MacBook Air offers performance improvements and better external display support over previous models, the NAND chips are still soldered onto the logic board. This means that the storage is not user-upgradeable, which is no surprise. The consensus among reviewers is that the M4 MacBook Air is little more than a spec upgrade. It introduces some welcome changes but is otherwise unremarkable, given that it contains no surprise upgrades.",
