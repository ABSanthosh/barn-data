  "text": "Software is more than just a new version number: at this year’s Worldwide Developers Conference, Apple rolled out expansive updates across its platforms, with a brand new Liquid Glass design, access to AI models for third-party developers, and new features. But you’ve heard about all of that, I’m sure, so we’re not going to rehash it. Instead, let’s get personal: I’m picking out, in my opinion, the best and worst new features of each of Apple’s platforms. To be clear, these are my completely scientific and totally well-reasoned expert opinions on the features that were announced, not just some off-the-cuff reactions less than a day later. macOS Best: Spotlight enhancements Yes. This. 100, as the kids say.1 Not everyone with a Mac is a power user, but power users probably disproportionately use the Mac, so a feature that is aimed at them feels like a tacit admission that the Mac is going to keep being the Mac. I gave up third-party launchers a long time ago, and I’m glad to see Apple finally embracing the more powerful features they can offer. Worst: Disappearing menu bar Didn’t we go through this back in 2007? The menu bar is an integral part of the macOS experience, why don’t you want me to see it? iOS Best: Spam filtering in Messages Long overdue. There was some facility for third-party filters in the past, but they were never really used.2 But if I never get another weird spam message asking if I left my sunglasses at their house, it will be too soon. Worst: Tapbacks in CarPlay Maybe calling this the “worst” is overselling it, but a) there wasn’t a lot else in iOS 26 that I found objectionable, and b) do I really want people tapping on messages and trying to pick the perfect emoji while driving? I do not. iPadOS Best: Improved windowing Finally, after what feels like seventeen different multitasking approaches, Apple has hit upon a surefire winner: windows you can place anywhere, manage via Expose, and tile to parts of the screen. Maybe they finally developed a time machine and went back to Xerox PARC. Worst: Games app It’s a supercharged Games Center, but that doesn’t do much for me. I appreciate that at least it tends to show off apps that I actually have played, but a giant splash screen of games recommended for me feels like an ad more than anything. watchOS Best: Configurable widgets I like the Weather widget on my Watch, but I’m annoyed that it forces me to include the wind direction and AQI along with temperature. Being able to pick the items it’s showing is vastly preferable—I always like to have the UV level in there to know how much I’m going to sunburn. Not if. How much. Worst: Workout Buddy Look, I’ve recently started running again, using the Nike Run Club app, which has a chipper (maybe too chipper?) coach who roots you on. But for all that it’s an actual person, not a robot. Your robot enthusiasm does nothing for me, you hear me? NOTHING. visionOS Best: Widgets Look, the ability to create little widgets and leave them in persistent places around your workspace is just cool. It’s a wholehearted embracing of spatial computing. The Vision Pro may be too rich for my blood3, but Apple seems committed to pushing that forward, and more power to them. Worst: Image Playgrounds We failed to keep the virus contained. tvOS Best: There’s still a tvOS Damning with faint praise, but the Apple TV continues to be the device I use the most that Apple seems to care about the least. tvOS doesn’t even get a tab in Apple’s preview of all the new operating systems. Poor kid. Worst: Sing in Apple Music with iPhone I really do not need to hear your off-key rendition of “Africa”, much less amplified through my soundbar.
