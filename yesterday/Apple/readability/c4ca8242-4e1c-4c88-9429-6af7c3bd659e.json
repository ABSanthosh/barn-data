This sale from Cult of Mac Deals means you can land a refurbished M1 MacBook Air for only $514.99, just in time to tackle this year’s schoolwork. That’s a crazy-good price. Apple’s refurbished store sells a similar model for $240 more! Is the MacBook Air still worth it? The MacBook Air has been a perennial crowd-pleaser ever since Apple CEO Steve Jobs pulled one out of a manila envelope in one of the most memorable product unveilings of all time. The laptop proves powerful enough to run most apps, but remains super-lightweight and not too expensive. Apple’s M1 chip, introduced in 2020, powers the refurbished MacBook Air in this sale. With its 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU, the M1 chip handles everything from basic tasks to more demanding applications with impressive speed and efficiency. Its 16-core Neural Engine means it can handle Apple Intelligence, the AI-powered suite of features coming soon to Macs, iPhones and iPads. Whether you’re juggling multiple tabs, editing videos or working on a design project, the M1 chip ensures smooth operation. It’s powerful and portable, making it perfect for students who need a laptop that can keep up with their multitasking needs. This refurbished M1 MacBook Air packs a 13.3-inch Retina display (2,560 by 1,600 native resolution, 227ppi). It comes with 8GB of RAM and a 128GB solid-state drive. Available in the ever-popular space gray finish, it weighs just 2.8 pounds. The power you crave, with the battery life you need Another major bonus of the MacBook Air M1 is its impressive battery life. Fully charged, this computer can last up to 18 hours. That’s a full day of classes, a lengthy homework session on the weekend or the approximate time it takes to agonize over a project that will ultimately take 90 minutes to finish once you get started. Connectivity is also a breeze, thanks to the two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. They let you easily hook up your external drives, monitors or any other peripherals you might need. It comes loaded with the latest Mac operating system, macOS Sonoma, so you’re equipped with all the latest tools.
