  "description": "Macworld According to prolific leaker Fixed Focus Digital on Weibo, Apple’s super-slim iPhone 17 Air will debut with a new custom color Apple has never used before. Similar to Sierra Blue from the iPhone 13 Pro (above), it is said to be a very light pale blue. In the right lighting, the report claims it might look almost white, which sounds like the pale shades from the iPhone 15 era. However, the post claims, “It is different from all the blue colors Apple has released before.” And that makes sense—Apple rarely recycles exact color shades for iPhones, beyond its classic white and black, midnight, starlight, and Space Gray. It sounds an awful lot like Apple is leaning into the “Air” thing here, going with a color that looks invokes the image of light, puffy clouds on a sunny day. Of note, the M4 MacBook Air is available in a sky blue color, which would fit this theme and also fits the description by Fixed Focus Digital.
