  "text": "We’ve been hearing rumors about Apple gearing up to announce new M4 Macs as soon as next week, but it looks like the company also has some updates for its accessories. More specifically, the company is reportedly working on new versions of the Magic Mouse, Magic Trackpad and Magic Keyboard – but you probably shouldn’t get too excited about that. Apple working on new Magic Mouse, Trackpad and Keyboard with USB-C As noted by Aaron Perris on X, iOS 18.1 RC includes references to a “new” Magic Mouse 2, Magic Trackpad 2 and also an updated Magic Keyboard. Technically, the current Magic Mouse and Trackpad are already version 2 (Apple refers to the Lightning versions introduced in 2015 as “2”). So what exactly is new about today’s findings? 9to5Mac has analyzed the code of macOS 15.1 RC, which was also released to developers today, and there are indeed references to new “Magic” accessories. Again, there’s already a Magic Mouse 2 and a Magic Trackpad 2, but the new models added with today’s build are labeled with the suffix “.usb,” which could be a hint that Apple will simply add a USB-C port to the current accessories without actually launching a new generation with new features or a new design. Further evidence that the new Magic Mouse, Trackpad and Keyboard won’t come with a new design is that the system will use the current assets (icons) for the new “.usb” models. Except for the Magic Keyboard, which was updated in 2021 along with the M1 iMac, it’s been almost 10 years since Apple updated the Magic Mouse and Trackpad. While having a USB-C port is certainly a welcome change, the update may disappoint those who were hoping for more significant changes. Apple currently sells the Magic Mouse for $79 and the Magic Trackpad for $129, but you can find them for less on Amazon. New M4 Macs coming next week According to the latest rumors, Apple will announce new Macs next week. This includes a new iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro, all powered by the M4 chip. When it comes to the Mac mini, customers can also look forward to a major redesign. To add fuel to the fire, macOS 15.1 RC adds new system extensions to support the M4 chip, which is currently exclusive to the 2024 iPad Pro. Presumably, Apple will also unveil the new “Magic” accessories next week along with the M4 Macs. Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links. More.",
