  "description": "Macworld If you’re an Apple user we already know you like the finer things in life, and we’d put money on the fact your iPhone is controlling half the gadgets in your home. Why? Well, why not. It just works, and this seamless integration with smart home kit frees up your time and removes many of the frustrations of everyday life. But there is one smart gadget you might not have considered yet, and this robot can take care of the most gruelling chore of all: cleaning out the pool. Investing in a robot pool cleaner is a smart choice. Imagine being able to enjoy the luxury of a swimming pool, but with none of the hard work pool maintenance typically requires. The Dreame Z1 Pro is a great pick, unlocking plenty of extra free time to actually enjoy your pool. Imagine this: you’ve spent a very loooong week at the office, but now it’s Saturday, the weather has warmed up, and you can’t think of anything better than spending the weekend lounging in the pool you worked so hard to pay for. You grab a towel, get into your swimsuit, oil up… and then start picking out leaves that have fallen into the water. Oh, and here are some bugs, let’s get rid of those. And we’ll tackle that nice slimey film on top of the water. Did you scrub the pool walls and floors lately? Suddenly this luxurious dip you had been longing for feels like hassle. Let Dreame take the hard work out of pool maintenance It doesn’t have to be this way. Dreame can help, and the Z1 Pro ensures you enjoy hands-off pool maintenance anytime you need it. It deploys all of its 8,000GPH suction power to clean your pool top to bottom, picking up anything that’s fallen in the water and scrubbing the waterline. Much like a robot vacuum will tackle cleaning your floors, this one will stick to the bottom or sides of the pool and meticulously clean the surface, too. The robot’s sensors will quickly map out the pool while AI smarts divide it into areas so it can better tackle cleaning. The Z1 Pro even knows how to avoid obstacles such as drain covers, lights, and so on. This wireless robot pool cleaner can run for about 180 minutes on a single charge, cleaning up to 2,160 square feet in the process. That’s quite a lot of pool to cover! While it can normally do its own thing and clean wherever it deems necessary, you can also assume full control right from your iPhone or the bundled remote. Hands-free pool cleaning If you’re running an emergency clean just before guests arrive and you don’t want them to see the robot, use the remote to call it back to you. This LiFi-connected remote is suitable for fresh- and saltwater pools and can communicate with the robot even while it’s underwater, allowing you to assign tasks or steer the cleaner. Once the cleaning job is done, the robot will park itself at the edge of the pool so you can pick it up and set it up to recharge. Easy! To set up the robot and get cleaning reports, also install the Dreamehome app on your iPhone. You’ll see everything from the map to the multiple cleaning modes available, as well as the cleaning logs. What are you waiting for? Dreame’s Z1 Pro costs $1,499 at Dreame’s online shop, but right now it’s discounted to $1,099–and you can save a further 15% with the code PROMO15. We think you might just find the time saved on pool maintenance is worth more to you than the discount, however. Take a further 15% off Dreame Z1 Pro Use Promo Code PROMO15",
