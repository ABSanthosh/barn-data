  "text": "Apple on Monday released the first betas of iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 to users, just a few days after the public release of iOS 18.2. There’s not much to say about today’s betas when it comes to new features, and unfortunately for Mac and iPad users, iPadOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 still don’t have the redesigned Mail app. The new Mail app is not yet available on Mac and iPad With iOS 18.2, Apple introduced a new Mail app – which was teased back in June at WWDC 2024. The new Mail app has a more modern look with smart categorization, which organizes your email inbox into Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. The app also makes it easier to see who sent you each email. However, the new app is only available for iPhone users. Although Apple hasn’t said anything about when the new Mail app will arrive on iPad and Mac, some marketing images of the M4 Macs released in October show the redesigned Mail app in macOS, which suggests that the update will eventually reach these devices. Unfortunately, this hasn’t happened yet with the iPadOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 betas released today. At least in the first beta, the Mail app still looks the same on both iPad and Mac. Of course, this is only the first beta and there’s still a lot to happen before the official release, but perhaps the new Mail app interface will only arrive on iPad and Mac with iPadOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4, both expected to be released in April 2025. This isn’t the first time that Apple has split the rollout of new features between devices. For instance, the Genmoji feature for creating your own custom emoji was introduced for iPhone and iPad users with iOS 18.2, but wasn’t available on the Mac until now with macOS 15.3 beta 1. Besides, the new Mail app has been criticized by some users who don’t seem to have liked the new categorization feature (luckily, there’s a way to revert it to the old design), so these users are probably relieved not to have to deal with the same issues on other devices. iOS 18.3, iPadOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3 are expected to be released to the public sometime between January and February.
