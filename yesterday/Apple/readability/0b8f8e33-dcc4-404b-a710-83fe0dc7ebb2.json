  "text": "How-To WWDC25 kicks off on June 9, 2025. Image: Arne Müseler/Wikimedia Commons/Apple How can you watch Apple’s WWDC event? You can stream the keynote on YouTube, on the apple.com website or on your smart TV. It starts at 10 a.m. Pacific time on Monday, June 9. At WWDC, Apple announces all the upcoming software updates for iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS and visionOS. This year, the headline change is a rumored visual redesign with translucent glass inspired by the Vision Pro. The iPad may be getting even more Mac-like, with Stage Manager 2 and a menu bar at the top of the screen. While Apple Intelligence may not headline the event, Apple has a few new features to unveil, like AI-generated Shortcuts, personal health recommendations and an API for developers. Here’s how you can watch it all live, whether you’re watching at home, secretly at work or in-person at Apple Park. The keynote starts at the following times: 10 a.m. Pacific, United States 1 p.m. Eastern, United States 6 p.m. GMT, Europe 10:30 p.m. IST, India 3 a.m. Tuesday AET, Australia No. 1: Watch the Apple event on Apple’s website, best for a computer The easiest way to watch the keynote is to just go to apple.com. Come Monday morning, the live stream should take over the homepage. Later, it’ll move to apple.com/apple-events/, where you can always go to rewatch old presentations. There, you’ll also see a link to Apple Event videos on Apple Podcasts — a convenient way to rewatch (and download) every Apple Event since January 2007. No. 2: YouTube live stream, a second choice across all platforms Another convenient way to watch the Apple event is on YouTube. The watch page is up now in advance. You can bookmark it, add it to a calendar event, or keep it open until it starts Monday morning. The YouTube live stream is the most accessible across any device and platform. In the past, Apple’s website has gone down if there’s too much traffic (though I don’t recall that happening recently). So, the YouTube live stream serves as a universal backup plan. However, the YouTube stream usually runs a little bit behind Apple’s own stream. Plus, I vastly prefer the video player on Apple’s website to YouTube’s. If you’re watching on a computer, I recommend you go to apple.com but keep YouTube muted in the background, so you can switch to it just in case. No. 3: In the Apple Developer app, best for Vision Pro and other Apple devices In Vision Pro, you can watch the keynote inside this neon immersive space.Screenshot: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Web browsers can be unreliable and crashy. If you have an Apple device (which you probably do, as a Cult of Mac reader interested in an Apple keynote), the best way to watch the Apple event is in the Apple Developer app. It’s completely free — you don’t need to have a paid developer account. It’s also where you can find WWDC session videos that are published throughout the week, where you can see how new features work in detail — and how they’re implemented in apps. Apple Developer is available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV and Vision Pro. Download Apple Developer from the App Store. No. 4: Watch the Apple event in the Apple TV app on your big screen The best way to watch the Apple event on your TV is in the Apple TV app. The Apple TV app isn’t just for Apple TV set-top boxes. Any modern smart TV made by Samsung, LG, Vizio, Panasonic, Sony (or any TV running Google TV software) has it built in. You can download the app on your Roku, Amazon Fire TV Stick, PlayStation or Xbox if you have any one of those. Here’s the full list of compatible TVs and game consoles. No. 5: In person at Apple Park — here’s my advice CEO Tim Cook and SVP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi take the stage to greet attendees before the prerecorded keynote plays.Photo: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac If you’re a registered developer who won the random lottery, a winner of the Swift Student Challenge, an engineer at a big enough company to get an invitation or a designated member of the press, you’ll watch the Apple event at Apple Park. You can get a taste of what you’re in for by checking out my article on my experience attending in 2022. Assuming it plays out like the last two years, you have one critical decision to make: where to sit. There are three gigantic video screens — one outside on the greenery, two inside Caffè Macs. Since 2023, there has been a large canopy added to the outside seating for shade. Before the live stream begins, Apple execs Tim Cook and Craig Federighi are likely to come out and say hello on stage. If you’re sitting outside, you’ll see them in person; if you’re sitting inside, you’ll see them through a live camera feed. Sure, plenty of great pictures of Cook and Federighi are out there. We all know what they look like. But if you want a picture of them yourself, captured with your own iPhone, seen with your own eyeballs, you’ll want to sit outside — get out there early to get a near-front-row seat. Just remember to put on the complimentary sunscreen. Moments before the Developer State of the Union begins, as seen from inside the Ring.Photo: D. Griffin Jones/Cult of Mac Sitting inside Caffè Macs, you’ll be more comfortable. Seating there is more casual and roomy. The indoor crowd is a bit chattier; it could lead to some interesting conversations if you’re sitting near a few Apple engineers.
