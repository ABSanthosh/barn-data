  "text": "Apple on Monday introduced a new generation of the iMac, which is now powered by the M4 chip. Although it looks almost identical to the previous model, the new M4 iMac comes with a few new tricks – and one of them is support for 8K output at 120Hz for compatible displays. M4 iMac supports 8K 120Hz external displays As noted by Vadim Yuryev from Max Tech, the technical specifications of the new M4 iMac announced today confirm that it can output video to up to two external displays in 6K resolution at 60Hz or a single 8K external display at 120Hz. This is the very first Mac to support external displays in this configuration. There are already some Macs capable of 8K output, but they’re limited to 60Hz. The models compatible with external 8K 60Hz displays are: 2023 Mac Studio 2023 Mac Pro 2023 Mac mini with M2 Pro 2023 MacBook Pro with M2 Pro and higher/later However, there’s a catch. Support for 8K 120Hz is only available on high-end versions of the iMac with a 10-core GPU. The entry-level model with an 8-core GPU is limited to just one external display in 6K resolution at 60Hz. Presumably, other Macs with the M4 chip to be announced this week will also support 8K 120Hz in their high-end versions. It’s interesting to note that not even Apple has an external display with an 8K 120Hz panel. The company’s Pro Display XDR has 6K resolution but a 60Hz refresh rate. As for the Studio Display, it has 5K resolution at 60Hz. Of course, support for 8K 120Hz makes the new iMacs more future-proof. More about the new iMac In addition to the M4 chip, the new iMac also comes with 16GB of RAM as standard for the first time. Apple has also added an option with nano-texture glass, four USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports and an upgraded camera with Center Stage. There are also new color options available. Prices for the new iMac start at $1,299. Pre-orders start today and they’re expected to ship on November 8. Apple posts event video for new M4 iMac, confirms first of three Mac announcements this week Apple brings USB-C to new Magic Keyboard, Magic Trackpad, and Magic Mouse New Magic Keyboard with USB-C is available in three separate models New USB-C Magic Mouse still has the charging port on the bottom Apple confirms expanded language support for Apple Intelligence coming in April 2025 and beyond Apple Intelligence set to launch in the EU for iPhone and iPad early next year Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
