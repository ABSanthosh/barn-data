  "text": "Apple’s flagship iPhone 16 line launched last fall with a heavy focus on Apple Intelligence. But another new iPhone is coming soon, offering some of the same modern tech but at a much lower cost. Here’s when to expect the iPhone SE 4. Next iPhone SE expected to launch in March According to numerous reports, Apple has set the iPhone SE 4 release date for early this year. More specifically, March 2025 is a safe bet for the launch month. It’s rare for Apple to ship big new products in January or February (though last year Vision Pro broke that pattern). The company almost always, however, has launches planned for March and/or April. March is the likeliest date, however, based on reporting from the supply chain regarding the iPhone SE 4 production timeline. For comparison, Apple’s prior iPhone SE launches occurred on the following dates: iPhone SE 3: March 18, 2022 iPhone SE 2: April 24, 2020 iPhone SE: March 24, 2017 As you can see, Apple has released new iPhone SE models in both March and April, but the only April occurrence was during COVID. It wouldn’t at all be surprising if that April launch got pushed back by the pandemic. Features of the new iPhone SE 4 When Apple’s new iPhone SE arrives, it is expected to be a huge upgrade from the current SE model. Here are the feature highlights: Edge-to-edge OLED display with no Home Button, Face ID, and a notch A18 chip, the same one found in the iPhone 16 8GB of RAM Apple Intelligence support 48MP camera on par with the iPhone 16 USB-C port and the first Apple-designed 5G modem All of these capabilities will come at a substantially discounted price compared to the iPhone 16. The current iPhone SE starts at $429. Apple may not keep the new SE that low, but expect it to at least get a storage bump over the current offering and start no higher than $499–perhaps lower. It may be missing certain nice-to-have features from the more expensive iPhone 16, but the iPhone SE 4 looks set to be the best model for most buyers.
