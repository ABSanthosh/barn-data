The show originally debuted in February 2020, with the fourth season finale having aired on March 26, 2025. The cancellation was apparently revealed to the cast and crew sometime after the original season finale was completed. \"Endings are hard, but after four incredible seasons, Mythic Quest is coming to a close,\" the show's executive producers — including star Rob McElhenny - told industry paper Variety. \"Because endings are hard, with Apple's blessing we made one final update to our last episode — so we could say goodbye, instead of just game over.\" Mythic Quest was one of the first original shows on Apple TV+, debuting just four months after the service itself. Despite some production issues related to the global Covid pandemic, it was already renewed for its third and fourth season after the second season debuted in 2021. The premise centered around the staff of a video game company that produced that titular MMORPG, and followed developments and tensions as the game became a hit with its audience. The series has been held in high regard by critics and fans, with a 97 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes. \"We're so proud of the show and the world we got to build— and deeply grateful to every cast and crew member who poured their heart into it,\" the producers said. \"To all our fans, thank you for playing with us. To our partners at Apple, thank you for believing in the vision from the very beginning.\" In addition to being its star, McElhenny created the show along with co-exec producers Charlie Day and Megan Ganz. He starred as Ian Grimm, alongside Ashly Burch, Naomi Ekperigin, Jessie Ennis, Imani Hakim, David Hornsby, Charlotte Nicdao, and Danny Pudi. Alongside its four-season run, the show also aired two special episodes. The first of the two dealt with the characters' reactions to working from home during the quarantine at the height of the Covid pandemic. The second covered their return to the office, again mirroring the real-world reactions and making the show explicitly contemporary to the years in which it aired. There was also a four-episode mini-series spin off, Side Quest, which focused on the lives of both the people producing the game, as well as the people who were fans of the game.",
