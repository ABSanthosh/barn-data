  "text": "At CES 2025, Anker unveiled a rather interesting new battery bank. It’s extremely compact, offers up to 25,000mAh of capacity, and has multiple built in cables for ease of use. I’ve utilized this battery bank for many months, and I can confidently say its an easy purchase if you’re looking for an all-in-one solution for all of your Apple devices, MacBooks included. First things first, this power bank is highly versatile. It includes two built in USB-C cables. One is an up to 27-inch retractable cable, and the other is an 8-inch foldable cable, which also doubles as a strap. It also has two USB-C ports and an USB-A port for additional outputs. All in all, this power bank outputs up to 165W, though each USB-C connector is only capable of outputting 100W max. This Anker power bank comes in at just over a pound (555g), making it not too heavy to carry around. It’s by no means the lightest power bank you can own, but given the versatility – I think it’s justified. It also comes in at just 6 inches tall and under 2 inches wide, making it pretty compact to toss in a bag. As mentioned earlier, this power bank can recharge a MacBook. When it’s fully charged, it packs around 90Wh of capacity, leaving plenty of juice to fully cover a MacBook if needed. Anker says it’ll recharge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just around half an hour. I think the more interesting part is the fact that it’ll fully cover a MacBook Air or 14-inch MacBook Pro if you’re away from power for an extended period of time. It’ll nearly cover a 16-inch MacBook Pro too, though not to 100%. All of that – in a form factor that can easily fit in your hand, makes this worth picking up. It also has a relatively nifty LCD screen, which’ll provide charging insights for your devices, and keep you up to date on the battery level of the power bank. It’s also safe to carry on a plane, making it the ultimate power bank for all of your Apple devices, provided you’re okay with the slightly hefty weight. If you’d like one of these power banks, you can pick one up on Amazon today. It’s available in two colors, silver and black. The silver one is available for a lower price at the time of writing.
