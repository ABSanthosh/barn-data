Ford announced that the Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, which both support Apple Maps EV Routing in CarPlay, will now be able to automatically direct drivers to the nearest NACS fast charging station whenever the vehicle needs to be charged.

Indications of this feature first appeared in the second developer beta of iOS 18.4, which contained text strings informing users of NACS charging stations along their route. Now, the capability is finally available to end users. Ford says that no vehicle software update is necessary and that the feature works with CarPlay and an iPhone running iOS 17 or newer. The change will ultimately allow for a more seamless experience for owners of the Mustang Mach-E or F-150 Lightning, as they will no longer have to switch between different applications simply to find a compatible NACS charger along their route.",
