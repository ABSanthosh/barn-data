A survey found that 88% of that age group own an iPhone — a figure that’s held fairly steady for years. What’s not positive news for Apple is how very few teens watch the Apple TV+ streaming service. U.S. teens love iPhone year after year For a relatively small demographic, teenagers have an outsized impact on consumer trends. They have disposable income (or influence over family spending), they’re hyper-connected through social media, and they’re at an age where identity and trends matter a lot. Today’s teens drive about $830 billion in U.S. consumer spending annually, either directly or indirectly through their sway over parents. Twice a year, Piper Sandler asks thousands of Americans between the ages of 13 and 19 about the products they own, where they shop, the services they use, and more. It’s called the Taking Stock With Teens Survey, and it’s been going on for decades. Those on that age group consistently choose iPhone in huge numbers, and spring 2025 is no different: 88% of teens own an iPhone. Looking back in time, the total was either essentially holding steady or growing. The number of U.S. teens with an iPhone was at 87% in 2023, 88% in 2021, and 85% in 2020. Way back in 2014, the total was about 61%. And there’s more positive news for Apple: the number of U.S. teens interested in buying an upcoming iPhone 17 in the autumn is on the rise. The new Piper Sandler report says 25% of teens expect to upgrade to an iPhone 17, an increase from the 22% who said that same in the surveys done in autumn 2024. Bad news for Apple TV+ Not all everything Apple touches turns to gold. It’s been completely unable to get teenagers hooked on its streaming video service. The latest edition of the Taking Stock With Teens Survey found that a minuscule 1% of the demographic watch Apple TV+ every day. To be clear, that doesn’t mean teens never watch the service, but it’s far from their favorite. For comparison, daily viewership for Netflix sits at 31%, while YouTube viewership is at 26%. Clearly, lots of adults watch Apple TV+, as the service controls 8% of the U.S. streaming market.  But the series and movies it makes don’t seem to appeal much to teenagers. Speaking of under-performers, a mere 1% of teens use an Apple Vision Pro AR headset. Apple Music does far better. In the Piper Sandler survey, 34% of U.S. teens have listened to the streaming music service in the last six months. And 30% of teenagers actually pay for a subscription to Apple Music. It’s still behind rival Spotify though, with 65% of teens listening to that streaming service, and 45% paying for it. Piper Sandler Taking Stock With Teens Survey spring 2025Chart: Piper Sandler",
