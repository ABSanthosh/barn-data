  "text": "News Adam Scott stars in “Severance,” a very popular Apple TV+ series. Photo: Apple TV+ Severance is the most-watched streaming series on any service, according to a company that tracks ratings. The Apple TV+ weird workplace drama beat out everything else on any streaming service for the second time since its season two began. In addition, Silo, another Apple TV+ series, continued to do well weeks after wrapping up its own season two. Severance dominates the ratings charts Severance drew in huge audiences during its first season. Enough to make it a No. 1 most-streamed series. Although fans had to wait years for new episodes, their interest didn’t dim. When season two returned in January, large numbers of fans tuned in. Enough to push the show to the top of the ratings charts twice since new season started. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Severance sits at No. 1 for the week of February 3 through February 9. And rival service Reelgood put the show in the No. 2 slot on its list for top rated series for the week of  Feb. 6 to Feb. 12. Ratings show a pair of Apple TV+ shows are among the popular streaming series.Charts: JustWatch/Reelgood Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. Season two of Severance is here, so start watching new episodes. Episode five of the new season debuted this week, with the sixth coming on Friday. In the mean time, be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two,  episode three, episode four and episode five. Silo just keeps holding on The Apple TV+ sci-fi series Silo season two wrapped up weeks ago but nevertheless did not drop in the ratings. The last episode (for now) aired on January 17, and enough people tuned in to put the show in the No. 4 slot on JustWatch’s list of most popular streaming series last week. And it was in the No. 8 slot on Reelgood’s equivalent list. Apple’s official description says: Silo is the story of the last ten thousand people on Earth, their mile-deep home protecting them from the toxic and deadly world outside. However, no one knows when or why the silo was built, and those who try to find out face fatal consequences. Rebecca Ferguson stars as Juliette, an engineer who seeks answers about a loved one’s murder and tumbles onto a mystery that goes far deeper than she could have ever imagined, leading her to discover that if the lies don’t kill you, the truth will. All ten episodes of Silo season two can be binge-watched now. And there’ll be plenty more to enjoy in the future. Apple already committed to seasons 3 and 4, so the complete story arc will be finished. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming series like Severance, Silo, plus many others comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
