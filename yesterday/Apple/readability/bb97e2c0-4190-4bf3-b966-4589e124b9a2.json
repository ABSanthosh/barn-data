  "text": "News The Gorge on Apple TV+ stars Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller as assassins falling in love. Photo: Apple The Gorge is the most popular film on streaming for a second week, according to a ratings tracker. The romantic action thriller from Apple TV+ stars Miles Teller, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Sigourney Weaver… plus a lot of monsters. And Severance held onto a large audience of innies and outies, just as it has since early January. The Gorge ratings: So popular Since the mid-February launch of The Gorge, viewers have watched in big numbers. The film follows a pair of highly trained agents falling in love even as they protect the world from horrible creatures. Movie and TV search engine Reelgood publishes a weekly list of the top-rated movies, and The Gorge sits at No. 1 for the week of February 20 through February 26, just as it did the previous week. Rival service JustWatch put the show in the No. 2 slot on its list of the 10 most popular films on streaming for the week of  Feb. 17 to Feb. 23. The Gorge stayed hot for another week.Charts: Reelgood/JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. Its high ratings shouldn’t surprise anyone who saw the recent announcement that The Gorge ranks as the biggest film premiere in Apple TV+ history. The premise could be the secret of the new movie’s success. The Apple TV+ teaser synopsis for the film says: “Two highly-trained operatives (Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts in guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within. They bond from a distance while trying to stay vigilant in defending against an unseen enemy. When the cataclysmic threat to humanity is revealed to them, they must work together in a test of both their physical and mental strength to keep the secret in the gorge before it’s too late.” The Cult of Mac review calls it “the perfect date night movie” for its even balance between romance and action. And we complimented the chemistry between the two young stars. The film can be watched now. Severance holds its grip on audiences Severance drew in huge audiences during its first season, and when season two returned in January, large numbers of fans tuned in. Enough to keep the show at or near the tops of the ratings charts every week since new season started. The weird workplace drama held the No. 2 spot on JustWatch’s chart of popular a series last week. And it was at No. 5 on JustWatch’s equivalent chart. Ratings charts show Severance is one of the popular streaming series in late February 2025.Charts: JustWatch/Reelgood And Apple itself chimed in recently, crowing that Severance recently passed Ted Lasso as the most popular Apple TV+ show ever. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. Episode seven of Severance season two debuted this week, with the eighth coming up on Friday. In the mean time, be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two,  episode three, episode four, episode five, episode six and episode seven. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like The Gorge, Severance plus many others come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial.
