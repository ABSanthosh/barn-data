  "text": "The Playstation 4 remains a wildly popular gaming console, and now if you have a Mac, Windows PC, or Linux machine, you can play quite a few Playstation 4 games on a fantastic free PS4 emulator called ShadPS4. So connect a PS4 Controller to your Mac and have at it! Emulators are so much fun, and one of the best parts of having modern computer hardware is just how well many emulators run nowadays. Now the Playstation 4 is no different, and since shadPS4 is available for every major desktop operating system, it doesn’t matter what system you’re on, you can give it a try yourself. Check out the ShadPS4 Github page Download ShadPS4 from Github releases As usual, if you’re unfamiliar with downloading Mac apps from Github here’s a little guide for that, it’s definitely not intuitive for most people who aren’t ubergeeks like myself. Your next question is likely obvious, how well does the Playstation 4 emulator run, and can it play any games that I actually want to play? The answer to both of those questions is; it runs quite well, and yes it will emulate many popular PS4 games, including Red Dead Redemption, Bloodborne, and Dark Souls. For example, check out Red Dead Redemption running on the PS4 emulator in this embedded YouTube video: You can also check out shadps4.net project news page to keep track of how games are running and other updates to the emulator. Have fun and happy emulating.",
