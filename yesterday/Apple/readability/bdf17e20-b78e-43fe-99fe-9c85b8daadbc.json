  "text": "Apple on Tuesday introduced two new iPads: the iPad Air with the M3 chip and an updated entry-level iPad with the A16 chip. While some believed that the cheaper iPad would finally receive support for Apple Intelligence features, that didn’t happen. But if you’re looking for a more affordable iPad with AI capabilities, I recommend giving the M1 iPad Air a try. The new iPad 11 There’s not much to say about the new iPad 11 except that it now has the A16 chip, while the previous version was powered by the A14 chip. According to Apple, the new iPad is 50% faster than its predecessor. Indeed, the chip is faster and has 6GB of RAM instead of 4GB. But even so, the A16 chip can’t run Apple Intelligence features. This was a real letdown for customers who had been waiting a long time to upgrade their iPad, but didn’t want to spend a lot of money on a brand new iPad Air or iPad Pro just to get access to Apple’s latest AI features. While the iPad 11 costs $349, the recently announced iPad Air with the M3 chip starts at $599, while the iPad mini 7 costs $499 in its base version. So what’s the best option for buying a new iPad with Apple Intelligence without spending a lot of money? I’d say the M1 iPad Air. The M1 iPad Air is a better deal M1 iPad Air, also known as the 5th generation iPad Air, was launched in 2022. Apple no longer sells it officially, but you can still find the M1 iPad Air for much lower prices in some stores, especially if you’re willing to buy a refurbished model. This iPad is, in many ways (perhaps all of them), better than the new iPad 11 announced today. And here’s why. Both have an 11-inch LCD display, but the panel on the M1 iPad Air is more advanced with a wide P3 color gamut and anti-reflective coating, while the iPad 11’s display is limited to sRGB colors and has non-laminated glass, which is much more susceptible to glare. The 5th generation iPad Air is also thinner and lighter than iPad 11. It’s 6.1 mm thick and 461 grams versus 7 mm and 477 grams, respectively. But what makes the M1 iPad Air unbeatable is, well, the M1 chip. M1 was the first Apple Silicon chip designed specifically for the Mac and then put into iPads. It has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU, while the A16 chip in the iPad 11 has a 5-core CPU and a 4-core GPU. What does that mean? The old iPad Air is faster than the new iPad 11. Benchmark tests show that M1 is around 30% faster than the A16 Bionic chip (keep in mind that the comparison is based on the iPhone 15 chip, which has an additional CPU and GPU core compared to the chip in the iPad 11). The M1 also has 8GB of RAM, which is better for multitasking and AI tasks. Because of this, the M1 iPad Air supports all the features of Apple Intelligence, as well as features such as Stage Manager for using multiple app windows simultaneously and an external monitor with the iPad. iPad 11 supports none of these features. The 5th generation iPad Air also has a USB-C 3.1 port with speeds of up to 10 Gbps, while the USB-C 2.0 port on the iPad 11 is limited to 480 Mbps. This means that transferring files between the iPad and an external device (such as a camera) is much slower on the iPad 11. The Air is also compatible with Apple Pencil 2, which has more features than the USB-C Apple Pencil for iPad 11. In short, these are the advantages of the 5th generation iPad Air over the iPad 11: Thinner and lighter design Better display Faster chip and better graphics More RAM Stage Manager support Apple Intelligence support Apple Pencil 2 support USB-C 3.1 As a counterpoint, iPad 11 has only one advantage over the iPad Air launched in 2022, and that’s the fact that it starts with 128GB of storage, while the M1 Air starts with 64GB. Which one to choose? If you just want an iPad to watch videos and read, it might be worth saving a few dollars and buying the new entry-level model for just $349. Of course, students can get it for even less from Apple’s educational store, so that’s something to consider. But if you want access to the latest iPadOS features and are looking for a laptop replacement, the M1 iPad Air is certainly a better deal. Even today, the M1 chip can handle the heaviest tasks and games with ease, and it runs all the same software features as the latest iPads. Apple sells the refurbished M1 iPad Air for $379 in its 64GB version. Apple Certified Refurbished Products are pre-owned products that undergo Apple’s stringent refurbishment process prior to being offered for sale.
