  "description": "Macworld Over the past few years, Apple has overhauled its entire product range, including transitioning the Mac from Intel to its own processors, introducing the tough Apple Watch Ultra, adding a new Plus model to the iPhone lineup, and introducing a brand-new product category – the Vision Pro headset.  In 2025 there’s even more change coming, with a new ‘Air’ iPhone rumored, a mysterious HomeHub display, a long overdue Mac Pro update, and much more. Read on to find out what’s coming from Apple in 2025. In this article, we take a look at what new products we expect Apple to launch throughout 2025 and beyond. We have investigated every rumor and trend we could find to bring you our predictions. Read on to find out what could be in store. New Apple products launched so far in 2025 Before we begin with the predictions, here’s a quick look at what Apple released so far in 2025: February: iPhone 16E – the replacement for the iPhone SE and iPhone 14 brought Apple Intelligence support to the entry-level iPhone. March: iPad Air M3 and A16 iPad launched on March 4 and MacBook Air M4 and M4 Max Mac Studio on March 5. Apple’s 2025 new products so farFoundry What else is expected in 2025? Various products haven’t been updated for a long time – specifically the Mac Pro (which never even got an M3 update). So an update to the Mac Pro is anticipated for 2025, perhaps at WWDC in June, but what else is coming from Apple? In the sections below we’ve split products into categories including Mac, iPad, iPhone, and some new product categories. Read on to find out what to expect at Apple’s next event and throughout 2025. New iPhones Foundry A new set of iPhones arrived at Apple’s iPhone event on September 9, 2024 and then the iPhone 16E arrived on February 19. What’s next for the iPhone? We can be pretty certain that a new iPhone will arrive in September 2025, as it always does. iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air! The rumors suggest there will be a new addition to the iPhone 17 line up in 2025. In September, Apple is also expected to introduce a new model: the iPhone 17 Air which will bring a fresh design and new features. Read: iPhone 17 rumors for the latest information we have. When? September 2025 iPhone 17e The iPhone 17e, on the other hand, isn’t expected until early 2026. The iPhone 16e was introduced in February 2025. Things may change later in 2026. The iPhone 18 Pro could launch that September, but Apple could delay the iPhone 18 and release that handset alongside the iPhone 18e in the spring of 2027, according to some reports. When? Spring 2026 New Macs Could we see the return of the iMac Pro in 2025? Apple The M4 Macs have arrived, so now Apple will be looking to roll out the M5 chip. But there is one Mac still waiting for an M4: the Mac Pro. We assume Apple is developing the M4 Ultra for the Mac Pro and that it will arrive this year. Here’s what you can expect from the Mac lineup for the remainder of 2025: M4 Ultra Mac Pro Earlier in 2025 Apple updated the Mac Studio with an M4 Max, but the M4 Ultra update didn’t happen, instead Apple made an M3 Ultra chip just for the Mac Studio. So where does that leave the M4 Ultra Mac Pro? We assume that Apple is either experiencing difficulty with the M4 Ultra, or it has decided to further separate the Mac Studio and Mac Pro by reserving the very best chip for the Mac Pro. We don’t expect Apple to change anything else with the M4 Ultra except for Thunderbolt 5 implementation, but we do expect to see it quite soon. Read: M4 Mac Pro rumors for more information. When? June 2025 at WWDC M5 MacBook Pro Apparently work on the M5 chip was underway as early as January 2025 and the M5 MacBook Pro will be arriving at the end of 2025 (probably in October as usual). The iPad Pro may be the first to get the M5 chip though (more in the iPad section below). Read: M5 MacBook Pro: Everything you need to know. When? October 2025 M4 Ultra Mac Studio The Mac Studio was updated in March 2025 when it gained an M4 Max and an M3 Ultra chip. Will the Mac Studio get an M4 Ultra when the Mac Pro does? Probably not straight away. When? TBC iMac Pro The M4 iMac delivered some new color hues, but it still has a 24-inch screen. Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac way back in 2022 when the Studio Display arrived, and there have been rumors ever since that Apple is working on a new large-screen iMac. Apple is said to be working on a new “Pro” version of the iMac, a return of the 27-inch iMac Pro perhaps, or even larger. There are enough rumors to believe that Apple is indeed working on such an iMac, though it’s unclear whether it will arrive in 2025 or later. Read: Larger iMac Pro rumors. When? TBC M5 MacBook Air We don’t expect to see the M5 version of the MacBook Air until spring 2026, and we don’t expect much to change other than the processor. Read: M5 MacBook Air: What you need to know When? Spring 2026 New AirPods It’s been a while since Apple properly updated the AirPods Pro.Foundry The AirPods Max and AirPods Pro have had minor updates since they launched a few years ago, but the next generation has yet to materialize. Will they get a full update in 2025? The wait for new AirPods Pro could stretch beyond 2025, but hopefully now. When they arrive, they could offer new health-related features when they arrive. As for the AirPods Max, there is a lot Apple needs to address here. Read: New AirPods rumors for more information. When? September 2025 New Apple Watch Mahmoud Itani / Foundry The Apple Watch Series 10 arrived in September 2024, with a slightly larger screen, but there was no generational update for the Apple Watch Ultra or the Apple Watch SE. Apple will surely release a new Apple Watch in 2025 along with new Apple Watch Ultra and SE models. The Apple Watch Ultra may gain the ability to send emergency texts via satellite. We could also see blood pressure monitoring on the new Watches in 2025. Some reports say Apple could move the Apple Watch SE launch to spring. Read: Apple Watch Series 11 When? September 2025 New iPads The iPad ProDominik Tomaszewski/IDG Almost the whole iPad range got a refresh in 2024, with the new iPad Air and iPad Pro in May and the iPad mini in October. The iPad finally got an update in March 2025 (albeit a pointless one as it still doesn’t support Apple Intelligence) and the iPad Air got upgraded to the M3 chip at the same time. So, what’s next? M5 iPad Pro The M5 chip is, apparently, set to arrive in the iPad Pro in September 2025, a month before it arrives in the MacBook Pro. Although later rumors suggest that the update will come after the MacBook Pro… Perhaps both at the same time? Read: M5 iPad Pro: Everything you need to know. When? September/October 2025 New product categories If Apple was never to innovate away from the products it makes right now it could be left behind as technology progresses. It’s no surprise therefore that the company is working on various new areas. We don’t expect these to land in 2025, but rumors suggest that some of them still could arrive sooner rather than later. HomePod with screen A HomePod that combines the screen of an iPad could be on the cards.Foundry We do hope there is some truth in the rumors that Apple is working on a HomePod with a screen. We’ve always said that a screen would make the HomePod infinitely more usable, but perhaps we are the only ones who hate having to talk to our speaker and control the HomePod via an iPhone (which can be a drain on the battery). A screen would extend the uses of the HomePod beyond audio into visual – so you could watch podcasts and news reports and YouTube videos, but most usefully communicate via FaceTime. So far all Apple has done is brought back the full-size HomePod that it removed from sale. Read: HomePod with screen rumours. When? 2025 HomeHub for the smart home Possibly connected to the HomePod with screen rumors are claims that Apple has big plans for the smart home and is working on a number of HomeHub related products. One is said to be an iPad like smart displays that allow you to control your home devices vis HomeOS software. Another device is said to mount a camera on a robot arm that can follow you around! When? Late 2025, 2026 Cheaper Vision Pro The Vision Pro is pricy and a little cumbersome, but Apple is said to be at work on two updated models: a cheaper Vision Pro, and another high-end model. Perhaps “Vision Pro 2” and “Vision Air?” There could be four new AR/VR products coming in 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. These could include a cheaper Vision Pro model (at $2,000). When? TBC Apple Car If you were hoping for a physical Apple Car prepare to be disappointed. Apple has cancelled the Apple Car project after about a decade of development. But this doesn’t mean there is no future for Apple’s car-related research. A second major iteration of CarPlay could takes things beyond maps and music to the next level, giving users complete control over things like climate control inside the car. Apple apparently wants to revolutionize the vehicle user interface and make it more user-friendly, convenient and functional. Read: The Apple Car is dead. Where does that leave Apple’s auto ambitions? New Apple products that launched in 2024 Here’s a quick look at what Apple released in 2024: The Vision Pro headset arrived in the U.S. on February 2. The M3 MacBook Air launched on March 4. The M2 iPad Air, the M4 iPad Pro, and the Apple Pencil Pro all launched on May 7. iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus launched on September 9. iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max launched on September 9. Apple Watch Series 10 launched on September 9. AirPods 4 launched on September 9 and new colors (and USB-C) for the AirPods Max were introduced. iPad mini A17 Pro launched on October 15. Apple launched the M4 iMac, Mac mini, and MacBook Pro the week of October 28. What Apple released in 2023 Apple hit the ground running in 2023 and closed the year with the Vision Pro, although it didn’t arrive until 2024: M2 Mac mini Mac mini with M2 Pro 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro with M2 Pro chip New full size HomePod (bit of a surprise this one!) A larger 15-inch MacBook Air A new Mac Pro with the M2 Ultra A new Mac Studio, also with M2 Ultra and M2 Max. iPhone 15, Plus, Pro and Pro Max 2023 Apple Watch Series 9 And Ultra 2 M3 iMac M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max MacBook Pro (14-inch and 16-inch) And of course, the brand-new Vision Pro headset was unveiled What Apple released in 2022 12.9-inch and 11-inch M2 iPad Pro 10.9-inch iPad, 10th generation iPhone 14 and 14 Plus iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max Apple Watch Ultra Apple Watch Series 8 Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) AirPods Pro (2nd generation) iPhone SE (3rd generation) iPad Air (5th generation) Mac Studio (1st generation) Studio Display M2 MacBook Air M2 13in MacBook Pro What Apple released in 2021 HomePod mini in new colors MacBook Pro with M1 Pro and M1 Max AirPods (3rd generation) Apple Watch Series 7 iPhone 13-series iPad mini (6th generation) iPad (9th generation) iMac M1 iPad Pro M1(3rd and 5th generation) Apple TV 4K (2nd generation) AirTag What Apple released in 2020 AirPods Max MacBook Air M1 13-inch MacBook Pro M1 Mac mini M1 iPhone 12-series HomePod mini iPad Air (4th generation) Apple Watch SE iPad (8th generation) Apple Watch Series 6 27-inch iMac (Intel) 13-inch MacBook Pro (Intel) iPhone SE MacBook Air (Intel) iPad Pro (2nd and 4th generation) For information about what Apple launched in the decade before that read: Best Apple products of the decade (2010-2019)",
