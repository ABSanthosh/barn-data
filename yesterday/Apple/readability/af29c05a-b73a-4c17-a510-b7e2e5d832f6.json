  "text": "We’re only three months away from the next WWDC, when Apple will unveil iOS 19. According to recent rumors, the update will be a big one, focusing on introducing a new design for the iPhone and iPad operating system. But it seems that Apple has other cards up its sleeve, as a new report from Bloomberg says that iOS 19 will have a live translation feature for AirPods. Live translation coming to AirPods with iOS 19 Citing sources familiar with the matter, Mark Gurman says that the feature will be able to translate a live “in-person conversation” from one language to another. The feature will be offered for current AirPods models as part of the iOS 19 update later this year. For instance, if an English-speaking user is listening to someone speaking in another language, the iPhone will use the AirPods’ microphones to automatically translate the speech. The iPhone will then translate the English speech into another language in real time. It’s unclear whether the new feature will be exclusive to the latest generation AirPods Pro or whether Apple will make it available for older models as well. Last year with iOS 18, Apple introduced new hearing health features for the second-generation AirPods Pro. Bloomberg reported earlier this week that Apple has big plans for its operating systems. This includes introducing a new design that will make the interface more consistent between iOS, macOS, and visionOS. Apple also plans to “simplify the way users navigate and control their devices.” As for AirPods, the company has been exploring the idea of putting cameras in its wireless earbuds. The cameras would be used to power artificial intelligence features, such as Visual Intelligence, without the need to take the iPhone out of your pocket. However, there’s still a long way to go before the release of these rumored AirPods with built-in cameras.
