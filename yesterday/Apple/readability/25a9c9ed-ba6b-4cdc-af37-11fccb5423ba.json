  "text": "All of us at AppleInsider wish you a happy and peaceful holiday season, and thank you for reading us throughout a roller-coaster 2024. Every year for the last 25 has been a big one for Apple, and you'd expect it for a company of its size. It launched the Apple Vision Pro, it joined the AI arms race with Apple Intelligence, and even found some time to release new products like the iPhone 16. With the end of the year fast approaching, the Apple News cycle is temporarily winding down, but AppleInsider won't be taking a break. Throughout the holidays, we will be with you, sharing the latest news stories and using our expertise to discuss how the news of the day impacts our favorite company, as it happens. It's also a time when the editorial team does a lot of preparation work for CES 2025, which kicks off the year. As usual, AppleInsider will be on the show floor, checking out new products that their creators claim will be the future of the industry. Of course, this time of year is dominated by a more immediate event for many people, as they have to come to grips with Apple products given as presents. Millions of people will have a new iPhone, an Apple Watch, or maybe some AirPods as a gift from others, or even to themselves. Whether you're in need of assistance setting up your new hardware — or the likely scenario that you have to be family tech support once again — we have guides covering how to set up new devices, which we continually keep up to date. As the year prepares to tick over to 2025, AppleInsider looks to the future, as always. It's been 27 years since our founding, and AppleInsider has repeatedly evolved to serve its readership as the tech news landscape changes. Taking into account all members of our editorial team, we have well over a century of experience with Apple hardware to draw on. From the newest releases to some of the oldest items from the company's history, we've got it all covered. It's one thing to have all of this expertise, but getting it out into the world to the people who need it most has been a shifting problem. Google's algorithmic changes, social media's unsteady relationship with the media, and journalistic shifts force us, and pretty much everyone else in the tech news space, to change battle plans all the time. We are already making changes to meet these new challenges, but you can always have your say on what we do. Over the next two weeks, we'll be discussing how we work, and what we work with, so you can see behind the scenes of our offices, spread across the globe. And, you can join the discussions on the AppleInsider forums to have your say on the year, check out the opinions of your fellow readers, and to make new friends while most of the tech world takes a breath. As always, we will see you in the comments, the forums, social media, YouTube, and our Discord, now and in 2025.",
