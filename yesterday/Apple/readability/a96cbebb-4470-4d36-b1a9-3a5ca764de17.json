  "description": "Macworld Apple just released the new M4 MacBook Pro with a faster chip, but the model it replaced is still no slouch—especially when you can grab one on a crazy clearance sale. Amazon is selling the M3 MacBook Pro with 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage for $1,399, a savings of $600 and the best price we’ve ever seen for this configuration. It’s hard to believe you’re going to find a deal better than this for this configuration, which features twice the memory and storage as the base model. Usually available for $1,999, this MacBook Pro runs on an M3 chip and 16GB of memory alongside a sizable 1TB SSD. That’s the perfect recipe for a speedy laptop with a ton of storage space for photos, videos, and all your work files. The 14-inch Liquid Retina XDR display is absolutely gorgeous and we fell in love with it when we reviewed the laptop. The screen has vibrant colors, high brightness that makes it easy for you to take the laptop to the garden to work, and the sharpness we’ve come to expect from Apple. We also have to praise the battery life because with an estimated 22 hours of use time, you’ll be just fine leaving home without a charger. So forget the M4, skip Black Friday, and save $500 on the MacBook Pro with the M3 chip at Amazon right away. Save $500 on this MacBook ProBuy it now at Amazon",
