CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced Apple Music is celebrating Kendrick Lamar’s Road to Halftime with a spotlight on the era-defining artist who has made a seismic impact on hip-hop and culture. Coming off of a remarkable year, Kendrick was among the top 10 artists of 2024 globally, with his latest album, GNX, soaring to No. 1 in 129 countries upon release, while “Not Like Us” was the top-streamed song on Apple Music worldwide. Throughout his career, Kendrick has seen nine albums top Apple Music’s top albums chart in more than 160 countries. “Throughout his career, Kendrick Lamar hasn’t met the cultural moment so much as he’s defined it,” said Rachel Newman, Apple Music’s global head of content and editorial. “He is an artist’s artist — authentic to his core. We couldn’t be more thrilled to watch him headline the third Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show this year, in what’s sure to be another moment we’ll all be talking about for decades.” Fans can get ready for the big event with a wide selection of music and exclusive content, from the first-look trailer Kendrick shared last month; to exclusive playlists curated by New Orleans musicians, NFL players, and teams; to over 100 hours of dedicated Apple Music Radio programming.
