If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Sonuby is a different kind of weather app, designed for users who often partake in outdoor activities. For example, if you often snowboard, you can have a weather forecast that places snow conditions front and center. Weather needs can be very individualistic, which is why Sonuby allows you to tailor the app to what you care about. Features As mentioned earlier, Sonuby has specialized weather reports for varying outdoor activities. It’s built around the concept of use-case based usage, and offers the following reports to help you out: Skiers and snowboarders can focus on snow conditions and temperatures Surfers can focus on wave heights, periods, and tides Skydivers can focus on cloud cover and wind speeds However, Sonuby also has features for more casual users. It has a “Daily Life” report as well, providing up to a 14 day weather overview, an hour-by-hour live forecast, and detailed maps for temperature, radar, humidity and pressure, cloud cover and precipitation, UV and sunshine hours, weather warnings, wind and gusts, and visibility.
