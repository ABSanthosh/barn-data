Photo: Nanoleaf Known for its modular light panels, Nanoleaf pushed boundaries Tuesday at CES 2025 with a new and slightly disturbing LED Light Therapy Face Mask as well as its first smart floor lamp. Those are in addition to other lighting products, like light strips, plus a new software subscription service. Nanoleaf LED Light Therapy Face Mask, Smart Multicolor Floor Lamp and more In a surprising move at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nanoleaf ventured into the personal care market with its LED Light Therapy Face Mask. Priced at $150 but now 10% off in a preorder deal, this skincare device goes right on your face and harnesses the power of Near Infrared Light (NIR) technology to address various skin concerns. In another first for the Canadian company, it also put out its Matter Smart Multicolor Floor Lamp, plus new light strips and a new software subscription service. LED Light Therapy Face Mask Light therapy might boost health, but good is this mask’s appearance when it comes to self esteem?Photo: Nanoleaf The mask, pictured above and cleared by the FDA for use, features multiple LED light colors, including red, blue, white, cyan, green, and yellow, each serving specific therapeutic purposes. With seven specialized treatment modes and an ergonomic design that conforms to facial contours, the device aims to tackle issues such as fine lines, acne and uneven skin tone. Research has indicated that red light therapy, in particular, may contribute to skin firming benefits, the company noted. Price: $149.99 $135 (early bird deal) Preorder from: Nanoleaf Matter Smart Multicolor Floor Lamp This sleek floor lamp gives you ample lighting options.Photo: Nanoleaf The company also makes its first foray into floor lighting with the Smart Multicolor Floor Lamp. It’s a sleek addition to its smart home lineup. Bearing a design reminiscent of the Philips Hue Signe, the $100 lamp integrates seamlessly with both the Nanoleaf app and HomeKit through Matter connectivity. Users can access an impressive palette of over 16 million colors, create dynamic color gradients, and sync their lighting to music using Nanoleaf’s in-app scenes. Price: $99.99 $90 (early bird deal) Preorder from: Nanoleaf New light strips For entertainment enthusiasts, Nanoleaf has introduced two innovative light strip products designed to enhance viewing experiences. The PC Screen Mirror Lightstrip and the 4D V2 TV light strip both feature a zigzag design that allows for better screen-edge adaptation without requiring additional mounting brackets. The PC version, specifically targeting computer users, can mirror on-screen colors during gaming and movie playback, though it currently lacks Mac compatibility. For television viewing, the 4D V2 includes an improved camera system with a stronger, longer mount suitable for wider screens. This camera captures and reproduces on-screen colors in real-time, creating an immersive viewing environment. Both products are scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2025, with pricing details to be announced closer to launch. New software subscription service Complementing the new hardware, Nanoleaf introduced a new software subscription service called Nanoleaf Premium. The service, priced at $1.99 monthly or $19.99 annually, brings two major features to the Nanoleaf Desktop app for Mac or Windows. The first is Orchestrator, an advanced music synchronization system that goes beyond basic beat matching to analyze and interpret musical themes, creating more sophisticated lighting effects that match the music’s style. The second feature, Scenescapes, combines lighting effects with ambient sounds to create immersive relaxation experiences, including beach and fireplace themes. Get a one-month free trial. The integration with Matter over Wi-Fi ensures broad compatibility with smart home platforms, while the new premium software services suggest a strategic move toward more sophisticated lighting control and entertainment features.",
