  "text": "Meta on Thursday announced a new feature coming to Instagram users. More specifically, this new feature should benefit those who like to watch Reels, Instagram’s short video platform that competes with TikTok. With the update, users can fast-forward Reels videos. You can now fast-forward Instagram Reels Over the last few years, both TikTok and Instagram Reels have considerably increased the maximum length limit for videos. Whereas previously videos could only be up to 15 seconds long, they can now be many minutes long. As a result, some people felt the need to skip or fast-forward through the videos. TikTok already had a fast-forward option, and now Instagram is adding a similar feature to Reels. Users who have already received the update can now watch videos at 2x speed by pressing and holding either side of the screen while watching Reels (via TechCrunch). While some users will certainly welcome the new feature, others – especially creators – may be concerned about how the short video format is affecting people’s ability to focus on longer content. On a related note, Instagram has been working on a new mobile video editor app called Edits. While the app was expected to be released this month, Meta has once again delayed its launch. The app will compete with CapCut (owned by TikTok) with options for shooting and editing videos on smartphones. Instagram is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed to get access to the new features.
