  "text": "Apple is set to expand its retail footprint in India by opening its third store at Bengaluru’s Phoenix Mall of Asia, as reported by Business Standard. The move underscores the company’s commitment to the Indian market, at a time when this growing partnership is provoking tension with President Trump. According to the report, the new store will occupy approximately 8,000 square feet on the first floor of the Phoenix Mall of Asia in Hebbal, Bengaluru. This size is comparable to Apple’s Delhi outlet, but smaller than its flagship Mumbai store, which spans over 20,800 square feet. Additionally, the lease (which is set for 10 years) includes a revenue-sharing component, a common arrangement in high-traffic malls: Apple will pay 2% of the store’s revenue for the first three years, increasing to 2.5% thereafter. This expansion aligns with Apple’s broader strategy in India. CEO Tim Cook recently confirmed plans to open four new retail stores in the country, including locations in Pune, Mumbai, Delhi-NCR, and Bengaluru. The company’s first two Indian stores, in Mumbai and Delhi, opened in 2023. New store signals increasing reliance on India Apple’s retail expansion in India comes at an odd time, amidst escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China. As Tim Cook told analysts during Apple’s Q2 2025 financial call: “For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the U.S. will have India as their country of origin, and Vietnam to be the country of origin for almost all iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and AirPods products also sold in the U.S. China would continue to be the country of origin for the vast majority of total product sales outside the U.S.” In response, President Trump has threatened to impose a 25% tariff on iPhones not manufactured in the U.S., aiming to push Apple toward domestic production. Whether that threat will alter Apple’s trajectory in India is anyone’s guess, but the new lease for a third store, with more on the way, suggests the company won’t be hitting the brakes anytime soon.
