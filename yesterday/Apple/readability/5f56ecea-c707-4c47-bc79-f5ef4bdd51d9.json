As part of bringing Vimeo to the Apple Vision Pro, filmmaker Jake Oleson has published a short film dubbed ‚Äòcurrents‚Äô.

The cinematography style that resembles photographs coming to life to me. ‚Äòcurrents‚Äô is also an easy viewing with wonderful music and a thoughtful story. Do give it a watch on Vision Pro if you can. Accompanying the short film is a very cool director interview blog post on Vimeo that shares more about the process: As part of the launch of Vimeo‚Äôs¬†new app¬†for Apple Vision Pro, we asked him to create an original short film for us that was shot entirely in spatial format. Armed with a single Canon camera with a dual fisheye lens, Jake and his team flew out to Vietnam to create ‚Äúcurrents,‚Äù the story of a young Vietnamese woman named Lynn, and her experience traveling to and arriving in Ho Chi Minh City for the first time. Meanwhile, there‚Äôs plenty of great spatial and 3D content AVP users should have queued up and ready to view.
