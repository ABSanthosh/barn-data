  "text": "From the beginning, Meta built its Threads microblogging platform with fediverse integration in mind. However, this integration has been rolling out in parts, and there’s another important update coming. Threads users can finally follow accounts from other fediverses, although there are still many limitations. Threads integration with the fediverse is getting better As announced by Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri on Wednesday, a Threads update being rolled out today expands fediverse integration even further. Threads users will have the option to follow accounts from other fediverses, so that they will see posts from those accounts in their timeline. It’s also possible to enable notifications for fediverse accounts. This is certainly a huge leap from the previous integration, which only let users share their Threads posts in the fediverse and see fediverse replies and likes on their posts. However, there’s a catch. Users can only follow fediverse accounts that have interacted with them on Threads posts. It’s still impossible to search for fediverse profiles, although Meta says this option will be available in the future. There’s still no way to reply to fediverse posts from Threads either. Of course, that’s certainly a start for those who believe in the fediverse. Meta seems to have been ramping up the development of new features for Threads recently, coincidentally when its competing platform Bluesky has been growing significantly. Last month, Meta began testing an option to let Threads users choose which feed they want to see by default. The app has also been updated with the ability to play full-screen videos in landscape and an option to let users create Custom Feeds based on their interests. The Threads app is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed in order to get access to the new features.
