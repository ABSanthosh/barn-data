  "text": "Apple is launching its first products of the year in just a few days, per reporting from Mark Gurman. Here’s what’s coming, plus some launches that could surprise us. iPhone SE 4 Apple’s next iPhone is almost here. The iPhone SE hasn’t been updated since 2022, so it’s overdue for an upgrade. The new iPhone SE 4 is expected to launch next week and will pack a ton of great features. Here’s what’s coming: OLED edge-to-edge display Face ID and a notch A18 chip USB-C charging 8GB RAM Apple Intelligence support 48MP Camera plus Apple’s in-house 5G modem Many of these features first debuted in the iPhone 16 just a few months ago, so getting them in Apple’s budget model is especially exciting. The current iPhone SE starts at $429, but the new SE 4 may start closer to $499. Even with a price increase, though, this will easily be the best iPhone for most people to buy. Powerbeats Pro 2 Gurman also says there’s at least one more Apple product launching next week: Powerbeats Pro 2. Apple and Beats have been teasing the new PowerBeats Pro 2 for a while, including recent sightings on Tiger Woods and Rory McIlroy. Gurman expects the new earbuds to be introduced “as early as Feb. 11.” As we’ve reported previously based on an iOS 18 beta leak, the new Powerbeats Pro are expected to feature a fresh, slimmer design, and come in purple, orange, and light brown. One of the big highlights will be the inclusion of a heart-rate sensor—a feature expected to come to AirPods Pro 3 later this year. Wildcards: M4 MacBook Air, M3 iPad Air, and iPad 11 Gurman explicitly stated that the new iPhone SE 4 and Powerbeats Pro 2 are expected next week. But he also hinted that other product launches could be in store. The M4 MacBook Air, for example, has been expected to arrive right around now. Gurman previously hinted that it might be the first Apple product launch of the year. Now, reportedly, stock of existing MacBook Air models is “dwindling” at Apple’s retail stores. This could be a sign that the M4 launch is imminent. Similarly, Gurman says that the M2 iPad Air has been unusually low in stock at Apple Stores too. The expected M3 update could arrive sooner than we thought. Finally, Apple’s base model iPad is getting an 11th generation update soon. It was expected that the M3 iPad Air and new A17 Pro iPad would launch around the same time. Apple’s new product launches: wrap-up All of these potential product launches, plus rumor of the first iOS 18.4 beta’s arrival, could make for a very fun week from Apple. Perhaps we’ll see several days of product launches in a row, similar to what Apple did back in October with its M4 Mac introductions. That staggered launch strategy seemed like a hit for Apple, so here’s hoping we get to see it happen again next week. Which new Apple products are you expecting to see next week?
