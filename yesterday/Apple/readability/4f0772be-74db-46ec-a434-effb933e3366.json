  "text": "News Apple took another early step toward releasing iOS 18.6. Image: Apple/Rajesh Pandey/CultOfMac Apple on Monday released the third round of betas for iOS 18.6, macOS Sequoia 15.6, iPadOS 18.6, watchOS 11.6, tvOS 18.6 and visionOS 2.6. That’s despite the company unveiling their eventual replacements, iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26 at WWDC in June. While that might seem odd, this is normal. The general public should get access to these betas later this week. iOS 18.6 and macOS 15.6 beta testing begins Apple is always working on improving the operating systems for all its devices. And just because it’s already looking ahead to the OS versions it’ll release this fall, that doesn’t mean it’s given up on the current ones. So while Apple used WWDC25 to give the world its first look at iOS 26 and macOS Tahoe 26, work continues on the versions that initially launched in September 2024. That means the company’s developers are coding two versions of them at the same time. Hence the periodic rounds of betas for iOS 18.6 and macOS 15.6, along with betas of iPadOS 18.6, watchOS 11.6, tvOS 18.6 and visionOS 2.6. Apple released the first round of betas for these platforms on June 16, then the second round on June 30. These focus on bug fixes, not new additions. While Apple keeps working on these soon-to-be obsolete versions, this late in the cycle, the company saves important new features for the next major upgrades coming in autumn. Just for devs Currently, this most recent round of updates for the current software for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV are available only for those in Apple’s developer program. It’s possible the full non-beta release will come soon. Alternatively, the third betas of iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, iPadOS 26, etc., are also available for developers to test.",
