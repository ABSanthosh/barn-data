  "text": "iOS 26 is out, with it’s all new shiny Liquid Glass interface, and new features like backgrounds and polling in Messages app, improvements to Apple Intelligence, Live Translation in FaceTime, Phone, and Messages, CarPlay improvements, enhancements to the Phone app, a new Games app, and more. It’s no wonder there’s so much interest in iOS 26 for iPhone, and since anyone can install the iOS 26 beta right now (though most should not), you might be wondering if your iPhone supports iOS 26 too. It turns out the compatible device list with iOS 26 is fairly generous, though a few iPhone models that supported prior iOS versions have been dropped. iOS 26 Compatible iPhone List iPhone 16e iPhone 15 Pro iPhone 13 mini iPhone 16 iPhone 15 Pro Max iPhone 13 Pro iPhone 16 Plus iPhone 14 iPhone 13 Pro Max iPhone 16 Pro iPhone 14 Plus iPhone 12 iPhone 16 Pro Max iPhone 14 Pro iPhone 12 mini iPhone 15 iPhone 14 Pro Max iPhone 12 Pro iPhone 15 Plus iPhone 13 iPhone 12 Pro Max iPhone 11 iPhone 11 Pro iPhone 11 Pro Max iPhone SE (2nd generation and later) As you can see, basically any iPhone model newer than iPhone 11 will support iOS 26, along with the newer model iPhone SE. This list comes from Apple and pertains to both the iOS 26 beta as well as the iOS 26 final, due out in the fall. iOS 26 System Requirements Aside from having a compatible iPhone model, there are some basic system requirements for iOS 26. The iPhone must be connected to the internet, so that iOS 26 can be downloaded, and you’ll need an Apple ID as well. You’ll want to be sure you have at least 30 GB of free storage available on the iPhone to be able to complete the download and installation of iOS 26. That’s really about it, so have fun with iOS 26 on your iPhone! Some iOS 26 Features Limited to Newest iPhone Models Of course, an iOS release wouldn’t be an iOS release if some features were not software limited to the latest hardware, and in this case Apple has a variety of features that are available in iOS 26 but only iPhone 15 Pro and newer (including any and all Apple Intelligence related features, a disappointing trend that Apple began with iOS 18, despite the fact that basically every LLM and chatbot works on considerably older iPhone devices). Specifically, you will need an iPhone 15 Pro or better to be able to use the following features: Live Translation in Messages, FaceTime, and Phone app Apple Intelligence related Reminders, suggetsions, and organization Apple Intelligence powered Messages background creation and poll suggestions Apple Intelligence features with Shortcuts and Actions Apple Wallet tracking of orders Genmoji and Image Playground Visual Intelligence using Apple Intelligence with screenshots Any older model iPhone prior to iPhone 15 Pro (even iPhone 15 base models!) do not support those features from iOS 26. Fortunately, even dusty old iPhone 11 users (the last tolerable iPhone screen for PWM sensitive users, thanks to it’s LCD display) can download and use ChatGPT on their iPhone, so while it’s not intermingled into the operating system the same way, you’ll still have powerful access to ChatGPT and AI features if you want them, you just have to download and use third party apps and services. What about iPadOS 26? What iPad Models are Compatible with iPadOS 26? iOS and iPadOS split officially a while ago, but they’re still basically the same operating system, with iPadOS having some features specific to larger screens. That’s particularly true with iPadOS 26, which has new and refined multitasking capabilities – again, maybe they’ll stick this time – and improved windowing and external display support. So, what about iPadOS 26? What devices can run that? iPadOS 26 supports any M-series Apple Silicon model of iPad, along with all models of iPad Pro 11″ from 1st gen or newer, iPad Pro 12″ 3rd gen and newer, and the iPad Air 3rd gen and newer, iPad mini 5th gen and newer, iPad Mini A17 model or newer, iPad 8th gen and newer.",
