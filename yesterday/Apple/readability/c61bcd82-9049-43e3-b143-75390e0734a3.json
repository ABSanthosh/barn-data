  "text": "News Bad news for anyone hoping for an M4 Ultra Mac Pro. Photo: Apple/Cult of mac Apple won’t show off any new hardware at its developers conference this week, according to a reliable source. There are apparently no Macs or other products ready to launch. Instead, WWDC25 will focus entirely on operating system upgrades and other software. WWDC keeps its focus where it’s supposed to be Each year, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference introduces new versions of macOS, iOS, watchOS, etc., to the coders who’ll write third-party applications for these operating systems. It’s a conference for developers — that’s right there in the name. But hardware occasionally sneaks in, too. Sometimes that’s because it’s a new computer for developers, like the Mac Pro unveiled at WWDC23. Other times, it’s because Apple wants developers to start writing software for a new platform, like the Vision Pro headset that the company also announced at WWDC in 2023. Apparently, neither situation will happen at WWDC25. “Apple has no hardware that’s ready to be released,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in his Power On newsletter Sunday. “Given the backlash over Apple Intelligence delays following its unveiling in 2024, the company is unlikely to debut a product that isn’t close to being ready.” No M4 Mac Pro at WWDC25 No new hardware at WWDC this week is bad news for those looking forward to an updated Mac Pro. Apple’s top-of-the-line model hasn’t been updated since WWDC23, which means it still runs an M2 Ultra processor. Those hoping for a version upgraded with a new chip will need to remain patient (or turn instead to the latest Mac Studio, which is up to 30% faster than the Mac Pro). It also seems Apple won’t announce long-rumored smart home accessories at WWDC25. The wait goes on for the screen-equipped HomePod and the wall-mounted HomeKit hub. AirTag 2 is also expected soon. But not this week, apparently. Of course, there’s no confirmation from Apple itself that there’ll be no new Macs at WWDC this week. We won’t know for sure until the keynote address Monday.",
