  "description": "Macworld After peppering its WWDC keynote with numerous “F1” references, it’s clear that Apple is going all out to promote its upcoming Brad Pitt flick. The latest move to drum up hype is a new trailer ahead of its June 27 release–but it not just for your eyes. Apple has released what it calls a haptic trailer for “F1,” and it’s exactly what it sounds like. As the trailer plays, your iPhone will vibrate along with what’s showing on the screen–engine revving, crashes, even seatbelt clicks. It’s a whole new experience for watching an iPhone video and somewhat reminiscent of the rumble feature on Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation controllers. It’s all very slick and gives a taste of what the movie will feel like in an 4DX theater, which are equipped with motion enabled chairs to “create strong vibrations and sensations, as well as other environmental controls for simulated weather or other conditions, such as lightning, rain, flashing (strobe) lights, fog and strong scents.” It could also be a taste of what Apple has planned for future immersive videos when used in conjunction with haptic accessories or a 2nd-gen Vision Pro headset. “F1” will release in theaters on June 27 and stream to Apple TV+ subscribers at a later date. @macworld.com We predicted Apple’s F1 WWDC intro #wwdc25 #apple #fyp ♬ original sound – Macworld – Macworld",
