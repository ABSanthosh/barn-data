  "description": "Macworld Yes, yes, Apple’s AirPods Max are gorgeous and all, but have you seen the Sonos Ace? Not only are these some of the best headphones out there, but they’re a better value than the Max, especially when they’re on sale: Amazon has slashed the Sonos Ace to $329 for the very first time, a savings of $120 and the best price we’ve ever seen. These over-ear headphones were built for what Sonos is known best for—impeccable sound. You’ll be able to enjoy high-quality music streaming like never before, thanks to crisp and clear audio, while spatial audio and noise cancellation will allow you to immerse yourself in the songs. We tested the headphones and found they do an amazing job at reducing annoying background noise. while Sonos’ Aware Mode keeps you alert when needed. You’ll get about 30 hours of playback when using ANC, while a short charge gives you an extra three hours of use. So go get your dad when he really wants this Father’s Day and order the Sonos Ace for their best price of $329 before the price shoots back up.",
