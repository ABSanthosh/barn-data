Aside from Apple's Mac models with displays, consisting of the 24-inch iMac and the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro lineups, the company does offer a few external screens. That selection is rather limited at the moment, consisting of the Apple Pro Display XDR and the Apple Studio Display, both of which have yet to have any updates. If a claim from Display Supply Chain Consultants' Ross Young is correct, Apple could be upgrading the Apple Studio Display for the first time. The X post from Young on Thursday says that sources have revealed to him plans to upgrade the Apple Studio Display. However, the upgrade won't change much about the display, but it will apparently modernize the backlighting. The current Apple Studio Display relies on an LED backlighting system. This would theoretically be switched out for a miniLED system, similar to the screens used in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro before the switch over to OLED, as well as the MacBook Pro displays. The technology uses larger numbers of miniLEDs than in a typical LED backlight, allowing for a more even spread of light shining through the LCD panel. It also allows for localized dimming, providing deeper black shades approaching the levels of OLED panels. The switch to miniLED isn't the only change that could arrive with the display. Young adds that Apple could introduce ProMotion to the screen as well. ProMotion is Apple's adaptive refresh rate system, which can go up to 120Hz depending on what content is being displayed on the screen. This would be a considerable improvement over the existing screen, which manages only 60Hz. The change would be massive for users, as this would provide an external display that can run at such a high refresh rate. One that other display producers have provided to the market for years. So far, it doesn't seem that there are any other real changes to be made to the screen, with it still being 27 inches in size and sporting a 5K resolution. However, Young rules out the possibility of it being a New iMac model, as it is definitively a screen, not an all-in-one computer. There are also unanswered questions about the existing Apple Studio Display, as there is a possibility that Apple could keep the model around as the entry-level option. The upgraded version could potentially be sold alongside the current edition, at more of a premium. Young and DSCC have a very good reputation when it comes to display-related rumors. Many claims are based upon supply chain checks and other screen-related sources, which is the research firm's speciality. Young does say that a launch later in 2025 is probable, but there may be a small opening for Apple to introduce it earlier. On Thursday, Apple CEO Tim Cook teased the arrival of \"the newest member of the family,\" with a launch on February 19. While it is believed to be the launch of a new iPhone SE, the cryptic nature of Cook's social media post could potentially also include an introduction of the new display too.",
