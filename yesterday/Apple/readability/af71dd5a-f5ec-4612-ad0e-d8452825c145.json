  "text": "MacPaw, the company behind many great Mac apps such as CleanMyMac and Setapp, unveiled Eney at CES 2025. It’s an all new AI assistant for your Mac, aiming to simplify your digital life. Eney will help you complete tasks quickly, effortlessly, and with ease. In simple terms, Eney feels like magic. You’ll be able to talk to Eney, ask it to do a task for you, and it’ll just do it. MacPaw is in a unique position to develop this tool, since they’ve already established great relationships with many Mac app developers through Setapp. Eney will have many capabilities, but some of the top ones include: Sending emails for you Converting a file format Uninstalling apps Writing notes Cleaning your Mac for you Quickly trimming videos Downloading videos for you Helping you sort through unread emails Extracting audio from a video And more! MacPaw is going to have all sorts of integrations with third party developers to make this possible. Eney will exist as a little window on your Mac, with most tasks being handled in the background, with no need for apps to be opened in the foreground. Certain apps will be able to have miniature interfaces within Eney if necessary. All Eney tasks will be processed using an on-device model that MacPaw is developing, and your local documents and personal information will never be sent to a cloud-based AI provider, such as OpenAI or Google. Eney will be available later this year, and you can sign up for the waitlist and email updates right here. They’ve also uploaded a trailer to YouTube, which you can check out to learn more: What do you think of MacPaw’s Eney announcement? Let us know in the comments.
