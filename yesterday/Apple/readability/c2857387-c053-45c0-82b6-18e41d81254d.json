The Circular Ring is a smart ring that offers fitness tracking capabilities in an extremely compact package. The second-generation model takes the concept further, with enhancement and more flexibility. The Ring 2, offered in gold, silver, black, and rose gold finishes, is made from titanium for ruggedness in everyday life, in a new more durable design. For 2025, Circular also makes it easier to get the right fit via Digital Ring Sizing, ensuring the user gets the correct size from the start. Along with the previously available heart monitoring features, the Ring 2 adds an ECG capability as part of its enhanced sensing capability. The sensors are also claimed to be more accurate than before, giving users an even clearer picture of their health. The battery life this time lasts for up to eight days, 24 hours per day, including when used for sleep-stage analysis. Recharging is also simpler, thanks to the use of a wireless charging dock. On the software side, the Kira AI in the companion app has been redesigned to match the new ring aesthetic and to give a more intuitive experience. The Circular Ring 2 will be available from $380 in February or March, after a crowdfunding campaign in January.",
