  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Pinning is a unique calendar countdown app for iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple Vision. It offers a visually appealing way of keeping track of birthdays, calendar events, anniversaries, and more! It also includes a number of native-feeling design elements. Top features First and foremost, Pinning is a calendar app at heart. You can sync your iPhone’s Calendar app to Pinning, allowing you to keep track of all of your important upcoming events through a quick scroll. Pinning also supports a number of great Apple ecosystem features, including iCloud Sync, support for Siri Shortcuts, Spotlight, and interactive widgets. You can also collaborate on event lists through iCloud, making it easy to share a brief schedule with a friend or colleague. The app also puts a huge emphasis on birthdays and anniversaries, making it easy to keep track of those important dates in your life. You can also organize events with tags, or sort them into different notebooks. Pinning also makes it easy to set up recurring events. About the app Obviously, there have been a number of countdown apps on the App Store, but Pinning aims to be different by focusing on the more novel features, while also being a simple to use app that fits in your ecosystem. And honestly, in my eyes, it feels like the right way to handle calendars. Pinning also prioritizes user privacy, and doesn’t serve any in-app advertising, even for free users. It also has a number of fun app icons and customization options. Download ‘Pinning’ Pinning is available for free on the App Store for iPhone/iPad running iOS 17 or later, Apple Watch running watchOS 10 or later, and Apple Vision Pro on all visionOS versions. For all of Pinning’s premium features, such as the ability to sync your devices calendar, you can purchase Pinning Pro, for $1.49/month, $11.99/year, or $29.99 lifetime.
