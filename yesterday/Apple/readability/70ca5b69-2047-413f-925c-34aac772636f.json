  "description": "Macworld Apple released the beta 2 of macOS 26 Tahoe on Monday, and while we don’t know yet the complete story of what’s new in the beta, we do know one thing: Apple has changed the Finder icon back to the old color scheme. The worldwide Mac community can breath a collective sigh of relief. The implementation of the icon addresses a major controversy that arose when Apple first released the Tahoe beta at WWDC a couple of weeks ago. In that first beta, Apple took the Finder icon and flipped the colors. It made for a disorienting impression–some would say it was downright wrong. You could get around it by using the new icon tinting in Tahoe, but you always knew that underneath that tint was a Finder icon you didn’t grow up with. A downright impostor. But, as aaronp613 points out, Apple has reverted the Finder icon back to the color scheme we’re all familiar with. The icon still features a new design influenced by the Liquid Glass look, but the essence of the icon has been preserved. Give Apple credit, betas are for testing things out, and it heard the feedback about the icon and listened. Apple will release the official version of macOS Tahoe in the fall. In the meantime, expect more changes and tweaks as Tahoe goes through its beta cycle. Developers can access the beta now, with a public beta coming in July. Learn more about macOS Tahoe.",
