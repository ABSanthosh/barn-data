Today: new iOS 19 leaks, iPad Fold on track for 2026, HomePad status update, and a special 20th anniversary iPhone Pro design. Here are this week’s Apple rumors. Revealing new iOS 19 leaks Credit: Jon Prosser’s Front Page Tech This week Jon Prosser published a new video that, if accurate, provides our best look yet into iOS 19’s rumored new design. Highlights include more rounded icons that are still squircles, search bars at the bottom of apps, new tab bar designs, glassy elements throughout, and more. Prosser even says iOS 19 will have an iPhone 17 Pro-exclusive Camera app feature. My takeaways If Prosser’s leaks turn out to be an accurate portrayal of some of iOS 19’s changes, I think Apple is definitely on the right track. A big redesign is a risky move, and Prosser’s mockups show Apple demonstrating care and balance with its design choices. It doesn’t seem to be making as extreme of changes as, for example, iOS 18’s Photos app did. But Apple also seems to be infusing enough new elements in iOS 19 that the iPhone software should feel fresh. So far, I’m optimistic. iPad ‘Fold’ may still be on track for 2026 Reporting from Mark Gurman has pinned Apple’s upcoming 18.8-inch foldable iPad for a launch in 2028 or later. But this week analyst Jeff Pu reiterated his previous claim that Apple will launch the iPad Fold in late 2026 instead, alongside its first iPhone Fold. My takeaways I’m not entirely sure what to make of this report. If Gurman says 2028 or later, then I find it hard to believe we could see the iPad Fold next year. No doubt, Apple could make an especially big show of launching iPhone Fold and iPad Fold at the same time. And I hope it does so. I’m just wondering if Pu’s information might be outdated. ‘Bold’ new iPhone Pro design for 20th anniversary Over the weekend, Mark Gurman reported that Apple is planning a “bold new Pro model that makes more extensive use of glass.” This is part of Apple’s plans to celebrate the iPhone’s 20th anniversary. No other details are yet available, and there’s even uncertainty over whether the device is next year’s iPhone 18 Pro or 2027’s iPhone 19 Pro. My takeaways There’s not a lot to go off here. What does using more glass mean? But as far as timing goes, I’m inclined to think this anniversary iPhone Pro is coming in 2026, not 2027. In his report, Gurman paired the iPhone Pro’s mention with the iPhone Fold which is coming next year. He has also previously said 2026 may bring ‘another new iPhone design.’ Finally, it makes sense to honor the iPhone’s 20th with a device that launches shortly before the iPhone announcement anniversary rather than many months after. That way, Apple can sell the new iPhone throughout the product’s entire 20th year. ‘HomePad’ might become a 2026 product Originally expected to be in users’ hands by this point, Apple’s ‘HomePad’ smart home display now may get punted to 2026. Mark Gurman says the company “is considering a delay until 2026, when [new] Siri features are expected to land.” My takeaways I’m very torn on this report. On one hand, from everything we’ve heard about the HomePad, Siri’s upgrades don’t necessarily seem essential to its usefulness. Sure they’ll make it a better product, but I’d love to get my hands on some HomePads even with the current Siri. I understand, though, if Apple wants to make more of an impact with HomePad when it launches as part of a renewed smart home push. You only get one chance at a first impression. And I’m sure the company remembers early HomePod reviews fixating on Siri’s inability to set multiple timers. Debuting HomePad at the same time as Siri’s big AI upgrades could provide a lot of momentum for the product, and the new and improved Siri overall.
