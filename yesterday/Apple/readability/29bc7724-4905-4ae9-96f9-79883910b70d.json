  "text": "Mac OS X Jaguar 10.2 may have been released all the way back in 2002, but thanks to the InfiniteMac project, you can also run Mac OS X Jaguar on your modern Mac right now with just a web browser. Sure you might even have an old dusty Mac laying around in a closet that can run Jaguar, but if you’re just looking to play around with two-decade old operating system, opening a web browser is quite a bit easier, and that’s really all there is to it. You might already be familiar with the InfiniteMac project, a browser-based Mac emulator that allows you to run old versions of the Ma operating system directly in a web browser, whether that’s System 7 or Mac OS 8, and now you can run Mac OS X Jaguar 10.2 as well. Head to the Mac OS X Jaguar page on InfiniteMac here Mac OS X Jaguar 10.2 boots up right away when visiting the web page, then it’s just a matter of waiting for it to load. The browser window will capture your cursor so that you can use it in Jaguar, but hitting the Escape key on your Mac will allow you to exit the cursor (sometimes you have to hit the escape key a few times, in my experience). Performance is usable, but not nearly as fast as the other InfiniteMac emulations of Classic Mac OS – yet anyway – so expect a slower experience, especially if you have grown accustomed to the very speedy virtualization available on Apple Silicon Macs. This is not that. But it’s Mac OS X Jaguar, running in a web browser, and that is pretty cool. You might also find that running Mac OS X 10.2 Jaguar this way through a browser is more prone to crashing, which is sort of weirdly fun to see kernel panics and crashes confined to a browser window, but that also makes it impractical for heavy usage at the moment: But don’t let the occasional kernel panics or crashes dissuade you from poking around in this old version of Mac OS X, which has the funky Aqua pinstriped interface that some people absolutely loved and others hated, and is a fun little blast from the past to play around with. It’s a full installation of Mac OS X Jaguar, so you can play around with the desktop, run old bundled default applications, adjust System Preferences, and just have a little fun.",
