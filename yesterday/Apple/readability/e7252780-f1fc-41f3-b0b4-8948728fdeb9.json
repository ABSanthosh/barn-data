  "description": "Macworld iPhone data recovery apps are the kind of tool you hope you never need, but you’ll certainly be glad to find one when it’s needed. iPhones have become more and more advanced, with new cameras and more storage meaning they’re chock full of precious memories and moments. They’ve also become more durable, with water and dust resistance and toughened, ‘Ceramic Shield’ glass, but they’re not indestructible. If you’ve ever dropped your phone, or plugged it in for a simple restore process and found that your backups are corrupted, you’ll want to reach for the best iPhone data recovery software. We’ve rounded up our picks of the best options available right now, but as with all things data recovery, there’s never any absolute certainty that your files can be restored. With that in mind, we’d recommend ensuring you have an iCloud backup where possible, and maybe one on your computer, too. See: How to back up your iPhone. PROMOTIONBlack Friday Special: 50% Off EaseUS MobiSaver EaseUS MobiSaver could be your lifesaver as it recovers iPhone data from iOS devices, iTunes, and iCloud in simple 3 steps. Any type of files are supported to be restored like photos, videos, contacts, messages, notes, calendars, Voicemail, Safari bookmark, voice memos, call history, WhatsApp, Viber, Kik, LINE, apps’ data \u0026 attachments. Now 25% OFF Exclusive Code: CRAZYBF Shop and Save 50% What to look for when choosing a data recovery app As you’ll see, data recovery software tends to be expensive: it can afford to be because the people who need it are often desperate. However, before you spend lots of money have a look to see if a free trial is available, at least then you can establish if anything can be recovered before spending your money. Just note that the free trial is likely to be missing key features and very unlikely to recover anything for you without demanding payment. Our sense is also, unfortunately, that this is a market with a high percentage of scams. The reason we’ve only included six products below is that all the others we tried seemed, well, a bit dodgy. And many of the dodgier denizens of this market are fond of inserting themselves into comment threads and forum posts, so be careful about using software you’ve heard about unless you’ve had a recommendation from a) someone who has actually tried it and b) definitely isn’t a fake bot account. We also have a Mac data recovery apps article. If you are looking for a way to recover deleted text messages read: How to get back deleted text messages on your iPhone. Best iPhone recovery apps Note: These are Mac apps that can uncover lost files on your iPhone (and other places), not apps that run on the iPhone. Dr. Fone Pros A la carte pricing Simple interface Platform agnostic Cons Pricey with all features included Pop-ups make it feel cheap Crashes Price When Reviewed: Data Recovery from $59.95 per year (usually $68.95); Full Toolkit $99.95 a year (usually $139.95); Perpetual license $115.95 (usually $162.95). Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Wondershare Dr. Fone from Wondershare is a comprehensive data recovery app that offers a wide range of features, including the ability to remove Apple ID and locks, spoof GPS location for games like Pokemon Go, transfer WhatsApp data to other devices, copy data to a new phone, erase data, or recover passwords. The interface is simple but impressive, with app icons on the sidebar for easy navigation. The “Toolbox” menu provides options to remove Apple ID and locks, spoof GPS location for games like Pokemon Go, and transfer WhatsApp data to other devices. However, users must plug their phone in, unlock it, and ensure their computer is trustworthy before performing any actions. Dr. Fone is effective at recovering deleted files and data. In our trials it was able to recover WhatsApp images from chats dating back years.  The package is currently available for $99.95/£78.86 a year or $115.95/£91.48 on the perpetual plan, with tax added at the point of sale and a 24-month warranty. However, users can save money by purchasing data recovery access for $59.95/£47.30 per year or $69.95/£55.19 as a one-off fee, which works for up to five devices. Dr. Fone is an impressive software with an array of extras that may not be needed. It is an all-in-one toolbox that is impressive and expensive, but its value lies in the individual features it offers. While the app may not be perfect for every user, it is a valuable tool for those looking to recover lost files or deleted photos. Read our full Dr. Fone review EaseUS MobiSaver Pros Impressively stable Mac app Great recovery potential The free option could be ideal Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $59.95 per month; $79.95 per year; $99.95 lifetime membership Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Easeus (monthly) EaseUS Mobisaver is a recovery tool that can recover contacts, media, app history, and more, even when using backups rather than the actual device. It is used in repair shops worldwide (the Windows version is cheaper, of course). The app comes in at $59.95/£55.70 per month or $79.95/£74.29 per year, while a lifetime membership is $99.95/£92.87. EaseUS Mobisaver has a unique look and feel, with a bluish/purple hue and slick animations while it’s scanning data. It took around 35 minutes to scan a phone, which was faster than expected.  Mobisaver can recover a wide range of content types, from messages, WhatsApp, Safari Bookmarks, deleted Reminders, or Calendar appointments. The Free version allows for a smaller number of items to be recovered at once, while the Professional version removes these limits. Both versions can also recover data from iTunes or iCloud backups. However, if you need to quickly recover something, you will need to be prepared for a long wait. In our tests, EaseUS Mobisaver finished its initial scan, then took more time to scan and showed 100% completion while still running, making it difficult to predict its duration.  Despite its price and slow performance, EaseUS Mobisaver is a great recovery app tailored more to businesses than everyday consumers. Read our full EaseUS MobiSaver for Mac review Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone Pros Affordable for most users Reliable recovery Cons Looks dated Price When Reviewed: $59.99 (price cut to $39.99) Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Stellar Info Stellar Data Recovery is a user-friendly iPhone data recovery tool that offers plenty of recovery potential though, including a user-friendly price tag. The app is regularly on sale for $39.99/£39.99 a year, with additional features geared towards enterprise device management included in its Toolkit options. With a license that allows users to use Stellar with a trio of iPhones, users can pay $40/£40 for a year and have their entire family covered. Stellar has been in the recovery game for years, but compared to alternatives it has a dated-looking interface. The app’s gray color makes it feel like an app from a decade ago, but it does provide a nice scanning animation as it digs through your phone’s data. The app is faster than some options we’ve tested, thanks to a basic scan that can find some data, acting as a sort of ‘triage’. After that, a Deep Scan is needed to find further data, which can be slower. The app is lightweight and reliable, even on iOS 18.1 beta devices. It performs well with WhatsApp attachments, deleted contacts, and Notes, but you need to pay to recover anything other than Safari Bookmarks. Stellar also recovers from iTunes and iCloud backups, so if your device is dearly departed, your data may not be. Although the aesthetics may be a small pain point for some users, Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone offers an impressive suite of recovery options at a solid price point. Read our full Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone review Disk Drill Pro Pros Slick UI Very thorough recovery Free option may suffice for many Cons Pro version is expensive Price When Reviewed: Basic: Free; Pro: $89; Enterprise: $499 (pay extra for lifetime upgrades) Best Prices Today: $89 at CleverFiles Disk Drill from CleverFiles is a user-friendly app that prioritizes data recovery, allowing users to quickly sift through deleted files within minutes of installation. The free plan is suitable for those recovering under 500MB of data, while the Pro version costs $89/£70.56 with an additional option to add future updates for around $15/£15. Enterprise users can purchase a bundle of user licenses. Disk Drill offers additional features beyond data recovery, such as identifying duplicate files, detecting data hoarding, and backing up files to prevent accidental deletion. Its sidebar displays all potential drive locations for recovery, including local, NAS, RAIDs, and other devices. It even factors in Time Machine data for quick data access. In testing, Disk Drill was able to recover a large number of old WhatsApp messages and contact information from an iPhone, although it took around an hour to scan. It also has a duplicate finder that runs on local storage and cloud-based options like Dropbox or Google Drive. Data Protection stores a copy of a deleted file for future reference. Disk Drill can create a backup macOS boot drive or a disk image of your entire hard drive, ideal for older Macs with mechanical drives that could fail. However, the only complaint with Disk Drill is its occasional issues when a phone locks itself, which may be a bug. While Disk Drill may be expensive for one-time users, it is a reliable safety net for regular data recovery from devices or for enterprise users. We also looked at Disk Drill Pro for Mac. Read our full Disk Drill Pro review FoneLab Pros Can also fix iOS errors. Can save to a number of file formats. Price When Reviewed: $69.95 (price cut to $55.96) Best Prices Today: $55.96 at FoneLab FoneLab is easy to use on macOS, offering a simple way to recover a whole host of data. Scanning is free across iOS, iTunes backups (if you’re still using those), and iCloud data, but recovery is limited to three instances on the free plan. FoneLab’s premium version ($70 for a lifetime license for 1 Mac and 6 mobile devices) will allow a user to recover data from any of the above. It also covers messaging services like Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as Viber, Kik, Line, and WeChat.  It’s perhaps not quite as full-featured as options like Disk Drill, but it is an affordable option that can cover a family’s devices for a relatively affordable fee. Once you boot up the Mac version of FoneLab for the first time, it is transparent about what you can gain from the premium version. You simply plug in your phone, enter your passcode, and hit ‘Scan’. Scanning is faster than some rivals, but analyzing that data takes a little longer.  It’s nice to look at, with a clear sidebar of filters and a main window that displays previews so you can pick what to recover. Within around 45 minutes I could see a whole host of images I thought were lost to time, including deleted product shots from old reviews and duplicate pet photos. It can restore from iCloud backups, too, which is handy if your device is lost or stolen. Rather than offer a multitude of features, FoneLab is focused on doing the recovery part well. The iOS System Recovery tool could be helpful if you’ve inadvertently bricked your phone, while the option to back up and restore your phone locally is handy, but also something offered by Apple’s own toolkit. WhatsApp transfer is useful for anyone fed up of the lengthy process of switching between phones and having to wait for your data from the messaging app to come with you.   This is a solid recovery option, while it lacks the bells and whistles you’ll find elsewhere, FoneLab is a relatively affordable option that feels ideal for families with multiple devices. Read our full FoneLab review FonePaw Pros Preview window so you can choose what you recover. Cons Can be a bit slow. Price When Reviewed: $66.47 per year Best Prices Today: $76.97 at FonePaw Another option with an easy-to-use interface, FonePaw offers a really great preview window that helps surface all of your content across photos, videos, notes, chat apps, and plenty more. That makes it easier to recover – pick what you need, and hit the button. It’s also a little cheaper than some options on this list for an annual license, but it’s still not cheap and there’s no recovery without paying. There is, however, a monthly payment option if you really just want to spend the absolute minimum to recover something. Some users have noted that it takes a long time to scan through a device, though. Also it’s practically a clone of FoneLab (above).

Scanning is faster than some rivals, but analyzing that data takes a little longer. \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s nice to look at, with a clear sidebar of filters and a main window that displays previews so you can pick what to recover.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWithin around 45 minutes I could see a whole host of images I thought were lost to time, including deleted product shots from old reviews and duplicate pet photos. It can restore from iCloud backups, too, which is handy if your device is lost or stolen.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eRather than offer a multitude of features, FoneLab is focused on doing the recovery part well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe iOS System Recovery tool could be helpful if you’ve inadvertently bricked your phone, while the option to back up and restore your phone locally is handy, but also something offered by Apple’s own toolkit.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhatsApp transfer is useful for anyone fed up of the lengthy process of switching between phones and having to wait for your data from the messaging app to come with you.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis is a solid recovery option, while it lacks the bells and whistles you’ll find elsewhere, FoneLab is a relatively affordable option that feels ideal for families with multiple devices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead our full \n\t\t\t\t\t\u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/2536616/fonelab-review-iphone-data-recovery-option.html\" score=\"\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFoneLab review \t\t\t\t\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003ch2 data-p_name=\"FonePaw\" id=\"fonepaw\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFonePaw\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/h2\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;https:\\/\\/b2c-contenthub.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2023\\/05\\/Best-Data-Recovery-Software-FonePAW.jpg?quality=50\\u0026strip=all\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;product-chart-item__image\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: FonePaw\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;FonePaw\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" alt=\"FonePaw\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Best-Data-Recovery-Software-FonePAW.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"1920\"/\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003ePros\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePreview window so you can choose what you recover. \u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrice When Reviewed:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cspan\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t$66.47 per year\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/span\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnother option with an easy-to-use interface, \u003ca href=\"https://go.skimresources.com?id=111346X1569486\u0026amp;xs=1\u0026amp;url=https://www.fonepaw.com/store/buy-mac-iphone-data-recovery.html\u0026amp;xcust=1-1-668872-1-0-0\u0026amp;sref=https://www.macworld.com/article/668872/best-data-recovery-apps-for-iphone.html\" rel=\"nofollow\" data-subtag=\"1-1-668872-1-0-0\" data-domain-name=\"fonepaw\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFonePaw\u003c/a\u003e offers a really great preview window that helps surface all of your content across photos, videos, notes, chat apps, and plenty more.
