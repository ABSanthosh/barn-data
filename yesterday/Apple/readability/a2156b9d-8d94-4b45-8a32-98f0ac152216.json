  "text": "Apple is preparing some additional vision based products, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. We’re expecting smart glasses, similar to Meta’s collaboration with Ray-Ban, as well as AirPods with cameras. These products won’t launch until at least 2027, if they do at all. According to the report, Apple wants to salvage some of their multi billion dollar R\u0026D investment in Apple Vision Pro’s visual intelligence – by bringing the tech to more products. We already saw this with the announcement of visual intelligence alongside the iPhone 16’s camera control, and Apple’s next step is to reportedly bring this to a glasses form factor. The glasses wouldn’t be full AR glasses with displays, but rather smart glasses with built in cameras, speakers, and mics – similar to Meta’s Ray Ban glasses, which have become pretty popular. Meta sells those glasses for as low as $299, although there are more expensive frames you can pick. On top of that, the company is still planning AirPods with cameras, something that’s been reported on previously. It’s unclear why these would be an appealing product rather than just glasses, and it feels like AirPods would be a bad product for outward facing cameras, but Apple is still experimenting with the form factor for visual intelligence features nonetheless. What do you think of Apple’s potential plans for additional Vision products? Let us know in the comments.
