Like many great Amazon deals, they tend to shift quickly, so if you’ve been thinking of getting a 16GB model MacBook Air now might be the time. To get the deal price you will need to clip the on-page coupon for some colors, whereas others show the discounted price right away, and others in the cart. The M2 MacBook Air features the powerful and energy efficient M2 chip, a nice 13.6″ Retina LCD display, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage, backlit keyboard, 1080p FaceTime camera, MagSafe charger, two USB-C ports, and is available in Midnight, Starlight, Space Gray, and Silver color options. Grab the M2 MacBook Air 16GB RAM for just $749.99 (down $250 from $999) Remember to clip the on-page coupon to grab the deal price, it’s pretty small but the screenshot below shows where to find it: Amazon is also offering the larger 15″ M3 MacBook Air at a discount in various configuration and color options, though it’s not as dramatic as a deal as the M2 16GB Air model mentioned here.
