  "text": "News An update on the original Vision Pro headset will boost processing power and improve comfort. Photo: Leander Kahney/Cult of Mac Apple prepares to launch its first major update to the Vision Pro AR/VR headset as early as this year, featuring a faster M4 processor and a redesigned strap aimed at addressing comfort complaints that have plagued the $3,499 device since its launch, according to a new report. The updated Vision Pro will include the M4 chip currently found in the iPad Pro, MacBook Pro and iMac, according to Bloomberg. That’s a big upgrade from the three-year-old M2 processor in the current model, but it’s not the M5 some sources predicted. Apple also tests versions with additional cores in the neural engine, the component responsible for processing artificial intelligence tasks critical to the headset’s live imagery and application processing in virtual environments. So those upgrades, along with a significant redesign resulting in a lighter weight and more comfortable use, might have to wait for future versions. And that’s even as Apple tries to make progress on smart AR glasses, too. Addressing the comfort problem Apple on working on new strap designs specifically engineered to reduce neck strain and head pain. Those are the most common complaints about the roughly 1.4-pound device. The company hopes to address these comfort issues without significantly reducing the hardware’s weight in this first update. The current Vision Pro ships with two strap options. One wraps around the back of the head and another also goes over the top for better weight distribution. Despite these options and third-party solutions, including bands from sleep apnea mask developers, comfort remains a persistent issue for many users. Limited impact expected While the hardware improvements represent meaningful upgrades, industry observers don’t expect this refresh to dramatically boost consumer adoption. The price point is expected to remain at $3,499. And the fundamental weight and bulk issues won’t be fully resolved until a more significant redesign planned for 2027. That future model, currently code-named N100, is expected to be substantially lighter and is being designed with completion targeted for next year, Bloomberg said. This represents Apple’s longer-term strategy to make the Vision Pro more appealing to mainstream consumers. Broader product strategy The Vision Pro update comes as Apple continues to struggle with the device’s market reception. The company has sold only hundreds of thousands of units since the February 2024 launch. That falls short of the transformative success Apple achieved with the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. The headset also suffers from a lack of compelling exclusive applications, contributing to its lukewarm reception. Apple plans to release visionOS 3 later this year, which will include virtual widgets and eye-scrolling capabilities to enhance the user experience. Competition heating up Apple faces increasing competition in the mixed-reality space. Meta offers rival devices at much lower price points. Samsung plans to release its Moohan headset later this year with similar capabilities but potentially lighter weight and lower cost. Meta is also advancing toward true AR glasses, with plans for a 2027 release that could beat Apple to market. Apple also works on other related products. They include smart glasses similar to Meta’s Ray-Ban collaboration, targeted for late 2026, and true AR glasses planned for before 2030. Apple CEO Tim Cook has reportedly made success in this category a key priority.",
