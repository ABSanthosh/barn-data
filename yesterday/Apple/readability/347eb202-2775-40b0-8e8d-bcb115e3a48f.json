Repair parts for the iPhone 16 lineup are now available to order in the US and other countries, including for those wanting to fix their iPhone for themselves. Following the release of the repair manuals for the iPhone 16 in September, it's now possible to acquire replacement parts for repairs from Apple directly. This is a continuation of a move starting in 2022 towards more user repairability of its products. Batteries, one of the most common replacement parts, sell for $99 for the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus, or $119 for the iPhone 16 Pro or Pro Max. Likewise, replacement camera assemblies cost $169 or $249, depending on the model. Displays range from $279 to $379. Parts can be found and ordered from Apple's self-service repair store. Users can also replace the rear camera system, back glass, top and bottom speakers, the TrueDepth camera for Face ID, and other parts. The repair kits, which include machines to disassemble the devices, are available to rent for $49 for seven days. Apple has said that it will offer better support for select third-party replacement batteries and displays in the future, as MacRumors noted. Used genuine Apple parts will also be supported for DIY repairs. While doing your own repairs on an iPhone with the kits from Apple makes it possible to save money on some repairs, the company does note that self-repair is best suited for \"individuals who are experienced with the complexities of repairing electronic devices.\" The manuals outline proper safety precautions for dealing with potentially dangerous parts, such as batteries.",
