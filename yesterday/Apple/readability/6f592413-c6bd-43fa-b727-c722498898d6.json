  "description": "Macworld One laptop we recommend to anyone and everyone is this amazing MacBook Air. And wouldn’t you know it, but it’s $250 off at Amazon right now, which means you can get it for a crazy-low $1,249. When we reviewed the MacBook Air M3, we put it succinctly by saying it’s “simply the best, but better.” We gave this laptop a 4.5-star rating, appreciating the excellent battery life, top-notch performance, and great price point. We also loved the design and display as well as the ability to run two external displays. The 15.3-inch Liquid Retina display this laptop comes with is absolutely gorgeous, with super crisp images, vivid colors, and great brightness. The laptop comes with 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD, which should be enough for most day-to-day scenarios. This MacBook comes with a Thunderbolt 3 port, but this official Apple Thunderbolt 4 cable for half off will work just fine. So, if you’re looking for a laptop upgrade, now’s a great time to get the new MacBook Air before the price jumps back up. Buy now at Amazon",
