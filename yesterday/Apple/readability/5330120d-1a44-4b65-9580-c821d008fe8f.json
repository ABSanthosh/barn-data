  "text": "Apple has issued the third beta versions of iOS 18.6, iPadOS 18.6, and MacOS Sequoia 15.6, to users participating in the beta testing programs of current gen system software. These beta releases are concurrent to iOS 26 beta and MacOS Sequoia 26 beta, and if you’re running one of the 26 betas you will not be able to access or see them without downgrading first. With that said, betas of current gen system software are basically just focused on bug fixes and security improvements, so any new features and major efforts for development are undoubtedly being deployed by Apple to the beta development of iOS 26, iPadOS 26, and macOS Sequoia 26. While these betas are comparatively unexciting, they do offer an idea of when the next notable software updates will arrive for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Since Apple goes through several beta releases before issuing a final version, it’s a good bet that iOS 18.6 and MacOS Sequoia 15.6 will be finalized sometime later this month or next month. If you’re enrolled in the current gen beta testing programs, you’ll find the updates available through the Software Update settings. For iPhone and iPad beta testers, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update \u003e Beta Updates \u003e Select ‘iOS 18 Developer Beta’ and then return to Software Update, and you will find the latest iOS 18.6 beta 3 version available. For Mac beta testers, go to  Apple menu \u003e System Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update \u003e Beta Updates \u003e Select “MacOS Sequoia Developer Beta”, to find the latest macOS 15.6 beta 3 release available. Again, if you’re actively running a 26-series beta, you’d have to downgrade to find these beta versions available, but that’s likely undesirable for anyone but registered developers who are ensuring app compatibility.",
