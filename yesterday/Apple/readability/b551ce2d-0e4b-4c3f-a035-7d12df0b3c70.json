If you need to cancel an app download on iPhone or iPad, it’s a very easy process to accomplish. How to Cancel Ongoing App Downloads / Installation on iPhone or iPad Canceling an ongoing app download or installation is easy, here’s all you need to do on iOS or ipadOS: Locate the app that is downloading on the Home Screen of iPhone or iPad Tap and hold on the app icon that is downloading until the contextual menu appears Choose “Cancel Download” to stop the app download The app will stop downloading immediately. While the canceled app download will disappear from the iPhone Home Screen, it can be downloaded again at any time to the iPhone or iPad by simply finding it again on the App Store, and then choosing to download the app again. Note that if the app that is downloading or loading shows as a blank icon with cross/circles and a grid looking appearance then the ‘Cancel Download’ option might not appear, because the app is in the process of loading. Can I temporarily pause the app download / install instead? You can also pause an app that is downloading or installing by tapping on the icon itself, where a pause button becomes visible. Tapping on the icon again will resume the download. Can I stop or cancel an iOS/iPadOS system update in progress? If the iOS or iPadOS update is currently downloading, you can stop the downloading and installation process of the iOS/iPadOS update by disconnecting from the internet with AirPlane Mode. If the iPhone or iPad is actively updating and you see an  Apple logo on the screen or a loading indicator, the update must continue and can not be canceled.",
