Apple has posted a second current bonus offer for its Apple Card, giving up to $200 cash back for users who apply for a new Apple Card and make 10 purchases per month on it. While the windows for the sign-up closes on March 21, cardholders will get credit for purchases made between receiving the card and December 31, 2025. The intention of the promotion appears to be to encourage new Apple Card holders to make using the card a routine choice, rather than for occasional use. There is no minimum spend on the qualifying purchases. The new offer appears to be Apple's first official sign-up bonus, notes 9to5 Mac, though the company has previously engaged in \"welcome\" and other bonuses to approved users. It is presently offering a $75 welcome bonus to new cardholders who were referred from a friend or family member. Apple Card in fluxThe promo page for Apple's existing $75 referral bonus does not, as usual, reward the person who referred a new user. It offers a $75 Daily Cash bump when a new user makes their first purchase on their new Apple Card within 30 days. As noted in the promotional material for both offers, the Apple Card rewards users with Daily Cash back on everyday purchases. Depending on the good or service purchased, Apple Card offers a one percent to three percent Daily Cash reward. The Apple Card, which debuted in 2019, does not charge annual fees, late payment fees, foreign transaction fees or any other type of fee. Users can apply to see if they are approved without any impact to their credit score. The card, which is currently set to change financial partners, also guides users on how to arrange payments in order to lessen interest charges. Apple Card users also do not have any of their data sold to third parties for advertising or marketing purposes, unlike most card competitors. Apple Card is currently only available in the US, and was estimated to have some 12 million users as of early 2024. Apple is currently seeking a new financial partner for the card, with Goldman Sachs seeking to exit its initial deal to back the Apple Card. With two bonuses to choose from, it might be obvious to choose the one that might result in $200. However, realize that you'll have to dedicate yourself to using the card 10 times a month for at least four months to get more money than the single $75 bonus.",
