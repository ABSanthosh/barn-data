  "text": "Today, Apple announced that veteran actor Michael J. Fox will appear in a guest role in Season 3 of Apple TV+’s acclaimed comedy series Shrinking. A poignant guest for a poignant show The news marks Fox’s first on-camera performance since his “second retirement” in 2020, due to complications from Parkinson’s disease, a condition he was diagnosed with in 1991 while filming Doc Hollywood. While there are no details on Fox’s character as of yet, his casting is particularly fitting, given that the show explores Parkinson’s disease through Harrison Ford’s character, Dr. Paul Rhoades. Fox’s involvement in Shrinking also reunites him with series co-creator Bill Lawrence, with whom he previously collaborated on the hit sitcom Spin City between 1996 and 2001. In fact, Lawrence has cited Fox as an inspiration for portraying the condition in an “inspiring rather than tragic” light. Fox’s return to acting comes after his Emmy-winning 2023 documentary, Still: A Michael J. Fox Movie, which was also released on Apple TV+. The documentary chronicled his career and journey with Parkinson’s disease. Season 3 of Shrinking will also feature other new guest stars , including Jeff Daniels, who will play Jimmy’s father, Sherry Cola, and Isabella Gomez. The series continues to follow therapist Jimmy Laird (Jason Segel) as he navigates personal and professional challenges, with a cast that includes Jessica Williams, Christa Miller, Luke Tennie, and Michael Urie. There is no word yet on when fans can expect the series’ return, but Apple has already promised “big feelings” up ahead. Apple TV+ is available for $9.99 per month and features hit TV shows and movies like Ted Lasso, Severance, The Studio, The Morning Show, and Silo.
