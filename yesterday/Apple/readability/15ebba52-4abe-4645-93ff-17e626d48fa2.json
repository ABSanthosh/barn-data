One of the more useful ways to take advantage of the Apple Intelligence features on iPhone, Mac, and iPad is to have the AI feature write emails for you. Can’t think of what to say? Or maybe you simply don’t want to write a particular email? Let Apple Intelligence write emails for you, and it’s quite easy to use this way, as we’ll show you here. How to Write Emails with Apple Intelligence on iPhone, Mac, iPad Here’s how to get Apple Intelligence AI features to write emails for you: Open the Mail app on iPhone, Mac, or iPad Go to Compose as usual to create a new email, and fill out the subject and who to send it to as usual Select into the body of the email, and then tap on the Apple Intelligence button (alternatively, right-click or long press into the text field and choose “Compose”) Select the “Compose” option Type a description of the email you want to write, for example “write a professional and concise resignation letter” Apple Intelligence will write out an email, which you can then edit or modify if needed, and send it as usual You’ll want to proofread the email before you send it out, but as you can see the writing of Apple Intelligence, which taps into ChatGPT, is really quite good and is more than satisfactory for many emails. Used properly, letting AI write your emails for you can save you a lot of time, and can be especially helpful for emails where you simply need to send a reply or write something out, but you either have writers block, don’t know quite what to say, or maybe you just don’t want to be bothered with writing something out. Remember, Apple Intelligence has very strict system requirements and requires a Mac or iPad with M1 Apple Silicon chip or better, and iPhone with iPhone 15 Pro or better. Earlier models of iPhone, Mac, and iPad, do not support Apple Intelligence, though you can get many of the same features by using the ChatGPT website or ChatGPT app. The Apple Intelligence composition features are based on ChatGPT, and while you can use it to write emails for you, you can also use it for things like creating a business plan instantly, a recipe, love letters (South Park did a parody of that), and just about anything else you can imagine. What creative uses of Apple Intelligence and ChatGPT have you come up with? Do you use this feature to write emails for you? Share your experiences and thoughts in the comments.",
