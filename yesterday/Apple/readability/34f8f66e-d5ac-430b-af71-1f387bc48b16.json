A similar plan to restrict imports of personal computing products was proposed last year, but the government delayed it after protests from Apple and other tech companies. According to Reuters, sources within the local government say that India plans to open consultations with manufacturers from late October. The plan is certain to be met with the same resistance as the 2023 attempt. However, companies require a licence to import products into India, and those licences are currently set to expire at the end of 2024. Consequently, firms will have to re-apply for approval regardless of what new conditions the government imposes. The unspecified sources say that India believes the industry has had sufficient time to adapt to the requirements bolstering domestic production. \"We are working on such restrictions as global treaties stop us from any tariff action on laptops and tablets,\" said a source. \"It leaves us with few policy options to limit imports.\" However, the sources also said that they could delay implementing the import restrictions by a few months if necessary. Currently, India gets two-thirds of its personal and business technology needs met through imports. As part of the new plan, the government is also considering new minimum quality standards to help restrict the flow of cheaper imports, mostly from China. India's moves to get more manufacturing done within the region comes as Apple is expanding its production there. At present, though, that local manufacturing is concentrated on the iPhone.",
