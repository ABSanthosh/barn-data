Photo: Apple TV+ The sci-fi action comedy Murderbot exploded onto the ratings charts after it reached streaming in May, and continues to be popular even as the season finale approaches. Many weeks after a launch, the series from Apple TV+ still appears on the top 10 lists of a company that tracks ratings. Plus, Owen Wilson‘s sport comedy Stick also pulls in plenty of viewers. Murderbot ratings: Enduring popularity Apple TV+ generally does well with sci-fi series, which isn’t surprising for a computer maker. Silo, Dark Matter, Foundation and others have all been hits for the streaming service. Murderbot, Apple’s latest foray into the genre, is about a cyborg — part robot, part human — built to provide security in very dangerous situations. The series follow the cyborg as it breaks the programming that forces it to kill … and then goes looking for a purpose. But don’t expect a traditional action show, as there’s plenty of comedy mixed in. Alexander Skarsgård, who won Emmys, Golden Globes and SAG awards for roles that include Succession, Big Little Lies and True Blood plays the eponymous lead character. The adaptation was done by Oscar nominees Chris and Paul Weitz (About a Boy, Mozart in the Jungle). It premiered on Apple TV+ on May 16, and over a month later remains consistently popular. Movie and TV search engine JustWatch put Murderbot in the No. 6 slot of its ratings list of the 10 most popular series in the U.S. on streaming services for the week of June 23 through June 29 (see chart below). A ratings service says Murderbot is one of the most popular streaming series. Plus, Stick drew plenty of eyes, too.Chart: JustWatch Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. The first nine episodes of Murderbot season 1 can be watched now. The season finale is scheduled to appear on Friday. Stick lands on the green again Stick stayed near the tops of the streaming TV popularity charts for a third week. The Apple TV+ series stars Owen Wilson in a feel-good sports comedy. In the series, Wilson plays an over-the-hill, ex-pro golfer whose career went off the rails decades ago. After his life gets even worse — his marriage fails and he’s fired from his job at a sporting goods store — the ex-pro bets his future on a troubled 17-year-old golf phenom. That might sound like a drama, but Apple calls it “a heartfelt, feel-good sports comedy about a found family and their relationships.” Perhaps it’s Wilson’s star power, maybe it’s the premise, but the new series found an audience. JustWatch put the series at No. 8 on its most recent chart (see above). Rival service Reelgood put the show in the No. 10 slot on its list for top-rated series for the week of June 26 through July 2. The first seven episodes of Stick season 1 are ready to watch now. The next premieres on Wednesday. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Murderbot and Stick, plus many others, come with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. And Apple’s streaming video service also includes a library of drama, comedies, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
