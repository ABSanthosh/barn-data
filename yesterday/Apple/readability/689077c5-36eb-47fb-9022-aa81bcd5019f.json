  "description": "Macworld During last week’s four-day “Prime Day” event, we saw AirPods 4 on sale for the lowest price ever. As expected, those prices went back up when the event ended–but they just dropped again, matching those steep Prime Day discounts. You can get the AirPods 4 without active noise cancelling for only $89, a 30 percent discount off its $129 MSRP and the lowest price we’ve seen. We think the AirPods 4 with ANC for only $119 is an even better buy, though. That’s 33 percent off, and again, the lowest price we’ve ever seen for these. The AirPods 4 with ANC earned our Editor’s Choice rating with a 4.5-star score when we reviewed them. We loved everything about them, chiefly the superb audio quality and excellent noise canceling without silicone tips. In our testing, the AirPods 4’s noise cancellation also delivered great clarity and volume when talking, while the Conversation Awareness feature works great to automatically lower the volume of what you’re listening to when someone strikes up a conversation. If you want to step up to Apple’s premium earbuds, AirPods Pro 2 are $169 now (32 percent off). It’s not the stellar price of $150 we saw during Prime Day, but it’s a good sale price we only see a few times a year.
