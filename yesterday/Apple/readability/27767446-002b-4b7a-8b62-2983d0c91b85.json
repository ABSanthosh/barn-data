The upgraded Beat Studio Pro was released in July 2023 with a proprietary Beats chipset that enables features across iOS and Android. The over-ear headphones are regularly available in four colors, but a new one has arrived. The Beats Studio Pro are now available in black and gold exclusively at Best Buy. The headphones are black everywhere except the headband cushion and accents. The headband cushion has an off-white color similar to Apple's starlight option. The metal portions around the hinges and the \"b\" logo are a shiny gold color. Beats Studio Pro are normally $349.99, but Best Buy has them discounted to $249.99. At less than half the price of Apple's AirPods Max, these are a great offering if you're looking for over-ear headphones with noise cancellation.",
