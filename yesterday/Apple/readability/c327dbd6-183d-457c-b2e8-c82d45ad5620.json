  "text": "Using AirTags to keep track of a dog can offer some additional peace of mind, especially if you’re worried about your fuzzy companion wandering off. Whether your dog has a penchant to escape out of your yard, has a tendency to bolt, or simply likes to run off at any opportunity, AirTags can provide a helpful way of locating them quickly, especially if you’re in a neighborhood, urban, or suburban environment where the Find My network is most useful as all other nearby Apple devices will help to track the location of that AirTag equipped dog. With an AirTags 4-pack being available for just $70, now is a particularly compelling time to equip your furry best friend with one of the personal trackers and an AirTag holder for their dog collar, so that you can improve your odds of being able to locate your dog should they ever get lost or separated from you. It’s important to know that an AirTag is not a replacement for a traditional dog collar with your phone number, but it is a great addition. One of the biggest benefits of using AirTags for tracking your dog is that it’s simple and affordable, especially compared to some of the expensive GPS trackers out there that may require a monthly subscription. Plus AirTags are cheap, compact, have no usage fees, and are easy and affordable to replace if your dog loses one. Plus, AirTags are water resistant, and combined with a good AirTags dog collar holder you’ll have added protection for the little trackers, even if it’s wet, snowy, or muddy outside. The best thing to do is get a good protective dog collar holder for the AirTag (I personally use this specific AirTag dog collar holder which is very cheap) and put it on your dogs normal collar. Then, if they go missing, you’re not sure where they are, or even if you just want to check up on them, you can open the Find My app on your iPhone, iPad, Mac, or whatever, and quickly locate their last known location. And if the dog is within Bluetooth range, you can use the Precision Finding feature to locate them quickly, though if they’re moving fast and out of range you’ll discover that too: If they’re further away, or the dog is lost, you can put the AirTag into “Lost Mode” which will alert you when it is detected by another Apple device via the Find My network, and if you’re in suburban or urban environment that likely won’t take too long since there are so many other people out there with iPhones and Apple devices in general, giving you pretty good odds of locating your dog again. Dog owners should appreciate the extra security that AirTags can offer for their best friend, and while they’re certainly not a replacement for a dog collar with the dogs name and your phone numbers, or a microchip, they’re fantastic addition for keeping track of your pet that is affordable to use, easy to implement, and offers some nice peace of mind to potentially be able to return your dog home safely, should they ever separate from you or your family. It’s worth pointing out that if you’re in a rural area, remote area in the wilderness, or somewhere far away from technology and other people, the utility of AirTags are not as high because the Find My network is not as effective (or available at all). For situations like that, you might want to equip your dog with a proper GPS tracker like this GPS equipped dog tracker with a 9 mile range for direct tracking of paths and other advanced features. I was inspired to write this post after having a frightening experience where I was unexpectedly separated from my dog and could not find her, but she did not have an AirTag at the time, and I really felt quite helpless. Fortunately a Good Samaritan found her and returned her to me, which is why you should always keep an identifying collar on your dog too, but after that experience I decided I was going to put an AirTag on her collar to offer some additional protection. For dog owners, they are a hugely important part of our lives and families, so give yourself some extra protection and peace of mind, and consider equipping them with an AirTag.",
