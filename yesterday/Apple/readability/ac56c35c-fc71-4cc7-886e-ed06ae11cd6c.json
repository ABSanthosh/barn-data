  "description": "Macworld Apple just issued a small update to iOS and iPadOS, bringing the version up to 18.3.1. The only change appears to be this security fix for USB Restricted Mode. USB Restricted Mode is that feature where you have to enter your iPhone or iPad passcode when you connect it to a computer or other USB device with a data connection, saying you “trust” that device. Without your passcode, the USB device only delivers power. Apple says the fix addresses a physical attack vector against this feature: “A physical attack may disable USB Restricted Mode on a locked device. Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals.” It sounds like some very specific people were targeted with this security flaw, and Apple has rushed to issue a fix for this very important security measure. Fix or no fix, you should never plug your iPhone into a USB device that you don’t know and trust. Apple released iOS 18.3 on January 27 but has yet to begin development of iOS 18.4, which is expected to bring several new Apple Intelligence features, including the new Siri. Apple will reportedly release the iPhone SE 4 this week, which could arrive as early as Tuesday. To update your iPhone or iPad, head over to the Settings app, then the General tab and Software Update, and tap Update Now.",
