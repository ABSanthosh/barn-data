Before proceeding any further, let’s understand what “humor” means so that any potential outrage addicts don’t have a meltdown. Here’s what the Apple Dictionary app defines Humor as; “the quality of being amusing” Now, we here at OSXDaily.com are a website that is focused on helping you use and learn Apple products, thus we are apolitical and nonpartisan, and this post is not a political statement. This is not a partisan thing, is that OK in this day and age? Humor can just be that, it can just be funny or amusing, OK? We do like to goof off, have fun, or simply be amusing sometimes. With that obvious preamble out of the way… Remember The Gulf of Mexico? How about its new name, The Gulf of America? Why not The Gulf of OSXDaily.com? That has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it, really rolls off the tongue… Or how do you feel about The Gulf of Gulf of the Gulf? The Gulf of Teriyaki Chicken? The Gulf of Bacon Burgers. When it comes to the Gulf, why let your imagination be limited by anything? While you may or may not be consumed by, or even addicted to, the relentless outrage cycle of the “news” and politics, if you have managed to still retain a sense of humor, you might appreciate this goofy offering from Mapquest. Remember Mapquest? You know, Mapquest, one of the first map sites that we all used long ago to get directions online, long before the days of Google Maps, Bing Maps, and Apple Maps. Well it turns out that Mapquest is still around, and they released a funny, completely pointless, but entertaining tool that lets you rename the Gulf of America / Gulf of Mexico into anything you’d like. Check out gulfof.mapquest.com and have some fun There’s not a lot to this, just name the gulf as you’d wish, and generate a map with your custom named Gulf. Send it to your colleagues, send it to your friends, send it to your family, send it to Apple, send it to Google, send it to the president of the USA, send it to the president of Mexico, send it to the intergalactic federation, send it to whoever or whatever you want, or send it to nobody, that’s OK too. By the way, both Google Maps and Apple Maps now recognize Gulf of America. How about that? Is this useful? No. Is this stupid? Yes. Is this fun? Yes. Did I find this myself? No, it has been viral on X, and I found it again on (the now overly political in my humble opinion) DaringFireball, so I decided to face the wraith of the partisans on all sides and make a post about it. Have a little fun! Live a little! Pet your dog (don’t forget to put an AirTag on their collar while you’re at it)! Put an extra shot of espresso in your coffee! Rename the Gulf to whatever the heck you want! And don’t read the “news”, it is bad for you! But you should read OSXDaily.com, it is good for you! OK now that I poked the bear, I’m going to hide in my den. Enjoy.",
