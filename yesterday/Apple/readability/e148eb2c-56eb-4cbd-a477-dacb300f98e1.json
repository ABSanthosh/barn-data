An exclusive deal discounts the upgraded M4 Pro 16-inch MacBook Pro by a staggering $330, with free 2-day shipping in time for the holidays. The lowest price on record is available exclusively for AppleInsider readers, with Apple Authorized Reseller B\u0026H Photo dropping the Space Black MacBook Pro 16-inch with 48GB RAM and 512GB storage down to $2,569. This reflects a $330 discount off retail on the M4 Pro model with 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU and is the lowest price available on this configuration per our 16-inch MacBook Pro Price Guide. You must click through this special pricing link from a laptop or desktop computer to activate the $2,569 price. We're sorry, but the deal cannot be activated through the B\u0026H or AppleInsider apps at this time. In addition to the savings on the laptop itself, B\u0026H is throwing in free 2-day shipping within the contiguous U.S. That means you can have a new MacBook Pro wrapped and ready for gift-giving just in time for the holidays. Payboo cardholders can further extend to the savings with one of the card's perks — an instant sales tax refund in select states or special financing. If you're looking for the lowest price on a MacBook period, B\u0026H is also marking down the 14-inch MacBook Pro with last year's M3 chip to $1,349. You can pick it up through this activation link using the above instructions, as well as via our 14-inch MacBook Pro M3 Price Guide.",
