  "text": "Deals You can do it all with this AI-powered photo editor. Photo: Cult of Mac Deals AI photo editor PicWish lets you remove backgrounds, unblur or sharpen pictures, and generally enhance your images in all kinds of ways. It’s easy to use but yields impressive results that would have been impossible (or required an advanced degree in an expensive tool like Adobe Photoshop) just a few years ago. With this PicWish deal, you can slash the price of the credits you need to pull off these fantastic image tweaks. You can get 5,000 PicWish credits for just $59.99 (regularly $95.95). PicWish AI photo editor: Easy to use, easy on your wallet If you do any photo editing online, you know the routine: You open a free tool and start to do something simple. Background remover? Paywall. Magic edit? Paywall. By the time you’re done, you’ve either forked over your credit card for a recurring subscription or rage-quit the app. While PicWish’s AI photo editor isn’t free, it won’t ask you for a recurring subscription just to use its powerful editing tools. Now, those background removals, quality enhancements or face swaps are yours with a one-time payment. Actually useful AI photo editing tools This all-in-one AI-powered photo editor is designed for anyone who wants quick, clean results. And that doesn’t mean it’s like Photoshop and reserved only for photographers and designers. Anyone, even those who aren’t tech-savvy, can upload a photo, click on what they need, and receive results in seconds. PicWish isn’t the kind of app that guesses what your photo should look like and then ruins it with a one-click filter. It gives you precise tools to do exactly what you want. Want to remove a cluttered background because you didn’t tidy up before taking that selfie? Done. Sharpen a blurry picture that you love, but it just didn’t capture properly? Easy. Swap out your sad beige wall for an AI-generated mountain scene? Yes, this AI photo editor can do that, too. PicWish’s packed tool box even offers handy things like a watermark remover, an object eraser, a face swapper and an AI art generator (just in case you’re in the mood to get weird). Bulk editing without losing your mind For creators with stacks of photos to clean up, like product shots or social media batches, PicWish’s bulk photo editing tools can save your sanity. The batch background remover, image resizer and collage maker make it easy to process dozens of images in one go without breaking your workflow. And if you’re dealing with vintage family photos or blurry smartphone pics, the colorizer, upscaler and photo enhancer do a surprisingly good job of bringing those images back to life. Despite all these advanced features, PicWish proves easy to use. The design seems strangely reminiscent of the popular graphic design app, Canva. And it works on Mac and iOS, as well as Windows and Android. Save on credits for AI Photo editor PicWish Instead of roping you into a monthly plan, PicWish runs on a pay-as-you-go credit system. You can grab 5,000 credits in one shot, and they’re yours to use anytime. If you use the editor so much that you run out, great — you know that you’re getting your money’s worth, and you can purchase more credits anytime. Save on credits for AI photo editor PicWish with this deal. You’ll get 5,000 PicWish credits for just $59.99. That’s a 37% discount off the regular price of $95.95.
