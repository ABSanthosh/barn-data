Apple's iCloud Passwords for Windows app now officially supports the Firefox web browser, making it possible for PC users to access and autofill credentials straight from Mozilla's web browser. Apple Passwords debuted in iOS 18 as a destination for iCloud Keychain items that were previously only available via a Settings app section. It has spread to other operating systems in some form to ensure universal access to logins, passkeys, and other credentials. On Wednesday, Firefox for Windows became the latest browser to support in-app iCloud password management, thanks to an update to Apple's iCloud Passwords extension. As noted by 9to5mac, the same functionality has been available for the Mac version of Firefox since December 2024, and it's also offered for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on Windows. There is a caveat, however, as Reddit users have pointed out that the iCloud password autofill feature appears to be only compatible with Windows 11, the latest version of Microsoft's operating system. Windows 10 users, meanwhile, are seemingly out of luck for the time being. Apple's iCloud for Windows app gained iCloud Keychain compatibility back in August 2021, and the app has received various updates over the years. To access and use your iCloud passwords directly from Firefox on Windows, you'll need both the iCloud for Windows app and the dedicated iCloud Passwords extension for Mozilla's browser. The iPhone maker's iCloud for Windows application lets PC users get access to information stored on the company's cloud platform, including photos, videos, mail, calendar dates, and other data. It also helps Windows users access and manage iCloud Keychain passwords on their PCs, and enables password autofill in supported browsers through a dedicated iCloud Passwords extension.",
