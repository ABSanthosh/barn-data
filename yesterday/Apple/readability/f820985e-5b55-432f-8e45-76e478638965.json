  "text": "News Plane loads of iPhones rushed to the U.S. recently. Image: Cult of Mac/Google Gemini Apple reportedly rushed 600 tons of iPhones into the United States from India just before President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on imports from the country. This is apparently part of the Mac-maker stockpiling products in the U.S. so it isn’t forced to raise iPhone prices to pay for Trump’s taxes. While there has been no word of a similar pre-tariff rush of iPhone imports from China, it seems unlikely Apple would overlook such an obvious move. Which means there are surely even more iPhones, Macs, etc. ready to meet U.S. consumer demand without enforced inflation. Apple strives to avoid Trump tariffs Last week, Trump slapped all major manufacturing countries with heavy import tariffs in a bid to reshape international trade. On Wednesday of this week, he reduced the import taxes to 10% on most countries, but raised them on China. Currently, the tariff on Chinese imports to the U.S. stands at 145%. Apple got caught in the middle, as most of its products are assembled by Foxconn in China. To a lesser extent, assembly also happens in India, Vietnam and other countries, as Apple worked to diversify its supply chain in recent years. Still, wherever they’re made, there are new tariffs imposed by Trump. In a clear effort to avoid iPhone price increases caused by import taxes, Apple reportedly brought in large amounts of inventory before the deadline. Word of the tactic first emerged a few days ago, but now there are new details. “Tech giant Apple chartered cargo flights to ferry 600 tons of iPhones, or as many as 1.5 million, to the United States from India, after it stepped up production there in an effort to beat President Donald Trump’s tariffs,” said Reuters on Thursday, For reference, Apple sold about 25 million iPhones in the United States during the second quarter of 2024, so the last-minute rush of imports can only last so long. That said, it’s not known how many units came in from China at the same time India increased its shipping, nor how many Apple already had stockpiled. The Trump tariffs didn’t come as a surprise — the politician has been threatening to impose these taxes for months. That gave Apple time to be ready. Immediate iPhone price increase unlikely Historically, Apple has tried hard to avoid raising the prices of its products. The iPhone 12 released in 2020 cost $799, and the iPhone 16 introduced in 2024 cost just the same. And during the international disruptions of the COVID epidemic, Apple was never forced into sudden price hikes, even though its production costs undoubtedly went up. Given that the company now has weeks or months of inventory in the United States, and its traditional disinterest in hikes, an iPhone price increase anytime soon seems very unlikely. Long term is a different story. Apple can’t absorb the cost of the 145% tariff Trump imposed on Chinese imports. And there’s the potential it’ll go even higher if the trade war continues to escalate. Which explains why the value of AAPL shares dropped 15% since the latest round of Trump tariffs began.",
