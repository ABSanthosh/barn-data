  "text": "Meta last year introduced significant enhancements to the Threads timeline, as users gained the option to create custom feeds and choose which feed they want to see by default. Now Meta is announcing another new feature for Threads: the ability to share custom feeds with others. Sharing custom feeds on Threads As shown by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Threads now has an option to let users share their custom feeds with other people. This means that other Threads users can see and save the feed you’ve created with all the accounts you’ve chosen. It’s a great way to share a tech news feed with a friend, for example. To make a custom feed public on your profile, Tap and hold the feed you’ve created at the top of your Threads app, then tap “Edit feeds.” You’ll see a “Public” toggle – just switch it on. The process of sharing a custom feed with someone is very similar. But instead of using the toggle, tap the “Share Feed” button to send it as a link or DM. The custom feeds can be seen in the top tab of the Threads app’s home screen. A shared feed can be pinned to the home screen as well. “Since launching custom feeds last year, people have created feeds around popular interests like sports, books, art, astronomy, fashion, poetry, design, and more, adding to the vibrant communities and conversations on Threads,” Meta told 9to5Mac. The option to share custom feeds is now being rolled out to all users globally. The Threads app is available for free on the App Store. Make sure you update the app to the latest version in order to get access to the new features.
