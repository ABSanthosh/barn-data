  "description": "Macworld A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman details Apple’s current release plans for the first half of 2026. Much of it was already expected, but the biggest scoop is that Apple is considering delaying the new M5 MacBook Pros—originally slated to be released this fall—until early next year. This fall still looks pretty full. We’ll have the new iPhone 17 lineup, including a new super-thin iPhone 17 Air, updated Apple Watches, new iPad Pro models, and perhaps an updated version of the Vision Pro headset and A18 Pro-powered MacBook. New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were set to be released this fall, but Apple may release them early in 2026. “The timing remains fluid,” Gurman notes. While nearly all the Apple Silicon MacBook Pros have been released in October or November, the M2 MacBook Pro was released in January of 2023, so this new timing is not unprecedented. Update MacBook Air laptops are also still expected to launch in the spring. Later in the spring, they’ll be joined by an iPhone 17e, which is similar in scope to the iPhone 16e released this year, and a new entry-level iPad and iPad Air. The iPads and MacBooks are what are dubbed “chip and ship” models—there aren’t any major new features expected, just upgraded processors. Apple is also expected to release its first external Mac monitor since the Studio Display was released in 2022. Not much is known about the new display’s specs, other than that it is expected to remain at a 27-inch size. The current Studio Display is missing several higher-end features, including ProMotion and HDR. Apple is still working on its affordable smart home hub product, which was supposed to be released this spring but was delayed due to its reliance on new Siri features and upgrades that have fallen far behind schedule. This device, which some call the “HomePad,” is now expected to launch in the first half of 2026. So, according to Gurman, Apple’s release lineup for the first half of 2026 includes these products: M5 MacBook Pro New Studio Display iPhone 17e iPad update iPad Air update M5 MacBook Air Smart Home hub",
