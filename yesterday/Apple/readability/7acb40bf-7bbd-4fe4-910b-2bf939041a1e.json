Credit...Piaras Ó Mídheach/Sportsfile for Collision, via Getty ImagesApril 22, 2025CBS News entered a new period of turmoil on Tuesday after the executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Bill Owens, said he would resign from the long-running Sunday news program, citing encroachments on his journalistic independence.In an extraordinary declaration, Mr. Owens — only the third person to run the program in its 57-year history — told his staff in a memo that “over the past months, it has become clear that I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ‘60 Minutes,’ right for the audience.”“So, having defended this show — and what we stand for — from every angle, over time with everything I could, I am stepping aside so the show can move forward,” he wrote in the memo, which was obtained by The New York Times.“60 Minutes” has faced mounting pressure in recent months from both President Trump, who sued CBS for $10 billion and has accused the program of “unlawful and illegal behavior,” and its own corporate ownership at Paramount, the parent company of CBS News.At an emotional meeting on Tuesday, Mr. Owens’s voice sounded raw and he struggled with his words, tearing up, as he announced his decision to the “60 Minutes” staff, which had gathered in its office across the street from CBS News headquarters in Midtown Manhattan.“It’s clear the company is done with me,” Mr. Owens said, according to a recording that was obtained by The Times. The correspondents Lesley Stahl and Scott Pelley were in attendance — Ms. Stahl choked up as she praised Mr. Owens, and noted that he had “taken a hell of a beating” — and Anderson Cooper dialed in from Rome, where he was covering Pope Francis’ death for CNN.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.
