Apple Union Square – San Francisco Erik Marinovoich – @erikmarinovoich Erik Marinovich is a San Francisco based lettering artist and designer, and is a co-founder of Friends of Type. Since 2009, he has drawn letters, logos and type for various consumer brands. In 2012, he co-founded Title Case, a creative work space that conducts workshops and lectures. Between client work, teaching and side-projects, you’ll find him on the road promoting Keep Fresh Stay Rad and Let’s Go Letter Hunting, two new releases from Friends of Type published by Princeton Architectural Press. Apple Aventura – Miami Jackson Alves – @letterjack Jackson Alves is a brazilian calligraphy/lettering artist and educator based in Orlando, Florida. Graduated in graphic design in 2003, in the last twelve years Jackson has been working exclusively as a letterform expert, collaborating with clients from different countries.

After a couple more jobs, she landed a very encouraging write-up in the famous wedding blog, Project Wedding. Immediately, her natural speed, innate writing skills, and meticulous, yet upbeat personality was noticed by Los Angeles’ luxury wedding industry, museums, and the world’s top fashion houses including Vogue, Dior, Ferragamo, and Chanel to name a few.
