  "text": "The display on an iPhone render The iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Slim are anticipated once again to get ProMotion support, as rumors about the high refresh rate feature continue to roll in. ProMotion has been a Pro-level feature for the iPhone for quite some time, with rumors occasionally claiming it will be on all models in the future. After the introduction of the iPhone 16 without ProMotion, those rumors are focusing on it coming to the iPhone 17. According to an industry source of ETNews on Sunday, Apple is preparing to use low-temperature polycrystalline oxide (LTPO) panels for all four iPhone 17 displays. That would include the iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Slim, as well as the existing two Pro models. LTPO is a display technology that allows for smartphone displays to run at a wide variety of refresh rates, including both high and low rates, with low power usage. It also powers the always-on display used in the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max. ETNews doesn't have a great track record when it comes to predicting future Apple products. However, the report joins the continually growing collection of rumors about the feature and its future availability. Multiple rumor sources have forecast the expansion of ProMotion to other models, including claims in July and September. This is not the only LTPO-related rumor circulating at the moment. In late October, it was claimed that changes to the LTPO in the Apple Watch Series 10 could result in a technology shift in a future iPhone screen. By using LTPO3, it's possible that even more power savings could be made. There's also the potential of ProMotion expanding its refresh rate range, with the top-end shifting from 120Hz to 240Hz.",
