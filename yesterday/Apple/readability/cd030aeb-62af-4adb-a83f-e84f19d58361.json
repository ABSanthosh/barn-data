  "text": "The Photos app on iPhone received a significant layout redesign in iOS 18 that has left many iPhone users annoyed or frustrated as the new Photos design is not necessarily intuitive or easy to use for everyone. Things have been moved around, albums or features they were using might be missing or harder to access, the order of which photos show up in your camera roll may be different, and it can even be more difficult to locate particular categories of media with new layout too. If you’re unhappy with the Photos app layout in iOS 18 on iPhone, read along and we’ll help you to improve the Photos layout so that it behaves more similarly to that you were accustomed to before. How to Improve the Photos Layout on iPhone with iOS 18 If you’re hoping to make Photos normal again and undo the redesign, you can make a few changes that will dramatically improve your experience: \u2028 Open the Photos app on iPhone Scroll all the way to the bottom and tap on “Customize \u0026 Reorder” Uncheck everything except for “Media Types”, “Utilities”, and “Albums”, (and perhaps ‘Shared Albums’ if you use that feature with friends/family) \u2028 Drag the order of these categories around to arrange the Photos app layout how you wish them to appear, for example dragging Utilities and Media Types to the top Now scroll to the very bottom of your photos camera roll and tap the arrows pointing opposite directions (yet another mystery button!) and tap on “Sort by Recently Added” These three changes combined, including rearranging the categories and changing sort order will make a considerable difference to your Photos app layout on iPhone with iOS 18, making it look and behave more like the Photos app in prior iOS versions on your iPhone. Another helpful tip for using the new Photos app is that you have to tap on “Media Type” or “Utilities” to expand out into certain albums or views that you may have had quicker access to before, like for seeing screenshots in the new design for example. What do you think of the Photos app layout design that came to iPhone with iOS 18? Do you like the new design or do you dislike it? Do you have any other improvement suggestions or tips for making the layout behave more like it used to? Share your experiences and thoughts in the comments.",
