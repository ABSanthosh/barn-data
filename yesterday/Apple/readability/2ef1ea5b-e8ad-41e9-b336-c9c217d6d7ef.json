  "text": "Patreon has released an updated version of its iOS app that allows fans in the U.S. to bypass Apple’s in-app payment system when signing up for new memberships, effectively sidestepping the 30% App Store commission. With the promised update now live (via TechCrunch), U.S.-based fans using the Patreon app can choose a new checkout method for subscriptions that doesn’t rely on Apple’s in-app purchase system. The new option is currently limited to creators using Patreon’s subscription billing model, which bills fans on the date they sign up rather than on a fixed monthly or per-creation schedule. The update provides “alternative checkout options for U.S.-based fans signing up for new memberships,” Patreon says. “At this time, this only applies for creators on subscription billing as legacy first-of-the-month and per-creation billing models are still unable to accept new membership sign ups in iOS.” Patreon says it’s also working quickly to enable alternative payment options for one-time payments in a future update. Until then, creators using legacy billing models still can’t accept new memberships through the iOS app. The company also considers its November 2025 deadline to switch all creators to subscription billing “on hold” as a result of last week’s court ruling. This is still a developing situation, but we are moving forward under the assumption that the November 2025 deadline for all Patreon creators to switch to subscription billing is no longer necessary for the small group of creators who are still on legacy billing models.While additional information may come that alters Apple’s requirements for Patreon’s iOS app, we are optimistic that this ruling will give us more flexibility in how we support creators on legacy billing models. However, for now, creators still need to be on subscription billing to be able to accept payments through the Patreon iOS app.  For those who still want to proceed with switching to subscription billing, our team is happy to assist with the transition, since it still unlocks access to the latest growth tools on Patreon, like gifting, Autopilot and tier repricing. While the full impact of the court ruling is still unfolding, Patreon says it will continue to prioritize transparency, control, and stability as it adapts to the new set of rules in the United States. Additional updates are expected as the company expands support for creators on all billing models. Meanwhile, Apple appealed the ruling on Monday as promised. Last week’s court ruling—requiring Apple to let developers offer alternative payment methods without a commission—resolves at least one issue that began affecting Patreon back in August.
