  "description": "Macworld The monitor might be the most important part of your Mac’s setup–after all, you can’t use any desktop computer without one and even the 16-inch MacBook screen can be extended to an external display twice that size. Because you’ll spend a lot of time looking at it, you’ll want to invest wisely. Not only will you want a monitor that provides a pleasing experience, but the quality of the images on the screen can also affect your work. However, picking a new monitor can be daunting. Not only are there many manufacturers to choose from, but there are also lots of sizes, resolutions, and features to consider–and when we say lots, we mean lots. We’re here to help guide you while you shop, and we have some tips on what to look for in a monitor. Below our recommendations for best desktop Mac monitor we test and review the best portable displays for Mac. Apple sells displays for its Macs, and you could go with its offerings, but its displays are a quite bit more expensive than what third parties have. Buying from a different company may mean you may not get a feature that Apple offers, but it may also be a feature that you don’t need, depending on how you use the monitor. Note there are compatibility issues for plain M1, M2 and M3 Macs, which, unlike M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro/Max/Ultra MacBooks, can’t natively connect to more than one external display. Fortunately, we can show you how to connect multiple monitors to M1, M2 and M3 Macs. There are plenty of companies that have great monitors that you can use with your Mac, without having to take out a second mortgage. Our sister publications Tech Advisor and PCWorld have tested several displays, and we list their top-rated ones that we have been able to confirm work with Macs, alongside the monitors we have reviewed below. Here are our recommendations in order, starting with Apple’s most expensive. Best Mac monitors 2025: Desktop recommendations Apple Pro Display XDR – Apple's top-end professional 6K display Pros Phenomenally well-specced Peak brightness of 1,600 nits, stunning picture quality Cons Seriously expensive (but this isn’t a consumer display) Stand not included Price When Reviewed: $4,999 (standard), $5,999 (nano-texture glass) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $4999 View Deal $4999 View Deal $4999 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $4999 at Adorama$4999 at Apple$4999 at B\u0026H Size: 32-inchResolution: 6K (6016×3384 pixels)Connections: Thunderbolt 3 (96W PD), 3x USB-CWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, Rotation stand extra $999/£949Orientation: Landscape; Portrait with stand Apple’s highly specced Pro Display XDR is a stunning piece of engineering, and we found it hard to find fault with the picture quality and colour output, but at that price and with these features this is a display for a very specific audience.  The XDR is phenomenally well-specced: it’s 32in and 6K, offering 40 percent more screen space than Apple’s 5K displays, and offers a peak brightness of 1,600 nits (or 1,000 sustained). But it comes with a seriously eye-watering price tag, especially if you want to include the Pro Stand for adjustability and pivoting. While this is an expensive monitor by consumer standards, but it really isn’t a consumer monitor. It’s intended for a professional audience. Picture quality is maintained at ultrawide viewing angles, thanks to industry-leading polariser technology. This is so that a creative team can gather round a single monitor and evaluate a photo, video or design project without suffering a loss of consistency. Connected via Thunderbolt, it can charge a MacBook at up to 96W.–Neil Bennett Read our full Apple Pro Display XDR review Apple Studio Display – Apple's 'affordable' 5K production monitor Pros Handsome design Good image quality Impressive spatial audio 12MP Ultra Wide camera with Center Stage Cons High starting price and costly upgrades No HDR or ProMotion Changing stand after purchase requires a service call Price When Reviewed: $1,599 Best Prices Today: New Refurbished Retailer Price $1,499 View Deal $1499 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599.99 View Deal $1649 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Apple 27-inch Monitor 5120 x 1440 LCD (Studio Display) $1287 View Deal Apple 27-inch Monitor 5120 x 1440 LED (MK0U3LL/A) $1449 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket $1,499 at Amazon$1499 at B\u0026H$1599 at Adorama View more prices from AppleApple United StatesBest BuyWalmart Electronics Close × Best Prices Today: Apple Studio Display – Apple's 'affordable' 5K production monitor New Refurbished Retailer Price $1,499 View Deal $1499 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599 View Deal $1599.99 View Deal $1649 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Apple 27-inch Monitor 5120 x 1440 LCD (Studio Display) $1287 View Deal Apple 27-inch Monitor 5120 x 1440 LED (MK0U3LL/A) $1449 View Deal Price comparison from Backmarket Size: 27-inchResolution: 5K (5120×2880 pixels)Connections: Thunderbolt 3 (96W PD), 3x USB-CWebcam: 12-megapixelStand: Tilt.

Buyers will enjoy its handsome design, good image quality, and impressive spatial audio, but you can save a lot of money by going with a non-Apple display. Apple displays have always produced very good image quality, and the Studio Display continues that tradition. Colors are rich, contrast is good, and the brightness is suitable for most tasks. The Studio Display has a tilt-adjustable stand, but it does not pivot between landscape and portrait modes, like the Pro Display XDR, although a very expensive WESA mount does add a portrait option. You can get a stand that provides about four inches of height adjustment but it doesn’t come cheap. The price tag for the tilt- and height-adjustable stand is a whopping $400/£400 more. The Studio Display has six speakers (four force-canceling woofers, and two high-performance tweeters) that sound better than any display we’ve used. Connected via Thunderbolt, it can charge a MacBook at up to 96W.–Roman Loyola Read our full Apple Studio Display review Samsung M8 Smart Monitor (2024) – Best 32-inch 4K display Pros Competitive price 32-inch display with 4K resolution Built-in Wi-Fi with support for AirPlayAdjustable stand (height, tilt, pivot) Cons No Ethernet Some features require a Samsung account No support for DCI-P3 Price When Reviewed: $549.99 (originally $999.98) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Saumsung $549.99 View Deal $679.99 View Deal $699.99 View Deal $699.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $549.99 at Saumsung$679.99 at Walmart Electronics$699.99 at B\u0026H View more prices from Best Buy Close × Best Prices Today: Samsung M8 Smart Monitor (2024) – Best 32-inch 4K display Retailer Price Saumsung $549.99 View Deal $679.99 View Deal $699.99 View Deal $699.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Size: 32-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: Micro-HDMI (with HDMI adaptor), 1x USB-C (video), 1x USB-C peripherals, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 5, AirPlay, ThreadWebcam: HDStand: Tilt and height adjustable (included)Orientation: Landscape Samsung’s M8 Smart Monitor has been a popular choice for home users since its launch in 2022, offering a 32-inch monitor with 4K resolution at a lower price than Apple’s expensive 27-inch Studio Display. The M80D model, also known as the fourth-generation update, offers several features that make it an excellent value for money at just $699.99/£549. The glass panel on the M8 still provides 4K resolution with 400 nits brightness, but the M80D model updates several other features to ensure excellent value for money. The monitor comes in three parts that need to be assembled by hand, and the plastic casing used for the display and the detachable 1080p webcam feels flimsy. However, the M8 is not a mobile device, making it suitable for general day-to-day use when sitting on your desk at home. The M8 supports HDR content and 99% of the sRGB color standard, which is accurate enough for basic graphics work, photo-editing, and presentations. Professional photographers or video-editors who require the more precise DCI-P3 standard will need to look at more expensive alternatives. The M80D model has a different set of connectors, with one USB-C port, one HDMI, and two USB-A ports, whereas previous models had two USB-C and one HDMI ports. However, it still supports Bluetooth for connecting additional peripherals, wi-fi, and AirPlay for Apple devices. This allows users to stream audio to the M8’s speakers or mirror the display from their Mac or iPad to the M8 without using a cable. The M8 can be used as more than just a basic computer monitor. It has a built-in ‘entertainment hub’, which includes apps for Netflix, YouTube, Xbox gaming service, and a web browser. Some functions are not available to Mac users, such as the ability to pair the display with a Samsung Galaxy watch for fitness data monitoring, and there’s an Easy Settings app only available for Windows users. Samsung could improve the on-screen menus and controls for the M8 to make them more straightforward. Despite the build quality not up to Apple standards and the untidy on-screen menu system, the M8 remains an affordable and attractive 4K display for home users, outperforming Apple’s more expensive Studio display–Cliff Joseph.

Its size and resolution make it a direct competitor to Apple’s Studio Display. The PD2730S was a pleasure to look at daily. The detail it produces is sharp and satisfying; I used the display with an M4 MacBook Pro, which has a mini-LED panel (what Apple calls Liquid Retina XDR) and it looks nice, but the PD2730S is much crisper. The colors produced by the PD2730S are great, too. BenQ promotes the PD2730S as a display that’s “always accurate” and has “consistent colors” thanks to the company’s AQColor technology. BenQ also offers two software utilities for adjusting color. The Display ColorTalk app helps you set up your MacBook and the PD2730S so that the colors match between the two as closely as possible. The Palette Master Ultimate app works with hardware calibrators and can be used to create custom color profiles. Both apps are free and helpful to photographers, designers, and anyone else who deals with colors on a professional level.–Roman Loyola Read our full BenQ PD2730S review Alogic Clarity Pro Touch Display – Best Mac touchscreen display Pros Impressive 4K 60Hz touchscreen Fantastic adjustable stand Cons Fiddly Mac touchscreen software install Hub doesn’t daisy-chain extra displays Price When Reviewed: $1,199 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Alogic $1199 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $1199 at Alogic Size: 27-inch or 32-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: USB-C (65W PD), USB-B, 2x HDMI, DisplayPortWebcam: 8-megapixel (retractable)Stand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, RotationOrientation: Landscape and portrait The Alogic Clarity Pro Touch offers Mac users a large, premium touchscreen on a monitor that boasts one of the best height-adjustable, tilt and pivot stands that we’ve tested. It’s a precision, 10-point multitouch, One Glass Solution (OGS) touchscreen that combines the monitor’s protective layer with its input layer via a conductive medium keeps the Clarity Pro Touch’s screen as thin as the other Clarity monitors, while maintaining the monitor’s bright picture. Touchscreens are useful for artists and video professionals, with many pro tools having accurate touch functionality that beats using a mouse. It’s a more intuitive way to fine-tune levels and effects in photo-editing or music mixing, in applications such as Adobe Lightroom and Audition, and Apple Pro Logic. Alogic has an optional accessory, the $199 Clarity Fold Stand, to better facilitate comfortable drawing or interacting onscreen—the articulating stand securely holds the monitor raised at an angle like a drafting board. It can rotate 360° so that you can share work with colleagues. We did find the touchscreen setup a little fiddly as you have to install drivers for Mac, but once up and running, the operation was smooth. The height-adjustable stand offers a versatile swivel and tilt experience, and the screen can be used in either landscape or portrait modes. Its retractable webcam automatically raises itself from within the monitor when an app requires it, and then auto-retracts when it’s no longer needed. The 27-inch Pro Touch and new 32-inch Max Touch are the top-end of Alogic’s Clarity range of monitors: the entry-level Clarity (reviewed below) boasts the same premium screen but isn’t a touchscreen and lacks the webcam; the Clarity Pro is also non-touch, but does come with the smart webcam.–Simon Jary Read our Alogic Clarity Max Touch review for a closer look at the larger touchscreen model.

It offers a color gamut of 99 percent of sRGB and can be selected for gaming, M-Book, or film. The monitor’s color gamut is good, but homogeneity decreases towards the edges. The monitor features Low Blue Light Plus technology, which filters out blue-violet radiation harmful to the eyes, and automatic adjustment of screen brightness. A display coating is designed to reduce glare. The monitor can be rotated 20 degrees in any direction, tilted 5 degrees downwards and upwards, and the entire screen can be rotated 90 degrees into portrait format. In addition to HDMI, DisplayPort 1.2, the USB-C port provides 65 watts of power delivery for the MacBook, while another DisplayPort is available for connecting a second monitor. The integrated hub offers three USB 3.2 ports and one USB-C port with 5 gigabits per second speed. The monitor has built-in speakers and a microphone optimized for video conferencing, equipped with noise filter and noise cancellation. A USB-C connection to the Mac is required for use. The monitor has a series of buttons for operation, including the integrated microphone, noise filter, Low Blue Light Plus, menu control, and on/off button. For an additional $20, the display comes with a practical Yogi Pad set, which serves as an iPhone holder, universal shelf, and studs for stacking building blocks. While not the fastest monitor, it is suitable for general office use and does not require professional editing.–Thomas Bergbold.

Indeed, the screen offers an unusually high contrast ratio of 2000:1: black looks like black, and colors are very clearly distinguishable. Thanks to its wide color space support (100 percent Rec.709, 100 percent sRGB, and 98 percent DCI-P3) it is on a par with modern Apple LCDs. The screen settings can be adjusted using the joystick on the back, or directly from the Mac desktop using the Dell Display and Peripheral Manager software. Here you can quickly adjust the brightness and contrast. There is also the option of defining a schedule for changing the brightness or contrast. If required, users can also define hotkeys for brightness and contrast control. However, the software works on the MacBook, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, but not on the iMac. The ports on the back are hard to reach and not entirely in logical positions. The two connections at the front are also arranged at the bottom, which makes plugging them in from the bottom a gymnastics exercise every time. A side or rear-facing solution like Apple’s would be better here. But this display does offer a lot of ports, and it’s a complete USB-C docking station for MacBooks and a good extension for the Mac mini or Mac Studio.–Christian Rentrop Read our full Dell UltraSharp U2723QE review Alogic Edge 40” Ultrawide QHD Monitor – Best flat widescreen Mac display Pros 3440×1440 ultrawide screen Accurate color Apple-sensitive styling Built-in USB hub Cons Low pixel density Price When Reviewed: $999.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Alogic $999.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $999.99 at Alogic Size: 40-inchResolution: UltraWide Quad HD (3440×1440 pixels)Connections: 5Gbps USB-C (90W PD), HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, 2x 480Mbps USB-C (5W), Gigabit Ethernet, audio mini-jackWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, RotationOrientation: Landscape Two large screens side by side can be a big productivity booster, but one super-wide screen means no screen separation and removes issues with matching specs, meaning you avoid potential color, brightness, and display quality discrepancies if the two monitors have different specifications. This 40-inch flat ultra-widescreen display—also available in a 34-inch model—saves you from buying two displays, each of which needs a connection to your Mac. It creates a remarkable amount of convenient and ergonomic working screen space for a single monitor to maximize viewable multitasking apps and documents without the bezel gap and setting complications you get with a dual-monitor setup. Picky creatives may prefer a higher pixel density but for general productivity users the 34-inch to 40-inch screen is even more spacious than having two monitors side by side.–Simon Jary Read our full Alogic Edge 40” Ultrawide QHD Monitor review BenQ MA270U – Best budget rotatable Mac display Pros Great image quality Nano Matte Panel cuts down glare and reflections Height-adjustable stand Cons 60Hz refresh rate may discourage gamers No webcam Price When Reviewed: $459.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $459.99 View Deal $459.99 View Deal BenQ $460 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $459.99 at B\u0026H$459.99 at Best Buy$460 at BenQNot Available at Amazon View more prices from Amazon Close × Best Prices Today: BenQ MA270U – Best budget rotatable Mac display Retailer Price $459.99 View Deal $459.99 View Deal BenQ $460 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Size: 27-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: USB-C (90W PD), 5Gbps USB-C (15W), 2x HDMI 2.0, 2x 5Gbps USB-A, audio mini-jackWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, RotationOrientation: Landscape and portrait The MA270U has a Nano Matte Panel front but it’s not a piece of glass. As the name suggests, it’s not glossy, so glare and reflections are practically non-existent, even more so than with the pricey Nano texture glass on the Apple Studio Display. A stand is included with the MA270U. Some displays sell the stand separately so there’s an additional cost consideration, but that’s not the case here. The stand offers a great range of adjustment: -5 to 20 degrees of tilt, swivels 15 degrees left or right, and 115 mm of height. The display can also pivot 90 degrees, a far greater range of motion than the Studio Display. The MA270U can connect to a Mac through HDMI or USB-C. The USB-C connection offers 90 watts of power so it can charge your MacBook at the same time. If you want to use the display as a connection hub, you need to connect to the Mac via USB-C. The one thing that’s immediately noticeable with the MA270U is its impressive image quality. Colors are full of life and the detail is excellent. One standout aspect of the image quality is how sharp text appears. This is great for production and design work, but it can even make it more enjoyable to read and write. The BenQ MA270U offers image quality that could satisfy users in a production environment–that’s one way of saying that its quality is better than what general users usually get. You might be able to find a 27-inch 4K display that’s a little cheaper, but it won’t look this good.–Roman Loyola Read our full BenQ MA270U review BenQ PD2706UA – Best ergonomic Mac display Pros Competitive price Includes flexible ergonomic arm Supports 100% sRGB Good connectivity Cons Only supports 95% DCI-P3 400 nits max brightness (with HDR) Weak speakers Price When Reviewed: $629.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $479.99 View Deal $479.99 View Deal $479.99 View Deal BenQ $629.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $479.99 at Amazon$479.99 at B\u0026H$479.99 at Best Buy View more prices from BenQAdorama Close × Best Prices Today: BenQ PD2706UA – Best ergonomic Mac display Retailer Price $479.99 View Deal $479.99 View Deal $479.99 View Deal BenQ $629.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Size: 27-inchResolution: 2K (2560×1440 pixels) aka HDConnections: 4x USB-A, USB-C, HDMI 1.4, 2x DisplayPort 1.2Webcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, Joint (Rotation)Orientation: Landscape It’s a common criticism of Apple’s own displays that they don’t allow you to adjust the height of the screen unless you pay a ridiculous amount for an optional adjustable stand. Most rival displays do allow you to adjust the height, of course, but BenQ’s 27-inch PD2706UA goes even further. Rather than having a conventional stand, the PD2706UA includes an ergonomic arm that attaches to your desk and allows you to freely adjust the height, tilt and swivel, and even rotate it into the upright portrait mode with just a tap of your finger. You don’t have to pay a fortune for this flexibility either, as the PD2706UA provides an attractive 4K display for just $629.99/£549.99. The ergonomic arm is designed to either clamp onto the edge of a desk or table, or attach to the circular grommets found on many pieces of office furniture. It does require a little patience to assemble properly, but the free movement of the screen will be a blessing for people who may have problems with their neck or shoulders, or simply for quickly swiveling the display into position to show your work to clients or colleagues. The display provides 4K resolution with support for HDR10, which is good value at this price. Connectivity is good too, with HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces, along with one USB-C connector that handles video and provides 90W output for charging a laptop. It also includes a built-in USB hub that provides three USB-A ports and one USB-C (for data transfer only), as well as BenQ’s ‘hotkey puck’, which sits on your desk and provides a quick dial control for selecting display settings without using the traditional on-screen menus. As always, BenQ keeps Mac users in mind by providing a Mac version of its DisplayPilot app, which provides features such as an ‘M-book’ mode that is designed to match the color settings on a Mac. The display also supports 100% of the sRGB color space, and 95% of DCI-P3, so it can handle a wide range of graphics and design tasks. Our only real complaint is that the display only provides modest levels of brightness – 350nits or 400nits with HDR – compared to 500nits for my office iMac. It also works with Benq’s Display ColorTalk and  Palette Master Ultimate color calibration tools. The built-in speakers are pretty feeble too, but the PD2706UA does have a 3.5mm audio connector so you can use headphones or external speakers if you want to. Some professional users might prefer a more expensive display that supports 100% of DCI-P3, but the PD2706UA will be a good, affordable option if you just need a 4K display for use at home or in the office, with the added bonus of the versatile ergonomic arm thrown in for good measure.–Cliff Joseph Alogic Clarity 27in UHD 4K Monitor – Display with most adjustable stand Pros Impressive 4K 60Hz screen Fantastic adjustable stand USB-C hub with 90 watts of power  Cons No webcam Hub doesn’t daisy-chain extra displays Price When Reviewed: $799.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $620.99 View Deal Alogic $799.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $620.99 at Amazon$799.99 at Alogic Size: 27-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: USB-C (90W PD), USB-B, 2x HDMI, DisplayPortWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, RotationOrientation: Landscape and portrait The Alogic Clarity is a stunning 27-inch display with built-in hub and a fantastic height-adjustable, tilt and pivot stand.

The stand is one of the best we’ve seen, and easily beats Apple’s standard monitor stand. It features multiple display connections and can power your MacBook at up to 90W via either USB-C or USB-B.

The S65TC also offers a high refresh rate, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and easy-to-use controls. It’s a nice display at a reasonable price. The ViewFinity S65TC supports Thunderbolt 4 and you can use it to connect to a Mac. One of the Thunderbolt 4 ports delivers 90 watts of power (it’s labeled with a laptop and Thunderbolt icons), so you’ll want to use that port to connect to a MacBook so it can charge the laptop while connected. If you prefer, you can connect it via the HDMI 2.0 port. The display also has 2 USB-A ports (and a USB service port for servicing the display), a DisplayPort (version 1.2), an ethernet port, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. The S65TC’s contrast is quite good, but the color reproduction feels watered down, especially if you put it next to an iMac, for example. Brightness is also in the lower spectrum at 350 nits–the Apple Studio Display’s brightness is 600 nits.

There are a few trade-offs: it’s 4K resolution rather than 5K, and it lacks speakers, a microphone, and a webcam. The height-adjustable stand costs an extra $99. Its overall image quality isn’t as good as the Studio Display, but it’s still very good for even professional-level image work. A Mac can also use one of the two HDMI 2.1 ports, but by connecting through USB-C you’ll also be able to use the display as a hub and its other USB-C port (15 watts), the two USB-A ports, and the 3.5 mm audio jack. It has a few advantages over the Studio Display, such as a variable refresh rate to a maximum of 144Hz, a higher maximum brightness, and it can connect to game consoles at 120Hz. Overall, it’s a display that’s worth the investment. This model is sold on Amazon in the U.K. but with a delivery estimation of more than three months and the European sales are in Euros, so not really one for the U.K. market.–Roman Loyola Mobile Pixels Geminos Dual Vertical FHD Monitor – Best vertically stacked dual display Pros Two vertically stacked monitors Ergonomic screen layout Adjustable height and viewing angles 65W USB-C passthrough charging Cons HD not 4K Webcam is too high when both screens are flat Price When Reviewed: $699 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mobile Pixels $699 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $699 at Mobile Pixels Size: 2x 24-inchResolution: HD 1080p (1920-x-1080 pixels)Connections: 2x HDMI, 2x USB-C (65W PD), 2x USB-A, Gigabit Ethernet, Audio In/OutWebcam: YesStand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, RotationOrientation: Stacked landscape The Mobile Pixels Geminos is a monitor curiosity that might take your fancy. Instead of having two screens side by side, the Geminos stacks two on top of each other, with the ability to fold the whole thing down flat if you want to. Having two screens stacked on top of each other will save your neck from frequent twisting plus a bunch of freed-up desk space too. The two joined 24-inch screens are HD rather than 4K so won’t suit those who want the deepest, richest colors, but as a productivity option, we applaud Mobile Pixels for the idea and comfortable dual-screen alternative. Setup is a little complicated, and you can buy two separate monitors cheaper, although not stacked vertically, for which you would need a special mount.

It’s not a great-looking monitor, with larger than average display bevels on the plasticky chassis. It’s not luxurious but it’s fine for an office or workstation. Asus’ ProArt PA279CV is a sensible choice for content creators who want a color accurate 4K monitor but don’t want to clean out their savings account.

It’s ideal for design, desktop publishing, and photo and video editing–it’s a good all-around display. Thanks to the Thunderbolt connection, it is ideal as a Mac docking station. Using Thunderbolt, the display offers four USB ports and an additional Thunderbolt socket into a practical docking station. The second Thunderbolt port also serves as a daisy-chain connection, which can be used to connect a second monitor. The rest of the ports are located on the rear of the display. The PD3225U also offers two HDMI 2.0 ports and DisplayPort 1.4. Content on the PD3225U is always clearly recognizable thanks to a peak brightness of 400 nits and a contrast ratio of 2,000:1. The PD3225Q is also an exceptionally evenly illuminated panel with no halos or similar display problems. The matte screen is coated with an anti-glare coating that largely prevents reflections from light sources. It also works with Benq’s Display ColorTalk and  Palette Master Ultimate color calibration tools. The PD3225U also supports BenQ’s own Display Pilot software.

Not everyone needs such a high-res display though, and I’ve always found that a QHD (quad-HD) display with 2,560×1,440 resolution is the affordable sweet spot that works well for both general office work and off-duty entertainment. HP’s somewhat clumsily named E27u G4 is a good option here, providing an attractive QHD display with a variety of connectivity features for just $424/£286.80. You’re not going to get a top-of-the-range display for that price, and the E27u does lack a few added extras, such as a built-in webcam or speakers. It gets all the basics right, though, with good image quality, multiple video inputs, and a useful built-in USB hub. The display’s 250 nits brightness may be relatively modest, but we found that the E27u looks bright and sharp enough for working with productivity software such as Microsoft Office, and also for streaming video from the BBC iPlayer and Apple TV+. And while Apple charges an extra £400 for an upgrade that allows you to adjust the height of its Studio Display—which is more than the entire cost of the E27u—you can tilt, swivel and adjust the height of the E27u, and even rotate it into upright (portrait) mode at no extra cost. The E27u includes HDMI, DisplayPort and USB-C interfaces for connecting to your Mac, with the USB-C port also providing 65W power to charge a MacBook or other laptop if required. When using the USB-C connection you can also use four USB-A ports to connect devices such a keyboard, mouse or hard drive, and there’s also a second DisplayPort interface that will allow you to daisy-chain a second monitor if required. Our only complaint is that there’s no audio connector that would allow you to connect headphones or a set of external speakers to the display – although HP does sell a special ‘speaker bar’ that bolts onto the bottom of the screen if you want to add audio ($43.00/£40.00).–Cliff Joseph Best portable monitors for Mac Most monitors sit on a desk and don’t move any more than their stand or arm allows. But sometimes a more portable solution makes sense when the MacBook’s own screen simply isn’t large enough. There are two main types of portable display: travel monitors that can be slipped into a backpack; or moveable monitors that can be carried from one room to another or quickly hidden from sight when not in use. Here are our picks for the best portable displays to match with your Mac. 1. Plugable 15.6-inch USB-C Portable Display: Lightweight portable USB-C 15.6-inch HD screen Pros Full HD (1920×1080 at 60Hz) IPS display Lightweight   Integrated folding travel cover and stand 85W pass-through charging 2x downstream 10Gbps USB-C ports Cons HD not 4K Price When Reviewed: $199.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $219.95 View Deal $219.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $219.95 at Amazon$219.95 at B\u0026H Size: 15.6-inchResolution: 2K (1920×1080 pixels) aka HDConnections: 3x USB-CWebcam: NoStand: FoldableOrientation: Landscape This 15.6-inch Full HD IPS display doubles most laptops’ screen space and is simple to setup and connect, and then disconnect and lightweight enough to carry away when you’re done.

Many purchase portable monitors not for their portability but instead their versatility and ease of use—so it can be moved across a home or corporate office. At home, it could let you have two home office setups without two monitors, or simply be stored out of sight in a cupboard when not in use. In an office, it could be carried to meetings if you need to lead a presentation or study a large spreadsheet. The Asus ZenScreen MB249C pairs a 24-inch screen with several stand options including a kickstand/handle that makes it easy to tote around a house or corporate office. It provides excellent image quality for its intended purpose. It’s bright enough and scores well in contrast, color gamut, and color accuracy, all while avoiding notable problems or pitfalls. The MB249C is a great choice for a second decent-sized monitor, too, as it offers multiple ways to mount and orient it alongside your primary monitor.–Matthew S. Smith Read a full Asus ZenScreen MB249C review on PCWorld. 3. Limink LK14 Al Alloy Portable Triple Monitor: Best screen extender for portability Pros Adds two 14-inch screens Portable Easy setup Cons HD, not 4K Price When Reviewed: $699.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $399.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $399.99 at Amazon Size: 14-inchResolution: 2K (1920×1080 pixels) aka HDConnections: USB-C or HDMI to hostWebcam: NoStand: ConnectedOrientation: Landscape If you need a bigger screen you can plug a display into your Mac laptop, but if you want multiple screens without the giant extra monitors, a better option is to buy a portable external display. These displays tend to not be much larger than the display on your laptop, but they don’t add a much more weight and can more than double your screen space. The Limink LK14 portable Tri-screen Monitor is a screen extender that your MacBook fits into and adds a 14-inch screen either side of the laptop’s own. It is compatible with 13-16-inch MacBooks, and connects via either USB-C or HDMI cables (included). Setup is easy and you can attach and detach this extender to your MacBook in about a minute. It’s HD rather than 4K and so is not as sharp and clear as the MacBook’s own. But it’s fine for spreadsheets, browsers and other mainstream applications. It’s great for adding supplementary screen estate when you’re on a video call, or for presentations. At $699, it is expensive, but you are paying for portability and two decent screens. The whole package, which comes with a leather protective cover, can be folded up and placed in a drawer when not in use, and is light enough (3.3lbs; 1.5kg) to take with you on your travels.–Simon Jary Read our full Limink LK14 Al Alloy Portable Triple Monitor review How to choose a Mac monitor Display technology is a bit of a movable feast, with a lot of confusing jargon and technical features to wade through, as well as a variety of different interfaces and cables that are used by Apple itself and the various monitor manufacturers. So it’s worth taking a closer look at some of the factors that you need to think about when buying a monitor for your Mac. Screen size Size isn’t everything, as the saying goes, but it’s a good place to start. Your decision will be influenced by how much desk space you have, and how comfortable you are while using the display. Some people think that a big screen is best, but then when they start to use it daily, they find that it’s too big. And the same goes for customers who think a small screen is best. If you’re looking for a size to start with for your own personal research, we recommend 24 inches—just like with Apple’s iMac. That seems like a good size for most people, and it’s easy to go up or down from that point. Most people tend to go between 24 and 27 inches for home use. For professionals—graphics, video, audio, even spreadsheets—a large screen will help you be more productive. Think 27 inches and higher. You’ll be able to fit more elements on the screen and not waste your time scrolling. If on-screen real estate is valuable to you, consider a multi-display setup. A smaller screen can be used for things like chat, email, web, and more, while the bigger screen is your main workspace. Or get screens of the same size and maximize the space. Screen resolution Screen resolution can go hand-in-hand with screen size. Screen resolution refers to the number of pixels used to create what you see on the screen. The higher the resolution, the more detail you can see. Larger displays tend to have more resolution options, as well as the ability to support higher resolutions. Often, when you find two displays that are the same size but have a wide price difference, it’s mostly because of the screen resolution. Monitors with high resolutions are more expensive. For example, Apple’s $1,599 Studio Display is 27 inches, and it has a high screen resolution of 5120×2880 (5K resolution). On the other hand, LG sells the 27-inch 27UK650-W, but it’s a 3840×2160 (4K) resolution display for content creators, and it’s $350–lower resolution, but $1,249 cheaper. (There actually aren’t other 27-inch 5K monitors available, except for the $1,449 LG UltraFine 27MD5KL-B.) So what screen resolution should you get? Here are some suggestions; these are guidelines that you can adjust based on your preferences. For general purpose use, such as web browsing, email, media viewing, small photo and video projects and viewing: 1920×1080 or 2560×1440 (HD) For more-involved content creation, productivity, and media viewing: 3840×2160 (4K) For pro-level content creation, productivity, and media viewing: 4K or higher Want to use an 8K monitor? Read How to connect an 8K display to your Mac. Connecting to a Mac How a monitor connects to a Mac can be confusing. The traditional HDMI and DisplayPort connectors used by many monitors are being replaced–or complemented–by USB-C and Thunderbolt ports. And though USB-C and Thunderbolt cables may look the same, there are actually some important technical differences between them, so it’s important to check which ports your new monitor uses and make sure you buy the correct cables and adapters. Most recent Mac models have Thunderbolt ports, so if you buy a monitor that has HDMI or DisplayPort interfaces only, then you’ll need an adapter to connect to the Mac. This can get a bit confusing, but Apple does provide a list of the ports included on most recent Mac models so that you can figure out what you need. Apple also provides a guide to HDMI and DisplayPort technology, which covers Mac models going right back to 2008, so that should provide all the info you need for all the Macs you use at home or at work. Less expensive monitors still tend to use HDMI and DisplayPort, and while it’s not too costly to buy adapters that will allow you to connect your Mac, we reckon it’s worth future-proofing your new monitor by getting one that includes at least one USB-C or Thunderbolt port. If a display uses Thunderbolt to connect to the Mac, it may have additional USB-C or Thunderbolt ports so the display can act as a hub. In this case, If you have a device you want to connect to your Mac, you can connect it to one of the ports on the monitor, which is already connected to the Mac and probably in an easier location for access. Look for a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection with power delivery (PD) that can charge your MacBook. A 65W PD will be enough for a MacBook Air or 14-inch MacBook Pro, but you’ll need at least 90W for a 15-inch or 16-inch Pro. Read our article on how to connect a second screen to a Mac which explains everything you need to know about how to identify which ports you have, the adapters you will require, and how to set things up. Ergonomics If you’re going to spend a lot of time sitting at a desk looking at your lovely new display then you need to keep ergonomics in mind. The ability to tilt the angle of the monitor back and forth, swivel it around for easy viewing, and adjust the height of the monitor in order to avoid an aching back or neck. Some monitors can pivot or rotate in either landscape or portrait mode. As a rough guide, there is a point at about 2 to 3 inches from the top of the screen that should be at eye level. Obviously, eye level varies from one person to another, so it’s important that you can adjust the screen for your own personal comfort. You may also prefer a monitor that doesn’t suffer from glare, or you will be forever repositioning the monitor (or your head) to compensate for that. Other considerations There are other considerations you’ll want to make when shopping for a monitor. A lot of these come down to personal preference or what you need for the work you do. They include: Color space (gamut): The number of colors a monitor can show. Professionals need specific color spaces. Refresh rate: The frequency when a screen is refreshed. Higher rates produce smoother animations. Webcam: Some displays have a built-in camera you can use for FaceTime and other video conferencing apps, or to record yourself. Speakers: If you plan on frequently viewing or listening to media, a good set of speakers makes for a better experience.",

Because you’ll spend a lot of time looking at it, you’ll want to invest wisely. Not only will you want a monitor that provides a pleasing experience, but the quality of the images on the screen can also affect your work. However, picking a new monitor can be daunting. Not only are there many manufacturers to choose from, but there are also lots of sizes, resolutions, and features to consider–and when we say lots, we mean lots. We’re here to help guide you while you shop, and we have some tips on what to look for in a monitor. Below our recommendations for best desktop Mac monitor we test and review the best portable displays for Mac. Apple sells displays for its Macs, and you could go with its offerings, but its displays are a quite bit more expensive than what third parties have. Buying from a different company may mean you may not get a feature that Apple offers, but it may also be a feature that you don’t need, depending on how you use the monitor. Note there are compatibility issues for plain M1, M2 and M3 Macs, which, unlike M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro/Max/Ultra MacBooks, can’t natively connect to more than one external display. Fortunately, we can show you how to connect multiple monitors to M1, M2 and M3 Macs. There are plenty of companies that have great monitors that you can use with your Mac, without having to take out a second mortgage. Our sister publications Tech Advisor and PCWorld have tested several displays, and we list their top-rated ones that we have been able to confirm work with Macs, alongside the monitors we have reviewed below. Here are our recommendations in order, starting with Apple’s most expensive.

But it comes with a seriously eye-watering price tag, especially if you want to include the Pro Stand for adjustability and pivoting. While this is an expensive monitor by consumer standards, but it really isn’t a consumer monitor. It’s intended for a professional audience. Picture quality is maintained at ultrawide viewing angles, thanks to industry-leading polariser technology. This is so that a creative team can gather round a single monitor and evaluate a photo, video or design project without suffering a loss of consistency.

Height-adjustable stand extra $400/£400Orientation: Landscape; Portrait with $1,599/£1,499 VESA mount adapter As a production display, the Studio Display is still expensive but is an affordable alternative to the Pro Display XDR. Buyers will enjoy its handsome design, good image quality, and impressive spatial audio, but you can save a lot of money by going with a non-Apple display. Apple displays have always produced very good image quality, and the Studio Display continues that tradition. Colors are rich, contrast is good, and the brightness is suitable for most tasks. The Studio Display has a tilt-adjustable stand, but it does not pivot between landscape and portrait modes, like the Pro Display XDR, although a very expensive WESA mount does add a portrait option. You can get a stand that provides about four inches of height adjustment but it doesn’t come cheap. The price tag for the tilt- and height-adjustable stand is a whopping $400/£400 more. The Studio Display has six speakers (four force-canceling woofers, and two high-performance tweeters) that sound better than any display we’ve used. Connected via Thunderbolt, it can charge a MacBook at up to 96W.–Roman Loyola Read our full Apple Studio Display review Samsung M8 Smart Monitor (2024) – Best 32-inch 4K display Pros Competitive price 32-inch display with 4K resolution Built-in Wi-Fi with support for AirPlayAdjustable stand (height, tilt, pivot) Cons No Ethernet Some features require a Samsung account No support for DCI-P3 Price When Reviewed: $549.99 (originally $999.98) Size: 32-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: Micro-HDMI (with HDMI adaptor), 1x USB-C (video), 1x USB-C peripherals, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi 5, AirPlay, ThreadWebcam: HDStand: Tilt and height adjustable (included)Orientation: Landscape Samsung’s M8 Smart Monitor has been a popular choice for home users since its launch in 2022, offering a 32-inch monitor with 4K resolution at a lower price than Apple’s expensive 27-inch Studio Display. The M80D model, also known as the fourth-generation update, offers several features that make it an excellent value for money at just $699.99/£549. The glass panel on the M8 still provides 4K resolution with 400 nits brightness, but the M80D model updates several other features to ensure excellent value for money. The monitor comes in three parts that need to be assembled by hand, and the plastic casing used for the display and the detachable 1080p webcam feels flimsy. However, the M8 is not a mobile device, making it suitable for general day-to-day use when sitting on your desk at home. The M8 supports HDR content and 99% of the sRGB color standard, which is accurate enough for basic graphics work, photo-editing, and presentations. Professional photographers or video-editors who require the more precise DCI-P3 standard will need to look at more expensive alternatives. The M80D model has a different set of connectors, with one USB-C port, one HDMI, and two USB-A ports, whereas previous models had two USB-C and one HDMI ports. However, it still supports Bluetooth for connecting additional peripherals, wi-fi, and AirPlay for Apple devices. This allows users to stream audio to the M8’s speakers or mirror the display from their Mac or iPad to the M8 without using a cable. The M8 can be used as more than just a basic computer monitor. It has a built-in ‘entertainment hub’, which includes apps for Netflix, YouTube, Xbox gaming service, and a web browser. Some functions are not available to Mac users, such as the ability to pair the display with a Samsung Galaxy watch for fitness data monitoring, and there’s an Easy Settings app only available for Windows users. Samsung could improve the on-screen menus and controls for the M8 to make them more straightforward. Despite the build quality not up to Apple standards and the untidy on-screen menu system, the M8 remains an affordable and attractive 4K display for home users, outperforming Apple’s more expensive Studio display–Cliff Joseph.

Its size and resolution make it a direct competitor to Apple’s Studio Display. The PD2730S was a pleasure to look at daily. The detail it produces is sharp and satisfying; I used the display with an M4 MacBook Pro, which has a mini-LED panel (what Apple calls Liquid Retina XDR) and it looks nice, but the PD2730S is much crisper. The colors produced by the PD2730S are great, too. BenQ promotes the PD2730S as a display that’s “always accurate” and has “consistent colors” thanks to the company’s AQColor technology. BenQ also offers two software utilities for adjusting color. The Display ColorTalk app helps you set up your MacBook and the PD2730S so that the colors match between the two as closely as possible. The Palette Master Ultimate app works with hardware calibrators and can be used to create custom color profiles. Both apps are free and helpful to photographers, designers, and anyone else who deals with colors on a professional level.–Roman Loyola Read our full BenQ PD2730S review Alogic Clarity Pro Touch Display – Best Mac touchscreen display Pros Impressive 4K 60Hz touchscreen Fantastic adjustable stand Cons Fiddly Mac touchscreen software install Hub doesn’t daisy-chain extra displays Price When Reviewed: $1,199 Size: 27-inch or 32-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: USB-C (65W PD), USB-B, 2x HDMI, DisplayPortWebcam: 8-megapixel (retractable)Stand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, RotationOrientation: Landscape and portrait The Alogic Clarity Pro Touch offers Mac users a large, premium touchscreen on a monitor that boasts one of the best height-adjustable, tilt and pivot stands that we’ve tested. It’s a precision, 10-point multitouch, One Glass Solution (OGS) touchscreen that combines the monitor’s protective layer with its input layer via a conductive medium keeps the Clarity Pro Touch’s screen as thin as the other Clarity monitors, while maintaining the monitor’s bright picture. Touchscreens are useful for artists and video professionals, with many pro tools having accurate touch functionality that beats using a mouse. It’s a more intuitive way to fine-tune levels and effects in photo-editing or music mixing, in applications such as Adobe Lightroom and Audition, and Apple Pro Logic. Alogic has an optional accessory, the $199 Clarity Fold Stand, to better facilitate comfortable drawing or interacting onscreen—the articulating stand securely holds the monitor raised at an angle like a drafting board. It can rotate 360° so that you can share work with colleagues. We did find the touchscreen setup a little fiddly as you have to install drivers for Mac, but once up and running, the operation was smooth. The height-adjustable stand offers a versatile swivel and tilt experience, and the screen can be used in either landscape or portrait modes. Its retractable webcam automatically raises itself from within the monitor when an app requires it, and then auto-retracts when it’s no longer needed. The 27-inch Pro Touch and new 32-inch Max Touch are the top-end of Alogic’s Clarity range of monitors: the entry-level Clarity (reviewed below) boasts the same premium screen but isn’t a touchscreen and lacks the webcam; the Clarity Pro is also non-touch, but does come with the smart webcam.–Simon Jary Read our Alogic Clarity Max Touch review for a closer look at the larger touchscreen model.

It offers a color gamut of 99 percent of sRGB and can be selected for gaming, M-Book, or film. The monitor’s color gamut is good, but homogeneity decreases towards the edges. The monitor features Low Blue Light Plus technology, which filters out blue-violet radiation harmful to the eyes, and automatic adjustment of screen brightness. A display coating is designed to reduce glare. The monitor can be rotated 20 degrees in any direction, tilted 5 degrees downwards and upwards, and the entire screen can be rotated 90 degrees into portrait format. In addition to HDMI, DisplayPort 1.2, the USB-C port provides 65 watts of power delivery for the MacBook, while another DisplayPort is available for connecting a second monitor. The integrated hub offers three USB 3.2 ports and one USB-C port with 5 gigabits per second speed. The monitor has built-in speakers and a microphone optimized for video conferencing, equipped with noise filter and noise cancellation. A USB-C connection to the Mac is required for use. The monitor has a series of buttons for operation, including the integrated microphone, noise filter, Low Blue Light Plus, menu control, and on/off button. For an additional $20, the display comes with a practical Yogi Pad set, which serves as an iPhone holder, universal shelf, and studs for stacking building blocks. While not the fastest monitor, it is suitable for general office use and does not require professional editing.–Thomas Bergbold.

Indeed, the screen offers an unusually high contrast ratio of 2000:1: black looks like black, and colors are very clearly distinguishable. Thanks to its wide color space support (100 percent Rec.709, 100 percent sRGB, and 98 percent DCI-P3) it is on a par with modern Apple LCDs. The screen settings can be adjusted using the joystick on the back, or directly from the Mac desktop using the Dell Display and Peripheral Manager software. Here you can quickly adjust the brightness and contrast. There is also the option of defining a schedule for changing the brightness or contrast. If required, users can also define hotkeys for brightness and contrast control. However, the software works on the MacBook, Mac mini, and Mac Pro, but not on the iMac. The ports on the back are hard to reach and not entirely in logical positions. The two connections at the front are also arranged at the bottom, which makes plugging them in from the bottom a gymnastics exercise every time. A side or rear-facing solution like Apple’s would be better here. But this display does offer a lot of ports, and it’s a complete USB-C docking station for MacBooks and a good extension for the Mac mini or Mac Studio.–Christian Rentrop Read our full Dell UltraSharp U2723QE review Alogic Edge 40” Ultrawide QHD Monitor – Best flat widescreen Mac display Pros 3440×1440 ultrawide screen Accurate color Apple-sensitive styling Built-in USB hub Price When Reviewed: $999.99 Size: 40-inchResolution: UltraWide Quad HD (3440×1440 pixels)Connections: 5Gbps USB-C (90W PD), HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, 2x 480Mbps USB-C (5W), Gigabit Ethernet, audio mini-jackWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, RotationOrientation: Landscape Two large screens side by side can be a big productivity booster, but one super-wide screen means no screen separation and removes issues with matching specs, meaning you avoid potential color, brightness, and display quality discrepancies if the two monitors have different specifications. This 40-inch flat ultra-widescreen display—also available in a 34-inch model—saves you from buying two displays, each of which needs a connection to your Mac. It creates a remarkable amount of convenient and ergonomic working screen space for a single monitor to maximize viewable multitasking apps and documents without the bezel gap and setting complications you get with a dual-monitor setup. Picky creatives may prefer a higher pixel density but for general productivity users the 34-inch to 40-inch screen is even more spacious than having two monitors side by side.–Simon Jary Read our full Alogic Edge 40” Ultrawide QHD Monitor review BenQ MA270U – Best budget rotatable Mac display Pros Great image quality Nano Matte Panel cuts down glare and reflections Height-adjustable stand Cons 60Hz refresh rate may discourage gamers No webcam Price When Reviewed: $459.99 Size: 27-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: USB-C (90W PD), 5Gbps USB-C (15W), 2x HDMI 2.0, 2x 5Gbps USB-A, audio mini-jackWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, RotationOrientation: Landscape and portrait The MA270U has a Nano Matte Panel front but it’s not a piece of glass. As the name suggests, it’s not glossy, so glare and reflections are practically non-existent, even more so than with the pricey Nano texture glass on the Apple Studio Display. A stand is included with the MA270U. Some displays sell the stand separately so there’s an additional cost consideration, but that’s not the case here. The stand offers a great range of adjustment: -5 to 20 degrees of tilt, swivels 15 degrees left or right, and 115 mm of height. The display can also pivot 90 degrees, a far greater range of motion than the Studio Display. The MA270U can connect to a Mac through HDMI or USB-C. The USB-C connection offers 90 watts of power so it can charge your MacBook at the same time. If you want to use the display as a connection hub, you need to connect to the Mac via USB-C. The one thing that’s immediately noticeable with the MA270U is its impressive image quality. Colors are full of life and the detail is excellent. One standout aspect of the image quality is how sharp text appears. This is great for production and design work, but it can even make it more enjoyable to read and write. The BenQ MA270U offers image quality that could satisfy users in a production environment–that’s one way of saying that its quality is better than what general users usually get. You might be able to find a 27-inch 4K display that’s a little cheaper, but it won’t look this good.–Roman Loyola Read our full BenQ MA270U review BenQ PD2706UA – Best ergonomic Mac display Pros Competitive price Includes flexible ergonomic arm Supports 100% sRGB Good connectivity Cons Only supports 95% DCI-P3 400 nits max brightness (with HDR) Weak speakers Price When Reviewed: $629.99 Size: 27-inchResolution: 2K (2560×1440 pixels) aka HDConnections: 4x USB-A, USB-C, HDMI 1.4, 2x DisplayPort 1.2Webcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, Joint (Rotation)Orientation: Landscape It’s a common criticism of Apple’s own displays that they don’t allow you to adjust the height of the screen unless you pay a ridiculous amount for an optional adjustable stand. Most rival displays do allow you to adjust the height, of course, but BenQ’s 27-inch PD2706UA goes even further. Rather than having a conventional stand, the PD2706UA includes an ergonomic arm that attaches to your desk and allows you to freely adjust the height, tilt and swivel, and even rotate it into the upright portrait mode with just a tap of your finger. You don’t have to pay a fortune for this flexibility either, as the PD2706UA provides an attractive 4K display for just $629.99/£549.99. The ergonomic arm is designed to either clamp onto the edge of a desk or table, or attach to the circular grommets found on many pieces of office furniture. It does require a little patience to assemble properly, but the free movement of the screen will be a blessing for people who may have problems with their neck or shoulders, or simply for quickly swiveling the display into position to show your work to clients or colleagues. The display provides 4K resolution with support for HDR10, which is good value at this price. Connectivity is good too, with HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces, along with one USB-C connector that handles video and provides 90W output for charging a laptop. It also includes a built-in USB hub that provides three USB-A ports and one USB-C (for data transfer only), as well as BenQ’s ‘hotkey puck’, which sits on your desk and provides a quick dial control for selecting display settings without using the traditional on-screen menus. As always, BenQ keeps Mac users in mind by providing a Mac version of its DisplayPilot app, which provides features such as an ‘M-book’ mode that is designed to match the color settings on a Mac. The display also supports 100% of the sRGB color space, and 95% of DCI-P3, so it can handle a wide range of graphics and design tasks. Our only real complaint is that the display only provides modest levels of brightness – 350nits or 400nits with HDR – compared to 500nits for my office iMac. It also works with Benq’s Display ColorTalk and  Palette Master Ultimate color calibration tools. The built-in speakers are pretty feeble too, but the PD2706UA does have a 3.5mm audio connector so you can use headphones or external speakers if you want to. Some professional users might prefer a more expensive display that supports 100% of DCI-P3, but the PD2706UA will be a good, affordable option if you just need a 4K display for use at home or in the office, with the added bonus of the versatile ergonomic arm thrown in for good measure.–Cliff Joseph Alogic Clarity 27in UHD 4K Monitor – Display with most adjustable stand Pros Impressive 4K 60Hz screen Fantastic adjustable stand USB-C hub with 90 watts of power  Cons No webcam Hub doesn’t daisy-chain extra displays Price When Reviewed: $799.99 Size: 27-inchResolution: 4K (3840×2160 pixels)Connections: USB-C (90W PD), USB-B, 2x HDMI, DisplayPortWebcam: NoStand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, RotationOrientation: Landscape and portrait The Alogic Clarity is a stunning 27-inch display with built-in hub and a fantastic height-adjustable, tilt and pivot stand. It will appeal to Mac users with its Apple looks and is even, in some ways, a superior monitor to Apple’s own Studio Display, although its 4K resolution isn’t as sharp as Apple’s 5K screen. The stand is one of the best we’ve seen, and easily beats Apple’s standard monitor stand. It features multiple display connections and can power your MacBook at up to 90W via either USB-C or USB-B.

The S65TC also offers a high refresh rate, Thunderbolt 4 ports, and easy-to-use controls. It’s a nice display at a reasonable price. The ViewFinity S65TC supports Thunderbolt 4 and you can use it to connect to a Mac. One of the Thunderbolt 4 ports delivers 90 watts of power (it’s labeled with a laptop and Thunderbolt icons), so you’ll want to use that port to connect to a MacBook so it can charge the laptop while connected. If you prefer, you can connect it via the HDMI 2.0 port. The display also has 2 USB-A ports (and a USB service port for servicing the display), a DisplayPort (version 1.2), an ethernet port, and a 3.5 mm audio jack. The S65TC’s contrast is quite good, but the color reproduction feels watered down, especially if you put it next to an iMac, for example. Brightness is also in the lower spectrum at 350 nits–the Apple Studio Display’s brightness is 600 nits.

There are a few trade-offs: it’s 4K resolution rather than 5K, and it lacks speakers, a microphone, and a webcam. The height-adjustable stand costs an extra $99. Its overall image quality isn’t as good as the Studio Display, but it’s still very good for even professional-level image work. A Mac can also use one of the two HDMI 2.1 ports, but by connecting through USB-C you’ll also be able to use the display as a hub and its other USB-C port (15 watts), the two USB-A ports, and the 3.5 mm audio jack. It has a few advantages over the Studio Display, such as a variable refresh rate to a maximum of 144Hz, a higher maximum brightness, and it can connect to game consoles at 120Hz. Overall, it’s a display that’s worth the investment. This model is sold on Amazon in the U.K. but with a delivery estimation of more than three months and the European sales are in Euros, so not really one for the U.K. market.–Roman Loyola Mobile Pixels Geminos Dual Vertical FHD Monitor – Best vertically stacked dual display Pros Two vertically stacked monitors Ergonomic screen layout Adjustable height and viewing angles 65W USB-C passthrough charging Cons HD not 4K Webcam is too high when both screens are flat Price When Reviewed: $699 Size: 2x 24-inchResolution: HD 1080p (1920-x-1080 pixels)Connections: 2x HDMI, 2x USB-C (65W PD), 2x USB-A, Gigabit Ethernet, Audio In/OutWebcam: YesStand: Height, Tilt, Swivel, RotationOrientation: Stacked landscape The Mobile Pixels Geminos is a monitor curiosity that might take your fancy.

Having two screens stacked on top of each other will save your neck from frequent twisting plus a bunch of freed-up desk space too. The two joined 24-inch screens are HD rather than 4K so won’t suit those who want the deepest, richest colors, but as a productivity option, we applaud Mobile Pixels for the idea and comfortable dual-screen alternative.

It’s ideal for design, desktop publishing, and photo and video editing–it’s a good all-around display. Thanks to the Thunderbolt connection, it is ideal as a Mac docking station. Using Thunderbolt, the display offers four USB ports and an additional Thunderbolt socket into a practical docking station. The second Thunderbolt port also serves as a daisy-chain connection, which can be used to connect a second monitor. The rest of the ports are located on the rear of the display. The PD3225U also offers two HDMI 2.0 ports and DisplayPort 1.4. Content on the PD3225U is always clearly recognizable thanks to a peak brightness of 400 nits and a contrast ratio of 2,000:1. The PD3225Q is also an exceptionally evenly illuminated panel with no halos or similar display problems. The matte screen is coated with an anti-glare coating that largely prevents reflections from light sources. It also works with Benq’s Display ColorTalk and  Palette Master Ultimate color calibration tools. The PD3225U also supports BenQ’s own Display Pilot software.

Not everyone needs such a high-res display though, and I’ve always found that a QHD (quad-HD) display with 2,560×1,440 resolution is the affordable sweet spot that works well for both general office work and off-duty entertainment. HP’s somewhat clumsily named E27u G4 is a good option here, providing an attractive QHD display with a variety of connectivity features for just $424/£286.80. You’re not going to get a top-of-the-range display for that price, and the E27u does lack a few added extras, such as a built-in webcam or speakers. It gets all the basics right, though, with good image quality, multiple video inputs, and a useful built-in USB hub. The display’s 250 nits brightness may be relatively modest, but we found that the E27u looks bright and sharp enough for working with productivity software such as Microsoft Office, and also for streaming video from the BBC iPlayer and Apple TV+. And while Apple charges an extra £400 for an upgrade that allows you to adjust the height of its Studio Display—which is more than the entire cost of the E27u—you can tilt, swivel and adjust the height of the E27u, and even rotate it into upright (portrait) mode at no extra cost. The E27u includes HDMI, DisplayPort and USB-C interfaces for connecting to your Mac, with the USB-C port also providing 65W power to charge a MacBook or other laptop if required. When using the USB-C connection you can also use four USB-A ports to connect devices such a keyboard, mouse or hard drive, and there’s also a second DisplayPort interface that will allow you to daisy-chain a second monitor if required. Our only complaint is that there’s no audio connector that would allow you to connect headphones or a set of external speakers to the display – although HP does sell a special ‘speaker bar’ that bolts onto the bottom of the screen if you want to add audio ($43.00/£40.00).–Cliff Joseph Best portable monitors for Mac Most monitors sit on a desk and don’t move any more than their stand or arm allows. But sometimes a more portable solution makes sense when the MacBook’s own screen simply isn’t large enough. There are two main types of portable display: travel monitors that can be slipped into a backpack; or moveable monitors that can be carried from one room to another or quickly hidden from sight when not in use. Here are our picks for the best portable displays to match with your Mac. 1.

Many purchase portable monitors not for their portability but instead their versatility and ease of use—so it can be moved across a home or corporate office. At home, it could let you have two home office setups without two monitors, or simply be stored out of sight in a cupboard when not in use. In an office, it could be carried to meetings if you need to lead a presentation or study a large spreadsheet. The Asus ZenScreen MB249C pairs a 24-inch screen with several stand options including a kickstand/handle that makes it easy to tote around a house or corporate office. It provides excellent image quality for its intended purpose. It’s bright enough and scores well in contrast, color gamut, and color accuracy, all while avoiding notable problems or pitfalls. The MB249C is a great choice for a second decent-sized monitor, too, as it offers multiple ways to mount and orient it alongside your primary monitor.–Matthew S.

These displays tend to not be much larger than the display on your laptop, but they don’t add a much more weight and can more than double your screen space. The Limink LK14 portable Tri-screen Monitor is a screen extender that your MacBook fits into and adds a 14-inch screen either side of the laptop’s own. It is compatible with 13-16-inch MacBooks, and connects via either USB-C or HDMI cables (included). Setup is easy and you can attach and detach this extender to your MacBook in about a minute. It’s HD rather than 4K and so is not as sharp and clear as the MacBook’s own. But it’s fine for spreadsheets, browsers and other mainstream applications. It’s great for adding supplementary screen estate when you’re on a video call, or for presentations. At $699, it is expensive, but you are paying for portability and two decent screens. The whole package, which comes with a leather protective cover, can be folded up and placed in a drawer when not in use, and is light enough (3.3lbs; 1.5kg) to take with you on your travels.–Simon Jary Read our full Limink LK14 Al Alloy Portable Triple Monitor review How to choose a Mac monitor Display technology is a bit of a movable feast, with a lot of confusing jargon and technical features to wade through, as well as a variety of different interfaces and cables that are used by Apple itself and the various monitor manufacturers. So it’s worth taking a closer look at some of the factors that you need to think about when buying a monitor for your Mac. Screen size Size isn’t everything, as the saying goes, but it’s a good place to start. Your decision will be influenced by how much desk space you have, and how comfortable you are while using the display. Some people think that a big screen is best, but then when they start to use it daily, they find that it’s too big. And the same goes for customers who think a small screen is best. If you’re looking for a size to start with for your own personal research, we recommend 24 inches—just like with Apple’s iMac. That seems like a good size for most people, and it’s easy to go up or down from that point. Most people tend to go between 24 and 27 inches for home use. For professionals—graphics, video, audio, even spreadsheets—a large screen will help you be more productive. Think 27 inches and higher. You’ll be able to fit more elements on the screen and not waste your time scrolling. If on-screen real estate is valuable to you, consider a multi-display setup. A smaller screen can be used for things like chat, email, web, and more, while the bigger screen is your main workspace. Or get screens of the same size and maximize the space. Screen resolution Screen resolution can go hand-in-hand with screen size. Screen resolution refers to the number of pixels used to create what you see on the screen. The higher the resolution, the more detail you can see. Larger displays tend to have more resolution options, as well as the ability to support higher resolutions. Often, when you find two displays that are the same size but have a wide price difference, it’s mostly because of the screen resolution. Monitors with high resolutions are more expensive. For example, Apple’s $1,599 Studio Display is 27 inches, and it has a high screen resolution of 5120×2880 (5K resolution). On the other hand, LG sells the 27-inch 27UK650-W, but it’s a 3840×2160 (4K) resolution display for content creators, and it’s $350–lower resolution, but $1,249 cheaper. (There actually aren’t other 27-inch 5K monitors available, except for the $1,449 LG UltraFine 27MD5KL-B.) So what screen resolution should you get? Here are some suggestions; these are guidelines that you can adjust based on your preferences. For general purpose use, such as web browsing, email, media viewing, small photo and video projects and viewing: 1920×1080 or 2560×1440 (HD) For more-involved content creation, productivity, and media viewing: 3840×2160 (4K) For pro-level content creation, productivity, and media viewing: 4K or higher Want to use an 8K monitor? Read How to connect an 8K display to your Mac. Connecting to a Mac How a monitor connects to a Mac can be confusing. The traditional HDMI and DisplayPort connectors used by many monitors are being replaced–or complemented–by USB-C and Thunderbolt ports. And though USB-C and Thunderbolt cables may look the same, there are actually some important technical differences between them, so it’s important to check which ports your new monitor uses and make sure you buy the correct cables and adapters. Most recent Mac models have Thunderbolt ports, so if you buy a monitor that has HDMI or DisplayPort interfaces only, then you’ll need an adapter to connect to the Mac. This can get a bit confusing, but Apple does provide a list of the ports included on most recent Mac models so that you can figure out what you need. Apple also provides a guide to HDMI and DisplayPort technology, which covers Mac models going right back to 2008, so that should provide all the info you need for all the Macs you use at home or at work. Less expensive monitors still tend to use HDMI and DisplayPort, and while it’s not too costly to buy adapters that will allow you to connect your Mac, we reckon it’s worth future-proofing your new monitor by getting one that includes at least one USB-C or Thunderbolt port. If a display uses Thunderbolt to connect to the Mac, it may have additional USB-C or Thunderbolt ports so the display can act as a hub. In this case, If you have a device you want to connect to your Mac, you can connect it to one of the ports on the monitor, which is already connected to the Mac and probably in an easier location for access. Look for a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection with power delivery (PD) that can charge your MacBook. A 65W PD will be enough for a MacBook Air or 14-inch MacBook Pro, but you’ll need at least 90W for a 15-inch or 16-inch Pro. Read our article on how to connect a second screen to a Mac which explains everything you need to know about how to identify which ports you have, the adapters you will require, and how to set things up. Ergonomics If you’re going to spend a lot of time sitting at a desk looking at your lovely new display then you need to keep ergonomics in mind. The ability to tilt the angle of the monitor back and forth, swivel it around for easy viewing, and adjust the height of the monitor in order to avoid an aching back or neck. Some monitors can pivot or rotate in either landscape or portrait mode. As a rough guide, there is a point at about 2 to 3 inches from the top of the screen that should be at eye level. Obviously, eye level varies from one person to another, so it’s important that you can adjust the screen for your own personal comfort. You may also prefer a monitor that doesn’t suffer from glare, or you will be forever repositioning the monitor (or your head) to compensate for that. Other considerations There are other considerations you’ll want to make when shopping for a monitor. A lot of these come down to personal preference or what you need for the work you do. They include: Color space (gamut): The number of colors a monitor can show. Professionals need specific color spaces. Refresh rate: The frequency when a screen is refreshed. Higher rates produce smoother animations. Webcam: Some displays have a built-in camera you can use for FaceTime and other video conferencing apps, or to record yourself. Speakers: If you plan on frequently viewing or listening to media, a good set of speakers makes for a better experience.",

Buying from a different company may mean you may not get a feature that Apple offers, but it may also be a feature that you don’t need, depending on how you use the monitor. Note there are compatibility issues for plain M1, M2 and M3 Macs, which, unlike M1/M2/M3/M4 Pro/Max/Ultra MacBooks, can’t natively connect to more than one external display.

Buyers will enjoy its handsome design, good image quality, and impressive spatial audio, but you can save a lot of money by going with a non-Apple display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eApple displays have always produced very good image quality, and the Studio Display continues that tradition. Colors are rich, contrast is good, and the brightness is suitable for most tasks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Studio Display has a tilt-adjustable stand, but it does not pivot between landscape and portrait modes, like the Pro Display XDR, although a very expensive WESA mount does add a portrait option. You can get a stand that provides about four inches of height adjustment but it doesn’t come cheap.

The M80D model, also known as the fourth-generation update, offers several features that make it an excellent value for money at just $699.99/£549.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe glass panel on the M8 still provides 4K resolution with 400 nits brightness, but the M80D model updates several other features to ensure excellent value for money. The monitor comes in three parts that need to be assembled by hand, and the plastic casing used for the display and the detachable 1080p webcam feels flimsy. However, the M8 is not a mobile device, making it suitable for general day-to-day use when sitting on your desk at home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe M8 supports HDR content and 99% of the sRGB color standard, which is accurate enough for basic graphics work, photo-editing, and presentations. Professional photographers or video-editors who require the more precise DCI-P3 standard will need to look at more expensive alternatives.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe M80D model has a different set of connectors, with one USB-C port, one HDMI, and two USB-A ports, whereas previous models had two USB-C and one HDMI ports. However, it still supports Bluetooth for connecting additional peripherals, wi-fi, and AirPlay for Apple devices. This allows users to stream audio to the M8’s speakers or mirror the display from their Mac or iPad to the M8 without using a cable.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe M8 can be used as more than just a basic computer monitor.

As the name suggests, it’s not glossy, so glare and reflections are practically non-existent, even more so than with the pricey Nano texture glass on the Apple Studio Display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA stand is included with the MA270U. Some displays sell the stand separately so there’s an additional cost consideration, but that’s not the case here. The stand offers a great range of adjustment: -5 to 20 degrees of tilt, swivels 15 degrees left or right, and 115 mm of height. The display can also pivot 90 degrees, a far greater range of motion than the Studio Display.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe MA270U can connect to a Mac through HDMI or USB-C. The USB-C connection offers 90 watts of power so it can charge your MacBook at the same time. If you want to use the display as a connection hub, you need to connect to the Mac via USB-C.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe one thing that’s immediately noticeable with the MA270U is its impressive image quality. Colors are full of life and the detail is excellent. One standout aspect of the image quality is how sharp text appears. This is great for production and design work, but it can even make it more enjoyable to read and write.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe BenQ MA270U offers image quality that could satisfy users in a production environment–that’s one way of saying that its quality is better than what general users usually get.

Most rival displays do allow you to adjust the height, of course, but BenQ’s 27-inch PD2706UA goes even further. Rather than having a conventional stand, the PD2706UA includes an ergonomic arm that attaches to your desk and allows you to freely adjust the height, tilt and swivel, and even rotate it into the upright portrait mode with just a tap of your finger. You don’t have to pay a fortune for this flexibility either, as the PD2706UA provides an attractive 4K display for just $629.99/£549.99.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe ergonomic arm is designed to either clamp onto the edge of a desk or table, or attach to the circular grommets found on many pieces of office furniture. It does require a little patience to assemble properly, but the free movement of the screen will be a blessing for people who may have problems with their neck or shoulders, or simply for quickly swiveling the display into position to show your work to clients or colleagues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe display provides 4K resolution with support for HDR10, which is good value at this price. Connectivity is good too, with HDMI and DisplayPort interfaces, along with one USB-C connector that handles video and provides 90W output for charging a laptop. It also includes a built-in USB hub that provides three USB-A ports and one USB-C (for data transfer only), as well as BenQ’s ‘hotkey puck’, which sits on your desk and provides a quick dial control for selecting display settings without using the traditional on-screen menus.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAs always, BenQ keeps Mac users in mind by providing a Mac version of its DisplayPilot app, which provides features such as an ‘M-book’ mode that is designed to match the color settings on a Mac. The display also supports 100% of the sRGB color space, and 95% of DCI-P3, so it can handle a wide range of graphics and design tasks. Our only real complaint is that the display only provides modest levels of brightness – 350nits or 400nits with HDR – compared to 500nits for my office iMac.

Not everyone needs such a high-res display though, and I’ve always found that a QHD (quad-HD) display with 2,560×1,440 resolution is the affordable sweet spot that works well for both general office work and off-duty entertainment. HP’s somewhat clumsily named E27u G4 is a good option here, providing an attractive QHD display with a variety of connectivity features for just $424/£286.80.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou’re not going to get a top-of-the-range display for that price, and the E27u does lack a few added extras, such as a built-in webcam or speakers. It gets all the basics right, though, with good image quality, multiple video inputs, and a useful built-in USB hub. The display’s 250 nits brightness may be relatively modest, but we found that the E27u looks bright and sharp enough for working with productivity software such as Microsoft Office, and also for streaming video from the BBC iPlayer and Apple TV+. And while Apple charges an extra £400 for an upgrade that allows you to adjust the height of its Studio Display—which is more than the entire cost of the E27u—you can tilt, swivel and adjust the height of the E27u, and even rotate it into upright (portrait) mode at no extra cost.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe E27u includes HDMI, DisplayPort and USB-C interfaces for connecting to your Mac, with the USB-C port also providing 65W power to charge a MacBook or other laptop if required. When using the USB-C connection you can also use four USB-A ports to connect devices such a keyboard, mouse or hard drive, and there’s also a second DisplayPort interface that will allow you to daisy-chain a second monitor if required. Our only complaint is that there’s no audio connector that would allow you to connect headphones or a set of external speakers to the display – although HP does sell a special ‘speaker bar’ that bolts onto the bottom of the screen if you want to add audio ($43.00/£40.00).\u003cem\u003e–Cliff Joseph\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"best-portable-monitors-for-mac\"\u003eBest portable monitors for Mac\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp id=\"best-portable-monitors-for-mac\"\u003eMost monitors sit on a desk and don’t move any more than their stand or arm allows.

Your decision will be influenced by how much desk space you have, and how comfortable you are while using the display. Some people think that a big screen is best, but then when they start to use it daily, they find that it’s too big. And the same goes for customers who think a small screen is best.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re looking for a size to start with for your own personal research, we recommend 24 inches—just like with Apple’s iMac. That seems like a good size for most people, and it’s easy to go up or down from that point. Most people tend to go between 24 and 27 inches for home use.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor professionals—graphics, video, audio, even spreadsheets—a large screen will help you be more productive. Think 27 inches and higher. You’ll be able to fit more elements on the screen and not waste your time scrolling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf on-screen real estate is valuable to you, consider a multi-display setup. A smaller screen can be used for things like chat, email, web, and more, while the bigger screen is your main workspace. Or get screens of the same size and maximize the space.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"screen-resolution\"\u003eScreen resolution\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eScreen resolution can go hand-in-hand with screen size.

The traditional HDMI and DisplayPort connectors used by many monitors are being replaced–or complemented–by USB-C and Thunderbolt ports. And though USB-C and Thunderbolt cables may look the same, there are actually some important technical differences between them, so it’s important to check which ports your new monitor uses and make sure you buy the correct cables and adapters.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eMost recent Mac models have Thunderbolt ports, so if you buy a monitor that has HDMI or DisplayPort interfaces only, then you’ll need \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/668462/best-usb-c-hubs-and-adapters-for-mac.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ean adapter\u003c/a\u003e to connect to the Mac.

Less expensive monitors still tend to use HDMI and DisplayPort, and while it’s not too costly to buy adapters that will allow you to connect your Mac, we reckon it’s worth future-proofing your new monitor by getting one that includes at least one USB-C or Thunderbolt port.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf a display uses Thunderbolt to connect to the Mac, it may have additional USB-C or Thunderbolt ports so the display can act as a hub. In this case, If you have a device you want to connect to your Mac, you can connect it to one of the ports on the monitor, which is already connected to the Mac and probably in an easier location for access.  \u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eLook for a USB-C or Thunderbolt connection with power delivery (PD) that can charge your MacBook. A 65W PD will be enough for a MacBook Air or 14-inch MacBook Pro, but you’ll need at least 90W for a 15-inch or 16-inch Pro.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eRead our article on \u003ca href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/671793/how-to-connect-an-external-monitor-to-your-mac.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\u003ehow to connect a second screen to a Mac\u003c/a\u003e which explains everything you need to know about how to identify which ports you have, the adapters you will require, and how to set things up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch3 id=\"ergonomics\"\u003eErgonomics\u003c/h3\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf you’re going to spend a lot of time sitting at a desk looking at your lovely new display then you need to keep ergonomics in mind.

Obviously, eye level varies from one person to another, so it’s important that you can adjust the screen for your own personal comfort.
