Laptop batteries can especially be a problem, since many of us keep our laptops plugged in much of the time. But there’s a new solution designed to improve your battery health: Chargie. Despite Apple and other device makers having solutions for battery aging that sets charge limits at 80% automatically, the reality is it isn’t always reliable or available or on older devices that don’t support the feature. Chargie makes it easy by giving you the ability to manually adjust the charging limit along with a fully controllable daily scheduler to keep the battery at a much safer 50% or 60% while you can, and also have it at 90 or 100% at times when you need longer battery life. The problem plaguing modern laptop batteries The days of frequently upgrading a laptop to new hardware are largely behind us. Modern computers have powerful tech, such as the M-class Apple silicon chips in MacBooks, and don’t need upgrades nearly as often. Unfortunately, the advancements found in many aspects of modern computers haven’t brought the same benefit to battery lifespan. Batteries still degrade and need replacing, which can be costly—and with some computers isn’t even possible, forcing a pricey upgrade sooner than necessary. This issue is exacerbated by the common habit of keeping a laptop plugged in to charge all day and night. Lots of us spend our days sitting at a desk, yet keep our laptop charging just in case we have to unplug at some point. But realistically, it doesn’t need to be plugged in that whole time. The same goes for overnight charges. These habits accelerate the need for a new battery or even a whole new laptop, leading to electronic waste and unnecessary cost. But Chargie was built as a solution to this common problem. How Chargie makes your laptop last longer Chargie is a small device from Lighty Gadgets that sits between your laptop and its charging cable. Connecting Chargie helps you take control of your laptop’s battery health by: monitoring the battery with greater precision setting charge limits and schedules to suit your lifestyle and ensuring you’re not degrading your battery faster than you have to Chargie is easy to connect to your laptop, and comes with adapters to suit a range of different laptop models. Once connected, you’ll interact with Chargie via a companion app that’s available for macOS, Windows, and ChromeOS. Inside the app, you’ll find fine-grained controls for setting charging limits and a charging schedule that matches your daily patterns. For example, you can schedule your laptop to fully charge by 5pm on in-office days, before you head home, while on WFH days the battery follows different orders. Chargie supports up to 100W power delivery, so you can still charge just as fast as ever, and the app provides detailed charging updates. Even if you don’t keep your laptop plugged in often, Chargie can still assist by preventing it from being kept at 100% charge for extended periods. This practice still contributes to improved battery health over time. Chargie availability and wrap-up Chargie ensures your laptop intelligently stops and starts charging to protect its battery without causing you any inconvenience. This ultimately prevents battery wear and tear and extends the device lifespan. You can buy Chargie for a $40 early bird price as part of its Kickstarter campaign. It’s expected to deliver in February 2025 for early bird orders, and March for all others. There is also the existing Chargie C Basic for phones that allows for slower charging and better battery life for phones. You can visit the Chargie website to shop the current lineup of Chargie products with some great holiday discounts available for a limited time.
