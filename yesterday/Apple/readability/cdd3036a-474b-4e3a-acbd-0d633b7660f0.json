  "text": "News Apple’s smart home device might look just a little bit like this. Concept: Vivint/Apple/Cult of Mac Apple is reportedly developing a “command center” for smart homes. It’ll supposedly be an inexpensive, wall-mounted, tablet-like computer used to control smart devices and make video calls. The device also would serve as an access point for the upcoming AI-powered Siri. This is not much like anything the company offers now, though it does mix in some of the features of an iPad and a HomePod. A wall-mounted iPad? Interesting. Apple’s HomeKit platform lets users control their lights, thermostats and other compatible accessories. The smart home system can be controlled by an iPhone, Mac, HomePod, etc. However, rumors of alternative options in development crop up periodically. Tuesday brought word of “a wall-mounted display that can control appliances, handle videoconferencing and use AI to navigate apps” from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The device supposedly includes a 6-inch touchscreen and looks like an iPad, except with a square display and a significant screen bezel. Bloomberg describes the device’s user interface as “a blend of the Apple Watch operating system and the iPhone’s recently launched StandBy mode.” Takes advantage of Apple Intelligence The intent is for users to talk to the wall-mounted device more than tap on it. “A person familiar with its development said the product is designed to bring Siri and Apple Intelligence to life in a way that hasn’t happened before,” wrote Gurman. In June, Apple unveiled an upcoming artificial intelligence-enhanced version of Siri, currently still in development. The goal is to make the voice assistant better at understanding what users want and performing complex everyday tasks. Apple’s wall-mounted smart home device allegedly could launch in March. Perhaps not coincidentally, that’s when the AI-enhanced version of Siri is expected to debut. Apple’s smart home controller reportedly will be relatively inexpensive — perhaps around $200, according to Bloomberg’s insider sources. A more costly follow-up could take the form of a tabletop iPad on a robot arm. Gurman first broke the news of Apple’s next smart home product in September, with Tuesday’s report including additional details.",
