Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo originally published his prediction in September of 2024, believing that the iPhone 17 — expected in fall 2025 — will use an improved 3nm chip dubbed the A19.He added at the time that the next-generation 2nm chips would be ready in time for only the high-end iPhone 18 Pro release, which should come in the fall of 2026.

The current iPhone 16 uses a 3nm A18 processor, with the Pro models using an A18 Pro processor. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo originally published his prediction in September of 2024, believing that the iPhone 17 — expected in fall 2025 — will use an improved 3nm chip dubbed the A19. He added at the time that the next-generation 2nm chips would be ready in time for only the high-end iPhone 18 Pro release, which should come in the fall of 2026. Other analysts were more confident the chip would be used across the lineup. Due to the strong test yields of the forthcoming 2nm chips, Kuo is now on board with the idea that they will be used throughout the iPhone 18 lineup. He reported that TSMC's yields on the 2nm chip are above the 60-70 percent range, according a new tweet posted on March 22. He noted that the yields hit those benchmarks three months ago, those yields are now \"well above that.\" Reiterating my prediction from six months ago: the 2H26 new iPhones (iPhone 18) will be powered by TSMC's 2nm chips.Worth noting, TSMC's 2nm R\u0026D trial yields reached 60-70% three months ago, and they're now well above that. https://t.co/ZoWXFqfUnS— (Ming-Chi Kuo) (@mingchikuo) March 22, 2025Changes for the iPhone 17 and iPhone 18While the chipmakers are focused on 2026's iPhone 18 lineup, Apple and its customers are eagerly awaiting the debut of the iPhone 17. Rumors suggest that Apple will drop the idea of an iPhone 17 Plus in favor of introducing a notably thinner model, potentially to be called the iPhone 17 Slim. This new model would likely use the same chip as the regular iPhone 17, which is expected to be powered by the A19 chip. In addition to the performance boost of the new chip, Apple has also been seeking to use faster RAM in the next iPhone. Accomplishing this would also help improve the responsiveness and performance of Apple Intelligence. Cosmetically, Apple has also been said to be trying to create a bezel-free iPhone. It has come close with the current iPhone 16, but the iPhone 17 may succeed in reducing the existing bezel to near-zero in size. In addition, Apple may use the opportunity presented by the new iPhone model to change up the suppliers of the camera sensor. Samsung has been reported to be lobbying hard for the opportunity to supply sensors for the iPhone. When the iPhone 18 debuts, analysts expect the smaller die size of the 2nm A20 could translate to a 10 to 15 percent boost in performance over the iPhone 17, while also reducing energy requirements. If true, the latter feature could lead to better battery life for the iPhone 18 line.",
