  "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a larger tablet with a great screen and a speedy chip, you don’t need to spend a thousand-plus on an iPad Pro. The 13-inch M3 iPad Air is a fantastic mid-range option, and today it’s officially available for its very best price: Amazon is selling the 13-inch iPad Air for $730, a savings of $69 and the deepest we’ve yet to see for Apple’s newest iPad Air. This tablet has a gorgeous 12.9-inch Liquid Retina display with slim bezels and a fantastic design. Despite it’s size, it’s also super light, so slipping this one into your bag and carrying it around won’t be as difficult. And the new M3 chip ensures you’re going to be able to quickly launch apps and movies and swap between it all without a hitch. Speaking of apps, this tablet comes with 128GB of storage, so you’ll be able to install a lot of them. And of course, it’s ready for Apple Intelligence for maaking your own emoji, editing photos, and getting help with your writing. While the M3 iPad Air isn’t much of an upgrade over the M2 model, it’s a fantastic pick for anyone getting their first tablet or upgrading from an older model. So snag the M3 iPad Air for its very best price of $730 at Amazon while this deal still stands. View Deal at Amazon",
