  "text": "As an iPhone or iPad user you’re undoubtedly familiar with using Dark Mode and Light mode for the interface, and you might even have automatic dark/light mode enabled on your device. But some users may like to use light mode in some apps, and dark mode in other apps, like when editing in the Photos app. With a little hidden settings adjustment, you can make the Photos app editor always stay in Dark Mode (or Light Mode) on your iPhone or iPad, regardless of what your broader system setting for the interface appearance is. Using the Photos editor in Dark Mode all the time might be easier on the eyes or simply preferable for some users, while others may prefer to always edit in Light Mode even if they’re using Dark mode systemwide otherwise. And you can also switch back to the default setting, which will place the Photos Editor in whatever appearance mode you have selected. How to Always Edit Photos in Dark Mode on iPhone or iPad You can set Photos app to always edit your photos or videos in Dark Mode, always in Light Mode, or to follow the System setting for appearance, which is the default setting. We’re focusing on always editing in Dark Mode here, but you can make the change as appropriate for you: Open the Photos app as usual and then tap on any photo or video to edit Tap on the edit button at the bottom of the photo/video, which looks like three lines with little dots on them Now tap on the three dots menu button in the corner Tap on “Appearance” and then choose “Dark” to always be editing in Dark Mode, “Light” to always be editing in Light Mode, or to follow the system setting “System” Having Photos Edit to always be in Dark Mode will mean the background and surrounding is black and dark, even if the system setting is for light/white. Similarly, having Light set for the Photos Editor appearance will use light mode in Photos app editing even if the system setting is for dark/black. This is ultimately a matter of personal preference, and whether you want to change this setting at all may depend on which appearance mode you prefer, and also whether you spend a lot of time making edits and adjustments to photos and videos in general.",
