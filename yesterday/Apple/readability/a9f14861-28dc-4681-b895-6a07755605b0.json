  "description": "Macworld iOS 26 is finally here – well, at least its first developer beta. As shown by Apple at the WWDC keynote last week, the update brings a bunch of improvements to the iPhone’s operating system. There are more customization options for iMessages, real-time translation for phone calls, and of course, the new Liquid Glass interface. But iOS 26 also introduces many new under-the-hood technologies that will help developers supercharge their favorite apps once the update arrives on your phone this fall. Here are five ways your apps will get even more capabilities in iOS 26: Frequent fliers With iOS 26, Apple has unveiled some great updates for the Wallet app. For example, tickets have been redesigned so that they can display even more information about an event. But there’s a new feature designed specifically for airline apps. Thanks to a new API available to developers, airlines will be able to show details of their services included in the customer’s fare and even provide upgrade options, all directly from the Wallet app on the iPhone. As an example, an airline ticket in the Wallet app can now show whether you have priority boarding or a checked baggage allowance. And if you want an upgrade, you’ll be able to get it with just a tap. In addition, with the user’s permission, airline apps can automatically add a ticket to the Wallet app as soon as you check in with no need to open the app and tap the “Add to Apple Wallet” button. Upgraded tickets in the iOS 26 Wallet app will also provide real-time flight tracking information, and you can share the tracking with your friends or family. iOS 16 will make your boarding passes and flight tracking much snazzier.Apple Gamers unite! For gamers, iOS 26 introduces several new technologies that will improve performance and the overall experience on your iPhone. One of these improvements relates to touch controls within games. Currently, developers working on an iPhone or iPad game that requires more advanced controls have to design their own touch controls. This leads to a certain inconsistency, as each game has different controls. Not to mention that it makes the developer’s job more difficult. In iOS 26, Apple now provides its own touch controls for buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, throttles, and touchpads. This not only makes it much easier for developers to implement but also ensures a better experience for players. The controls can be customized for each game, but will still be based on Apple technologies for better response. And with the new Games app, which comes pre-installed on iOS 26, developers can implement specific Challenges and Activities so that players can invite their friends to play along. And finally, Metal 4 brings next-level gaming on Apple silicon devices. Sound the alarm Also with iOS 26, developers finally have the ability to implement alarms in their apps. Currently, apps are limited to sending you regular notifications in most cases, but now they will also be able to provide full-screen alarms, similar to the iPhone’s native alarm. That means your favorite recipe app will now be able to set an alarm for you without you having to open the Clock app. Developers can implement their own interface for the alarm and set different options for countdown and snooze functionality as well as live activity on the Lock Screen. Alarms are everywhere in iOS 26—and that’s a great thing.Apple Bye-bye passwords Apple joined the FIDO Alliance back in 2020, along with other companies such as Google and 1Password, to work on passkeys, an authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with security keys and biometrics. Many apps and websites already provide support for passkeys, and with iOS 26, Apple is introducing many improvements that will make adopting passkeys even easier. With the update, iPhone and iPad apps can let users create a new passkey account with just a tap. The feature not only generates a passkey but also pre-fills your personal data, such as name and email, so you no longer have to waste time filling in long sign-up forms. Passkeys can be authenticated with Face ID or Touch ID, and credentials are synchronized between all your Apple devices via iCloud. Double up One of the main complaints about iOS is how it limits background activities. As a way of saving battery and hardware resources, Apple has only let apps run certain activities in the background, such as GPS and audio. Because of this, users must keep an app open when they’re doing something important, such as uploading files or exporting a video. Thankfully, this has changed with iOS 26 thanks to a new API for running tasks in the background. Developers can implement this API in their apps so that tasks that take longer can run in the background, meaning that users can switch to other apps without interrupting the previous task. Imagine being able to use other apps while exporting a video in Final Cut for iPad or uploading your photos to Google Photos in the background. That’s exactly what will happen once third-party apps are updated with this technology. You’ll finally be able to do two things at once on your iPhone and iPad.Apple And much more There are many other new APIs coming with iOS 26, and they open up a whole new world of possibilities for developers. However, one thing you need to keep in mind is that each app needs to be updated to take advantage of these new technologies. In other words, don’t expect to see apps with these features before iOS 26 is released to the public in September. For now, iOS 26 is only available as a developer beta. Apple says a public beta will be available in July and the full release will arrive this fall. The update is compatible with iPhone 11 and later.",

That’s exactly what will happen once third-party apps are updated with this technology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure data-wp-context=\"{\u0026#34;uploadedSrc\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;figureClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;wp-block-image size-large\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;figureStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;imgClassNames\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;wp-image-2818238\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;imgStyles\u0026#34;:null,\u0026#34;targetWidth\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;targetHeight\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;none\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;scaleAttr\u0026#34;:false,\u0026#34;ariaLabel\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Enlarge image: iPadOS 26 Multitasking\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;alt\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;iPadOS 26 Multitasking\u0026#34;}\" data-wp-interactive=\"core/image\"\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" data-wp-init=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async--click=\"actions.showLightbox\" data-wp-on-async--load=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" data-wp-on-async-window--resize=\"callbacks.setButtonStyles\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\u0026amp;w=1200\" alt=\"iPadOS 26 Multitasking\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 2400w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=300%2C200\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=768%2C512\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 768w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=1200%2C800\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1200w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=1536%2C1024\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1536w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=2048%2C1365\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 2048w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=1240%2C826\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1240w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/iPadOS-26-Multitasking.jpg?resize=150%2C100\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 150w\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou’ll finally be able to do two things at once on your iPhone and iPad.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eApple\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"and-much-more\"\u003eAnd much more\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eThere are many other new APIs coming with iOS 26, and they open up a whole new world of possibilities for developers. However, one thing you need to keep in mind is that each app needs to be updated to take advantage of these new technologies. In other words, don’t expect to see apps with these features before iOS 26 is released to the public in September.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor now, iOS 26 is only available as a developer beta. Apple says a public beta will be available in July and the full release will arrive this fall. The update is compatible with iPhone 11 and later.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
