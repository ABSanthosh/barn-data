  "text": "News iOS 18.5 is probably a week away, with good news for iPhone 13 users. Image: Ed Hardy/Cult of Mac Apple sent the iOS 18.5 release candidate out for testing Tuesday and revealed that the update will enable the iPhone 13 series to access carrier-provided satellite features. The new software also will bring other changes and bug fixes for models going back to the iPhone XR. The release candidates for macOS Sequoia 15.5, iPadOS 18.5, watchOS 11.5, tvOS 18.5 and visionOS 2.5 also went out at the same time. iOS 18.5 expands carrier-provided satellite connectivity to more iPhones Release candidates are the last step in beta testing. They give third-party software developers and other beta testers one last opportunity to look over the final versions of operating systems before Apple introduces them to average users. They also include the official description of the new versions, revealing the new features Apple considers most important. The one for iOS 18.5 says, “This update introduces a new Pride Harmony wallpaper for the Lock Screen, and other features, bug fixes, and security updates for your iPhone.” Apple showed off the Pride wallpapers Monday. (These will arrive in macOS Sequoia 15.5 and iPadOS 18.5, too.) However, the iOS 18.5 description doesn’t mention a new feature that it told developers about Tuesday: “Support for carrier-provided satellite features is available on iPhone 13 (all models).” iOS 18.3 brought satellite texting for all iPhone 14 and later models. The feature allows users with no cellular access to send text messages using satellite services offered by their wireless carriers. In the United States, that’s T-Mobile and Starlink. iOS 18.5 adds that connectivity to iPhone 13 versions. Expect Apple OS upgrades next week Release candidates traditionally come out a week before the full launch. Given that the latest round of RCs went out on May 6, the full versions of iOS 18.5, macOS Sequoia 15.5, iPadOS 18.5, watchOS 11.5, tvOS 18.5 and visionOS 2.5 likely will arrive on May 13. However, Apple could surprise us and release them at any time. That said, developers complain if they don’t get a week of testing with the RCs.",
