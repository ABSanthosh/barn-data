Apple has reportedly emerged as the company most likely to acquire Major League Baseball streaming rights previously held by ESPN. The iPhone maker currently offers Friday Night Baseball via Apple TV+, which consists of two baseball games every Friday without interruptions or restrictions, but that could soon change. According to a Sports Business Journal report on Monday, Apple is looking to land streaming rights for MLB content beyond the scope of its current arrangement. Legacy media outlets such as NBC are also said to be in talks with MLB over the same streaming rights, but Apple's offer is said to be noticeably higher. For reference, Apple has had an arrangement with Major League Baseball since 2022, which sees the company paying $85 million per year. ESPN's previous streaming deal, meanwhile, was worth a much higher $550 million per season. Depending on the outcome of its negotiations with MLB, Apple may be able to offer Sunday night baseball games to Apple TV+ users at some point in the future. Apple could continue offering the games as an included part of Apple TV+ or seek to break them out as a paid service like MLS. There's a paid MLB.tv service that rakes in about $120 per year for access to every game including blackouts. After investing so much into baseball, Apple may not be able to recoup costs through increased Apple TV+ interest alone, hence the need for a potential MLB service addition. A new MLB streaming deal also has the potential to provide additional revenue for Apple TV+. While Apple doesn't detail the revenue from any individual service or show, Apple TV+, as a whole, is costing Apple billions per year. The company's supposed negotiations with MLB align with its recent push into sports-related content. In February 2024, the iPhone maker released a dedicated Apple Sports app, which displays real-time scores and statistics for MLS, NBA, and more. Apple has also partnered with Major League Soccer to offer the so-called MLS Season Pass, which has been available since 2023. The Apple TV app is currently the official destination for all matches and MLS content. Apart from MLB and MLS, the iPhone maker reportedly considered a $2B deal regarding Formula 1 streaming rights. Apple has also expressed interest in FIFA tournaments, and NFL content for Apple Vision Pro. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether or not the company will be able to acquire streaming rights to any additional MLB content, as negotiations are reportedly still ongoing and traditional broadcast companies are in the running.",
