  "text": "News Apple TV+ subscribers can now laugh along with Acapulco season 4. Graphic: Apple TV+ Acapulco returned to Apple TV+ on Wednesday for its fourth and final season. While bilingual shows often struggle on American TV, this comedy earned high praise from critics. With Apple more willing to cancel underperforming series, keeping Acapulco going for this long means it must have found an audience. It certainly earns top ratings from viewers. The series follows Máximo Gallardo in two time periods. In 1984, young Máximo (played by Enrique Arrizon) gets his dream job at Acapulco’s hottest resort, Las Colinas. In the present day, an older Máximo (played by Eugenio Derbez) is still involved with the resort and the many people he met there. With that description, the series could be a dark and serious drama, but instead it’s played for laughs. And skillfully so. One reviewer called it a “vibrant, colorful, and supremely feel-good series.” Season One scored a 100% critic’s approval rating on the review-aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes. All three previous seasons earned very high audience approval scores — all above 90%. And that’s important. The days are long gone when Apple was so determined to build up its catalog that it never cancelled anything. Central Park and Swagger are only a couple of examples of well-liked series that got the axe. Back to Las Colinas The plot teaser Apple TV+ gives for Acapulco season 4 reflects that the show takes place in two eras: “In season four, present-day Máximo works tirelessly to restore Las Colinas to its former glory before the grand reopening. In 1986, when a competitor claims the number one spot in the annual ranking of Acapulco’s “Best Hotels,” young Máximo will do whatever it takes to get back on top and secure Las Colinas’ future.” The star of Acapulco is thrilled that it’s back for season four. “Having Apple order a fourth season of Acapulco is beyond thrilling,” said Eugenio Derbez. “I’m incredibly grateful to our amazing partners, the talented cast and crew, and especially the audience, whose love and support have made this journey possible. It’s rare for shows centered on Latino stories to make it this far, and that makes this milestone even more meaningful.” Watch it now The first two episodes of Acapulco season 4 can be enjoyed now. Or get started by bingewatching the first three seasons. Streaming the comedy series comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial. You can also get it via any tier of the Apple One subscription bundle. Of course, Apple’s streaming video service also includes much more than one comedy. There’s a library of drama, sci-fi, musicals, children’s shows, nature documentaries, etc.",
