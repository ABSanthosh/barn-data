  "text": "M4 Pro benchmarks show it may be a powerhouse Supposed scores for the M4 Pro chipset have shown up on Geekbench, and it easily outperforms the Mac Pro with M2 Ultra in single- and multi-core scores. The M4 Pro is an option for the new Mac mini and MacBook Pro. While these products don't launch for the public until November 8, early testers are running benchmarks. According to a score for Mac16,7 on Geekbench, the M4 Pro is a powerful chipset capable of outperforming the M2 Ultra found in Mac Pro. It received a single-core score of 3,925 and a multi-core score of 22,669. For comparison, the Mac Pro with M2 Ultra has a 2,868 single-core score and a 22,065 multi-core score. This is the configuration with a 24-core CPU and 192GB of RAM. The Mac16,7 could be one of the new MacBook Pro models. It shows it has an M4 Pro clocking at 4.51GHz with a 14-core CPU and 48GB of RAM. If these scores are accurate, the M4 Pro will prove to be a formidable chipset, to say nothing of M4 Max or the inevitable M4 Ultra. Review embargoes likely lift early next week ahead of the November 8 launch, so the Geekbench scores can be verified then.",
