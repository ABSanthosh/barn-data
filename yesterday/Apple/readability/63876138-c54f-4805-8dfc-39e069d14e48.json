If you're reading AppleInsider, chances are you have a good idea how much nearly any Apple product might cost. However, it is easy to forget that it isn't common knowledge, as was proven on a classic game show. A Threads post from Justin Ryan shows a recorded video of a segment from The Price is Right. An Apple Vision Pro is shown, and the players have to guess the price without going over, and they all came in well under retail. If you're not familiar with The Price is Right, it is a game show where contestants are called down from the audience and are given a chance to play for bigger prizes after guessing a product price first. Going first is never ideal, as someone can snipe your bid by adding a dollar. All four bidders realized the Apple Vision Pro was an expensive product, and likely even understood that Apple was a high-priced retailer. Some VR headsets cost $500 or less, easily, so $1,000 seemed like a safe bet for the contestants. However, this is Apple we're talking about. None of the contestants came close, with the highest bid coming in at $1,250 — nearly a third of the $3,499 base model price tag. Some would suggest this is a sign that Apple's headset is truly overpriced. Average consumers don't know the value of such a product, so they're likely to come well under the expected price. That said, Apple didn't build Apple Vision Pro for the average consumer. It is marketed as a high-end device that has its uses, but it isn't a mass market product. If there is a lesson to be learned from this game show, it's that Apple needs a lower-priced headset. However, even with price reduced materials and limited features, it may be hard to hit a sub-$2,000 price anytime soon. Apple is expected to reveal a new Apple Vision Pro model sometime in the next year. It is unknown whether it will be a low-priced model, a second-generation model, or both.",
