  "text": "AirTag, Apple’s item tracking device, was announced almost four years ago. Although the company has introduced new software features for AirTag owners since then, the accessory has never had a hardware upgrade since its launch. But according to the latest rumors, an AirTag 2 is on the way – and here’s everything we know about it so far. Latest rumors on AirTag 2 For those unfamiliar, AirTag is a small accessory that can be used to track items such as keys, backpacks, suitcases and even vehicles. It works through Apple’s Find My network, which sends the location of the accessory to the owner via other Apple devices nearby, so AirTag doesn’t need to be connected to the internet to work. But what about the rumored AirTag 2? According to multiple sources, Apple has been working on the second generation of its item tracker with plans to launch it sometime this year. A Bloomberg report last year revealed exactly what to expect from the AirTag 2 in terms of hardware specifications. According to people familiar with the matter, one of Apple’s main goals is to extend the range of the Precision Finding feature. Presumably, Apple will use the same UWB chip added to the latest iPhone and Apple Watch models. Currently, an AirTag can be tracked with Precision Finding at a range of 10 to 15 meters thanks to Apple’s Ultra Wideband “U1” chip. However, the latest generation of Apple’s UWB chip introduced with iPhone 15 and Apple Watch Series 9 has an extended range of up to 60 meters. This makes it easier to find these devices at a greater distance. Other reports also suggest that Apple is working on new anti-stalking measures. For instance, some people have found a way to modify AirTags to disable their internal speaker. Apple wants to find a way to make this modification impossible. Unfortunately, there are no rumors about any changes to the AirTag form-factor. Although the current version is already small enough, it’s not exactly ideal for things like a wallet. There are third-party item trackers that are almost as thin as a card, but they don’t have Precision Finding – which is exclusive to AirTag. As for the release date, leaker Kosutami recently suggested that AirTag 2 will be released “in May or June,” so perhaps we’ll see the new accessory in time for WWDC 2025.
