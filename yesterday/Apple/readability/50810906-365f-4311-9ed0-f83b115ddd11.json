  "description": "Macworld There may be a “new” AirPods Max at the Apple Store, but the only thing different is the USB-C port. So why bother—especially when you can get a Lightning pair for their best price ever: Amazon’s Black Friday Apple sales incude the fantastic Lightning-based AirPods Max headphones for $399, a healthy $150 discount from their $549 MSRP, and the best price we’ve ever seen. Other than the port, these AirPods Max are identical to the USB-C model despite some new colors. They have the same design that’s gorgeous and comfortable and come with the same specs and features, including top-notch noise cancelation and super useful transparency mode. In our review of the AirPods Max, we gave them a four-star rating, loving the pleasant sound quality and just how well-built they are. “Are the AirPod Max the best wireless noise-cancelling headphones you can buy? For those who rely on the Apple ecosystem, yes. They offer sound quality on par or even slightly better than their competitors and superior noise-cancelling,” we noted in his review. While the headphones don’t have a physical button to stop them, they have some super smart sensors that pause audio when you take them off and shut off on their own after a while. They also provide some 20 hours of listening time, and plugging them in for some 5 minutes adds another 90 minutes of listening time. And they have a feature the USB-C model doesn’t have: you can plug in a Lightning-to-3.5mm cable and listen with a wired connection. So don’t miss out on getting the AirPods Max at their best price ahead of Black Friday for $399. Get the AirPods Max for 27% offBuy now at Amazon",
