The previous rumor from June 2024, has now been confirmed through a general recruitment notice on the store's new website. No specific job positions have been listed yet, and neither the opening date nor the exact location of the store has not been confirmed. Apple says only that the new store is \"coming soon,\" with no address details. As with many recent Apple Stores, the downtown Detroit store's site features a bespoke Apple logo. Unlike ones such as the new Miami store, however, the new artwork can't yet be downloaded. As for the location, it's believed that Apple has taken over over two currently closed storefronts between 1426 and 1434 Woodward Avenue, according to the Detroit Free Press. When opened, the new store will mark the fourth Apple Store in the general Detroit area, and the seventh in the state of Michigan. The other three Detroit stores are Apple Twelve Oaks in Novi, Apple Somerset in Troy, and Apple Partridge Creek in Clinton Township. The proposed new store site is currently represented by Bedrock Real Estate, which owns the building there. Bedrock owner Dan Gilbert first told reporters of his hopes for getting an Apple Store in the area in 2015. Renovation signage has been up at the proposed site since June 2024, and Gilbert was also involved in setting up an Apple Developer Academy in the city in 2021. A new Apple Store could help further revitalize the downtown core in Detroit, which has seen an uptick in economic development in recent years. The new store would be situated between a boutique hotel and the former Hudsons building, now the headquarters of automaker General Motors.",
