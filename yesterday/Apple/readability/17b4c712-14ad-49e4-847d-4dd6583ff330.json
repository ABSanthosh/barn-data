  "text": "There are two types of portable MagSafe batteries: ones designed for a weekend camping trip and ones designed to get you through a heavy single day. I recently picked up the BENKS ArmorGo, and it’s a great option for your everyday carry (EDC) kit. It’s slim enough to fit in your pocket but big enough to get the job done. MagSafe Monday: Every Monday, Bradley Chambers looks at the latest and greatest in the MagSafe and wireless charging industry to help you get the most out of your Apple devices that support wireless charging. Design What sets the BENKS ArmorGo apart from other MagSafe batteries is the aramid fiber texture. It not only looks really nice, but gives the it a strong, grippy feel that helps it stay in place while in your hand or pocket. It really makes it easy to pull out of your pocket. At just 0.34 inches thick and weighing only 4.3 ounces, it’s one of the thinnest and lightest MagSafe batteries I’ve tested. It slides easily into a back pocket or a purse without adding bulk. BENKS ArmorGo Charging speed and capacity At 5000mAh in terms of battery capacity, the BENKS ArmorGo hits the sweet spot for everyday use. It’s not designed for multi-day power, but it’s perfect for getting through a long travel day or a nonstop work schedule. It can charge my iPhone 15 Pro from nearly dead to around 50% in about 30 minutes using MagSafe, which is plenty to keep you going until you can get a wired charge again. Overall, It’s fast, reliable, and doesn’t get very hot while charging. Wrap up The BENKS ArmorGo is a great pick if you want a compact battery that punches above its weight. The strong N52 magnets keep it locked in place while wirelessly charging your iPhone, and it’s just as handy for quickly topping off your AirPods, Kindle Paperwhite, or even a Nintendo Switch with a USB-C cable. While it doesn’t have built-in wired charging, the wireless experience is solid, and the 5000mAh capacity is right in the zone for daily carry. The aramid fiber texture gives it a high-end look and feel while making it easier to grip. It’s lightweight and ultra-thin and slides into just about any pocket or pouch without getting in the way. If you’re building out your EDC kit or just want something simple that works, this one’s worth a look. The BENKS ArmorGo can be purchased from Amazon or directly from BENKS.
