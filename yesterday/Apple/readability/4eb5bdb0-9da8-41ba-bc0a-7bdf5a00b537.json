  "description": "Macworld It’s not often that Apple releases an iOS update to address a single security vulnerability—generally, there are at least a few security holes plugged in even a minor iOS point release. It’s even more rare that the security fix in question addresses something that was seemingly already fixed. But that’s exactly the case with iOS 18.3.2 and iPadOS 18.3.2. According to Apple’s security note on this release, the only change in this release is a WebKit update to address an out-of-bounds write issue that allowed some content to break out of the “web sandbox.” The most interesting part is Apple’s note that this was an issue addressed in iOS 17.2 back in December 2023 and needed further attention: This is a supplementary fix for an attack that was blocked in iOS 17.2. (Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been exploited in an extremely sophisticated attack against specific targeted individuals on versions of iOS before iOS 17.2.) So go head over to Settings and update your iPhones, iPads, and Macs. There’s a security vulnerability that wasn’t as tightly fixed as it should have been over a year ago.",
