  "text": "If you’d like to start the new year with some binge watching, you can enjoy a free weekend of all-access to Apple TV+ films and shows starting on January 3 and continuing through January 5. The free weekend is available on any device where you can stream Apple TV+, all you will need is an Apple ID to access the free weekend. This means basically any iPhone, Mac, iPad, Apple TV, Vision Pro, smart TV’s from LG, Samsung, Sony, Vizio, TCL, Roku, Amazon Fire TV equipped devices, Chromecast, Google TV, Playstation, and Xbox consoles can all access or stream the free Apple TV+ content this weekend. You can also watch online through a web browser at tv.apple.com if you prefer. Apple TV+ offers a selection of shows and movies, including Apple TV+ originals, ranging from The Morning Show, Ted Lasso, Silo, See, For All Mankind, Foundation series, Slow Horses, Presumed Innocent, Disclaimer, Shrinking, Bad Sisters, Disclaimer, Dark Matter, Fly Me to the Moon, The Family Plan, Wolfs, The Instigators, and more. Check out https://tv.apple.com Apple TV+ typically costs $10/month, and while the selection of shows and movies might be less than you’d get on something like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Max, Disney+, or the ten thousand other streaming service options, some people really enjoy what Apple TV+ has to offer. I personally haven’t watched any shows or content from Apple TV+ so I can’t vouch for any of it, but you can always visit Rotten Tomatoes Apple TV section to see how other people rate the shows. BTW if you’re binging in a busy home, don’t forget you can connect your AirPods to Apple TV to watch privately without blasting the audio to everyone else. It’s not clear if a subscription automatically starts after the free weekend, so you might want to schedule a cancellation of the service for the end of January 5 if you don’t want to accidentally start paying Apple even more money than you already do when you buy new devices or subscribe to iCloud to backup your iPhone. If you’re interested in learning more, check out the Apple press release. Otherwise, enjoy your binge watching!",
