In 2025, the market for Bluetooth and wireless peripherals is fairly saturated. There's something for just about everyone. Whether you're looking for a basic input device for your iPhone and iPad or something for an advanced gaming setup, the options are endless. The Seenda CBD 2 (CTU-301) wireless keyboard and mouse set won't wow you with an endless array of customization options or expensive materials, but it will with its bright colors and bold design choices. Instead of offering all the latest bells and whistles at a remarkably high price tag, Seenda keeps things basic. You get the core input device experience with a unique look at a reasonable $39.99 price point. The company also has a rather unusual-looking ergonomic mouse available, with vertical buttons rather than horizontal ones. Seenda's MBD 5 (MOU-302) mouse seems odd at first glance, but you get used to the button placement fairly quickly, and it's great for games. Overall, Seenda delivers peripherals that are unquestionably different, but not always in a good way. Seenda CBD 2 and MBD 5 review: What's inside the boxSeenda's CBD 2 peripheral set ships with virtually everything you can expect from a $39.99 product, and it's not much. The same can be said for the $27.99 MBD 5 ergonomic vertical mouse. Seenda's peripherals only ship with the essentials.The packaging itself is relatively durable, but you don't get any use-altering accessories beyond the peripherals themselves and their associated instruction manuals. In the case of the MBD 5 ergonomic mouse, however, you do get a USB-C charging cable. This is because it has a built-in 500mAh battery. Seenda says it can provide up to 2 months of continuous usage on a single charge. The CBD 2 peripheral set features removable batteries. The mouse requires one AA battery, and the keyboard needs two AAA batteries — which are not included. The CBD 2 wireless peripheral set ships with a removable protective cover for the keyboard. It's a nice touch that keeps dust out, but nothing groundbreaking. Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: Design, build qualitySeenda's peripherals would never be mistaken for a modern-day Apple product, and that's precisely where their charm lies. Seenda's products are available in strikingly bright color options.Unlike Apple's Magic Keyboard, which has remained largely unchanged for years, Seenda's CBD 2 keyboard features round buttons, making it look unique. The accompanying mouse similarly features a wide, ball-like scroll wheel. The design has a retro-futuristic vibe that goes well with Apple's recent 'Liquid Glass' software aesthetic, yet also echoes the past. Seenda's peripherals are reminiscent of the iPhone 5c, which Apple's design chief at the time called \"unapologetically plastic.\" Seenda's products don't try to imitate the look and feel of an aluminum or titanium finish — they stand out precisely because of their extensive use of brightly-colored plastic. In the hand, they feel quite heavy and durable, which is more than you'd expect from the $39.99 CBD 2 peripheral set. Seenda's CBD 2 wireless keyboard features round buttons.In terms of colors, the CBD2 keyboard and mouse set would go well with a base model iPhone 16, an 11-inch iPad, or iPad mini, and it might come in handy with the new multitasking system introduced with iPadOS 26. Alongside the industry standard black and white color options, Seenda's CBD 2 keyboard and mouse set is available in three vibrant color combinations: Coral Pink, Black and Yellow, and Blue and Purple. The company's MBD 5 (MOU-302) ergonomic mouse features an even more radical design, as the left and right mouse buttons are vertical rather than horizontal. The Purple color comes with light green buttons and a yellow scroll wheel, allowing for a color combination that might make you think of \"The Simpsons\". The MBD 5 ergonomic mouse is also available in Blue, Black, and Rose. Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: Ports and featuresRelative to a standard mouse, the left side of the MBD 5 ergonomic mouse features two additional buttons. They're convenient for games, and we tested it with Palworld on an M2 MacBook Air. Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 ergonomic mouse both feature a USB-A wireless receiver.On the top side of the MBD 5, you'll notice a dial. When connected to an iPhone, iPad, or Mac, the mouse dial can be used to adjust your system volume. This works without issue, regardless of the platform in question. The bottom of Seenda's ergonomic mouse is where the device's on/off switch is located. You'll also find a button that allows you to switch between Bluetooth and wireless mode, along with a USB-A receiver for the latter. The CBD 2 keyboard features a built-in slot for your mobile devices — iPhones and iPadsThe keyboard in Seenda's CBD 2 peripheral set, meanwhile, features a built-in stand or slot for a mobile device, such as an iPad or iPhone, although the device also works with Macs and PCs. One drawback is that iPhones with a case may not fit into the keyboard's built-in stand. The CBD 2 keyboard and mouse set uses a wireless receiver with a USB-A connector, meaning that you can connect to Seenda's products wirelessly or via Bluetooth. However, depending on your device, you may not have much of a choice. Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: CompatibilityBoth the MBD 5 ergonomic mouse and the CBD 2 peripheral set feature wireless receivers with a USB-A connector. Seenda's peripherals feature a USB-A wireless receiver, which is convenient if you want to use them with an older MacBook Pro.It may not be ideal for modern Macs, which typically lack USB-A ports. Still, newer Apple products can connect to Seenda's devices via Bluetooth, and the USB-A receiver is a great compatibility feature for older Macs. We tested Seenda's products with a variety of products, including Apple Silicon-based Macs, Intel-based Macs, as well as iPhones and iPads. Overall, you won't experience any issues with a more recent iPhone, iPad, or Apple Silicon Mac. We were able to get Seenda's products working via Bluetooth on a 2016 iPhone 7 and a 2017 iPad Pro, but devices without Bluetooth 4.0 won't be able to use Seenda's CBD 2 peripheral set or the company's MBD 5 vertical mouse. As for testing Seenda's accessories with Intel-based Macs, we experienced the best results with units running macOS Sequoia, even on unsupported hardware. The Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 wireless mouse work great, even with a Mac that's decades old.Officially, Seenda's products are compatible with macOS 10.12 Sierra or newer, but we encountered issues using Bluetooth on older releases of macOS, such as 10.15 Catalina. Occasionally, macOS misidentified Seenda's mouse as a keyboard from a different brand. That's where the USB-A wireless receiver comes in handy, though! Both the CBD 2 peripheral set and Seenda's MBD 5 ergonomic mouse worked flawlessly when used with the wireless receiver. We were even able to use Seenda's products with a PowerPC Mac from the year 2000, running macOS 9.2. Overall, Seenda's peripherals will work with just about any Mac built in the last 25 years, but the same can't be said for mobile device compatibility, unfortunately. Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: Performance, usabilityIn our testing, we experienced no issues with the Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set or the MBD 5 vertical mouse. Both devices performed as expected, be it on iOS, iPadOS, or macOS. Seenda's CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 vertical mouse are great for gaming on the iPad Pro.The CBD 2 keyboard and mouse set is a great option for iPad Pro users. While obviously not a requirement to use the device, Bluetooth peripherals allow for more Mac-like navigation, especially with iPadOS 26. In general, typing with Seenda's CBD 2 keyboard is a relatively enjoyable experience, and it beats the on-screen keyboard of the iPad Pro. With its round buttons and hefty feel, the CBD 2 keyboard is more reminiscent of a typewriter than a Mac — but it's responsive and reliable. The keys are responsive, with more travel than a typical Apple keyboard. Seenda's CBD 2 keyboard for writing and web-browsing on an iPad.Seenda's CBD 2 peripheral set is also great for gaming on the iPad Pro. The CBD 2 keyboard and mouse work well with Minecraft on iPad, allowing for an experience that's virtually identical to the PC version of the game. We also tested Seenda's products with Asphalt Legends, which is one of the few other games that support keyboard input on iPadOS. Seenda's MBD 5 mouse is great for gaming with a Mac.The MBD 5 mouse, meanwhile, is better for Mac or PC gamers because of the added buttons on the left side of the device. They emulate the press of the Shift and Control keys, which are often used in games that require keyboard input. At first glance, it looks like it would take a while to get used to the vertically positioned buttons. In reality, however, it feels just like any other mouse. Relative to Apple's Magic Mouse, it's much better for gaming, because of the scroll wheel and separate left and right mouse buttons. It lacks the multi-touch gestures of the Magic Mouse, however, so Seenda's MBD 5 mouse won't be for everyone. Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: Pros Broad compatibility with the 2.4G wireless mode Low price point Good durability Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: Cons iPhones with a case won't fit in the CBD 2 keyboard Not compatible with older Bluetooth-enabled iPhones and iPads Bluetooth issues with older versions of macOS Rating: 4 out of 5Seenda CBD 2 peripheral set and MBD 5 mouse review: Where to buyThe CBD 2 (CTU-301) keyboard and mouse set, as well as the MBD 5 (MOU-302) ergonomic vertical mouse, are available on Amazon: Seenda CBD 2 (CTU-301) wireless keyboard and mouse set Seenda MBD 5 (MOU-302) ergonomic vertical mouse Overall, they're worth buying. The low $39.99 price point of the CBD 2 peripheral set is especially appealing, and both the keyboard and mouse performed well in our testing. At $27.99, the MBD 5 vertical mouse costs a bit more than a typical wired option, but the added features make it a solid buy. The extra buttons are especially useful for games, and they might work well the titles Apple announced at WWDC 2025, once they're released.",
