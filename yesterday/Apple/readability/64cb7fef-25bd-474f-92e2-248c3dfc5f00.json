  "text": "Robot cleaners have evolved significantly since their early days, offering deeper cleaning, smarter routing, auto-emptying, and more. But larger homes with mixed flooring surfaces and complex layouts can still prove challenging for conventional robots. Roborock’s new Saros 10 and Saros 10R models bring robocleaners into the AI era, employing advanced machine learning algorithms for both cleaning and navigation tasks … The most advanced cleaning features Both models offer the most advanced cleaning features yet, starting with the thinnest design ever seen in a Roborock. Just 3.15 inches (7.98cm) high, the machines slip easily beneath low-sitting furniture that would block other cleaners. Four different lifting modes allow the Saros 10 models to cope with a wide range of flooring surfaces. The cleaner can independently raise and lower the chassis, mop, main brush, and side brush for unrivalled flexibility. This adaptability enables the most efficient cleaning of everything from hardwood surfaces to deep pile carpets, avoiding the common problem of cleaners which drag dirt from one surface to another. The AdaptiLift chassis can also easily cross the most challenging doorway thresholds. Pet hair is another pain point for many robocleaners, with hair tangles a common reason for devices to lose cleaning efficiency. The Saros 10 models have a clever anti-tangle system which divides the main brush and FlexiArm rising side brush to enable 100% hair removal and ensure full cleaning performance is retained. Both models are also able to employ their intelligence to adapt suction power and cleaning modes in real-time to perfectly balance efficiency and thoroughness, but they can also learn your own preferences. If particular areas of the home need to be cleaned more frequently than others, for example, the Saros 10 models will mark those as higher priority. Saros 10: The AI-powered deep cleaning specialist The Saros 10 is the successor to the S8 MaxV Ultra, and is specifically designed for larger homes with the most challenging cleaning demands. You get maximum cleaning power, with 22,000 Pa suction and the most sophisticated mopping system, VibraRise 4.0. This increases the vibrating area of the mop by 27%, and the wheels can lift the front of the cleaner to increase pressure on the mop during a secondary pass for the most stubborn of stains. One of the most common problems experienced with conventional cleaning robots is coping with cables running across the floor to lights and other devices. The Saros 10 is equipped with a wide vertical laser in addition to the standard horizontal one, allowing it to detect both cables and other irregular shapes, cleaning around these. That secondary laser also comes into its own when the robot is faced with very low height clearance beneath furniture. The RetractSense Navigation System enables the robot to measure the available height and where necessary retract the main LiDAR module into the body of the robot, further reducing its height. While retracted, the Saros 10 switches navigation to the secondary laser, which offers an ultra-wide 100-degree scan. The primary module then raises again once clear of the height restriction. Finally, the Saros 10 really brings cleaning to a new level through the use of AI algorithms to automatically identify the different types of dirt and stains encountered, to work out which cleaning modes will be most effective, and to make all the necessary adjustments. Saros 10R: The ultimate AI-powered navigation system For homes with the most complex layouts, the Saros 10R model introduces a whole new generation of navigation technology. Instead of a traditional laser distance sensor, the 10R combines two different types of scanning. The first is dual-light Time-of-Flight sensors, which offer a sampling frequency 21 times higher than standard laser modules. The second are RGB cameras providing a video feed to the robot. The combined inputs allow the robot to create not just the most detailed and precise mapping of your home, but a true 3D model rather than the 2D version provided by LiDAR. Both feeds are processed by the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0, an AI system which can intelligently work out what’s in front of it. It can distinguish more than 100 different types of obstacle, from loose cables through children’s toys to socks. The AI capabilities are also used to enable the 10R to automatically adjust its cleaning modes based on both what it sees and usage history. For example, it knows when it has cleaned a kitchen or a bathroom, and will trigger immediate mop-washing so that dirt from those rooms isn’t spread to the rest of the home. It also takes into account the time of day, automatically reducing suction power during quiet hours. The Saros 10R offers voice control, either through its own built-in “Hello, Rocky” commands, or through Alexa, Google Home, and Siri Shortcuts. Matter support will later be added as a free over-the-air update, offering even greater integration with smart home ecosystems like Apple Home. Of course, the Saros 10R isn’t just about smarts – you also get all the high-performance cleaning capabilities you’d expect. That includes the same advanced multi-lifting and anti-tangle technology as the Saros 10 model. Launch discounts offer $200 saving To celebrate the launch of its most innovative models, Roborock is offering an introductory discount of $200 on both models. Saros 10: $1599 now $1399 Saros 10R: $1599 now $1399 Both discounts are available from February 10 to 16 inclusive.
