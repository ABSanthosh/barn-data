  "text": "Instagram and Spotify on Thursday announced an update to both apps that will bring new integration to make their users’ lives a bit easier. Instagram users will now have a quick and easy way to add songs they like to their Spotify library with just a few taps. Instagram now offers integration for adding songs to Spotify “We know that music is all around you and sometimes that means right on your social media feed. That’s why beginning today, Spotify is excited to unveil a new integration with Instagram that makes it even easier to capture and instantly add songs to Spotify from Instagram with just one simple tap,” Spotify said in a note to 9to5Mac. Essentially, when users see a post or Story on Instagram with a song, they can now tap on it to not only get more information, but also add it to Spotify without leaving the app. The new button appears right next to the player for listening to a preview of the song on Instagram. Of course, in order to get the new feature to work, users must link their Spotify account to Instagram. Songs added to Spotify will appear in the “Liked Songs” playlist and also in the “Your Library” tab. The new experience will be available for both iOS and Android users. “At Spotify, we’re always looking for new ways to create a deeper connection between artist and fans, and with this Instagram integration we’re introducing new ways for users to discover more of their favorite artists and tracks.” It’s worth noting that TikTok already has a similar feature, and it works not only with Spotify but also Apple Music and Amazon Music. The new feature for adding songs to Spotify from the Instagram app is now being rolled out globally. Make sure you have the latest version of both apps installed on your device.
