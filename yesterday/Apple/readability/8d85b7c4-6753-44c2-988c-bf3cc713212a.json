  "text": "Apple is launching a limited-time promotion in partnership with Nike. In an email today, the company revealed that Apple Card users can store 6% Daily Cash rewards on purchases at Nike through June 15. Apple says: Get 6% total Daily Cash back at Nike, on up to $500 in purchases, when you use Apple Card with Apple Pay through June 15. Terms and limitations apply. Shop in-store, online, or in-app on the latest shoes, apparel, accessories, and more — just in time for summer. Apple Card Daily Cash is issued at the end of every day, and appears directly in the Wallet app on your iPhone. You can then transfer that money to your bank, deposit it into your Apple Card Savings Account, apply it to your Apple Card balance, or use it to fund Apple Cash transactions with friends and family. This new limited-time promotion at Nike comes after Apple made other changes to Apple Card last week. T-Mobile transactions no longer qualify for the bonus 3% Daily Cash rate, but Apple Card users can now score six months of Uber One membership at no cost. 9to5Mac is supported by CardPointers: Download CardPointers for free and save over $750 per year by maximizing your credit card rewards. 9to5Mac readers can save 30% on CardPointers Pro’s annual and lifetime plans and get a $100 Savings Card, effectively making the lifetime upgrade free.  Add 9to5Mac to your Google News feed.  FTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.
