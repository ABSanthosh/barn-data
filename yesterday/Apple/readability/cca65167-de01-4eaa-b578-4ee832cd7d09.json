  "text": "Apple Maps is about to get a notable upgrade that will lead to more efficient EV routing suggestions for Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning drivers. As a refresher, the Apple Maps EV routing feature can help you plan trips by automatically inserting necessary charging stops along your route. The feature tracks your car’s charge level and takes into account a number of different factors to determine when and for how long you’ll need to charade. This includes variables like the availability and speed of chargers, elevation changes, your driving speed, and more. Currently, the Apple Maps EV routing feature is only supported by three cars: the Ford Mustang Mach-E, the Ford F-150 Lightning, and the Porsche Taycan. Last year, Ford began the process of delivering adapters that allow Mach-E and Lightning drivers to charge at Tesla Superchargers. Ford EVs include the CCS charging port, and this adapter converts that CCS connection into the North American Charging System (NACS) plug type. Apple Maps EV routing, however, hasn’t been updated with knowledge of this change. Currently, the feature works based solely on the plug type of the car itself. In this case, that means Apple Maps EV routing will only route Mach-E and Lightning drivers to CCS charging stations, as the feature has no knowledge of the fact that those cars can also charge at NACS stations. In a post on the Mach-E Forums today, however, Ford’s chief Mustang Mach-E engineer Donna Dickson said this is about to change. You will also now be able to find compatible Tesla Superchargers in the Connected Built-in Navigation system in the MY25 Mustang Mach-E. As a reminder, the locations of compatible Tesla Superchargers are also available when using Google Maps EV Routing for Android Auto, and will be coming to Apple Maps EV Routing for Apple CarPlay. As of right now, Ford and Apple haven’t shared any additional details on how this will work. Presumably, Ford drivers with a NACS adapter will simply be able to tell Apple Maps that they can charge at CCS and NACS stations. Apple Maps can then provide more accurate and efficient routing suggestions based on that knowledge. As a Mustang Mach-E driver myself, I very much look forward to this enhancement. Hopefully we get more details from Ford and Apple soon. If you’re an electric vehicle owner, charge up your car at home with rooftop solar panels.
