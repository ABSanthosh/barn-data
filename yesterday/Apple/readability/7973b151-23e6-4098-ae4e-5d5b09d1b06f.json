  "description": "Macworld Shooting music videos on iPhones is nothing new. Lady Gaga’s video for “Stupid Love” made a big deal about being shot “entirely on iPhone 11” almost five years ago. Olivia Rodrigo and Selena Gomez have shot music videos on iPhones, and most recently, The Weeknd’s “Dancing in the Flames” was shot in cinematic slow-mo on iPhone 16 Pro. But few actually feature the iPhone itself as much as OK Go’s new video for “A Stone Only Rolls Downhill.” You can watch it below. The video features “64 videos on 64 iPhones” and makes use of clever framing, choreography, and edits to tie it all together. Not only were all the videos shot on iPhone, but the iPhones are the star of the video. It’s difficult to judge exactly which iPhones are in use, but they appear to be iPhone 15 Pro models in bright colorful cases. In a short behind the scenes video you can see the phones have action buttons rather than mute switches, but no camera control button. And of course, they all feature a Dynamic Island.",
