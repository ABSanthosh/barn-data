Make AirPods almost universal AirPods connect seamlessly to iPhones and other Apple computers, or the wireless earbuds can be easily used with Androids, Windows PCs or other devices with Bluetooth. Unfortunately, not every TV and music player has Bluetooth. But it’s AirFly to the rescue. Plug its 3.5mm jack into devices that lack wireless connectivity, and your AirPods are ready to go. The original intended use was with the entertainment systems built into the back of seats on airlines — hence the name. And the gadget still works quite well for that, but it is equally useful for hearing the audio from TVs built into gym equipment. There are a variety of models.

Pros:Use with any 3.5 mm audio jackConnects to car stereos, gym equipment, airline entertainment systems If you like the idea but want more features, try the AirFly Pro. It adds the ability to pair with two sets of Bluetooth headphones at once, so you and your spouse/etc. can watch the same movie on an airline entertainment system. It also has a slightly longer battery life. Beyond that, AirFly Pro can connect your iPhone to a car stereo’s AUX port to play music off your iPhone. Read my review for more details.",
