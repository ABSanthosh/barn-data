  "text": "If you‚Äôre a regular Apple user, you likely didn‚Äôt bother spending over an hour of your day to watching the WWDC 2025 keynote, where Apple announced the naming convention change for system software moving to year designations, along with the introductions of the new Liquid Glass interface, iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, and visionOS 26. While you can watch the full WWDC 2025 keynote video below, if you‚Äôd rather not take an hour and a half to do that, there are several shorter videos that overview what was announced, along with a introduction to the shiny new Liquid Glass appearance that graces all future Apple operating systems. Plus, for those wondering what happened with last years promised Siri improvements, two bonus video‚Äôs with Apple executives and press outlets, including the Wall Street Journal, discuss the delays with the related Apple Intelligence features. What‚Äôs Coming Video (WWDC 2025 Short Overview) If you want a short overview of what was announced at WWDC 2025, this two minute video detailing what‚Äôs coming from Apple is quick and digestible. Apple describes the video on YouTube as ‚ÄúWoah. Here‚Äôs your guide to some of the big announcements from this year‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference.‚Äù Liquid Glass Interface Introduction Video Apple introduced the new Liquid Glass interface and design language at WWDC 2025, and since almost no casual person wants to watch the full keynote video, Apple was thoughtful and made a short nearly 5 minute video overviewing the Liquid Glass interface on iOS, MacOS, and iPadOS. Apple‚Äôs description for the video is ‚ÄúMeet our next chapter in software design, built with the sleek and expressive material Liquid Glass. This universal design puts greater focus on your content, creating a more personal experience that brings joy and delight across all our platforms while still feeling instantly familiar.‚Äù Full WWDC 2025 Video If you feel like watching an hour and thirty minutes of WWDC 2025 keynote video, here it is. It starts off with an overproduced sequence showcasing how quirky and fun Apple executives are (they‚Äôre just like you!), and then gets into the introduction of iOS 26, MacOS 26, iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, visionOS 26, new Xcode features, and more. WSJ Interview Where Apple Executives Defend Siri \u0026 Apple Intelligence Delays Another interesting video to watch is an interview between the Wall Street Journal and two Apple executives, where they discuss failing to launch the promised new Siri improvements with Apple Intelligence that was demonstrated at last years WWDC 2024. The inability to deliver on time the promised Apple Intelligence features has resulted in multiple lawsuits against Apple for false advertising amongst other complaints, but Apple claims those features are still coming sometime down the road. WSJ describes the interview as ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs AI rollout has been rocky, from Siri delays to underwhelming Apple Intelligence features. WSJ‚Äôs Joanna Stern sits down with software chief Craig Federighi and marketing head Greg Joswiak at WWDC 2025 in Cupertino to talk about the future of AI at Apple‚Äîand what the heck happened to that smarter Siri.‚Äù WWDC Press Interview with Apple Executives In yet another interview between press and Apple Executives, Tom‚Äôs Guide (who is Tom?) has a 45 minute video where the discussion again covers why Siri isn‚Äôt ready with the promised improvements, AI Vision, iPadOS, and more. Tom‚Äôs Guide describes the video on youTube as: ‚ÄúApple‚Äôs Craig Federighi and Greg ‚ÄúJoz‚Äù Joswiak sit down with Mark from Tom‚Äôs Guide and Lance from ‚Ä™@techradar‚Ä¨ to unpack some of WWDC 2025‚Äôs biggest reveals, and they don‚Äôt hold back. From the truth of the Siri reboot delay to Apple Intelligence‚Äôs bold vision and the surprise of iPadOS stealing the show, this interview covers it all. We ask the tough questions: ü§ñ Why is Siri still not ready? üß† How is Apple Intelligence evolving the iPhone experience? üì± Did Apple just turn the iPad into a Mac (without saying it)? Whether you‚Äôre curious about what it‚Äôll take to get Siri ready, the philosophy driving Apple‚Äôs approach to AI, or the design secrets behind liquid glass ‚Äî this is a conversation you don‚Äôt want to miss.‚Äù ‚Äì Any thoughts on these videos?
