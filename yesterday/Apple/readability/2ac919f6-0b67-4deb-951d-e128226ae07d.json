  "text": "It’s Amazon’s annual Prime Day sale, and if you click through this link, or any of the ones below, you can show your support for Daring Fireball by throwing the referral revenue from any purchases you make my way. You don’t pay a penny more but I get a few percentage points of your purchases. Prime Day discounts are no joke either — we need an outdoor TV for our sun-drenched deck, and I’d been putting off purchasing one out of indecision, but I pulled the trigger and saved $500 with a Prime Day discount last night. (Sometimes my procrastination pays off.) Just about everything Amazon sells from Apple is being offered at significant discounts. Just a handful of popular ones: 11-inch M3 iPad Air for $480 (regularly $600). iPad Mini (A17 Pro) for $380 (regularly $500). AirPods 4 With Active Noise Cancellation for $120 (regularly $180) and the ones without ANC are just $90. (You should definitely get the ones with ANC, though — I never did write a proper review, but I tested a pair with ANC for months and they’re quite amazing given their price and non-sealed ear fit.) 13-inch M4 MacBook Airs starting at just $850 (regularly $1,000) and the sweet configuration with 24 GB RAM and 512 GB storage for $1,250 (regularly $1,400). It seems like you save $150 on any MacBook Amazon sells. Even small items like Apple’s woven USB-C cables and wired EarPods (USB-C or old-school 3.5mm) are a few bucks off. (I keep a pair of the old 3.5mm EarPods in my laptop bag for use with my Playdate, along with Apple’s $9 USB-C headphone jack adapter (one of the few products I saw that’s not discounted for Prime day, but, come on, it’s $9) in case I ever find myself needing wired buds.) It’s called Prime Day for a reason: you need to be a Prime subscriber to get these deals. We’ve been members since forever, and the $140/year fee pays for itself in shipping fees alone. But for some high-priced items like MacBooks and iPads, you can make up the entire annual fee in one purchase today. I don’t post a ton of affiliate links here on DF, but when I do, they sometimes work out to a nice windfall. As the media industry moves more and more toward subscriptions and memberships — and, alas, paywalled content — I’m still freely publishing the entirety of my work other than Dithering. I really do get asked by readers on a regular basis how they can support Daring Fireball directly. I’ll do a new round of t-shirts and maybe some other merch soon. That’s one way. I might someday offer a membership tier with bonus content (again), but that day is not today. But one way you can support DF directly today is by buying anything — anything at all — from Amazon after clicking through any of the above links.",
