  "text": "The microblogging platform Bluesky announced this week an important new feature for its users – Trending Topics. With the update, people can see what everyone is talking about on Bluesky. However, the feature still has a number of limitations. Bluesky now has Trending Topics As announced by Bluesky’s official account on the platform, the Trending Topics feature is now available in the app and website. Just as you might expect, users can see a list of the most discussed topics on Bluesky at the moment. By tapping on a topic, Bluesky shows the top and recent posts about it. At least for now, Bluesky’s Trending Topics are global – which means that they don’t differ by region. In addition, Bluesky says that the feature is in beta and there are a number of details that users should be aware of. For instance, trendings are only available to those using Bluesky in English – although more languages will be supported in the future. Users can opt out of seeing Trending Topics by tapping the “X” button or turning the feature off in the settings. Moreover, you won’t see muted words in Trending Topics. With the update, Bluesky once again goes head-to-head with Threads, which still limits its Trending Topics feature to users in the U.S. and Japan. Bluesky has been growing significantly fast in recent months. The platform gained 10 million users in just a month, now with more than 25 million users according to a website that uses the platform’s API to obtain statistics about it. The rapid growth of Bluesky is also pushing Meta to release new features for Threads more quickly. The competition between Bluesky and Threads has been getting fiercer as more people look for alternatives to X (formerly Twitter). The Bluesky app is available for free on the App Store, and it requires an iPhone running iOS 15.1 or later. Make sure you have the latest version of the app installed so you can access all the new features.
