Image: Apple/Cult of Mac Severance hit the top of the weekly list most-watched streaming series for the fourth time during its season two, according to a company that tracks ratings. The weird workplace drama on Apple TV+ keeps beating series on any streaming service. And the thriller/romance The Gorge is still the among the most popular films on streaming. Severance mysteries keep a grip on audiences Severance drew in huge audiences during its first season, and when season two returned in January, large numbers of fans tuned in. Enough to push the show to the very top of the ratings charts four times since new season started, including last week. Movie and TV search engine Reelgood publishes a weekly ratings list of the 10 most popular series on streaming, and Severance sits at No. 1 for the week of March 6 through March 12. Rival service JustWatch also put the show in the No. 2 slot on its list for top rated series for the week of March 3 to March 9. Ratings charts show Severance is one of the popular streaming series in March 2025.Chart: JustWatch/Reelgood Ratings estimates from companies like JustWatch and Reelgood are necessary because streaming services rarely reveal how many people tune in to their offerings. And Apple itself chimed in recently, crowing that Severance recently passed Ted Lasso as the most popular Apple TV+ show ever. In the hit series, Mark Scout (played by Adam Scott) leads a team of employees who’ve undergone a severance procedure that surgically divides their memories between their work and personal lives. This daring experiment in “work-life balance” is called into question as Scout finds himself at the center of an unraveling mystery that will force him to confront the true nature of his work … and of himself. Episode nine of Severance season two debuted this week, with the finale coming up on Friday. In the mean time, be sure you didn’t miss anything important with Cult of Mac’s recaps of episode one, episode two, episode three, episode four, episode five, episode six, episode seven, episode eight and episode nine. The Gorge action/romance gets high ratings, too Viewers keep being drawn to The Gorge, the romantic action thriller starring Anya Taylor-Joy and Miles Teller. It stayed at the top spot on Reelgood’s rating chart of most popular streaming films for two weeks after the movie debuted on Apple TV+ on February 14, and last week came in at No. 7. The Gorge stayed hot for another week.Chart: Reelgood Its weeks of high ratings shouldn’t surprise anyone who saw the recent announcement that The Gorge ranks as the biggest film premiere in Apple TV+ history. The premise could be the secret of the new film’s success. The Apple TV+ teaser synopsis for the movie says: “Two highly-trained operatives (Miles Teller and Anya Taylor-Joy) are appointed to posts in guard towers on opposite sides of a vast and highly classified gorge, protecting the world from an undisclosed, mysterious evil that lurks within. They bond from a distance while trying to stay vigilant in defending against an unseen enemy. When the cataclysmic threat to humanity is revealed to them, they must work together in a test of both their physical and mental strength to keep the secret in the gorge before it’s too late.” The Cult of Mac review calls it “the perfect date night movie” for its even balance between romance and action. And we complimented the chemistry between the two young stars. The film can be watched now. Watch these and more on Apple TV+ Streaming hits like Severance, The Gorge, plus many others comes with a subscription to Apple TV+. The service is $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial.
