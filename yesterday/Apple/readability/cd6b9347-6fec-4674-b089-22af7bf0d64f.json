The M4 Pro update to the 14-inch MacBook Pro has made it an extremely viable option for anyone who wants to work on the move. It's so attractive that three major online retailers have the same offer. Amazon is offering the upgraded M4 Pro 14-inch MacBook Pro, complete with its 14-core CPU and 20-core GPU, 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display, 24GB of unified memory and 1TB of storage at $2,099. That's $300 or 13% off the list price of $2,399. The package also gets you all-day battery life, support for Apple Intelligence features, 1,600 nits of brightness, a 12MP camera, and Thunderbolt 5 connectivity. While you could go with Amazon, there's also the opportunity to pick up the same bundle from B\u0026H Photo, priced the same at $2,099. Lastly, you could elect to buy the 14-inch MacBook Pro in this configuration from Best Buy, again at $2,099. Either way, you are going to end up with a great deal on a portable Mac for on-the-go productivity.",
