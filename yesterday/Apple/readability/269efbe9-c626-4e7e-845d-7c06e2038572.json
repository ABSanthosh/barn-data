Photo: Apple Filming began on the highly anticipated fourth season of Apple TV+’s beloved comedy series Ted Lasso, marking the show’s return after speculation about its future, according to new reports. The production sees Jason Sudeikis reprising his Emmy-winning role as the optimistic American football coach turned soccer manager, alongside several original cast members and exciting new additions. Original stars Juno Temple and Brendan Hunt have finalized deals to return to the series, joining the previously confirmed core group that includes Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein and Jeremy Swift. These six actors reportedly have three-year contracts, suggesting Sudeikis has mapped out an ambitious new multi-season storyline for the show’s next chapter, as Deadline reported. New faces join the Richmond family Apple CEO Tim Cook posted on X.com Monday to say production on season 4 had begun. His photo shows, from left, Jeremy Swift, Hannah Waddingham, Juno Temple and Jason Sudeikis on set in Kansas City, Missouri.

The recasting addresses the character’s evolution, as Henry is now portrayed as a 12-year-old skilled soccer player, requiring genuine athletic ability from the actor. Additional series regulars joining the cast include Tanya Reynolds from Sex Education, Jude Mack, Faye Marsay, Rex Hayes, Aisling Sharkey and Abbie Hern. Many of these new actors are expected to portray players on AFC Richmond’s women’s soccer team, which forms the central focus of the upcoming season. A fresh challenge for Ted According to the official synopsis, season four presents Ted with his most significant challenge yet: coaching a second division women’s football team. The storyline promises to explore themes of taking risks and embracing new opportunities as both Ted and his team venture into uncharted territory. Production began in Kansas City, Sudeikis’ hometown, before moving to London for additional filming. This approach ties directly to season three’s conclusion, which saw Ted returning to Kansas to be closer to his son. Behind the scenes developments Comedy veteran Jack Burditt joins as executive producer under his Apple TV+ overall deal, while the core creative team remains largely intact. Temple’s return required careful scheduling coordination with her starring role in another Apple TV+ series, The Husbands, while Hunt continued his dual role as both actor and executive producer throughout the development process. The original three seasons of Ted Lasso achieved remarkable success for Apple TV+, earning critical acclaim, multiple Emmy Awards including back-to-back Outstanding Comedy Series wins, and becoming a cultural phenomenon that helped establish Apple’s streaming service as a major player in original content. Apple officially confirms renewal as Sudeikis returns for Ted Lasso season 4 (March 14, 2025) The coach himself signed on to return, but what will be the focus? Recent rumors say it will be on AFC Richmond’s women’s squad.Photo: Apple TV+ In a move that will delight fans worldwide, Apple TV+ officially ordered a fourth season of its Emmy-winning soccer-comedy sensation Ted Lasso, according to a new report Friday. The announcement comes after more than a year of speculation following the third season’s conclusion in May 2023. It appears to hinge on a pivotal confirmation: Jason Sudeikis returns for Ted Lasso season 4. He signed on to reprise his role as the beloved, optimistic, heavily mustachioed and highly unlikely Premier League soccer coach. “Ted Lasso has been nothing short of a juggernaut, inspiring a passionate fanbase all over the world, and delivering endless joy and laughter, all while spreading kindness, compassion and unwavering belief,” said Matt Cherniss, head of programming for Apple TV+. “Everyone at Apple is thrilled to be continuing our collaboration with Jason and the brilliant creative minds behind this show.” So Coach Lasso himself — Sudheikis — has signed on the return to the pitch after much speculation. Rumors even said season 4 production might be scheduled, with cast members merely hoping Sudheikis would come back. While full casting details remain under wraps, sources indicate Warner Bros. Television already secured options for key cast members including Hannah Waddingham (Rebecca Welton), Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent) and Jeremy Swift (Leslie Higgins), The Hollywood Reporter noted. Additionally, Juno Temple is reportedly in negotiations to return as Keeley Jones. And co-creator Brendan Hunt nears finalizing his deal to continue as Coach Beard. The Reporter added the show’s creative team remains intact but will expand. Veteran producer Jack Burditt (Nobody Wants This, 30 Rock) joins as an executive producer under a new overall deal with Apple TV+. And Sudeikis himself teased the upcoming season’s theme. He suggested AFC Richmond’s characters will “LEAP BEFORE THEY LOOK, discovering that wherever they land, it’s exactly where they’re meant to be.” This hints at a shift from the third season’s conclusion. It saw Ted returning to the United States to be closer to his son and ex-wife. A return worth waiting for Finally found the dang password to this thing. Sorry y’all. What’d I miss? — Ted Lasso (@TedLasso) March 14, 2025 The renewal comes as welcome news for the Apple TV+ platform. Ted Lasso finished 2023 as the number one original streaming series in the United States according to Nielsen ratings. The show has been credited with significantly boosting Apple’s streaming service profile since its debut. It was the most-watched Apple TV+ show ever, until Severance recently overtook it. “If ever there was a show the world needed more of right now, it would be Ted Lasso,” remarked Channing Dungey, chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. TV and WBD U.S. Networks. That echoed fans’ sentiments embracing the show’s unique blend of humor, heart and humanity. The original creative team remains, with Sudeikis, Bill Lawrence, Joe Kelly and Brendan Hunt continuing as executive producers alongside new addition Burditt. The writing team includes Jane Becker, Jamie Lee, Bill Wrubel, Brett Goldstein and Leanne Bowen, with Sara Walker and Phoebe Walsh serving as writers and producers. Storylines remain to be seen Season 3 left many character arcs in transitional states. Ted headed back to America. Other Richmond team members embarked on new chapters in their lives. How the fourth season will reunite these characters remains to be seen. But Sudeikis’s hint about “leaping before looking” suggests fans can expect the unexpected when AFC Richmond returns to the pitch. For Apple TV+ subscribers who have made Ted Lasso the platform’s crown jewel, this announcement represents not just the continuation of a favorite show. It’s the extension of what has become a cultural touchstone known for its optimism, emotional depth and celebration of kindness in the face of adversity. Apple hasn’t commented yet on production details and release timeline for the new season. Ted Lasso season 4 shift: After a delay to mid-2025, AFC Richmond will build its women’s squad (February 6, 2025) Juno Temple, left, and Hannah Waddingham could be back in season 4, which will apparently shift the focus to the AFC Richmond women’s squad.Photo: Apple TV+  Beloved Apple TV+ soccer comedy Ted Lasso begins pre-production on a long-hoped-for fourth season in January in London, according to a Thursday report. This follows recent news about the studio picking up cast members’ options, the first concrete clue that Ted Lasso season four might actually happen. Apple TV+ ended the hit show after three seasons. But if Ted Lasso season four production starts as expected, it’s time to believe again! Fans eager to know more about the Ted Lasso platform and its future can check out Apple’s confirmation of season 4. So we know beloved hit Apple TV+ comedy series Ted Lasso will return for a fourth season. Though sources now say its production start will hit a delay of a few months. But perhaps more interesting than that: When it comes together, it will center on the formation of the AFC Richmond women’s soccer team. That departure from the show’s previous focus on the men’s squad is a major Ted Lasso season 4 shift. Rumors have noted Coach Lasso himself (Jason Sudeikis) may be less involved this season, if at all. Maybe that’s reflected in the plot pivot. The fictional Premier League team AFC Richmond tapped a low-level American college football coach to manage the club — a ludicrously unrealistic premise, yet a charming and funny show — but for the new women’s squad he’ll merely consult, perhaps, and maybe only by SMS. Production on Ted Lasso season 4, originally slated to begin in January 2025, has been pushed back to May or June 2025, according to Sigmund Judge, host of the “Magic Rays of Light” podcast. The delay suggests that fans might have to wait until late 2025 or potentially 2026 for the season premiere. The London-based filming schedule remains unchanged. That should maintain the show’s fairly authentic British football atmosphere (as far as I know, as a Yank — but a Yank who somehow manages to appreciate both Ted Lasso and actual Premier League football). The shift to focusing on a women’s team isn’t entirely unexpected. It was subtly teased in the final moments of the show’s third season, which concluded in 2022. This new direction, following lots of hand-wringing and rumors over time about a possible new season despite the original three-season plan, could offer fresh storytelling opportunities while building on the established AFC Richmond universe. Focus on women’s team seems savvy EXCLUSIVE: London filming for #TedLasso S4 is now set to begin in May/June with focus shifting at AFC Richmond to the formation of its women’s team. — Sigmund Judge (@sigjudge) February 5, 2025 The development of a women’s team storyline represents a strategic evolution for the series, which has already garnered significant success for Apple TV+. The show has consistently been one of the streaming service’s most popular offerings. Even Apple CEO Tim Cook himself expressed interest in its continuation beyond the original run. While specific plot details remain under wraps, this new direction suggests that Apple TV+ is committed to expanding the Ted Lasso universe while potentially introducing new characters and dynamics to the beloved series. The focus on women’s football could also reflect the growing global interest in and support for the women’s game, which includes a perennially powerful U.S. Women’s National Team. Ongoing contract negotiations Behind the scenes, Warner Bros. has already begun securing talent for the upcoming season. Key cast members Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein, and Jeremy Swift have reportedly had their options picked up. However, uncertainty remains regarding Jason Sudeikis’s involvement, as the actor has previously expressed satisfaction with the original series’ conclusion and hasn’t shown interest in reprising his role, though cameo appearances haven’t been ruled out. The production’s legitimacy gained credibility in October 2024 when “Season 4” appeared in the Film \u0026 Television Industry Alliance’s production database. Further confirmation came in January 2025 through Nick Mohammad, a cast member known for his previous “accidental” revelations about the show. Ted Lasso season 4 reportedly starts production in January 2025 (October 18, 2024) Fans of Coach Lasso (played by Jason Sudeikis) and his (fictional) Premier League football club AFC Richmond have new reason to rejoice, per a new post on Mastodon from MacStories’ podcast Magic Rays of Light. It doesn’t offer a ton to go on besides the text below and a photo of the Greyhound coaching staff watching the players huddled together, reaching up to touch the locker room’s famous “Believe” sign. Here’s what the post said: Exclusive: #TedLasso S4 is set to begin pre-production in January. According to our sources, the football drama is now confirmed to return next year with a fourth instalment, with London shoots beginning in early 2025! Follows another big clue This apparent confirmation that the show will go on follows another concrete set of clues. In late August, The Hollywood Reporter said Warner Bros. Television, which produces the show for Apple TV+, picked up options for three cast members to reprise their roles: Hannah Waddingham (Rebecca Walton), Brett Goldstein (Roy Kent) and Jeremy Swift (Leslie Higgins). The possibility of a fourth season has been a topic of speculation since the show’s third season finale in 2023, meant as the conclusive ending. However, the cast previously expressed interest in continuing their characters’ stories in some capacity. Meanwhile, the show won much critical acclaim, awards and nominations, and, inevitably, a few haters, too. Some of the shows characters ended up digitized and put in Electronic Arts’ FIFA 23 game, believe it or not. Then three characters became Barbie dolls. And of course the coach’s famous shortbread cookies became a real product. Surely Sudeikis is on board Bill Lawrence, co-creator of the series, recently commented on the potential for a fourth season, emphasizing that the decision ultimately rests with Jason Sudeikis. “Even without talking to each other, and every actor, actress, writer, producer on that show — and [we didn’t get] together and decide this was the message — we all loved the experience,” he noted. “As fans, we’d all kill if it was going again, but everybody would say the same thing, which is: Whatever Jason feels like doing, and whatever his decision is, we’re all down with it.” When the cast members’ options were picked up, speculation suggested the studio wouldn’t do that unless the show’s co-creator and star, Sudeikis, supported the move, even if his role is limited in the fourth season. That seems true of this new development, too. Ted Lasso season 4 is coming. Believe it. We originally published this post on October 3, 2024, and republished it with confirmation on October 18, 2024. Warner Bros. approaches 3 cast members, a sign Ted Lasso season 4 may actually happen (August 25, 2024) “Ted Lasso” made plenty of money, too, but when it first ended, it left a revenue gap shows like “Severance” help to fill.Photo: Apple TV+ In a surprising turn of events, fans of a certain beloved Apple TV+ soccer comedy may have reason to “Believe” that Ted Lasso season 4 may actually happen. On the show, a handwritten sign in the fictional Premiere League soccer team’s locker room urges players to believe they can win. Now actual proof of a probable fourth season comes to light. Fans will do doubt want to believe this is a done deal, but so far it’s just a hopeful sign. Created by Jason Sudeikis and Bill Lawrence, from the start Ted Lasso carried a three-season story arc. So after its conclusion in May 2023, any thinking it would return was of the strictly wishful variety. Until now, that is, according to a report in The Hollywood Reporter. AFC Richmond may once more take the pitch. Warner Bros. Television took a significant step by picking up options on three key cast members from the original run. Hannah Waddingham, Brett Goldstein and Jeremy Swift have been approached to reprise their roles as Rebecca Walton, Roy Kent and Leslie Higgins, respectively. This development sets the stage for a potential continuation of the heartwarming series. Just a hopeful sign, not a done deal While this news is encouraging, it’s important to note that additional negotiations must take place to secure the return of other main actors, including co-creators and stars Jason Sudeikis and Brendan Hunt, as well as Juno Temple. Represented by SAG-AFTRA, they would require new deals to be put in place. The possibility of a fourth season has been a topic of speculation since the show’s third season finale, which many viewed as a conclusive ending to the series. However, the cast has previously expressed interest in continuing their characters’ stories in some capacity. The show has won critical acclaim, awards and nominations, and, inevitably, a few haters, too. But some of the shows characters were digitized and put in Electronic Arts’ FIFA 23 game, believe it or not. And three characters became Barbie dolls. It’s all up to Sukeikis Bill Lawrence, co-creator of the series, recently commented on the potential for a fourth season, emphasizing that the decision ultimately rests with Jason Sudeikis. Lawrence said. “Even without talking to each other, and every actor, actress, writer, producer on that show — and [we didn’t get] together and decide this was the message — we all loved the experience,” he noted. “As fans, we’d all kill if it was going again, but everybody would say the same thing, which is: Whatever Jason feels like doing, and whatever his decision is, we’re all down with it.” No comment from the suits on Ted Lasso season 4 Lawrence added, “Not only is he the star, he’s the head writer, and he’s also the dude whose life just has to be completely overhauled and moved to a foreign country with young children. It’s a big deal. So, as a fan, if someone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s gonna happen again,’ I’ll go nuts. As a partner, I’m down for whatever he wants to do.” So it’s worth noting Sudeikis is, most likely, already onboard with season 4. As The Hollywood Reporter notes, the studio would not proceed with steps in a greenlighting process, like securing cast members’ contract options, without his consent. As fans eagerly await further news, representatives for Warner Bros. Television have declined to comment, and Apple TV+ has not yet responded to requests for information. The potential return of Ted Lasso for a fourth season remains an exciting prospect for its devoted fanbase. And by the way, another Lawrence comedy, Bad Monkey, airs on Apple TV+ now. Watch Ted Lasso on Apple TV+ While waiting for the fourth season, you can stream the first three seasons of Ted Lasso now.

So after \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/reviews/ted-lasso-finale-recap-apple-tv-so-long-farewell\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598872\"\u003eits conclusion\u003c/a\u003e in May 2023, any thinking it would return was of the strictly wishful variety. \u003ca href=\"https://deadline.com/2024/08/ted-lasso-season-4-deal-near-brett-goldstein-hannah-waddingham-1236049653/\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598873\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eUntil now\u003c/a\u003e, that is, according to a report in \u003cem\u003eThe Hollywood Reporter\u003c/em\u003e. AFC Richmond may once more take the pitch.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWarner Bros. Television took a significant step by picking up options on three key cast members from the original run. \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/ted-lasso-star-belts-out-classics-in-home-for-christmas-trailer\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598874\"\u003eHannah Waddingham\u003c/a\u003e, Brett Goldstein and Jeremy Swift have been approached to reprise their roles as Rebecca Walton, Roy Kent and Leslie Higgins, respectively. This development sets the stage for a potential continuation of the heartwarming series.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eJust a hopeful sign, not a done deal\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this news is encouraging, it’s important to note that additional negotiations must take place to secure the return of other main actors, including co-creators and stars Jason Sudeikis and Brendan Hunt, as well as Juno Temple. Represented by SAG-AFTRA, they would require new deals to be put in place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe possibility of a fourth season has been a \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/will-there-be-ted-lasso-season-4\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598875\"\u003etopic of speculation\u003c/a\u003e since the show’s third season finale, which many viewed as a conclusive ending to the series. However, the cast has previously expressed interest in continuing their characters’ stories in some capacity. The show has won critical acclaim, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/apple-tv-emmy-nominations-2023\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598876\"\u003eawards and nominations\u003c/a\u003e, and, inevitably, a few haters, too. But some of the shows characters were digitized and put in \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/believe-it-or-not-ted-lasso-and-afc-richmond-are-coming-to-fifa-23\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598877\"\u003eElectronic Arts’ \u003cem\u003eFIFA 23\u003c/em\u003e game\u003c/a\u003e, believe it or not. And three characters \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/3-ted-lasso-cast-members-become-barbie-dolls\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598878\"\u003ebecame Barbie dolls\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIt’s all up to Sukeikis\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBill Lawrence, co-creator of the series, recently commented on the potential for a fourth season, emphasizing that the decision ultimately rests with Jason Sudeikis. Lawrence said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Even without talking to each other, and every actor, actress, writer, producer on that show — and [we didn’t get] together and decide this was the message — we all loved the experience,” he noted. “As fans, we’d all kill if it was going again, but everybody would say the same thing, which is: Whatever Jason feels like doing, and whatever his decision is, we’re all down with it.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eNo comment from the suits on \u003cem\u003eTed Lasso\u003c/em\u003e season 4\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLawrence added, “Not only is he the star, he’s the head writer, and he’s also the dude whose life just has to be completely overhauled and moved to a foreign country with young children. It’s a big deal. So, as a fan, if someone’s like, ‘Oh, it’s gonna happen again,’ I’ll go nuts. As a partner, I’m down for whatever he wants to do.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo it’s worth noting Sudeikis is, most likely, already onboard with season 4. As \u003cem\u003eThe Hollywood Reporter\u003c/em\u003e notes, the studio would not proceed with steps in a greenlighting process, like securing cast members’ contract options, without his consent.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs fans eagerly await further news, representatives for Warner Bros. Television have declined to comment, and Apple TV+ has not yet responded to requests for information. The potential return of \u003cem\u003eTed Lasso\u003c/em\u003e for a fourth season remains an exciting prospect for its devoted fanbase.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd by the way, another Lawrence comedy, \u003cem\u003eBad Monkey\u003c/em\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.cultofmac.com/news/bad-monkey-trailer\" data-lasso-id=\"1641598880\"\u003eairs on Apple TV+ now\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWatch \u003cem\u003eTed Lasso\u003c/em\u003e on Apple TV+\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile waiting for the fourth season, you can \u003ca href=\"https://www.googleadservices.com/pagead/aclk?sa=L\u0026amp;ai=DChcSEwiy6czFvq-LAxV3W0cBHeqJCBcYABABGgJxdQ\u0026amp;ae=2\u0026amp;aspm=1\u0026amp;co=1\u0026amp;ase=5\u0026amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA2JG9BhAuEiwAH_zf3s1kQ3OV8cVmCK3m_oA6J_WaABlIIM4UagyJIzk8VHfG3UVPd4u0IBoCT-4QAvD_BwE\u0026amp;ohost=www.google.com\u0026amp;cid=CAESV-D2V3lAZ1FPOCJh-F5G2Y0sMgOoVRrP2-x79fK0falzXol9-BodKNvWSJEtxbFIvFEqQLPGCXvASyR3cG2HadAf-eZF1a9F3DCGVa0jkV77ONdIrSLcHQ\u0026amp;sig=AOD64_0qv0o27wVDOBvKYzydiQkkmKGmdQ\u0026amp;q\u0026amp;adurl\u0026amp;ved=2ahUKEwi__sXFvq-LAxW-F1kFHQ5BA2UQ0Qx6BAgLEAE\" data-lasso-id=\"1641824135\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estream the first three seasons of \u003cem\u003eTed Lasso\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e now.
