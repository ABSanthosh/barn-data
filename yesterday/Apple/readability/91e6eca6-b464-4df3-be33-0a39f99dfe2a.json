  "text": "iPhone and iPad users are already very familiar with something called “proximity pairing.” First introduced with iOS 11, this feature lets users transfer backup and other data from one device to a new one just by placing them close together. Now it seems that Apple is finally working on adding proximity pairing setup to the Mac. Proximity pairing setup coming to the Mac Evidence seen by 9to5Mac in the iOS 18.4 code suggests that the Mac will soon gain proximity pairing, just like the iPhone and iPad. The system will guide users to scan a pairing code on the Mac screen using an iOS device. As a result, the Mac will import some of the settings (such as the Apple Account login) from the iPhone or iPad. Technically, macOS already supports proximity pairing – but it’s exclusive to Macs enrolled with MDM solutions like Apple School Manager, Apple Business Manager, or Apple Business Essentials. Currently, regular users setting up a new Mac either need to enter their Apple Account data manually or restore the settings from another Mac connected via Thunderbolt. The new code added to iOS 18.4 suggests that the solution will be available to everyone with a future software update, possibly macOS 15.4. Both iOS 18.4 and macOS 15.4 are major updates, as they expand Apple Intelligence support to more languages for the first time. Apple’s AI features now work in French, German, Italian, Portuguese (Brazil), Spanish, Japanese, Korean, and Chinese (simplified), as well as localized English for Singapore and India. On the Mac, the update adds the new Mail app that first arrived on the iPhone with iOS 18.2. According to Apple, these software updates will be released to the public in April.
