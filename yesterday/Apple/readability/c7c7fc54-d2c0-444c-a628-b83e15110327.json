  "text": "OpenAI has been announcing a lot of new features and enhancements for ChatGPT in recent days, and the company still has a few more cards up its sleeve. Now OpenAI is introducing an intriguing feature: the ability to call ChatGPT using your phone line without the need for cellular data. ChatGPT now has its own phone number The announcement was made by OpenAI via a live stream on YouTube and shows the technology in action. Essentially, anyone in the US can now call 1-800-CHATGPT (1-800-242-8478) to talk to ChatGPT and get access to the same advanced answers you can get from the chatbot on the web. ChatGPT via telephone uses Advanced Voice Mode technology to provide a natural conversation with the user. The main idea of offering access to ChatGPT via a regular phone line is to let people talk to the chatbot when they are in an area without an internet connection. In the demo, OpenAI gave the example of people on a road trip who want to know more about something they’ve seen without having to upload a photo or video. For users in the rest of the world, OpenAI also announced that ChatGPT is now available on WhatsApp, so that users can chat with the chatbot by text directly from Meta’s messaging platform. To do this, simply start a chat with the same phone number mentioned above (1-800-242-8478). OpenAI says it’s working on letting users log into their ChatGPT accounts with the WhatsApp bot. Earlier this week, OpenAI also made ChatGPT Search available to everyone for free. With ChatGPT Search, users can ask questions and get answers with data collected from the web in real time. OpenAI has also added video support to ChatGPT’s Advanced Voice Mode, so that users can have a natural conversation with the chatbot via video chat. In addition, with the release of iOS 18.2 last week, iPhone and iPad users can now talk to ChatGPT right from Siri. The ChatGPT app is available for free on the App Store. It requires an iPhone running iOS 16.4 or later.
