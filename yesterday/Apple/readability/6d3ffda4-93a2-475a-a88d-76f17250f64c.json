  "text": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently shared a video in which he announced a series of changes coming to the company’s platform policies such as Instagram and Threads. Among them, the executive revealed that it will switch from fact-checking to a Community Notes model – and it seems that this is already being implemented in the Threads app. As noted by developer and researcher Alessandro Paluzzi, the Community Note feature is already hidden in the Threads app for iPhone. With this option, users can write a note about any post on Threads. The interface reinforces that the “note is anonymous” and redirects users to a support article on Instagram with more details about the feature. “If you see a post that might be inaccurate or confusing, you can write a note with background info, a tip or an insight people might find useful. Your note may get published on the post if it’s rated helpful,” says the article. In this article, users will also find a button to join the Community Notes program waitlist. Meta argues that the change will allow “people across a diverse range of perspectives to decide when posts are potentially misleading and need more context.” Last week, Zuckerberg admitted that he had been inspired by X (formerly Twitter) to introduce Community Notes on Facebook, Instagram, and Threads, as the Elon Musk-owned platform already has a similar feature. The feature will first be rolled out to users in the US “over the next couple of months” and should be expanded to more countries next year. In addition to eliminating fact-checking controls on Meta’s social networks, Zuckerberg also announced that the company will lift restrictions on some topics such as politics and human rights. Meta also killed its diversity, equality, and inclusion program. The move has been heavily criticized by a number of users. There are no details on when exactly Meta will begin showing Community Notes on Threads and other platforms.
