  "text": "Apple has given the iPad Air lineup a spec-bump update to include M3 chips, but otherwise the new iPad Air remains pretty much the same as the previous M2 model. The updated iPad Air with M3 chip features the same 12 megapixel front and rear camera with Center Stage on the front camera, Touch ID on the power button, a USB-C port for charging and data transfer, and an easy-on-the-eyes LCD retina display. The M3 chip supports Apple Intelligence, just like the M2 chip before it. Even the stock iPad Air wallpaper remains the same as the prior version. The M3 iPad Air continues to start with 128GB storage and is available in 11″ for $599 and 13″ for $799, and is available in the same four muted color options; blue, purple, starlight, and space gray. Apple also introduced an updated Magic Keyboard for the M3 iPad Air that is available only in white color, and removes keyboard backlighting. Prices on the new Magic Keyboard are $269 for the 11″ model and $319 for the 13″ model. Separately, Apple has spec-bumped the entry level iPad model as well. The iPad 11th gen now features an A16 chip, which oddly enough does not support Apple Intelligence, and now starts with 128 GB storage in the base model. iPad 11 is available in blue, pink, yellow, and silver, and starts at $349. You can pre-order any of the new iPad models today, and they will be widely available on March 12. If you’re interested in learning more about these updated iPad models, you can check out the hyperbolic marketing press release from apple.com While that’s it for the product announcements today, it is rumored that Apple will release updated MacBook Air models with the M4 chip this week as well.",
