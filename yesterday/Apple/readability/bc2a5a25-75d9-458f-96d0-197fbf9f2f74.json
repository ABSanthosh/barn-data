  "text": "All iPhone 17 Pro rumors have pointed to one thing: a redesigned horizontal camera bar. While many people have called this ugly, it does have a hidden perk for users who’d like to customize their phones. Shared by leaker Majin Bu on X, some iPhone accessory manufacturers are creating camera covers with unique designs, to cover up the iPhone 17 Pro’s long horizontal camera bar. Manufacturers of accessories have started producing original camera covers to fit the wider camera tray of the new iPhone 17 Pro, as seen in the designs shown in the photo, which feature four variants with camera holes arranged in different configurations. pic.twitter.com/W3pQwuqjWM— Majin Bu (@MajinBuOfficial) April 20, 2025 Many people have been using “camera lens protectors” for the longest time, but this takes it up a notch. It’ll provide coverage for those who think they need it, while also offering a unique touch of customization. I’m honestly really curious to see what sorts of designs people end up coming up with. Either way, this seems like a wonderful way to take advantage of the large camera bar that’ll soon exist on everyones iPhone 17 Pro. Most iPhone 17 Pro cases actually leave a full cutout for the camera bar, so this would fit in quite well. What do you think of these camera bar backplates? Are you interested? What would you want on the back of your phone. Let us know in the comments.
