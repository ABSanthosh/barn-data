Annual shareholder meetings are held to vote on matters presented by shareholders and how future goals are being met. During such meetings, the company's performance during the previous year is also discussed. As part of Apple's meeting on February 25, participants will vote on the re-election of the Board of Directors, approval of executive compensation, and will ratify Ernst \u0026 Young — Apple's accounting firm. The 2025 shareholder meeting was announced by Apple in an SEC filing on January 10. In the filing, Apple CEO Tim Cook shared a letter to shareholders, highlighting the iPhone maker's accomplishments and overall success in 2024, such as the launch of Apple Intelligence and the Hearing Health features for AirPods Pro 2. \"Last year, we launched a new era with our first products built from the ground up for Apple Intelligence — which brings together personal context with powerful generative models to deliver intelligence that's relevant and useful to you,\" said Cook. \"As always, I am especially proud of how teams at Apple bring together groundbreaking innovations with the values that guide our work.\" The SEC filing is simply a proxy statement emphasizing Apple's achievements and various accomplishments throughout 2024. As a result, the information is hardly surprising for those who pay attention to the company's financial sector. The shareholder meetings themselves are rarely of interest to the general public, either. According to Apple's SEC filing, the company has an all-time revenue record in its Services sector, which is up 13% year-over-year. The company has also experienced significant success in many emerging markets, including South Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Apple's annual shareholder meeting will be held on February 25, 2025, at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
