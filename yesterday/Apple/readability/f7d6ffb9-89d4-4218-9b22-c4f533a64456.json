  "text": "CarPlay users often request web browsers and video apps for use while parked, but Apple limits CarPlay apps to a handful of categories. Adapters that run Android apps and display CarPlay exist as a workaround. However, there’s now an app on the App Store that includes a browser feature for playing video. The CarPlay app loads URLs from the web to play video while parked. Sidecar is a utility app with CarPlay support that has existed for a while. Apple hasn’t changed its tune on web browsers and video players for CarPlay, though. Instead, an update to Sidecar has made it through app review without being flagged. The app requires users to provide a URL to the app on the iPhone, then navigate to the web feature in the CarPlay app to load the website. It has plenty of room for improvement as a web browser and video player, but customers should be aware that the feature could be removed in a future update. Sidecar is a free download with a $9.99 in-app purchase to unlock the web browser/video playing feature. This is probably a buy-it-while-supplies-last situation with no guarantee that future versions will pass app review.
