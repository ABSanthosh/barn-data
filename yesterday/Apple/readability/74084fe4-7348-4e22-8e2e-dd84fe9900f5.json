  "text": "OpenAI, the company behind the popular ChatGPT artificial intelligence tool, has introduced a new phone-based ChatGPT client experience. By calling 1-800-ChatGPT (1-800-242-8478), you are able to have a phone conversation with ChatGPT to get AI answers by phone. Essentially the phone line for ChatGPT means that you can access and use ChatGPT entirely by voice, and without data or an internet connection. All you need is a phone line, whether that’s a land line, or a cell phone. When you call 1-800-ChatGPT, you will be able to talk for 15 minutes for free (this is a monthly limit, but if you download the ChatGPT app and create a ChatGPT account you will have additional call time). The conversation and answers will be entirely by voice, and as usual, ChatGPT is quite impressive. You can also text the same number via WhatsApp to have text-based conversations, but at that point you should probably just download the app and use it directly, since you also have powerful voice chat capabilities in the app and which does not have the same limit on messages or voice conversations. The quirky video below from OpenAI demonstrates the 1-800-ChatGPT feature in action: OpenAI considers this an experimental way to interact with ChatGPT, and so its features and availability may change in the future. But for the time being, check it out, it’s pretty cool. If you’re interested in ChatGPT and AI, don’t miss our articles on the topic.",
