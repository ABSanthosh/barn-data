  "text": "News An upcoming Apple Studio Display version could offer a better type of screen. Photo: Apple Apple plans to make the 27-inch Studio Display look even more beautiful, according to a reliable source. It’ll supposedly accomplish this by replacing the standard backlights with mini-LEDs. The change will likely increase its appeal to prosumers looking for an Apple-quality external display for their Mac or iPad. Apple Studio Display might go mini-LED The Apple Studio Display launched in 2022 with a 27-inch 5K LCD that features TrueTone and P3 wide color gamut. In addition, the peripheral includes a wide-angle webcam with Center Stage support, studio-quality microphones and a six-speaker sound system. Despite all the extra features, it still depends on a traditional LCD. Still, Apple is reportedly about to upgrade the display to a new type. It’ll follow the MacBook Pro line by getting a mini-LED screen, according to a (paywalled) prediction made Thursday by Ross Young, CEO of Display Supply Chain Consultants.  This type uses thousands of tiny LEDs to provide backlighting for the LCD and illuminate very specific areas. The result is higher contrast, blacker blacks, improved brightness and better power efficiency. The analyst says the Apple Studio Display upgrade will take place “later this year or early next year.” Whether the change will affect the price is unknown. The display has a list price of $1,599, though it can be found on sale at $1,299.99. Young’s sources in the display industry allow him to make predictions about Apple products that have often proved accurate in the past. And a 27-inch iMac?! An apparent afterthought by Young brings hope to those asking for an iMac with a display larger than the current 24-inch one. “Possible that they could also use the new display in a 27″ iMac or they could refresh both the Studio Display and the iMac,” he also said in a second (paywalled) social media post. The last 27-inch iMac launched in 2017. There’s been no new version of the all-in-one desktop in that size since then, and Apple says it’s not planning to make one.",
