Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$39.95 Best Prices Today: powerstation mini 5K Gold Limited Edition Retailer Price Mophie $40 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The small Powerstation Mini 5K Gold Limited Edition immediately catches the eye with its golden color. The housing is made of aluminium and has a bead-blasted finish. This gives it a high-quality look. With its compact dimensions of 7.6 by 4 by 2.5 centimeters, the Powerstation Mini 5K fits into any small bag. The capacity is 5,000 mAh and a four-stage LED display shows the charging status and remaining battery life. The USB-C port is capable of Power Delivery with a maximum output power of 20 watts. The output of 20 watts is sufficient for a charging capacity of 51 percentage points for the iPhone 15 and 24 percentage points for the 11-inch iPad Pro, both after 30 minutes. The output power of 20 watts is ideal for the iPhone, but can also power a camera or an iPad if required. The only thing missing is a protective bag to protect the stylish powerbank from scratches in your handbag. Should you buy the Powerstation Mini 5K Gold Limited Edition? The Powerstation Mini 5K scores points in several respects: the elegant housing is a real eye-catcher and the power bank is barely bigger than a lipstick. With 5,000 mAh, it offers enough capacity to recharge an iPhone after a long day. We have more power banks in our roundup of the best MagSafe and magnetic power banks for iPhone.",
