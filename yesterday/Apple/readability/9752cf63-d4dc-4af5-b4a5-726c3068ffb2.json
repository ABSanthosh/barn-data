  "text": "As we reported in August, a change coming to the App Store in the European Union would force developers to provide a public address and phone number that would become visible to customers in the region. As of today, the change has come into effect and developers are required to provide this data to Apple. New requirements for developers distributing apps on the EU App Store The requirement is part of a series of new rules for online platforms established by the EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA). One of them requires Apple and other companies to verify and display contact information for any “traders” distributing digital apps. And of course, this affects the App Store. Apple says that a developer is considered a trader under EU terms when they make any revenue as a result of an app. This includes not only direct revenue from App Store sales, but also in-app purchases or advertisements. In other words, only those distributing free apps with no ads won’t have to provide such information. As of today, developers are required to provide their public trader data in order to submit new apps or updates to the App Store. Otherwise, they won’t be able to do so. Apple says that developers who don’t submit their public address and phone number by February 17, 2025 will have their apps removed from the App Store in the EU. Many developers are unhappy about as they don’t have a specific phone number or address for their work and will have to provide their personal data. Unfortunately, there’s not much Apple can do about it as it’s only complying with the EU. For individual developers, the DSA requires EU App Store to show their address or P.O. Box, phone number, and email address. For organizations, only the phone number and email address are required. Users will find this information right below the description of each app in the App Store. More details can be found on the Apple Developer website.
