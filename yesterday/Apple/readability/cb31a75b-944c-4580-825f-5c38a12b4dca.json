  "description": "Macworld If you have an iPad already or are thinking of picking up an older one, maybe a refurbished model, you’ll need to know how long it will still be able to use the newest version of iPadOS. Apple is usually excellent in this area, often keeping older generations of its products on the latest versions of the operating system or at least blessed with security updates to keep them safe. But there comes a time when the software on an iPad can no longer be updated to a secure version of iPadOS, and when that happens you may find that apps and services will no longer work and your data could be at risk. Here’s a quick guide to how long you should expect an iPad to remain usable.  Which versions of iPadOS does Apple support? While the latest version of iPadOS is the one with all the latest features, and the one that Apple will update with new features through the year, the company provides security updates for older versions of iPadOS in order to ensure the safety of users of older iPads, but how long can you expect to get these updates for? The crucial thing is whether Apple will update the operating system software that runs on your iPad if it discovers a security flaw. You could be at risk if you use an iPad that doesn’t have adequate security measures in place. This means that the real defining element of how long an iPad can last is security updates. Once those stop, it’s not advisable to continue using the device, as it could be vulnerable. Generally, Apple issues security updates for two generations after ending support for the latest version. For example, when iPadOS 17 arrived in 2023, Apple still issued updates for iPadOS 16 and 15 throughout the year. But with iPadOS 18, Apple stopped issuing regular security updates for iPadOS 15 and iPadOS 16. (The last update to iPadOS 16 was in August 2024). Security updates are released relatively frequently and simply update the code in the system to close any potential areas where hackers or malware could gain access. These appear on your device as “point” releases, such as iPadOS 18.1, 18.1.1, 18.2, etc., and they make small adjustments to iPadOS and fix any security flaws that could put your data at risk. To find out if you have installed the most recent version of iPadOS go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update and check. iPadOS 18 runs on iPads introduced since 2019.Apple Which version of iPadOS can I run? The key is to know which version of iPadOS your iPad can run, that way you can identify whether Apple is still committed to updating it with security-related fixes. Apple tends to continue security support for the two or three most recent versions of iPadOS (Apple tend not to support a third version if the same iPad models are covered by the newer version). iPadOS 18 iPadOS 18 arrived on September 16, 2024. It runs on the following models: iPad Pro 11-inch \u0026 13-inch (M4) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later) iPad Air (M3, M2, 3rd gen and later) iPad (7th gen and later) iPad mini (5th gen and later) With this iteration of iPadOS Apple dropped support for the 2nd-gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, and the 6th-gen iPad. iPadOS 17 iPadOS 17 arrived in 2023 and was last updated in August 2024. It runs on the following models, and Apple is issuing software updates for it (the most recent was iPadOS 17.7.5 on February 10, 2025). iPad Pro 12.9 (2nd gen and later) iPad Pro 11 iPad Pro 10.5 iPad Air (3rd gen and later) iPad (6th gen and later) iPad mini (5th gen and later) iPadOS 17 dropped support for 2016 iPad Pro 9.7-inch (A9X chip), 2015 iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st gen) (A9X chip) and 2017 iPad (5th gen) which runs on an even slower A9 processor. Apple Which iPads are not supported with any updates? With the arrival of iPadOS 18, Apple dropped support for iPadOS 15 and iPadOS 16, which means that iPad Air 2nd gen and iPad mini 4, have been dropped from the list of supported iPads. Because Apple no longer supports them with security updates, you should avoid any iPads that can’t run iPadOS 16. That includes these models: iPad Air (2nd gen and earlier) iPad (4th gen and earlier) iPad mini (4th gen and earlier) Keep in mind that in late 2025 iPadOS 17 support might end, at which point the following iPads will no longer be supported: 2016 iPad Pro 9.7-inch (A9X) 2015 iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st gen) (A9X) 2017 iPad (5th gen) (A9) Which iPads are supported with full updates? These are the iPads that get the latest version of the iPadOS – iPadOS 18. Not every iPad below gets all the features, many miss out on the Apple Intelligent features that require an M1, M2, M3 or M4 chips found in the iPad Air or iPad Pro, or the A17 Pro chip used in the 2024 iPad mini. iPad Pro (M3, M4) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd gen and later) iPad Pro 11-inch (all) iPad Air (M2, M3, 3rd gen and later) iPad (7th, 8th, 9th, 10th gen and A17 Pro) iPad Mini (5th, 6th gen and A16) How long does Apple support iPads with security updates? Apple currently supports security updates for iPadOS 18 and 17. The oldest iPad able to run iPadOS 18 is from 2018 and the oldest iPad able to run iPadOS 17 is the decade-old 1st gen 12.9-inch iPad Pro from 2015, the 2016 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the 2017 iPad (5th gen). Apple may stop security updates for iPadOS 17 in late 2025 or 2026, at which point it will end support for those models. Note that the first 12.9-inch iPad Pro is already considered obsolete by Apple (as you will see in the section below!) That is still seven to ten years of security support. When buying an iPad, you can assume between eight and 10 years of security updates. If it’s the full version of iPadOS you are after, you can expect about six years of support–the 3rd-gen iPad Pro 12.9-inch being the oldest iPad that can run iPadOS 18, and they were introduced in 2018. Every iOS and iPadOS version and the iPads supported by it.Foundry How long does Apple support iPads for repair? Generally, Apple moves devices onto the Vintage list between five and seven years after it stops selling them. Around seven years after Apple stops selling a product it is moved into the Obsolete list, though some countries have different rules. Once considered Vintage by Apple, your chance of being able to get replacement parts is difficult, but when a product is Obsolete you will not be able to get replacement parts. Therefore if it has been five years since Apple stopped selling an iPad you are unlikely to be able to get replacement parts if something goes wrong. The products considered vintage and obsolete are listed below. Vintage iPads iPad Air 2 iPad mini 2, iPad mini 4 iPad Pro 10.5-inch iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st gen, 2nd gen) iPad (5th gen, 6th gen) Obsolete iPads iPad Air (1st gen) iPad mini (3rd gen and earlier) iPad (4th gen and earlier) iPad Pro 12.9-inch (1st gen) iPad Pro 9.7-inch (1st gen) How long should an iPad last? On the software side of things, it seems from the current examples laid out above that you can expect software security support up to nine years from when an iPad went on sale, however, we wouldn’t count on that. Because Apple doesn’t consider a product vintage until five years after it stopped selling it, you can expect at least six years of support (assuming the product was sold for a year, though Apple often sells products for much longer than that). Of course, hardware is the other side of the equation and that can be more random as parts deteriorate or fail. Say your battery life falls off a cliff, you’ll need to still be within your one-year warranty period to have it repaired for free. Apple does have a battery replacement service though, usually costing $99/£99 for a replacement and fitting, so this could prolong the hardware side of things for a good while (essentially up until it was moved to the vintage list five years after Apple stopped selling it). Apple offers hardware servicing and parts for a range of older iPads, all at a cost of course. On its site, the company states, “Owners of iPhone, iPad, iPod, Mac or Apple TV products may obtain service and parts from Apple service providers, including Apple Store locations and Independent Repair Providers, for a minimum of 5 years from when Apple last distributed the product for sale”. This is clarified later in the text, saying that you can get iPads repaired up to seven years after they were last on sale from Apple. So, if you want to know if your iPad qualifies, simply Google when it was discontinued by Apple.  Naturally, a 10-year-old iPad is an impressive feat of durability, but it won’t be as fun or powerful as a new one. So, take a look at our iPad buying guide to see what’s currently on offer. After all, you could be using it for a very long time. Want to know how long Apple supports iPhones and how long Apple supports Macs, we have that covered too.",
