  "text": "Apple on Friday confirmed that it will release its Q1 2025 earnings report on January 30, 2025. The report will cover iPhone 16 and Apple Watch Series 10 sales more extensively, as well as giving us a hint about sales performance during the holiday season. Apple to report Q1 2025 earnings later this month In Q4 2024, which covered the months of July to September, Apple reported $94.93 billion in revenue, up 6% year-on-year. The company recorded growth in most of its categories, except for Wearables, Home, and Accessories – which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, and HomePod. Since new products such as the iPhone 16 and Apple Watch Series 10 were launched in mid-September, the Q4 2024 report only includes data on the first two weeks of sales for these products. With the Q1 2025 report, which covers sales from October to December, we’ll have a clearer picture of how the new devices have been performing so far. Here’s what Apple reported for Q1 last year: iPhone revenue: $69.70B Services revenue: $23.12B Mac revenue: $7.78B iPad revenue: $7.02B Wearables, Home \u0026 Accessories revenue: $11.95B On a related note, Apple today made official that Luca Maestri has stepped down as the company’s CFO, and will now lead the Corporate Services teams. Apple’s new CFO is Kevin Parekh, who has worked at the company for 11 years and previously led Financial Planning and Analysis, G\u0026A and Benefits Finance, Investor Relations, and Market Research. As always, Apple will live stream the investor call on its website to discuss the results. The call will be held at 2PM PT/5PM ET with Apple releasing its full earnings report 30 minutes before that. This will be Kevin Parekh’s first call as CFO.
