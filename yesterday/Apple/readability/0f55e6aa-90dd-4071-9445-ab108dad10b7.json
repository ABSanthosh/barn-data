  "text": "After the EU forced Apple to implement major changes to how iOS and the App Store work for European users, other countries have also conducted their own antitrust investigations against the company. Now the Brazilian court has ruled that Apple has 90 days to allow sideloading on iOS for iPhone users in Brazil. Apple may have to enable sideloading for iOS users in Brazil As reported by Brazilian newspaper Valor Econômico (via O Globo), a federal judge in Brazil ruled on Wednesday that Apple will have to open up the iOS ecosystem to third-party apps in Brazil just like the company did in the EU. The judge considers that the “limitations” imposed by the company on developers could jeopardize the entry of new competitors in the segment. In November 2024, the Brazilian antitrust regulator “Cade” ruled that Apple can no longer prevent developers from selling content and distributing apps outside the App Store in Brazil. The company would have 20 days to comply with Brazil’s antitrust legislation, otherwise it would be fined more than $40,000 a day. Unsurprinsigly, Apple appealed the decision and a judge ruled that the injunction was unnecessary, giving the company more time to discuss the case. At the time, Apple said that the request to implement changes to the App Store wasn’t urgent and that it would also affect the company’s business. Last month, Apple had to face a public hearing in Brazil concerning the case. But now Judge Pablo Zuniga has ordered that Apple will have to implement the required changes in Brazil within the next three months. The judge states that, despite Apple’s claims, the company “has already complied with similar obligations in other countries, without demonstrating a significant impact or irreparable damage to its business model.” The antitrust investigation against Apple began after Latin American e-commerce giant Mercado Libre accused Apple of forcing developers offering digital goods or services in their apps to use Apple’s own payment system. Other companies such as Match, which owns Tinder, and Epic Games have also filed complaints against Apple with the Brazilian regulator. An Apple spokesperson told Valor Econômico that the company “believes in vibrant and competitive markets” and that it “faces competition in all segments and jurisdictions” where the company operates, reinforcing its commitment to its users. Apple believes the changes will “harm the privacy and security” of iOS users and says it will appeal the decision.
