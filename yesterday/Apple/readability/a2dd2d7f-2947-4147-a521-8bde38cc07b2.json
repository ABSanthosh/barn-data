  "text": "The recently rebranded Max has launched an official, approved alternative to password-sharing. You can now add an “Extra Member” to your Max account, but it will cost an extra $7.99/month. Here are the details. The days of widespread password sharing for streaming services are quickly ending. Various streamers have debuted up-charges for sharing your account with someone not in your household. And starting today, Max has followed suit. Max users who want to share their account with a friend or family member can do so with a new “Extra Member” add-on. It costs $7.99 extra per month. And that’s true whether you have an ad-supported or ad-free Max plan. Here are the restrictions, per Max: The Extra Member Add-On is available to Max subscribers billed through WarnerMedia that are not part of the Disney+, Hulu, Max Bundle. The add-on is not available to subscribers billed through third-party providers, e.g. app stores and internet, mobile, and TV providers. Account owners invite an extra member to share their subscription plan with them. Extra members have their own account, password, and profile. Extra members need to be 18 years or older and be in the same country where the subscription owner signed up for Max. $7.99/month is a tough sell for users of the ad-supported plan, since it only runs $9.99/month anyways. Users of the premium, ad-free plan have more to gain. 9to5Mac’s Take Max seems to regularly have special $2.99/month offers available. As a result, I’m not sure how appealing this new option will be for viewers. Again, unless you strongly prefer ad-free viewing. In my experience though, ads on Max are way less intrusive than with other streamers. At least for HBO shows, I often get a few very brief pre-roll ads and zero that actually interrupt my show. Do you plan to utilize Max’s new Extra Member add-on? Let us know in the comments.
