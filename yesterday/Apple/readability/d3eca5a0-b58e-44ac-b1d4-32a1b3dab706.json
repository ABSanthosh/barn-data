The Basic tier, which currently retails for $19.99/£19.99 a year (then $24.99/£24.99 a year) requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, offers support for one device, access to additional tools, and easy uninstallation if desired.

First, and as helpful as it may be, the free version of Cleaner One Pro feels like a living ad for the subscription-based tiers, the interface being slathered in advertising encouraging you to unlock the full feature set. This advertising, of course, disappears once you sign up for the service, but the “More Tools” module leads to a screen offering access to Trend Micro’s antivirus, VPN, decompression, and ad blocking utilities. Yes, this can be argued from both sides and a company has every right to advertise its full set of wares, but this still seems excessive once you click into the “More Tools” window. You can’t navigate through module windows using the page up and page down keys, and are instead limited to the mouse, which seems like an odd feature to leave out. This and the fact that once an activation key has been purchased, it can’t be copied and pasted from the Trend Micro website or your email, and has to be entered in by hand, shows security overlapping ease of use, even if it is for a one-time thing like entering the activation code you just paid for. Finally, a lack of communication from Trend Micro itself for product and technical questions raised my eyebrows a bit, and I’m curious as to whether others have experienced this, or have had quick, speedy communication with the company. Should you buy Cleaner One Pro for Mac? What’s present with Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and an elegant user interface makes it easy to navigate the program, customize settings, quickly view extraneous apps, files, and login items, and prune your Mac down more effectively. It’s also to Cleaner One Pro’s credit that the application doesn’t try to make itself a mega-suite and do everything under the sun, including antiviral scanning and protection or act as a VPN, although Trend Micro readily advertises those products for sale. A free trial for Cleaner One Pro would not go amiss, and if Trend Micro could find a way to keep its customers informed of its offerings while easing up a bit on its in-app advertising, the experience would be that much better. Still, Cleaner One Pro offers a useful set of Mac cleaning tools for a good price, and if you’re looking for something reliable in this field, it’s worth your consideration.",

Other nice touches included easy access to technical support to quickly file a ticket, report a bug, or suggest a new feature, and the Smart Scan feature helpfully points out whether or not a macOS update is available for download and installation, which is a helpful add-on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CleanerOnePro3-Customizing-the-Smart-Scan-module-and-choosing-which-tests-to-perform.jpeg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all\" alt=\"CleanerOnePro3 Customizing the Smart Scan module and choosing which tests to perform\" srcset=\"https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CleanerOnePro3-Customizing-the-Smart-Scan-module-and-choosing-which-tests-to-perform.jpeg?quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 1157w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CleanerOnePro3-Customizing-the-Smart-Scan-module-and-choosing-which-tests-to-perform.jpeg?resize=300%2C176\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 300w, https://b2c-contenthub.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CleanerOnePro3-Customizing-the-Smart-Scan-module-and-choosing-which-tests-to-perform.jpeg?resize=768%2C450\u0026amp;quality=50\u0026amp;strip=all 768w\" width=\"1024\" height=\"600\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" loading=\"lazy\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cp\u003eCustomizing the Smart Scan module and choosing which tests to perform.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr/\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eFoundry\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eStill, there are some elements that could require some attention. First, and as helpful as it may be, the free version of Cleaner One Pro feels like a living ad for the subscription-based tiers, the interface being slathered in advertising encouraging you to unlock the full feature set. This advertising, of course, disappears once you sign up for the service, but the “More Tools” module leads to a screen offering access to Trend Micro’s antivirus, VPN, decompression, and ad blocking utilities. Yes, this can be argued from both sides and a company has every right to advertise its full set of wares, but this still seems excessive once you click into the “More Tools” window. You can’t navigate through module windows using the page up and page down keys, and are instead limited to the mouse, which seems like an odd feature to leave out. This and the fact that once an activation key has been purchased, it can’t be copied and pasted from the Trend Micro website or your email, and has to be entered in by hand, shows security overlapping ease of use, even if it is for a one-time thing like entering the activation code you just paid for.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, a lack of communication from Trend Micro itself for product and technical questions raised my eyebrows a bit, and I’m curious as to whether others have experienced this, or have had quick, speedy communication with the company.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch2 id=\"should-you-buy-cleaner-one-pro-for-mac\"\u003eShould you buy Cleaner One Pro for Mac?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat’s present with Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and an elegant user interface makes it easy to navigate the program, customize settings, quickly view extraneous apps, files, and login items, and prune your Mac down more effectively. It’s also to Cleaner One Pro’s credit that the application doesn’t try to make itself a mega-suite and do everything under the sun, including antiviral scanning and protection or act as a VPN, although Trend Micro readily advertises those products for sale. A free trial for Cleaner One Pro would not go amiss, and if Trend Micro could find a way to keep its customers informed of its offerings while easing up a bit on its in-app advertising, the experience would be that much better. Still, Cleaner One Pro offers a useful set of Mac cleaning tools for a good price, and if you’re looking for something reliable in this field, it’s worth your consideration.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"link_wrapped_content\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003ch3\u003e\n\t\t\tBest Prices Today: Cleaner One Pro for Mac\t\t\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003cdiv data-ga=\"article-footer-author\"\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003eChris Barylick is a D.C.-based technology journalist, loves writing about emerging technologies, video games, DIY projects, hardware, utilities, politics, and upgrades, and has written for Macworld since 2007.
