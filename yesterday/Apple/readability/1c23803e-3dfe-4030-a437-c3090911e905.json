  "description": "Macworld Sure, the Apple Watch Series 10 is great, but it’s not all that different than the Series 9. And today it’s cheaper than ever: Usually available for $499, you can get the 41mm Apple Watch Series 9 with cellular in silver or pink for just $300. That’s cheaper than a Wi-Fi Series 10 and the best price we’ve ever seen. With a gorgeous Retina display, the Apple Watch Series 9 comes with a ton of sensors to track your fitness journey, your sleep patterns, run ECGs, and so on. Since it’s not the basic GPS version, you won’t even need to have your iPhone with you when going for a run, for instance, and you can make calls, send messages, and stream music right from your wrist, wherever you are. The main difference between it and the Series 10 is a slightly smaller size and thicker body, and the ability to measure water depth and temperature when diving. Otherwise, the two watches are very similar. So snag your very own Apple Watch Series 9 with GPS and Cellular for $300 at Woot. You should hurry up and take advantage of this deal because Woot deals come with a short lifespan (this one expires in 4 days) or vanish completely when sold out, whichever comes first.
