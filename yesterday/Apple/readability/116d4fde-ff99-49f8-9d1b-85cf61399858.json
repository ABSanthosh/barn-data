  "text": "Liking the look of the new Sky Blue M4 MacBook Air, but don’t want to splurge on a new purchase? You can enjoy the new wallpaper without coughing up any dough, just download the full resolution version below. The MacBook Air series was recently spec-bumped with a powerful M4 processor, and along with the new processor came a new color option; Sky Blue. Sky Blue is subtle and can look a lot like silver in some lighting conditions, and quite blue in others, but for some people it’s exactly what they want, and it makes for a nice wallpaper color too. This isn’t a completely new or redesigned wallpaper, in fact the M4 MacBook Air Sky Blue wallpaper is basically just a different color variation of the same other MacBook Air wallpapers introduced a few years ago, but that doesn’t mean it’s not nice to look at. Click the image below to launch a full sized version into a new window: The wallpaper is high resolution so you can crop it or size it to other devices if you’d like. For example I think the corner section is kind of nice looking and doesn’t say “AIR” so it was better suited for my MacBook Pro. If this wallpaper doesn’t do it for you, perhaps another one will. Have fun and customize your Mac! Thanks to 9to5mac for digging up the Sky Blue variation of this default wallpaper.",
