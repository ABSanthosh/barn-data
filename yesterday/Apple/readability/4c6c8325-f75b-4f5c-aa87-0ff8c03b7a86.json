  "text": "Apple has officially announced its first fiscal quarter 2025 earnings call will be held on January 30 at 5:00 p.m. ET. The biggest quarter of the year for Apple has historically been the holiday one as it combines the gift-giving season with the first full quarter of new iPhone sales. The results for the first fiscal quarter of 2025 will provide an idea of how the iPhone 16 and Apple Watch Series 10 have sold since their September launch. Apple shared that the earnings call will occur on January 30, at 5 p.m. Eastern via its Investor Relations portal. As always, the earnings call will discuss information from the earnings report, forward-looking statements, and include a short question-and-answer segment with analysts. In addition to the new iPhone and Apple Watch releases, Apple's latest Mac lineup with M4 processors will have an impact. The new iMac, MacBook Pro, and Mac mini should contribute to better-than-average Mac sales figures. Services has been a reliable source of growth for many quarters, but it could slow down soon. The free Apple TV+ weekend that started on January 3 shows that Apple is trying to increase interest in its services despite the continued success by the numbers. There is also the chance that Apple could prepare investors for trouble with Services in 2025. The United States Department of Justice is interested in breaking up Google and stopping exclusive rights payments to companies like Apple. Such a move could lose Apple as much as $20 billion a year to services. AppleInsider will provide the usual analysis of Apple's earnings report and the following call on January 30. It is likely to be another record-breaking quarter for the nearly $4 trillion company.",
