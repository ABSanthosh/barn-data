  "text": "Welcome to Indie App Spotlight. This is a weekly 9to5Mac series where we showcase the latest apps in the indie app world. If you’re a developer and would like your app featured, get in contact. Currency is a completely free currency conversion app for iPhone and Mac, with no ads, a clean design, and offline functionality. It has support for over 160 currencies, making it an easy to use tool for any international travel. Top features With Currency, you can convert between dozens of currencies, all at a quick glance. With its easy to understand interface, you can simply add your desired currencies to a list, type in your desired amount with your default currency, and it’ll automatically convert to all of the listed currencies at the latest market rate. Currency has support for over 160 currencies, and sources from 15 different exchange rate providers, keeping the data as accurate as possible. It also fetches rates every hour, allowing the app to work accurately, even while offline. The app also supports iCloud Sync, allowing you to keep your currency list consistent between your iPhone and your Mac. More about Currency As mentioned earlier, Currency is completely free. There’s no ads, no subscriptions, or no in app purchases. What you see is what you get, and everything is available as soon as you download it. The developer also put a lot of thought into the design, making it feel as native as possible. Smaller details like the country flags listed next to the currency icons have also been redrawn to fit into a squircle shape, similar to an app icon on your home screen. It also has a really nice feeling (and fast) Mac app. Download Currency Currency is available completely for free on the App Store for iPhones and Macs running iOS 17 / macOS Sonoma and later. Unfortunately, there’s no native iPad or Apple Vision apps quite yet, but hopefully the developer will get around to it.
