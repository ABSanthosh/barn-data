  "text": "Scroll-to-Top is a super useful gesture that has been around on the iPhone for a long time, basically rather than swiping to get back to the top of a long screen of text, email, webpage, or whatever, you just tap the top of the screen and it immediately scrolls to the top. This is a great feature, but it’s a little different with iPhone models that have Dynamic Island. The Dynamic Island is the little oblong cutout at the top of newer model iPhone screens, and while it holds the camera and microphone, it also updates depending on whatever apps are running. For example, if you have a music app open it’ll be in the Dynamic Island, or if you have a Timer running it will display there, or directions will, and so on. One issue with Dynamic Island is that it’s much harder to use the ‘scroll to top’ gesture, because if you try and tap on the top of the screen like users are accustomed to pre-Dynamic Island, then they usually end up accidentally tapping on the Dynamic Island itself, so rather than scrolling to the top of the current app window, it will switch to whatever app is updating the Dynamic Island itself. How do you use Scroll to Top with Dynamic Island on the iPhone 16 series, iPhone 15 series, or iPhone 14 Pro line, and not accidentally switch to an app instead? That’s what this article is here to help you with. Using Scroll-to-Top with Dynamic Island iPhone Models, the Easy Way If you’re tired of accidentally switching to whatever app is using Dynamic Island, and all you want to do is use the Scroll-to-Top gesture on iPhone, here’s a little handy trick: To use scroll-to-top with Dynamic Island, try tapping either the clock or the battery icon instead If you tap either the clock icon in the top left corner, or the battery icon in the top right corner, you will activate the Scroll-to-Top feature, without switching to the app that is using Dynamic Island. This is probably the easiest way to use Scroll-to-Top on any iPhone model with Dynamic Island. Option 2: Dismiss Dynamic Island, Then Tap it to Scroll-to-Top The other option is to dismiss whatever app is running in Dynamic Island by swiping left or right on the Dynamic Island itself, and then you can tap directly onto the Dynamic Island. This works too and is a little more intuitive for those who are accustomed to tapping at the top of the screen, but because you have to swipe left or right on the Dynamic Island before this works, in order to dismiss whatever app is using Dynamic Island, it’s an additional step, and less intuitive. – Do you use Tap-to-Scroll and Scroll-to-Top on the iPhone? What do you think of that feature in general, and how do you feel about its behavior with Dynamic Island? Do you have any other useful tricks with scrolling to the top or tap-to-scroll?
