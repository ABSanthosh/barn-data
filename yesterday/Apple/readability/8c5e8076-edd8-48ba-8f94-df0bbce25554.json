  "description": "Macworld When the M3 MacBook Air came out, we summed it up pretty simply as “simply the best, but better” and we stick by that. While this is Apple’s most affordable laptop line, we still love seeing it on sale. Right now, you can get one for $899 at Amazon, which is $200 under its MSRP and $400 less than it cost just a few months ago. “The MacBook Air gets a nice performance boost, thanks to the M3 chip upgrade. The new dual external display support is a compromise, but it’s a welcome change in production environments,” reads our review. Since our review Apple has boosted the RAM from 8GB to 16GB, which previously carried a $200 upcharge. Along with the superb peformance, this 13.6-inch laptop features a gorgeous Liquid Retina Display that offers sharp images and vibrant colors, no matter how bright the environment you work in. The combination of the M3 chip and 16GB of memory makes this laptop ready for just about any task you want to throw its way, from your everyday workload to light gaming, streaming, and more. This particular configuration features 256GB of storage space, which isn’t a lot. Then again, getting a portable SSD these days is fairly cheap and will save you plenty of money you’d otherwise spend on a storage upgrade from Apple. The 512GB version, for instance, is on sale for $1,099, and you can get a 1TB portable SSD for much cheaper. Either way, the new Apple MacBook Air is a great pick for a laptop, and if you can get it for $200 off, it’s even better. Go ahead and hurry up because we don’t know how long this deal will last.
