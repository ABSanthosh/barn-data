Photo: Apple TV+ If you love a good nature documentary — especially because the photography is so mind-blowing nowadays — you’re in for a treat with The Secret Lives of Animals. Apple TV+ dropped an official trailer for it recently (see below). The 10-part series is now streaming, as of Wednesday, December 18. “Welcome to a world beyond imagination, where fish can fly and lizards walk on water,” the trailer’s voiceover says, as those images appear onscreen. “Animals do the most remarkable things at every stage of their lives.” Update: The Secret Lives of Animals 10-part docuseries started streaming on Apple TV+ Wednesday. The Secret Lives of Animals docuseries debuts on Apple TV+ December 18 Narrated by SAG Award-winning English actor Hugh Bonneville (Paddington, Downton Abbey) and produced by the acclaimed BBC Studios Natural History Unit, The Secret Lives of Animals streams on Apple TV+ December 18. It “highlights 77 unique species in 24 countries over three years, revealing stunning, never-before-seen animal behaviors and highlighting the remarkable intelligence of the natural world,” Apple TV+ said.

That’s sure to include footage you would never see without this type of filmmaking. And some of it has never been seen before, Apple TV+ said. “For the first time, The Secret Lives of Animals captures the sounds and vibrations of a unique jumping spider courtship dance, a killifish in Trinidad breathing through its tail when out of the water, and a wood mouse marking its territory with signposts. Witness a rarely seen relationship between a frog and a tarantula, a land lizard that can breathe underwater and a monkey that uses a bizarre nose-poking ritual as a test of friendship,” the streamer noted. “Each episode focuses on specific behaviors that are pivotal in the life cycles of various animals — from birth and leaving home to raising a family, and from finding food to growing old — highlighting their striking intelligence and adaptability,” it added. Watch the trailer for The Secret Lives of Animals BBC Studios Natural History Unit produces the series for Apple TV+.
