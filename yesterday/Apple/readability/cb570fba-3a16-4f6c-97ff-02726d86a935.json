The process of switching ecosystems from iPhone to Android has been streamlined over the years thanks to work from both Apple and Google. The latest feature may overcome one of the biggest headaches in the process. Code discovered by Android Authority's Mishaal Rahman in the Android 16 QPR1 Beta 1 indicates that the Google SIM Manager app has language around helping users transfer their eSIM from iPhone to Android. Specifically, it mentions a new \"Transfer to Android\" section in the iOS Settings app under General, Transfer or Reset iPhone. Presumably, this feature would be announced as a part of iOS 19 during WWDC, but there's nothing stopping Apple from rolling it out during the summer in a version of iOS 18. It is a relatively minor feature, but useful for those moving between device ecosystems. Moving from iPhone to Android is already straightforward thanks to the existing data transfer systems and tools available from Google and Apple. However, the eSIM isn't moved automatically, which means users have to interact with their eSIM provider in some way to make the transfer happen. The new system would show the user a QR code on the iPhone that would be scanned by the Android phone. The eSIM is then transferred wirelessly, which is how it works for Android to Android transfers today. Users moving between iPhones also have a simple solution to transferring the eSIM that's included in the device upgrade process. This new feature would be the first time cross-platform transfers would be simplified. There is no mention of whether going the other direction, from Android to iPhone, would get a similar feature. At the least, it may appear in a future update as a part of Apple's Move to iOS app on the Google Play Store.",
