    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (today – November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). There is no longer any need to wait, and we’re seeing some fantastic deals! We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Apple Black Friday 2024 deals: The best deals on every Apple product Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B\u0026H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro deals for Black Friday 2024 Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model.

Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that.

Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179.

Peacock has 75% off at $1.99 month for six months. Paramount is offering a couple of months at $2.99. Britbox is pay $8 a month, 50% off the usual price. Sadly Apple isn’t discounting Apple TV, however, as we explain in How to get Apple TV+ for free you can get much more than Apple’s 7-days trial, or its 3-months if you buy an Apple product. There are even some Black Friday deals: Roku is giving three months of Apple TV+ for free to those using Roku devices. (It is also giving away Apple Music). In the U.K. if you shop at Currys, or on Currys.co.uk you can get four months Apple TV+ free this Black Friday. As for Apple’s set top box, there are small savings to be had, but this is a case where it would be better to buy from Apple and get the $25 voucher with it.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
