    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/676493/how-to-delete-system-storage-on-mac.html",
    "description": "Macworld If you are struggling with not enough storage and trying to make more space on your Mac, Apple helpfully outlines ways to save space and shows some mysteriously named elements taking up storage space. In macOS Ventura and later, If you click on the Apple logo \u003e About This Mac \u003e More Info \u003e General \u003e Storage Settings (or in macOS Monterey and older: Apple logo \u003e About This Mac \u003e Storage), you will see lots of information about what is taking up space on your Mac as well as tips to help you manage it. Among some mysteriously named elements taking up storage space you may see the likes of System, System Data, macOS and Other and wonder if you can delete them. We address how to delete Other on a Mac in a separate article. Here we will be addressing System and System Data. Note: Apple has made various changes to the way it displays this information, most recently naming it System Date in macOS Ventura and later. As a result, you will see examples that won’t pertain to your Mac. To find out more, read How Apple has revamped System Preferences in macOS Ventura. PROMOTIONMac Black Friday-ready – CleanMyMac is 30% off now! Get the latest version of CleanMyMac, freshly released in 2024. With just a few clicks,its intelligent Smart Care module initiates a thorough scan of your system, clearingoff the unneeded files from the System Data. Reclaim your disk space withCleanMyMac. Get 30% OFF What is System Data on the Mac? First, we’ll address what’s contained System Data and whether you should delete it from your Mac. System Data is a catch-all title for various elements that are spread across your Mac’s drive. Essentially these are all the same thing: files that don’t fall into the other categories, usually data and files used by macOS, caches, temporary files, downloads, backups, plug-ins, and so on. It’s also the operating system files, which you obviously can’t delete. But there are aspects you can delete including old Time Machine snapshots, iOS backups, cache files, any downloaded disc images for upgrading apps or macOS, and, if you’ve enabled the FileVault encryption feature, files associated with that. We also have an article that explains how to delete cache on a Mac. If your Mac is low on storage it can cause problems. You might see a message that your start-up disk is almost full, for example, and if you ignore that you might find you can’t even start up your Mac. Low storage can also slow your Mac down and cause other issues that stop it from running at its best. You may also find that you can’t install an update to macOS if you don’t have enough free storage. If you aren’t sure how to see how much disk space your Mac has read: How to check how much disk space you have. The question of whether you can reclaim any of the space given over to this class of storage is complicated somewhat by the fact that Apple seems to give it a new name with every version of macOS, as you can see from the images below: macOS Ventura and later: System Data (and macOS) In Ventura, you can see how much space is being taken up by System DataFoundry macOS Monterey: macOS In Monterey what was previously System is labeled as macOS. It’s essentially the same thing. Foundry macOS Big Sur and earlier: System (and Other) Older versions of macOS labeled certain types of storage as System or Other. Regardless of the version of macOS you are running, those graphs indicate how much of your storage is attributed to certain types of files on your Mac. As you can see from the image above, System was using up 19.63GB on our Mac in Big Sur, but the number is a little more concerning in Ventura at almost 47GB. For each user, the System size is different so it’s possible it can be even bigger. Whether it’s referred to as System, System Storage, macOS, or something else, you can reduce the amount of space taken up by this section of storage, but you will need to identify what is being attributed as Storage (or whatever Apple’s named it in your version of macOS). Follow the steps below to find out what’s in System or System data so you can free up some space on your Mac. How to delete System Data on a Mac Apple offers up various ways to delete data from your Mac. How you access them depends on the version of macOS you are using. macOS Ventura and later In macOS Ventura or later, you no longer see these Recommendations in an easy-to-navigate list (it seems that some people may still see these if they haven’t already implemented them). Instead, if you go to Apple logo \u003e About This Mac \u003e More Info \u003e General \u003e Storage you will need to click on the (i) beside the various storage categories. Then you can do things like Empty Trash, erase Documents, and delete Messages attachments, for example. In Ventura, you can work through the various categories to reclaim storageFoundry However, what Apple doesn’t grant you access to is exactly what we are in interested in here: System Data and macOS. Click on System Data in Ventura and you see nothing. Similarly, System and macOS are both grayed out in older versions of macOS. There’s a good reason for this, of course, if you delete things from System, System Data and macOS you are much more likely to damage your Mac. That is why Apple doesn’t make it simple to delete anything from System, System Data or macOS. But you can. There is no Clear System or Delete System button available in macOS, so you’ll have to manage the storage yourself. In the sections below we will explain how to delete each type of System file.  While it’s possible to manually delete the various files included in the System category, we’d recommend that you only do so if you’re confident you know what you’re doing. It’s easy to accidentally delete an important file, only to discover it causes problems later on. If disaster does strike, try some of the tips in how to recover deleted files on Mac. Another option is to use Terminal, but this is one for more advanced users. We explain the process here: How to delete files and folders using Terminal. Before removing anything at all, we’d suggest running a full backup of your Mac’s storage, just so you can return it to the previous state if any problems arise. Read how to backup a Mac and best Mac backup software for more details. Alternatively, the safer option would be to use a system clean-up app like MacPaw’s CleanMyMac X, Software Ambience’s Daisy Disk, or Nektony’s MacCleaner Pro. You can find reviews of those tools, along with several more, in our roundup of the best Mac cleaner software and optimisation utilities. These apps can safely delete the files you don’t need so you don’t have to worry about finding and identifying files that are safe to delete. macOS Monterey and earlier Before Apple launched Ventura you could click on the Apple logo \u003e About This Mac \u003e Storage \u003e Manage and then work through Apple’s Recommendations (which included things like Optimize Storage, empty Trash automatically, Reduce Clutter). You could also peruse the sidebar on the left and click on each category to open a new window with details of what you can delete. Apple offered various Recommendations to help you clear space – but stopped short of granting System accessFoundry How to clear space in System Data on a Mac Follow these steps to delete the various things that make up System storage or System data. Step 1: Remove Time Machine snapshots Foundry One of the main culprits for taking up space in System is the local snapshots Time Machine creates each day. You might think that Time Machine backups are only saved to an external disk, but Apple also creates local snapshots on your startup volume. The company says that these snapshots will only be saved if there is plenty of free space and old snapshots will automatically be deleted when new ones are made. This is great if you accidentally save in correct changes to a document, or delete something you didn’t mean to, but it can take up space on your Mac that you might prefer to have access to. Luckily there is an easy method for removing local snapshots from your storage. You can simply turn off the Time Machine feature itself, which will remove all of the local snapshots stored on your Mac. There is also a slightly more complicated method using Terminal. We explain both in our step-by-step guide for removing these space-stealing artefacts, so read how to delete Time Machine backups on Mac to find the easy way to remove them. Step 2: Remove old iOS backups Foundry Another System space hog are old backups of your iPhone or iPad. These can use unnecessary space on your Mac, so it’s a good idea to clear them out once in a while. Depending on which version of macOS you’re using, here’s how to quickly dispense with them. If you have iPhone back ups on your Mac (and you are running macOS Catalina of later) you will find them in the Finder (older versions of macOS used iTunes). Open the Finder Click on your iPhone in the left-hand menu Select Manage Backups Highlight the ones you no longer need Click Delete Backup then confirm your choice If you don’t see your iPhone here you probably don’t have any back ups on your Mac, probably preferring to back up your iPhone via iCloud instead. If you are using macOS Mojave or earlier then you’ll need to use the now defunct iTunes for this: Open iTunes Select iTunes (in the top left corner) then Preferences Choose the Devices tab from the window that appears Highlight the backups you no longer need Click Delete backup Step 3: Delete data from the System folder Foundry That’s taken care of two of the biggest users of System storage on the Mac, what about everything else? Everything else you might want to delete from System is hidden away in the Library folder(s). Apple likes to keep the Library folders hidden, presumably to prevent users from accidentally moving or deleting essential files. But if you want to access that part of your storage, then it’s possible via a menu option in Finder. What’s important is that you know what you are doing and don’t just delete things willy nilly. There are actually multiple ways to make the hidden Library folder visible, read how to show hidden files on Mac for more details about finding hidden files. To grant yourself temporary access to the Library folder follow these steps: Open a new Finder window Go to your Home folder (press Command + Shift + H) Right click and choose Show View Options from the menu Enable the option to Show Library Folder  Now you have access to the Library folder you’ll able to open the Library folder and look for the files that you suspect are taking up room on your drive. At this stage it is really important to exercise caution and only delete things that you know are superfluous. If you aren’t sure that you should delete something don’t. Our advice is that if you don’t feel comfortable doing this yourself you should use a specialist app to do it for you. Best apps for deleting System files The best option in our opinion really is to use a dedicated optimisation utility, so take a look at our guide to the best Mac cleaner software and optimisation utilities as it provides the easiest method for keeping your Mac in tip-top condition.

    "description": "Macworld NOTE: In macOS Monterey and later, Other storage was renamed System Data. Here’s how to delete System Data on a Mac released in 2021 or later. Storage space on your Mac is precious, especially if you have a 128GB or 256GB SSD. Your Mac can start to slow down and not perform as well when your storage is almost full, at which point you might see a “Your Startup Disk Is Full” warning. So it’s important to know what’s using up the space on your disk and clear out redundant files that build up over time. So, if when investigating what is taking up so much of your valuable storage space you find a mysterious section labeled Other, you are likely to think that sounds like a great way to regain tens of gigabytes of space on your drive. After all, Other is just ‘stuff’ isn’t it? It’s a name that screams “Delete me!” It can’t be anything you actually need… Or can it? PROMOTIONBrand New CleanMyMac | Free up Other storage Get the latest version of CleanMyMac, freshly released in 2024. With just a few clicks, its intelligent Smart Care module initiates a thorough scan of your system, clearing off the unneeded files from the Other storage. Reclaim your disk space with CleanMyMac. Download New Version If you are wondering what is Other in Mac storage and want to know how to delete Other storage you’ve come to the right place. Plus we’ll explain how you can reduce the amount of space Other is taking up on your Mac and what you can delete from Other storage on Mac. We also run through various ways to free up space on your Mac in a separate article. If you aren’t sure how to see how much disk space your Mac has read: How to check how much storage you have on your Mac. Other vs System Data Before we begin, you may not even see Other as a category of storage at all. If you’re running macOS Big Sur or earlier, if you clicked on the Apple logo \u003e About This Mac \u003e Storage you’ll see a bar chart labeled with various categories of data, one of which is Other. in macOS Monterey and later, this Other section is now called System Data. They’re essentially the same thing: Since 2021, the contents of the Other folder have been merged with the System and System Data folders you’ll find on machines with newer operating systems. Apple has also changed Other to System Data on iOS: Here’s how to delete System Data/Other on an iPhone. What is in Other storage on my Mac? When confronted with the need to free up storage on your Mac we’re guessing that your first port of call was About This Mac, where there is a handy tool to help you manage your storage – and it’s here that we’re assuming you saw a gigantic Other category (as we explained above, you will only see Other in older versions of macOS, so if you don’t see Other here, you will be better off reading this article). The About This Mac storage view pre-macOS Monterey gives us some clues as to what isn’t in the Other category as it gives us a basic overview of what’s taking up the space on your Mac including Photos, Apps, Messages, Music, and so on. Here’s how to get to that view: Click on the Apple Logo in the top left. Go to About This Mac. Choose Storage. Wait while it calculates. Eventually, you will see a bar chart showing what types of files are taking up space on your Mac, similar to the image below. In our case, yellow is Photos, red is Apps, light blue is Messages, purple is Music, dark blue for Mail, light blue for iCloud Drive and grey for System. Other is the biggest consumer of storage in our case: 38.55GB. Click Manage and you will see a screen like the one below. Here you can make various tweaks to your system, choosing to store files in iCloud, for example, or reviewing files to reduce clutter. You can also make adjustments in the various sections of storage, including Applications, Documents, iCloud, Mail, Messages, etc just by clicking on them and then deleting data that is presented to you. However, you can’t access Other here at all – notice how it’s greyed out in the left-hand column. With Other such a large consumer of storage you are most likely wondering what exactly Other is. If it isn’t music, documents, videos, photos or apps, what could it be? The label ‘Other’ is applied by the system to files that don’t fit squarely into those types, such as installer packages, cache files, old Time Machine backups, app extensions, temporary files and the like. Most are those that you don’t need anymore, but they’ve got to be stored somewhere, so they get dumped in the Other category. See our article Best Mac Cleaners, where we discuss the top apps that help identify what to delete, such as CleanMyMac X, DaisyDisk, MacCleaner 2 Pro, and more. We’ll also delve into some of these tools below. How to see what’s in Other So now we know what types of files end up in Other, but how can we actually see what’s taking up all the Other space on our Macs?  To see what’s using up all that Other space you’ll need to open the Finder and head to the Library folder, as that’s usually where the majority of Other content is stored. Depending on how your system is set up, you might not be able to see the Library folder in your normal Finder window, so the easiest way to jump directly to it is to follow these steps: Open Finder. Click on the Go option in the menu bar. Select Go to Folder. Then type in ~/library and press enter. You’ll now be presented with a long list of folders, most of which will contain files deemed by macOS to be Other. You’ll see a lot of folders, many of which we would advise you to step away from immediately. However there are a few folders here that you might be able to safely delete some items from, for example, Caches and Application Support. But you need to be very careful as you dig around looking for sub-folders within them that contain data that is safe to remove. (You might also like to read our article that explains How to delete cache on a Mac.) Before you start to delete anything please read on though – because deleting some of these files might affect the way your Mac works! Also, not all the files in Other will be visible. If you want to know how to see hidden files read: How to show hidden files on a Mac. Can I delete files from Other? Yes, but you’ll need to be careful. Some files in Other might affect the way your Mac works. The safest files in the Other category to remote are things like .dmg files left over from installations, old Time Machine backups, and iPhone and iPad backups. We’ll run through this below. But when you start getting into cache files and other more obtuse types you can quickly run into problems. For example, deleting a cache from an old app that you no longer have won’t cause any issues. But should you delete one from an app you do use, then it will immediately forget all of your preferences and other details. Basically, the rule of thumb is if you’re not sure what something is or what it does, leave it alone. Of course, as always, we strongly recommend that you run a complete backup of your system before you start removing anything, just to avoid disaster. Just follow our step-by-step guide on how to backup a Mac and you can begin cleaning up your system knowing that you have a copy to fall back on should anything go awry. How to delete Other files As we said above, you can’t just select Other and delete it thereby reclaiming 30GB of space in one go. However, you can locate and delete some of the file types that Apple classes in the Other category, thereby reclaiming some of that space. You can delete some files that are classed as Other via the Finder. Some of these you can search for by file type, but others are to be found in the Library folder, but you’ll need to know where to look and have an idea of what they are before you trash them.  There are also some file types that are easy to locate and delete safely, so we’ll start by showing you how to tackle them. All these files are deleted the same way as any normal file: locate them in the Finder \u003e right click on the file \u003e choose Move to Trash (or Move to Bin if you are in the U.K.) Note that you’ll need to empty the Trash afterwards or the file will still be on your Mac. To do that right click/control-click on the bin icon and choose Empty Trash. Step 1: Delete DMG files and other space hogs It is quite easy to locate and delete DMG files (program installers) and these are a good place to start because they can take up a surprising amount of space. You can locate and delete them via the Finder. Click on your Desktop (anywhere there isn’t a file or folder) Open the Finder. Click This Mac. In the search box type dmg. When it appears below select Kinds: Disk Image. Press Enter. Now you will see all the dmgs you have on your Mac. You can safely delete these. You may need to enter your password to confirm. Once you have moved these files to the trash/bin you will need to empty it: right click on the trash icon and choose Empty Bin/Empty Trash (depending on your language). To delete them select all by pressing Command + A and then right click/control click on the selected area and choose: Move to Trash. There are other file types that can take a lot of space up on your system that you can also delete this way. Repeat the steps above to delete PDFs, CSV files, and Zip archives. Step 2: Delete Temporary files macOS creates temporary files on your Mac and generally these files are vital to performance, however, they quickly become outdated. Once you are sure your Mac no longer needs them you can safely delete them. Open the Finder. Click on the Go option in the menu bar. Select Go to Folder. Type in ~/library. Press Enter. Locate the Application Support folder. Have a look through these folders, if you find any for apps that you know you don’t use then you can probably safely delete the files associated with them. Step 3: Delete Cache files Caches are another file type that takes up space in Other, and like the temporary files addressed above, you need to be careful because your Mac may need these files to run the way you want it to. We do have a separate article that explains How to delete cache on a Mac which is worth a read because the whole process is quite complex. There’s more than one kind of cache for starters. You can delete system cache by following these steps:  Open the Finder. Click on Go \u003e Go to Folder… Type in Library/Caches/ Click on Go. Now you can open each folder and look for files you think you can safely delete. Just be careful. Deleting application cache is a slightly different process: Open the Finder. Click on Go \u003e Go to Folder… Type in ~/Library/Caches/ (there is a ~ this time, it’s next to the Z). Click on Go. Again you will need to open each folder and make a decision about what to delete. Remember you also need to empty your Trash/Bin after you have deleted these files. Step 4: Delete Time Machine snapshots Time Machine snapshots could also be a space hog on your Mac. You may be aware that Apple’s Time Machine software can back up your Mac to an external drive, but did you know that it also creates local snapshots on your Mac itself? Apple says that it will only store these snapshots if there is enough free space, and it will delete old ones to store new one, so this shouldn’t be a big space hog. But it could allow you to recover enough space to make all the difference. Luckily there is an easy methods for removing local snapshots from your hard drive – just turn off the Time Machine feature. When you do this it should remove these backups from your Mac. The other way to delete these snapshots isn’t so easy: you need to use Terminal. If you want to try it then we explain how here: How to delete Time Machine snapshots on your Mac. You may also like to read how to delete Time Machine backups on Mac to find the easy way to remove them. Another option, if you want to make sure files are well and truly deleted, is to use Terminal, but this is one for the pros. We explain the process here: How to delete files and folders using Terminal. How to delete Other safely If we’ve not made it clear enough above, it is possible to delete a lot of what Apple classes as Other, but you need to be extremely cautious because without some of these files your Mac may not work optimally. Also, you need to be aware that deleting certain files this way can leave some remnants on your Mac, even after you have emptied the Trash. Because of these concerns our preferred method for deleting Other on a Mac, and removing all the space hogs, is to use one of the dedicated Mac cleaning software packages that help you avoid any costly mistakes. Some of our current favourites are CleanMyMac X, MacCleaner 2 Pro, and Daisy Disk, but you’ll find a selection of other excellent options in our roundup of the best Mac cleaner software and optimization tools. These often have system analysing features that can highlight redundant files while holding back on the ones that are still used on a regular basis. Then if you want to remove them it’s just a case of hitting one button rather than trawling through hundreds of sub-folders and hoping you don’t delete anything essential. You’ll need to pay for them, as the trials usually only offer the ability to diagnose problems rather than fix them, but most are well worth the money when you consider the time and frustration that they can save. We used CleanMyMac to delete files when we needed to free up space for macOS Big Sur. There are various options, we’ll run through some of them below:  Smart Scan – this will scan your Mac and eventually let you know what junk you can remove. You can click on Review Details to see what it is suggesting you delete. In our case these are Used Cache Files, Universal Binaries, System Log Files, Language Files, and so on, to the tune of 4.56GB. There’s also the option of removing Mail Attachments and emptying the Trash. Large \u0026 Old Files – this lets you remove files you haven’t opened for a while. This accounted for 5.23GB in our case. You can also use CleanMyMac to uninstall apps. CleanMyMac is £29.95/$29.95 (usually £34.95/$34.95) if you buy the plan for one Mac. There is also a free trial. Download from developer MacPaw here. We also have a round up of the Best Mac Cleaners in which we look at the following alternatives to CleanMyMac: DaisyDisk, MacBooster, Parallels ToolBox, and MacCleaner Pro. Read our review of Parallels Toolbox. Before buying any additional software or delving into the Library folder, take a look at our tips on how to free space on a Mac, as there might be some simple things you can do to claim back that valuable hard disk storage.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
