    "description": "Macworld Here at Macworld we’re extremely fond of Apple’s AirTag, which we consider by far the best Bluetooth tracker for an iPhone or Mac user. However, one complaint raised in our AirTag review was that it doesn’t have an attachment (or keyring) hole, which means you’re forced in most situations to buy an accessory to put it in. Want to attach it to your keys? You need to buy a special key ring. Want to attach it to your luggage? Special luggage label. An ecosystem has quickly sprung up offering straps, loops, pet tags, cases and holders for AirTag owners. But which ones are worth buying? We’ve been testing out all the AirTags accessories we can get our hands on, so we can help you find the best AirTag holder for your needs from key rings, luggage tags, wallets and more. We have also included a growing list of trackers and accessories that might not be AirTags themselves but work seemlessly with Apple’s Find My app and ecosystem Best AirTag Key Rings Apple AirTag FineWoven Key Ring Pros Made by Apple Cons Fabric can scuff Price When Reviewed: $35 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $35 View Deal $35 View Deal $41 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket There are cheaper alternatives, but this is the classic AirTag key ring—replacing the previous Apple Leather Key Ring, now that Apple has gone fully vegan in honor of its legendary co-founder Steve Jobs. It’s light, attractive and reassuringly well-made. It’s easy to put the AirTag inside, but the metal popper won’t let it escape. And we love the large, chunky (but quite flat) ring, although we’d recommend testing it out in a shop if you’re planning on attaching car keys with a small aperture. This reviewer’s Nissan and Skoda keys were both a tight fit. The fabric covering protects the AirTag’s edge from drop damage but leaves most of its chassis, both front and back, open to the elements and liable to scuff a little—a complaint publicly made about Apple’s FineWoven iPhone cases. We think this is worth it for the pleasing look, and scuffing is both inevitable and minor, but if you want total protection you’ll need to look elsewhere. It’s available in five colors: Black, Deep Blue, Blackberry, Dark Green and Chartreuse–David Price Belkin Secure Holder with Wire Cable for AirTag Pros Feels more secure than Apple ring Cons Plastic feel Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $19.95 View Deal $19.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Belkin’s Secure Holder is made of hard plastic, which gives it more of a budget feel, but it’s reassuringly robust, and looks tough with its wire cable that includes a hex key to lock the AirTag in place. As with Apple’s key ring, both faces of the AirTag are left exposed, but the plastic surround sticks out more and thus provides more drop protection. It’s available in white or black.–David Price OtterBox Rugged Case for AirTag Pros Super protective Cons Larger than most Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $10.99 View Deal $19.95 View Deal $19.95 View Deal OtterBox $19.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket OtterBox is a company known for its ultra-protective phone cases, and its Rugged Case for AirTag continues this tradition, as its name suggests. The protective perimeter is increased to allow for larger bumps and mishaps than most AirTag key rings. OtterBox also has a Rugged Passport Series of the Rugged Case that is styled with the coordinates of iconic cities, such as New York, London, Paris and Tokyo, as well as a large range of other AirTag cases and key rings.–Simon Jary Nomad AirTag Keyrings Pros Range of AirTag keychain options Price When Reviewed: From $15 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Nomad $15 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Available in black and white, the Nomad Rugged Keychain is built with a polycarbonate frame and TPU overmold, and ships with two enclosure options: a closed back option and an open speaker option. It is rated IP66 for water and dust resistance. With a Rustic Brown option, the Nomad Leather Keychain carries your AirTag in a good-looking, thermoformed, American Horween Leather holder. Over time, the raw, vegetable-tanned leather will patina to create a unique lived-in look. Adding a third available Natural (tan) color, the Nomad Leather Loop for AirTag is a Horween leather loop that attaches to your AirTag with a powerful 3M adhesive. The AirTag battery, however, remains easily accessible for replacement.–Simon Jary OtterBox Core Series Case for AirTag Pros Sustainable materials Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $10.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The OtterBox Core Series Case is the most sustainable AirTag key ring—made from a FSC-certified recycled and recyclable material. Its speckled looks shows off an authentic recycled appearance.–Simon Jary ElevationLab TagVault: Keychain Pros Waterproof Cons Reduces volume of AirTag sounds Price When Reviewed: $12.95 (single); $39.95 (4 pack) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price ElevationLab $12.95 View Deal $12.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Elevation Lab’s TagVault: Keychain claims that it is fully waterproof. This rugged case has a gasket that prevents water intrusion while passing through ultra-wideband and Bluetooth signals and allowing about two-thirds of the AirTag’s sound volume. It has an integral loop for a keychain ring and comes with a simple but robust one.–Glenn Fleishman Read our full TagVault: Keychain review Caseology Vault Pros Rugged Karabiner attachment Cons Larger than most Price When Reviewed: $14.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $14.69 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket How about a properly rugged key ring accessory for your AirTag? The Caseology Vault is made from military-grade thermoplastic polyurethane, with a nicely grippy sandstone finish that makes it less prone to drops. Like the Olixar Silicone it features a karabiner attachment. This is removable, which makes the Vault a versatile accessory. It’s just as happy tracking rucksacks as keys.–David Price Best AirTag luggage tags and locks Apple AirTag Loop Pros Made by Apple Price When Reviewed: $29 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $16.15 View Deal $29 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Although it now looks to be discontinued you can still find Apple’s fine AirTag Loop on sale. It is made of polyurethane and feels and looks smart, with two of the color options (Electric Orange and Sunflower) particularly bright and cheerful. This will also help you to spot your suitcase on the conveyor belt. The AirTag clips in using a metal clasp that’s easy to use and secure; you then put the strap around your luggage’s handle and loop the head part back through the slit in the tail. It looks slightly delicate at first glance–the strap gets quite thin at a certain point–but proved resistant to moderate tugging and should be fine under non-military usage conditions. Like Apple’s key ring, it protects the edges of the AirTag but not the center of its two faces, so expect some scuffing.–David Price Belkin Secure Holder with Strap for AirTag Pros Robust Price When Reviewed: $12.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $8.48 View Deal $12.95 View Deal $12.95 View Deal $12.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Belkin’s Secure Holder is also available with a robust string for attaching it to the handle of a suitcase or bag. Like the strap-style loops provided by other manufacturers this threads back through itself to easily attach to your luggage. It’s available in white, black, blue, and pink with a matching string. Since the front and back sections, string and key ring are all detachable, you could create a multicolor accessory by mixing and matching more than one holder.–David Price Casetify Customisable AirTag Holder Pros Colorful design options Price When Reviewed: $29 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Casetify $29 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The principal appeal of Casetify’s AirTag holder is the sheer range of designs and colors you can choose from. The ones pictured are, from left, Colorful Floral in Turquoise and Pink (with Peach background); Flowers for you by Matthew Langille (with Licorice); and Egg Tart with Mice (with Avocado). That last one is our favorite, but there are hundreds of options.–David Price OneAdaptr AirLock – Best Find My travel lock Pros Physical padlock Works with Apple Find My Price When Reviewed: $49 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price OneAdaptr $49 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Add extra security to your luggage as well as an Apple-certified location tracker with OneAdaptr’s AirLock. This TSA-approved travel lock It’s not an AirTag accessory as it is its own Bluetooth locator but it works just like one and is fully compatible with Apple’s Find My app and ecosystem. It even uses the same reusable battery as the AirTag. As with an AirTag you can play a sound to easily locate your AirLock, check the most recent location of your luggage and receive notifications if your AirLock is left behind—which might save you a cab ride back from the airport when you realize that you left your suitcase at the hotel. If your lugge gets lost by the airline or other travel operator you can activate Lost Mode in the Apple Find My app, Aside from the locator, the AirLock is an old-school physical zinc alloy padlock with P64 water resistanc, available in either black or silver. Best AirTag wallet and card holders It’s not just keys and luggage that’e easy to lose. Misplacing your wallet or card holder is a common occurance, and as long as you also haven’t lost your iPhone, finding one with an AirTag pocket is an easy solution. Artpaxy Wallet with AirTag Holder Pros Full bifold wallet with AirTag pocket Price When Reviewed: $29.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $29.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket This traditional-looking bifold wallet includes a front-mounted pocket for an Apple AirTag, and then does the usual wallet business with 13 card slots, two cash pockets and two ID windows. It also claims to include Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) blocking to stop device scanning. Bosca Old Leather AirTag Seven Pocket ID Card Case Pros Slim and stylish AirTag wallet ID window Cons High International shipping fees Price When Reviewed: $85 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $85 View Deal Bosca $85 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket This slim, stylish and minimalist hand-stained, vegetable-tanned leather card case comprises of a surprising seven small pockets to store your cards and cash, with a snap-close AirTag pocket on the front so you be able to loate it when it’s left in another jacket or trouser pocket—or left behind on the bar.

These screws are piercing, self-tapping screws with a T10 slot. They’re used to hold a hard plastic anchor to provide further stability when attached to a pet collar that you provide–though the case may be too big for smaller collars. The kit includes a steel Torx T6 L-shaped wrench with screw tips on both ends.–Glenn Fleishman Read our full Elevation Lab TagVault: Pet review Best AirTag wallet holders ElevationLab TagVault: Wallet – card holds AirTag Pros Securely holds AirTag Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price ElevationLab $9.95 View Deal $9.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Designed to hold an AirTag firmly in place in a wallet, it comes in two form factors: standard, 3.25 by 1.5 inches (83 by 38 mm), and compact, 2 by 1.5 inches (51 by 38 mm). Both are 0.05 inches (1.3 mm) thick. The more rectangular style works well in billfold slots; the squarer design in other parts of a wallet. With the AirTag exposed front and back, there’s no additional blocking beyond your wallet to block wireless signals for tracking and Precision Finding.–Glenn Fleishman Read our full TagVault: Wallet review Ugreen Bluetooth Wallet Finder Tracker Tag for Apple Pros Super thin tracker Works with Apple Find My IP68 protection Rechargeable Price When Reviewed: $26.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $26.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Even thinner than a wallet card holder or AirTag-holding wallet is this 1.7mm thin tracker from Ugreen. It works with Apple’s Find My app so is like an AirTag that is completely flat and barely noticeable tucked up alongside the cards in your wallet. It will shriek out at 80dB if you want to find your lost wallet nearby. Best AirTag mounts Olixar AirTags Adhesive Silicone Pocket Pros Stick on your AirTag Price When Reviewed: $11.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Mobile Fun $11.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket If the thing you want to track hasn’t got a handle you can loop the AirTags to, or a pocket you can slip one inside, then the next option is stickiness. These neat silicone pockets (which come in a pack of four) both protect the tracker from external damage, and give it a strong and reliable adhesive surface to cling to a jewel box, schoolbag or games console. Despite the unobtrusive look of the pocket the AirTag is still fairly obvious and easily slipped out, so this solution isn’t ideal for tracking down stolen property (unless there’s a more discreet internal surface you can stick it to). But for locating TV remotes–and for sheer versatility of application–they’re indispensable.–David Price KeyBudz Covert Mount for AirTag Pros Tamperproof lid Extreme environment protection Price When Reviewed: $14.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $14.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The KeyBudz Covert Mount for AirTag is made of rugged fiberglass reinforced copolymer and built to withstand submersion in water and extreme temperatures with IP68 waterproof and dustproof protection.

It’s not discreet, it’s not rugged, and it doesn’t offer additional water protection, but as a mount, it works well. Pelican relies on 3M VHB adhesive for attachment, which creates a near-permanent mount that becomes stronger over time.—Glenn Fleishman Read our full Pelican Protector Sticker Mount Case for AirTag Devices review Other types of AirTag cases and holders ElevationLab TagVault: Bike – AirTag bike tracker Pros Built for bikes Price When Reviewed: $19.95 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Elevation Lab $19.95 View Deal $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket The TagVault: Bike is a lozenged-shaped plastic shell that houses the AirTag AirTag nestles inside its waterproof seal. It attaches to a bike via the bike’s water bottle mount, using longer screws to attach the bottle cage, or shorter screws if you don’t attach the cage. The case is a matte black, rendering it unobtrusive. Screwed in between a cage and the frame, a thief would first have to recognize it and then work hard to remove it quickly.–Glenn Fleishman Read our full Elevation Lab TagVault: Bike review Journey REEVUS – Insulated bottle iPhone stand and tracker Pros Works with Apple Find My Water bottle included Magnetic carry loop works as iPhone stand Price When Reviewed: $89.99 With this multi-purpose Apple Find My friendly gadget you should never lose your bottle again as it includes a rechargeable tracker in its clever lid that means can you can track its live location on your iPhone. You’ll get out-of-range alerts, and can easily locate the bottle when nearby as it has a built-in 100dB speaker. That lid is smarter than just a tracker as the hinged carry loop includes a MagSafe magnet that will hold your iPhone (12 and later) even when the bottle isn’t full—which is great as a secure camera tripod, gimbal or phone stand. It’s one of the best water bottle carry loops we have tested, and all its extra features really are bonuses. The chic soft-touch matte-finish stainless Steel bottle itself holds up to 23.67 fluid ounces (700ml), and will keep your drink cold (24 hours) or hot (12 hours) with its double-walled vacuum insulated interior. The tracker works with Find My on an iPhone but isn’t an AirTag. Its battery should last 120 days before needing a wireless recharge that takes just an hour.

Pitaka PitaTag – Get your lighter back Pros Never lose your lighter Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Pitaka $69.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Lighters are easy to leave behind or lend to someone and forget to ask for it back. One solution is to hide an AirTag inside the lighter so you can track it down and get it back when this happens. This refillable lighter, crafted like the company’s iPhone cases, from military-grade aramid fiber and premium zinc alloy, looks like a card case rather than a cheap off-the-shelf lighter. Pitaka claims that the lighter’s blue pyramid-shaped flame is unaffected by wind, and that it features a built-in gravity lock pin to ensures that it can’t create a flame when upside down. If the Apple AirTag is just not right for you, check out these Bluetooth tracker recommended AirTag alternatives. What you can expect in an AirTag case Because the AirTag comes in a single variety, you don’t need to choose which kind to acquire. Apple sells them singly ($29) and in a four-pack ($99). Engraving is free. An AirTag regularly broadcasts 2.4GHz Bluetooth signals with an encrypted device ID for other Apple devices to pick up and relay along with those devices’ locations. The 2.4GHz band penetrates solid objects well, but case designers need to be mindful of materials that have the potential to block the signal. In our survey of AirTag cases, we didn’t find a case so far that had that design problem. AirTags also use ultrawideband (USB) technology for Precision Finding, exclusive to Apple’s own Find My items. Precision Finding lets an iPhone with UWB identify the direction and distance within inches when it’s within about 15 to 30 feet (4.5 to 9 m). Consider to what use you may put an AirTag to determine the features you want: Purpose: Cases exist in enough variety that you can find one designed as a luggage tag, another as a stylish keyring, and another to resist enormous amounts of damage. Figure out where you want to put the AirTag and match the case to it. Water resistance: Many cases feature some degree of water resistance, some using the IP rating that defines precisely how much. If you’re using an AirTag outside or on a pet’s collar, you may want one with a high degree of resistance. When attaching to a bag or keyring, it may seem less important or not important at all. Ring, clip, loop, or carabiner: Case makers offer many variants on attachments. Some include a simple hole to attach a keychain, while others incorporate a keychain as part of the product and may include a keyring. You can purchase multiple cases built into a carabiner, including one with a three-digit combination lock. You can also get a string or similar loop design, in which the case passes through a loop and pulls tight on a handle without a knot. Removable or adhesive: You might want an AirTag case that’s easy to move about or attach and reattach. Other cases include adhesive for semi-permanent fixed attachment. Hidden for theft recovery: Some cases are designed to hide an AirTag, making its presence less apparent and thus less likely to be discovered if stolen; others are obvious, such as in a keychain or luggage tag. Temper hideability with the knowledge that Apple’s anti-stalking features built into AirTag tech makes them discoverable to criminals with a smartphone.Shows the front: Conversely, some cases show off an AirTag, revealing its front where you might have had added custom engraving from Apple with an emoji or text. You might want to see that engraving to differentiate among AirTags you own. Cost: Cases generally cost from about $20 to $35—around the price of a single AirTag. However, there are outliers below $10 and above $40. It’s all about the function, ruggedness, and complexity of purpose. Some charge extra for style. How we test AirTag case features For each kind of case, we rated them based on specific features around which they were designed. These include: Easy to insert the AirTag for secure retention: Every case has a slightly different approach to getting an AirTag inside. Some cases have an elaborate locking procedure or require removing and restoring four tiny screws to preserve a waterproof seal. Others are simple as sliding the tag into a holding or popping it into a rubber ring. Attaches securely for attachable cases: We tested cases that market themselves as attachable at how well they succeed at that task. Cases may come with or be part of a keyring, carabiner, wrist strip, or pet collar, or may have an adhesive to stick on to objects, like the inside of luggage. Access for battery replacement: Apple expects an AirTag battery to last for about a year in everyday usage, which it defines as one case of Precision Finding and four tones played per day. A case should allow access that isn’t maddening for replacing the battery every several months to a year. Robust against bumps and bangs: Only a few kinds of cases can avoid the wear and tear of bumping against other objects. Most need to be constructed with that in mind. For cases exposed to other surfaces, we look at whether the materials and build quality give confidence in them provide lasting value. Blocks access to remove: A handful of cases provide a security element intended to prevent access to an AirTag without excessive force—the AirTag would have to be destroyed to remove it. We rate these cases on whether they seem able to prevent or deter everything but destruction.

    "description": "Macworld It doesn’t take long for iPhone rumors to circulate. It’s one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what’s coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks. So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here’s everything we know so far, but don’t take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it. Updated April 8: In Mark Gurman’s latest newsletter, he clarifies that the “big” design shakeup is coming in 2027, and the iPhone 17 Pro will look very much like the iPhone 16 Pro, save for the full-width camera bump that matches the color of the rest of the phone. iPhone 17 Release date: When is the next iPhone coming out? Here’s something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September—usually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here’s when the most recent models were released: iPhone 15: September 12, 2023 iPhone 14: Sepember 7, 2022 iPhone 13: Sepember 14, 2021 iPhone 12: October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid) Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than the others due to production issues. iPhone 17: Price We haven’t yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line. Most rumors suggest the “Plus” model will be replaced by the new super-slim “Air” model, which will take over its price in the lineup as well: iPhone 17: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799) iPhone 17 Pro: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099) iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199) iPhone 17 Air: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($899) This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max. Now that Apple has introduced the iPhone 16e there may also be an iPhone 17e joining the line up in September 2025, although we don’t know if it will be updated in September 2025, or if that model won’t arrive until spring 2026. The price is likely to be $599 for the iPhone 17e, unless Apple introduces an iPhone 17e in place of the iPhone 15, with a price of $699, in which case the iPhone 16e could remain in the line up with it’s $599 price tag. iPhone 17: Colors We haven’t yet heard anything about what colors to expect from the iPhone 17 line. The iPhone 16 comes in five colors including Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White and Black. While the iPhone 16 Pro comes in Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, White Titanium and Black Titanium, which are reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options. There were rumors that the iPhone 16 would also come in purple, so perhaps that’s in the pipeline for 2025. iPhone 17: New slimmer ‘iPhone 17 Air’ model Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a new “Slim” model with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the first to report this change (in May 2024), and in the same month, The Information reported on the Slim model, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above “Pro Max” in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has been accurate about supply-chain predictions, mentions that a future folding iPhone will have “the same high-density battery cells as the ultra-thin iPhone 17.” It’s already possible for iPhone batteries to hold more energy in the same volume, it’s just a matter of cost—with the slim iPhone 17 Air, Apple will likely spend more on a battery that holds more charge in its limited volume. A video by Jon Prosser in August 2024 surmises that the slim iPhone will be called the iPhone Air (we agree that makes sense) and will not be the most expensive in the lineup (it’s been rumored for years that Apple is planning to launch a new model with higher-end features above the Pro Max), but rather be a mid-priced model that prioritizes form and design over specs, much like the MacBook Air. Additionally, a report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in August 2024 claimed the new model will fit between the standard iPhone and the Pro: ” If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone–but don’t really need the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model–you can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.” A report from Jeff Pu in November 2024 claims that the iPhone 17 Air/Slim will be around 6mm thick. That’s thinner than any iPhone so far. The iPhone 16, for context, is 7.8mm thick. The thinnest new iPad Pro is 5.1mm thick. According to Korea’s Sisa Journal in January 2025, the so-called iPhone 17 Air will be 6.25mm thick and cost in the same price range as the iPhone 16 Plus (starting at $899 U.S.). A medium post from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the “thinnest part” of the new ultra-slim iPhone is just 5.5mm thick, but it’s difficult to know what that means without more context. The camera bump, according to Weibo leaker Ice Universe, will be 4.0mm thick, bringing the total phone thickness to 9.5mm at the camera. In October 2024 Pu said he expects the phone to have an A19 chip (not A19 Pro), 8GB of RAM, around a 6.6-inch display, an aluminum body, and a single 48MP rear camera. Another report (in July 2024) suggested that Apple won’t use resin-coated copper components on the mainboard due to quality issues with the supplier. This was one of the ways Apple planned to reduce internal space requirements, so it’s unclear if it will have an impact on the iPhone 17 slim model’s overall thickness or not. A leaked image in January reportedly showed the case of the new iPhone 17 Air, with prominent “camera bar” design. Majin Bu/X In a video, Jon Prosser claims to have laid eyes on the iPhone 17 Air himself, and has commissioned renders of what it looks like. iPhone 17: Cameras All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a 24MP front-facing camera. An October 2024 research note from analyst Jeff Pu added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a 48MP telephoto camera along with a new 24MP front camera. According to a later report from Majin Bu, the 48MP telephoto camera will have a zoom of 3.5x (85mm), with an optical “crop zoom” mode similar to today’s 48MP wide camera, so you can shoot 12MP 7x (160mm) shots before the digital zoom kicks in. Some iPhone 17 models (maybe even all of them) will have a new camera bump, a wide rectangular raised area that stretches across the phone similar in style to Google’s Pixel line. According to a leaked image of one iPhone 17 aluminum frame (we don’t know from which model), it will be substantial in size. The Pro models are expected to have a “camera bar” design like the iPhone 17 Air, only larger and with three cameras in the familiar array. According to leaker Jon Prosser, it should look something like this: Front Page Tech / @Zellozi Months later, Mark Gurman clarified in his newsletter that the camera bump won’t have a dark interior, but rather the entire area will match the color of the phone. In February 2025, veteran leaker Majin Bu leaked iPhone 17 CAD images that seemed to reveal three different camera designs. The images suggest that there will be not one or two but three different camera module designs on show. The two Pro models will have triple rear lenses embedded in a thick band that runs across the back of the phone, as predicted by Jon Prosser (above). The standard iPhone 17 will stick feature two lenses stacked vertically. And the rumored iPhone 17 Air will offer an iPhone 16e-like single camera lens on the rear in order to reduce costs and keep the chassis slim and light. Sonny Dickson A report from The Information in July 2024 claims that “at least one” model will feature a mechanical aperture, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far. iPhone 17: Rumored specs and features Various rumors suggest that the new iPhones could benefit from the following updates: Screen The always-on display is supposed to finally be available on the non-Pro models. In addition, some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple’s iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device. Apple is also said to be working with Corning on a new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass for the iPhone 17 lineup. Dynamic Island The iPhone 17 Pro Max may have a smaller dynamic island. Rumors have changed back and forth—Jeff Pu said the dynamic island (or rather, the hardware “pill” that the island surrounds) will be smaller in the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Then Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it will be the same size as current models. Then leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo said it will indeed be smaller. Design All iPhone 17 models are expected to have aluminum frames and bodies (with glass), rather than steel frames or titanium bodies in the Pro models today. Processor We don’t know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models will get an A19 Pro, while the non-Pro models may get a standard or cut-back version of the A19, or perhaps a more souped up variant of the A18. RAM Since Apple bumped every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, rumors have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to 12GB. Wi-Fi When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple’s own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won’t be ready in time for next year’s iPhone 17 line. Wi-Fi 7 support seems likely, too. iPhone history The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone SE 3 are the current-generation models available from Apple. In addition to this SE 4 model we’re also expecting iPhone 17 to launch in 2025. Below you can find links below to our reviews of all iPhone models, including the latest generation.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
