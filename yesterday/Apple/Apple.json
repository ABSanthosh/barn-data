They were announced alongside the iPhone 7, which notably lacked a headphone jack. While you still received a pair of wired EarPods with the iPhone 7, Apple's AirPods made the same design wireless, bypassing the need for a connector of any kind.Wireless earbuds were hardly a new concept at the time, but the release of the 2016 AirPods marked the beginning of a new Apple product line.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more.

    "description": "Macworld There may be a new M3 iPad AIr on shelves, but since not much has changed, we’re always on the lookout for a sale on the M2 model. And today we’ve got a whopper: Amazon is selling the M2 iPad Air with 512GB of storage and 5G connectivity for just $699. That’s a savings of $350 and the best price you’re ever likely to see. When we reviewed the M2 Apple iPad Air, we gave the tablet a 4-star rating, appreciating its performance and the speedy processor. We also really liked the landscape front camera with Center Stage because it made participating in video calls or shooting vids for social media that much easier. With 512GB of storage space (four times the base model), you get tons of space for apps and games, so you’ll never have to worry about running out. The 11-inch Liquid Retina display is gorgeous and delivers vivid colors and great contrast, as well as 500 nits of brightness. This model also comes with 5G built-in, so you can connect to a wireless network on the go. It requires an extra change through your carrier, but it’s usually just $10 or $15 per month on top of your regular bill. The M3 iPad Air is pretty great, but it’s going to be a long time before it gets anywhere close to the M2 price levels. So take advantage of this $350 discount and order the M2 iPad Air while this deal is hot. Snag an iPad Air with 512GB of storage and 5G for $350 offBuy now at Amazon",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s AirPods 2025 plans: In summary New AirPods Pro could launch featuring heart‑rate and temperature tracking and better ANC sound Some AirPods to get live translation feature via software update  AirPods Max could gain H2 chip, Adaptive Audio, Conversation awareness, Voice Isolation, Bluetooth 5.3 and more In September 2024, Apple introduced the AirPods 4. At the same time the company announced that hearing aid features would be coming to the 2nd generation AirPods Pro and the AirPods Max got a minor update (Lightning switched for USB-C and a color refresh). Those hoping that the AirPods Pro 3 and the AirPods Max 2 would launch were disappointed. It is now almost three years since the AirPods Pro 2 were introduced in September 2022, and more than four years since the AirPods Max introduction in December 2020. Updates are long overdue. In this article we are tracking all the rumors about the launch date, new features and specs and any other changes coming to the AirPods Pro and AirPods Max. Read on for the latest news about the 2025 AirPods. We’ll look first at the rumours and leaks relating to the AirPods Pro 3 before moving on to the AirPods Max 2 below (click here to jump to the AirPods Max section).  AirPods Pro 3 release date: When will the AirPods Pro 3 be released? In summary September 2025 launch of AirPods Pro 3 likely… …But launch could be delayed until 2026 Production delays indicated It would be typical to expect a September launch for AirPods Pro, alongside iPhone 17. The original AirPods Pro were introduced in October 2019, the AirPods 2nd-gen launched in September 2022, and those were updated with USB-C in September 2023. In a February 2025, Bloomberg report Mark Gurman suggested that the AirPods Pro 3 were “Still many months away”. That could still line up with a September (or October) launch though. Also in February an unverified leaker claimed in a tweet that there would be an AirPods Pro launch in May or June. Twitter However, in May 2025 analyst Ming-Chi Kuo suggested that we might not see an update to the AirPods until 2026. This could relate to production delays due to a new infra-red camera Apple is said to be equipping the AirPods with (more on that below). Twitter AirPods Pro 3 price: How much will the AirPods Pro 3 cost? In summary Price hike not expected… …But prices may rise due to economic factors We don’t expect the price to change, although it may increase in certain parts of the world and remain the same in others.  For example, when Apple launched the AirPods Pro in the U.K. the price was £249, that price was later reduced to £229, so it might go back up to £249. The price in the U.S. hasn’t changed since launch. Other factors may affect pricing. Pricing for the AirPods range starts at $129/£129 for the AirPods 4, and rises to $499/£549 for the AirPods Max:  Apple Earbuds: $19/£19 AirPods 4: $129/£129 AirPoids 4 with ANC: $179/£179 AirPods Pro 2nd-gen $249/£229 AirPods Max $549/£499 Ignoring the $300 premium for the AirPods Max, that’s an extra $70 between the AirPods 4 with ANC and the AirPods Pro. It would be feasible for Apple to increase the price of the AirPods Pro if the new features made the upgrade worthwhile.  We have a round-up of the Best wireless earbuds for iPhones and the best wired headphones if you’d like to consider alternatives to AirPods. Also read AirPods Pro vs AirPods to find out how the models compare. AirPods Pro 3 features: What specs and features will the AirPods Pro 3 have? In summary Heart rate monitoring Temperature monitoring Translation Better active noise cancellation It’s fairly easy to make predictions about the new features coming to AirPods Pro 3 just by looking at the AirPods 4 and the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 (Beats is an Apple-owned subsidiary). For example, Powerbeats Pro 2, which launched in February 2025, includes heart rate monitoring. Read our review of the Powerbeats Pro 2 and our AirPods 4 review. As for the features rumored to be coming to the AirPods Pro 3, here’s what we’ve heard: Heart Rate monitoring: In December 2024, Gurman said Apple is working on in-ear heart rate monitoring. This will enable users to track heart rate while exercising without having to wear an Apple Watch.  The inclusion of heart rate monitoring in the Powerbeats Pro 2 certainly indicates that the same feature will be available on the AirPods Pro 3, but you can expect it to be superior. One issue with the Powerbeats Pro 2 is that they can’t steam music and capture heart data simultaneously. Another issue is with the interplay between the heart rate monitoring on the Apple Watch and the Powerbeats.  Temperature monitoring: Mark Gurman has also said Apple was researching in-ear temperature sensors, and Apple has a patent on such technology. In-ear temperature sensing could also be faster and more reliable than those via the Apple Watch. Translation: As part of the iOS 19 update Apple is said to be adding a live translation feature to AirPods. It’s unknown which AirPods will be compatible, but the AirPods Pro 3 are sure to be. We expect to hear more at WWDC. Better active noise cancellation: According to Mark Gurman (in October 2023) the AirPods Pro 3 will feature a new H3 chip, which could lead to better active noise cancellation. Crash detection: An Apple patent describes a way that motion sensors inside AirPods could aid Crash Detection. AirPods Pro 3 design: Will Apple update the AirPods Pro design? In summary Changes to the charging case possible Slimmer design suggested Touch controls may work with gloves Mahmoud Itani / Foundry As mentioned above, we can look to the AirPods 4 for some clues about changes that may come to the AirPods Pro. One such change related to the charging case. The AirPod 4 charging case lacks a physical setup button, instead featuring a sensor under the status light on the front that lights up when active. There may be more changes coming. According to Mark Gurman (back in October 2023) the AirPods Pro will get a new design. We don’t expect new colors, but the buds may slim down further. The changes may be less visible, more tactile: A number of Apple patents indicate that Apple is looking to improve the way that the touch controls work on the earbuds work when the user is wearing gloves. For example in February 2025 a patent was granted to Apple that could enable this. AirPods Max 2 release date: When will the AirPods Max be updated? In summary Update long overdue Could be waiting until 2027 Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote of the AirPods Max in a December 2023 newsletter, saying that “The cans don’t sell well enough for the company to invest in entirely new hardware or software features”. However, it’s now more than four years since the AirPods Max were introduced and with such a premium price Apple owes it to customers to bring the AirPods Max into line with their competition and other AirPods Apple sells.  In 2024 Mark Gurman predicted that the AirPods Max would get an updated at the iPhone event. Sadly, the update included only a color change and a switch from Lightning for USB-C connectivity.  I expect Apple to launch new AirPods Max headphones tomorrow with better noise cancellation, adaptive audio \u0026 USB-C. They’ll launch with the low-end AirPods 4. This is line with my reporting for months but runs counter to lack of low inventory in stores. https://t.co/KIJQEwywcp— Mark Gurman (@markgurman) September 9, 2024 Even worse, the change meant that the AirPods Max could no longer be used as wired headphones (a feature of the Lightning-based model). This was the case until a software update in March 2025 added this ability along with lossless and ultra low latency audio. As a result of that software update, users are now able to play lossless audio and ultra-low-latency audio through a wired connection. Lossless audio is a key feature for audio producers, while ultra‑low latency audio is key for gaming and live streams. Both very important features for the AirPods Mac. Despite these ‘updates’ the over four year old headphones are lagging behind the competition and an update is long over due. The bad news is that, if analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is correct, we could be waiting until 2027 for the second generation of AirPods Max. Twitter AirPods Max 2 price: How much will the AirPods Max 2 cost? In summary Price unlikely to change… …Although Apple could unify the U.S. and U.K. prices At $549/£499 the AirPods Max are an expensive purchase. The fact that they are now more than four years old makes that price look incredibly inflated. It’s no wonder they are frequently discounted at Amazon and elsewhere. When the new models launch we don’t expect a price change though. These are designed to fit at the premium headphones end of the market, and their competition has solar prices. That said, the price in the U.S. and U.K. may come in to line, with Apple choosing to ‘match’ the price as it usually does (many Apple products share an, e.g. $499/£499 price point) which Apple calculated based on exchange rates and local taxes. AirPods Max 2 specs: What specs and features will the AirPods Max 2 have In summary Necessary updates to bring into line with rest of the AirPods lineup New chip  Removal of ‘audio howl’ There is so much lacking from he AirPods Max compared to the AirPods Pro that it is easy to assume that the following will be included:  H1 chip upgraded to H2 (or H3)  Adaptive Audio (which combines transparency mode and ANC) Conversation Awareness  Conversation Boost Voice Isolation  Personalized Volume Option to activate with ‘Siri’ voice command (not just ‘Hey Siri’) Custom high dynamic range amplifier Bluetooth 5.3 (up from Bluetooth 5.0)  Find My  Also expect better battery life.  One patent identified in 2022 indicates Apple is looking at detecting “audio howl”, which is described as distracting audio feedback. AirPods Max 2 design: Will Apple update the AirPods Max design? In summary More protective carry case Removable ear cushions  Waterproofing  Jason Cross/IDG Improvements to gesture controls which are currently via the Digital Crown. Could Apple forgo the Digital Crown in favor of touch controls on the ear cups?  We could see changes to the carry case. Ideally it should cover the whole product and be more protective. A patent from 2022 suggested that Apple was developing a better case with magnetic clasps. The Audio Howl patent mentioned above also refers to removable ear cushions which could be reattached using magnets.  We’d also like to see a foldable design and better waterproofing. If you’re keen to hear the latest rumors about Apple’s plans, the best place to start is our roundup of New Apple products. Those interested in the current range should take a look at our roundup of the best AirPods deals for the latest bargains.",
