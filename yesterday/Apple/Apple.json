    "description": "Macworld As is tradition, Apple released beta versions of its new operating systems to developers on the first day of WWDC on June 9. Beta 1 is for developers only–the public beta will begin in July, probably after two or three developer-only betas. Updated June 13: Apple updated beta 1 for developers today, though the version number has only changed the last letter (from 23A5260n to 23A5260u). This is still “beta 1” and there are likely no new features, just a critical bug or security flaw fixed. What’s in the latest beta The first beta release of iOS 26 has everything Apple demonstrated in its WWDC keynote: Liquid Glass, the new Phone app and features, the new Camera and Photos experience, and more. You can read all about all the new features in our iOS 26 superguide. There are plenty of bugs and unrefined areas, as you would expect with the first beta release of a major new operating system update. Not everything is working as it should, and it is not advised to run this version of the OS unless you’re a developer or have a high tolerance for buggy or unoptimized software. iOS 26: How to install the public beta The public beta is not yet available, but is expected to begin in July. If you want to be among the first to test iOS 26, you can sign up for the public beta test. Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update. iOS 26: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. You don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta, a free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. Find out everything you need to know about iOS 18 in our iOS 26 superguide.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2814927/virtualmacosx-com-user-data-exposed-in-breach.html",
    "description": "Macworld Cybersecurity researchers SafetyDetectives reported on Friday about a data breach involving VirtualMacOSX.com, an online provider of cloud services targeted at Mac users. The breach involves data that “belongs to 10,000 of its customers.” SafetyDetectives states that it found a post publicizing a VirtualMacOSX.com database in a forum known for data leaks, cracks, and more. Access to the data was given to those who replied to or liked the post. The data included sensitive information, including full names, financial data, contact info, and passwords. Analysis by SafetyDetectives led them to believe the data is genuine, but the researchers “refrained from testing the exposed credentials” to verify the data due to ethical concerns. VirtualMacOSX.com describes itself as an “affordable, Mac-based home on the web. We offer Mac OS X server plans hosted from our state of the art datacenters in Western Canada (Serving the Americas and Pacific Rim) and Eastern Canada (Serving the Americas and Middle East/Europe).” Plans start at $12.75 per month for an hour of use a day and 2GB of storage.  According to Trustpilot, Canada-based VirtualMacOSX.com averages a rating of 2.5 out of 5 in Trustpilot reviews, with 48 percent of the reviews rated as 1 star. SafetyDetectives calls itself a pro-bono “publishing group of cybersecurity experts, privacy researchers, and technical product reviewers.” Macworld contacted VirtualMacOSX.com via email for comment on the report. How to protect yourself from data breaches The breach covered here doesn’t involve a macOS vulnerability, but one at a service provider. It is not known how an outside party accessed VirtualMacOSX.com’s database and whether the data was encrypted or not. If it was encrypted, it appears that the threat agent had the keys to decrypt the data. In an instance where you believe your data was exposed in a data breach, there are a few steps to take to protect yourself: If you continue to use the service that was breached, change your password and enable two-factor verification. Check your credit report and freeze it. This will help block unauthorized approvals to financial services that are being made in your name. If you need to sign up for a service (such as a loan or credit card), you can temporarily unfreeze your account so a credit check can be performed. Check your records for all of your financial institutions. If you access them online, change your passwords and enable two-factor verification. Some institutions also provide alerts when attempts are made to access your account. Use a service such as Have I Benn Pwned to see if your email address was involved in a data breach. Apple releases security patches through OS updates, so installing them as soon as possible is important. Macworld has several guides to help, including a guide on whether or not you need antivirus software, a list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans, and a comparison of Mac security software.",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
