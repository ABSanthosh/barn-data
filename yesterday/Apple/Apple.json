    "description": "Macworld Apple’s newest iPad is on sale for its best price yet, which means you can get Apple’s budget tablet for just $299. That’s a savings of $50 you can put towards something else you’ve been waiting to buy. There are about a million things you can do with your new tablet, starting with streaming all your favorite shows and movies. The 11-inch Liquid Retina Display will ensure you’ll get gorgeous images in vivid color. It also comes with 128GB of storage space—twice that of the previous model. Considering how large some apps and games are, that’s a welcome change across iPads. We gave the new iPad a 4-star rating, appreciating just how bright the screen is, as well as the overall high-quality design and workmanship of the tablet. Even though the A16 doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, we still appreciated the strong performance Apple’s most affordable tablet delivers. Oh, and did we mention the battery life? Our tests involve running a TV show on a loop with the screen set to max brightness and with True Tone disabled. The tablet lasted for six hours and ten minutes before shutting down, which means you’ll likely get more than 10 hours of real-world use. That’s plenty to get through a busy day of gaming and video watching. Apple deals don’t stick around for long, so our advice is to hurry up and get your own A16 iPad for $299 before the deal vanishes. Save $50 on the iPad A16Buy now at Amazon",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/678333/wwdc-ios-macos-watchos-hardware-keynote.html",
    "description": "Macworld Of the big Apple events of the year, WWDC is the most reliable: In each of the past 18 Junes, like clockwork, Apple has held a big get-together for its developer partners and announced a raft of important software updates. The September iPhone launch, March/April spring event and October event seem almost unpredictable by comparison. In this article, we list the major announcements (and some of the smaller titbits) you can expect to hear about at WWDC 2025. Some of these–updates to the five big Apple operating systems, most obviously–are as predictable as the timing of the event. But we reckon Apple will spring a few surprises this year. When is WWDC 2025? Apple has announced that WWDC25 will take place from June 9 to 13, with the keynote event on Monday June 9. The company has now invited members of the press to view the keynote stream from Apple Park, including Macworld’s Roman Loyola. When is the WWDC keynote? The keynote is will begin, as usual, at 10am Pacific Time. It will take place on Monday, June 9. If you are wondering what time will the WWDC keynote start where you are it translates to: US: at 10 a.m. (PDT), 11 a.m. (MDT), noon (CDT), 1 p.m. (EDT) Canada: at 2 p.m. (ADT) UK: at 6 p.m. (BST) Europe: at 7 p.m. (CEST) India: at 10.30 p.m. (IST) Singapore and China: next day at 1 a.m. Japan: following day at 2 a.m. (JST) Australia: following day at 1 a.m. (AWST), 2.30 a.m. (ACST), 3 a.m. (AEST) New Zealand: following day at 5 a.m. (NZST) How to watch WWDC 2025 When WWDC starts Apple will live stream the opening keynote on its website and elsewhere, including on the Apple TV app. This means you’ll be able to watch the presentation on iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and even PC. Current Apple Developer Program members, Apple Developer Enterprise Program members and Swift Student Challenge winners were able to apply for free tickets. More information about how to do that below. What is WWDC? WWDC stands for the Worldwide Developers Conference and is dedicated to the third-party software and hardware developers that create apps and accessories for Apple’s platforms: iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, and Vision Pro. At the event Apple previews the software coming to iPhones, Macs, iPads and more later in the year. The beta program starts after the event so that developers can start testing the new software, find out ways to use new features, and and make sure it works with their apps. What will Apple announce at WWDC 2025? While devs are at the heart of the event, Apple uses WWDC to announce its software plans and potentially some new Macs and other products to the world. In the past we’ve seen quite a lot of new stuff, including new Macs. Read on to find out what we expect to see Apple unveil at the event, from software and hardware to some entirely new products. Apple WWDC 2025: Software releases WWDC is all about the software, so we can be certain that Apple will reveal details of its upcoming operating system updates for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple TV, HomePod, and Apple Watch. Those updates will then be issued to developers as a beta to test, and then a few weeks later a public beta will start. Learn about participating in Apple’s beta software program so you can test the new software as soon as the beta arrives. Eventually, the new software will be available for everyone to download in the fall (usually September for iOS/iPadOS/watchOS and either September or October for macOS. Here’s what to expect: Apple Intelligence AI will be at the forefront of WWDC, with the company likely to discuss how it is growing its AI feature set known as Apple Intelligence. At WWDC 2024 Apple Intelligence features were a large part of the announcements around iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS 15 Sequoia, but Apple is yet to deliver on some of its promises relating to Apple Intelligence, with some Siri related features being pushed to the iOS 19 release. iOS 19 The headliner of the event simply because of the sheer number of iPhone owners across the planet. If you’ve got an iPhone made within the past five years, you’ll likely be able to install the new version of iOS when it’s released in the fall of 2025–though the Apple Intelligence features are only for the iPhone 15 Pro or later. At WWDC Apple will showcase the new features coming to iPhones later in 2025. The rumors we’ve heard about iOS 19 so far indicate that we could see a major design overhaul, improvements to Siri, more Apple intelligence features, and Home app changes. But before iOS 19 launches, there’s a whole beta-testing cycle to get through. iOS 19 will be announced at WWDC 2025, and then released as a developer beta (for registered app developers only) almost immediately after the keynote. Developers will then be able to install the iOS beta and a few weeks later a public beta version will be made available for all users who want to try the new features. Our advice is to be cautious and prepared for serious flaws with the beta software–it might even brick your device. Over the course of the next few months, the developer and public betas will go through a testing process where features will be tweaked, changed, fixed, and updated until we reach the finished iOS 19.0 public release, most likely in September. Read all the rumors and our hopes for iOS 19 in our iOS 19 guide. iPadOS 19 The accompanying update for iPad owners, iPadOS 19 is likely to incorporate most of the new features of iOS 19 but adapted to a larger-screen interface. When Apple’s two mobile operating systems split in 2019 they were similar in most respects, but the iPad version is heading steadily into its own realm. In 2022, Apple released iPad OS 16 a month after iOS 16, so it’s possible that the two versions don’t arrive at the same time. Find out more about iPadOS 19 in our guide. macOS 16 What’s Apple got in store for its follow-up to macOS Sequoia? We’ll find out at WWDC 2025. This version will be numbered macOS 16, but what is less predictable is the California landmark Apple will name the version after. So far we’ve had: Mavericks, Yosemite, El Capitan, Sierra, High Sierra, Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura and Sonoma. Based on the trademarks Apple has applied for, macOS Rincon or Skyline could be likely. We’ll share all the rumors and our hopes for macOS 16 in our macOS 16 guide. visionOS 3 Now that the Vision Pro has been on sale for a while you can expect to hear about new software features coming to the device at WWDC. Apple is likely to have things to say about new apps being made for the device as well as third-party software that is being created for Vision Pro. watchOS 12 The new operating system for the Apple Watch will be revealed at WWDC 2025. This is more of a niche than the iPhone, iPad, and Mac updates discussed above but could bring more health and fitness features to Apple Watch owners around the world. Expect AI to have an impact here as well. tvOS 19 The lowest-profile of the big Apple operating systems, tvOS is the platform that runs on the Apple TV. tvOS is generally light on new features, but the push into AI could change that, with new discovery and search tools. HomePod software version 19 Apple is also likely to update the software on the HomePod and HomePod mini alongside the other operating systems. We may hear more about Apple’s plans for the HomePod during the WWDC event–especially as Apple is rumored to planning big changes to the HomePod. Other software You can also expect Apple to update its developer-focused apps, like Swift, Xcode, and TestFlight. Apple displayed this special Swift logo on its WWDC 2023 website.Apple WWDC 2025: Hardware releases WWDC tends to be a software-focused event, but Apple has often found time during its WWDC keynotes to launch hardware products too. The first few iPhone revisions—iPhone 3G, iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, and iPhone 4S—were all released at WWDC, and the HomePod had its unveiling at the event in 2017 as well. However, the event has focused on Mac releases in recent years. Apple unveiled the iMac Pro in 2017 alongside updates to the iMac, MacBook, and MacBook Pro, and announced a new Mac Pro and the Pro Display XDR in June 2019. At WWDC 2020, Apple announced the transition from Intel to Apple silicon, and WWDC 2022 saw Apple launch the M2 chip in the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro. WWDC 2023 saw Apple introduce the Vision Pro, 15-inch MacBook Air, and the Mac Studio and Mac Pro with M2 Ultra chip. What’s in the hardware pipeline for Apple right now? Hardware seems unlikely for this event due to a heavy focus on AI, but there are still some possibilities for surprises: New Macs We already have M4, M4 Pro, and M4 Max, but no M4 Ultra yet, and updates to the Mac Pro are long overdue. Mac Pro Over the years, including in 2023, new Mac Pro models have been launched at WWDC. Apple updated the Mac Studio in March 2025, but notably Apple gave the Mac Studio an M3 Ultra chip option rather than an M4 Ultra: is the M4 Ultra being kept back for the Mac Pro? It looks like it. Read what we know about the M4 Mac Pro. Other hardware There are also rumors about a HomePod, or HomeHub that could be used to control digital home hardware and home security tools. There are lots of rumors about different products, WWDC could be the first time we hear Apple discuss this new product. Read about Apple’s HomeHub plans. How to attend WWDC If you wanted to attend the WWDC Keynote in person you needed to enter a lottery and apply for a ticket to attend the keynote alongside other developers. There was a lot of competition for those tickets, which were randomly selected from those to apply and aren’t transferable. The good news is that tickets are free, at least. The lottery for ticket allocated for 2025 started at the end of March and those interested had to apply by the beginning of April. The lucky applicants were notified of their success in getting a ticket at the beginning of April. Apple invites developers to participate in a series of classes, workshops, and sessions to learn about the system-wide changes coming to the major software platforms in the coming year so they can update their apps. Some lucky developers even get to watch the event live in person. Current Apple Developer Program members. Apple Entrepreneur Camp alumni. Swift Student Challenge winners; challenge applicants will be included in a separate random selection process for winners (it is usually in May that Apple began alerting the lucky few of their status as winners). Current Apple Developer Enterprise Program members. You can find out more about how to get tickets to WWDC in our FAQ. WWDC keynote tickets have been free and randomly distributed for the past few years, but it previously cost $1,599 for developers to attend and those tickets sold out very quickly. Even without a ticket, all registered Apple developers get online access to session videos, slides, and sample code throughout the week. Apple will share additional conference information in advance of WWDC25 through the Apple Developer app. When was WWDC last year? Apple traditionally holds WWDC during the first weeks of June. Here are the dates from the past few years: WWDC 2024: June 10-14 WWDC 2023: June 5-9 WWDC 2022: June 6-10 WWDC 2021: June 7-11 WWDC 2020: June 22-26 WWDC 2019: June 3-7 WWDC 2018: June 4-8 For a broader view of the year’s plans, check out our guide to the new Apple products coming in 2025. We’ll update this article regularly in the run-up to WWDC, so check back to see the latest news.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
