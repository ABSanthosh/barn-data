Image Credit: Apple / USPTOIn 2022, Apple came up with the idea of adding haptic volume and power buttons to more expensive iPhone models. Relative to the standard buttons used on the iPhone 14 range, the new haptic buttons would have incorporated a dedicated haptic engine for vibration feedback.The change was also meant to facilitate a visual distinction between Apple's base model iPhones and the more expensive \"Pro\" lineup. In April 2023, the hardware was abruptly removed from the iPhone 15 Pro, and it was believed that all work on the Bongo design had ceased. Surprisingly, however, it turns out that Apple had filed a patent application for its haptic button design. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/675887/thunderbolt-4-vs-thunderbolt-3-vs-usb-4.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple has changed its MacBook connection standard from Thunderbolt 4 to Thunderbolt 5, but some earlier MacBook Air models had their ports listed as “Thunderbolt / USB 4” and “Thunderbolt 4 and USB 4” on its Pro and Max models. What does all this mean? What is the difference between Thunderbolt 5, Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 3? And then what is USB 4? We thought that USB and Thunderbolt couldn’t get any more confusing with many different speeds (from 5Gbps to 120Gbps) and functions possible using the same “Type-C” connection. From an Apple user’s point of view, there isn’t a great deal in Thunderbolt 4 that was new or different from Thunderbolt 3, with which it is backwards compatible. The big changes have arrived with Thunderbolt 5. Indeed, in its M1 and M2 MacBooks tech specs, to add to the confusion Apple didn’t even call it Thunderbolt 4, listing it as “Thunderbolt / USB 4” including Thunderbolt 3. For the superior M1 Pro and M1 Max MacBook Pro models, Apple listed the ports as full Thunderbolt 4—this is because the Pro/Max versions can support multiple external screens, unlike the limited plain M1 or M2 MacBooks. Without the ability to connect to two external displays, it can’t be labelled as certified Thunderbolt 4. What is the difference between Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 5? After much teasing in 2022 and a demo in October 2022, Intel officially announced Thunderbolt 5 on September 12, 2023, and Apple started introducing it into its MacBook Pro, Mac Studio and some Mac mini models from 2024. Thunderbolt 5 is a real step up from Thunderbolt 4—unlike Thunderbolt 4’s minor (Mac) enhancements on Thunderbolt 3. Bandwidth is doubled from 40Gbps to 80Gbps, and display connections go as fast as 120Gbps—so up to three times more bandwidth than previous existing connectivity solutions. Thunderbolt 5 supplies up to 240W of charging power downstream to the connected Mac. Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro supports 140W PD 3.1 through its MagSafe 3 port and now via its Thunderbolt 5 ports; Thunderbolt 4 ports are rated PD 3.0 and limited to 100W. That means the Thunderbolt 5 MacBooks can fast-charge via either the MagSafe 3 connection or Thunderbolt 5 ports (using either 240W-rated Thunderbolt or USB-C cables). Thunderbolt 5 also supports DisplayPort 2.1—compared to today’s DisplayPort 1.4. DisplayPort 2.1 supports a max 10K resolution (10240-×-4320 pixels at 60Hz) on a single display, compared to the 8K resolution supported by DisplayPort 1.4. It also includes improved version of Display Stream Compression (DSC 1.2a) that improves bandwidth management. Thunderbolt 5 offers the ability to daisy-chain up to 10 devices thanks to the dual USB Type-C ports. It can dynamically adjust bandwidth, prioritizing one direction over the other based on usage Thunderbolt 5 is backward compatible with Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4, and USB4 devices, so you can upgrade without having to replace existing peripherals. What is the difference between USB4 and Thunderbolt 4? Intel didn’t want there to be a confusing USB 4.1, 4.2, etc, so it jammed the 4 right next to the USB. Apple ignores this and insists, in its Apple-like way, on calling it “USB 4”. Both use the same Type-C connector, just like Thunderbolt 3, too. Thunderbolt 4 is based on the same underlying protocol as USB4—the two are tightly connected, with all Thunderbolt 4 devices supporting USB4. If someone has a USB4 laptop, they can use a TB4 device and the other way around. In fact, Thunderbolt 4 is USB4 with all the trimmings. Not all USB4 devices will be as powerful as the fully certified Thunderbolt 4, however. Just like Apple’s version of Thunderbolt 3, Thunderbolt 4 will always have a full 40Gbps bandwidth. USB4, however, starts at 20Gbps but can also reach Thunderbolt 4’s 40Gbps. Look out for USB 20 or USB 40 in product marketing. A USB4 port can only support one display. Thunderbolt 4 can support two 4K displays. The good thing about USB4 is that it will mean that manufacturers can release more powerful hubs and docks that are not Thunderbolt, at a cheaper cost. However, since Thunderbolt products are certified, it means that they are of the highest standard. USB4 devices don’t need to be certified and so eventually we will see many USB4 devices flooding the market with varying degrees of quality, as we see with USB-C hubs today. What is Thunderbolt hubbing? Thunderbolt 4 is, in some ways, just a software upgrade for Mac users. You need at least Apple’s Big Sur operating system (macOS 11) to get its new hubbing functionality. Hubbing does away with the risks of Thunderbolt device daisy-chaining. You’ve always been able to connect multiple Thunderbolt devices but in a potentially long chain, which meant that if you removed any one of them (except the last one in the chain) all the others became unusable until the chain was re-established. Now, with Thunderbolt hubbing, you can have up to four Thunderbolt ports in a hub or dock—each a separate ”branch” that can be disconnected without affecting any other Thunderbolt devices connected in the other ports. Up to six Thunderbolt 4 devices can be smartly daisy-chained. What is the difference between Thunderbolt 3 and Thunderbolt 4? Thunderbolt 4 is only significantly different for Windows PCs, whose Thunderbolt 3 variations were often limited in features—where Apple always gave its users the full Thunderbolt 3 feature set. Thunderbolt 3 on a Windows laptop could lack the full 40Gbps bandwidth, or maybe not support multiple displays or power delivery. Poor PC users, you’ve got to feel for them. Thunderbolt 4 requires mandatory certification for all computers, which means Windows users finally get all the great features Apple users got with Thunderbolt 3. So Thunderbolt 4 standardizes Thunderbolt 3 for all computer users. It’s backwards compatible, but buying Thunderbolt 4 or 5 devices will also future-proof your setup. So if your Mac has “just” Thunderbolt 3, don’t worry. It’s just that Windows PCs can now join in the fun without limitations, where in the past PC manufacturers could claim theoretical specs but not deliver the best they could by being merely “compatible” rather than “certified”. It should be noted that the MacBooks with Apple’s own M1 or M2 chips had a significant limitation: they can’t run more than one external display natively. However, there is a workaround that allows M1 and M2 MacBooks to run more than one external display. In fact, Thunderbolt 3 was required to support only one external 4K monitor, whereas every Thunderbolt 4 laptop has to support two 4K displays or one 8K display. Thunderbolt 4 and 5 ensure that you can wake a computer with the shake of a mouse or the tap of a keyboard on Thunderbolt 4 or 5 docks. This wasn’t always the case with Thunderbolt 3. This is maybe why Apple isn’t specifically calling its Thunderbolt version 4, due to the M1/M2 display limitation. TB4 and TB5 are also a more data-safe technology, as they requires Intel VT-d-based direct memory access (DMA) protection, also known as DMA remapping. What else? Well, Thunderbolt 4 supports PCIe (peripheral component interconnect express) at 64Gbps for faster storage speeds than TB4’s 32Gbps and TB3’s 16Gbps. Some of the early Thunderbolt 3 MacBooks had less bandwidth available on the right-hand-side Thunderbolt ports. Faster PCIe is important if you frequently transfer very large files between storage devices. Here we are talking about the portion of total Thunderbolt bandwidth allocated for PCI Express data transfer. With Thunderbolt 4 and 5, you’re assured to have all four lanes of PCI Express available—so PCIe can consume up to 32 or 64Gbps of the total 40Gbps/80Gbps Thunderbolt bandwidth. With Thunderbolt 3, depending on your laptop manufacturer and model, some implementations offer only 16Gbps of PCIe bandwidth.  Other advantages of Thunderbolt 4 and 5 include that hubs and docks can now have more than two Thunderbolt ports (up to four) and that TB4 and TB5 cables can be up to 2 meters long and still handle the 40Gbps bandwidth. Previously, passive TB3 cables had to be 0.7m or under to handle full bandwidth. Thunderbolt 4 and (most) USB4 support the latest USB PD 3.1 standard that allows for maximum charging of 240W compared to USB PD 3.0 and Thunderbolt 3’s 100W. Remember that you need the correct type of cable for the higher charging rates: read our roundup of the best Thunderbolt 4 cables. Thunderbolt docks We have tested the best Thunderbolt 4 hubs and docking stations.  The TB4 and TB5 hubs generally feature four Thunderbolt ports (one upstream to connect to the computer, and three downstream to external devices). Docks sometimes swap out one or two downstream Thunderbolt ports for more traditional display connectors (such as HDMI and DisplayPort). You can learn more about the most fully featured hub we’ve tested in our Caldigit Thunderbolt 5 Element 5 Hub review. This hub features four Thunderbolt 5, two 10Gbps USB-C and three 10Gbps USB-A ports. Foundry The CalDigit Thunderbolt 4 Element hub features four Thunderbolt 4 and four 10Gbps USB-A ports. Intel Who owns Thunderbolt? Intel or Apple? Apple and Intel have collaborated on Thunderbolt technology since 2010, releasing its first Thunderbolt MacBook in 2011. Apple even registered the trademark “Thunderbolt” although it passed this on to Intel, in return for “unrestricted use of the technology”. But Intel is the official owner of the Thunderbolt technology. Before this agreement, the technology was known by Intel as “Light Peak”.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
