    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

Now, another delay seems likely, even as the app's future remains unresolved.As The Wall Street Journal has learned, President Trump is planning on pushing back the ban date — for the third time. Allegedly, talks were underway for a sale, but the ongoing trade war between the U.S. and China that Trump lit off in April has caused the deal to be pushed onto the back burner.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2806778/amazon-prime-day-2025-all-you-need-to-know.html",
    "description": "Macworld Somehow, it’s already June and that means this year’s first Prime Day event is quickly approaching. There may be no better time to get your hands on Apple gear, plus accessories for Macs and iPhones, as well as other tech of interest to Apple diehards. Read on for all the details. When is Prime Day 2025? Let’s start by saying that Amazon hasn’t yet made an official announcement, so we’re working on guesstimates based on historical precedent. Usually, Amazon’s event takes place in the second or third week of July. Based on this history, will will surmise Amazon’s 2025 event will take place on July 8-9 or July 15-16. Rumors have been swirling that Amazon is considering a longer event in 2025. Whether Prime Day will last its typical two days, or go for the full week like the Spring sale or Black Friday remains to be seen. We’ll know when Amazon makes its dates official. When was Prime Day in previous years? In previous years, Amazon’s Prime Day event lasted for 48 hours, and always started on a Tuesday. Let’s check out the exact dates: 2024: July 16-17 and October 8-9 2023: July 11-12 and Oct 10-11 2022: July 12-13 and October 11-12 2021: June 21-22 2020: October 13-14 What do you need to do to get access to Prime Day deals? Amazon’s Prime Day event is dedicated to Amazon Prime members. So, if you’re paying for a subscription to get free shipping and faster deliveries, as well as a bunch of other perks, you’re already good to go. If you’re not already subscribed, you can start a 30-day free trial, although we’d suggest waiting a couple more weeks, at least, so you can make sure the trial extends through all potential Prime Day dates. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or you could pay $139 for the whole year. If you’re a student, you can get it for as little as $7.49 per month or $69 per year. Discounts are also available for folks who receive government assistance. While it’s true that most deals on Prime Day are dedicated to members, there will be plenty of discounts that come with such requirements. What can you expect on Prime Day? Prime Day is the sale event when a ton of tech products get their best discounts. Oftentimes, these discounts are better than we’ll see on Black Friday—and that’s saying quite a bit. We expect to see great discounts across the board for Apple tech, from iPads to MacBooks, smartwatches, and all the accessories. We also think we’ll see loads of discounts for SSDs, monitors, chargers, and smart home tech. If you’re also into Amazon’s brands, expect fantastic deals for those too, from Kindle to Ring to Echo, and so on. Deals you can get ahead of Prime Day Prime Day is a fantastic time for shoppers, but there are loads of deals to get right now: Apple MacBook Air M4, 13-inch, 16GB memory, 256GB storage: $849 (15% off $999) Apple AirPods Pro 2: $170 (32% off $249) Anker 20W 2-port chargers with type-C cables, 2-pack: $12 (37% off $19) Sony WH-1000XM4: $228 (34% off $348) Samsung ViewFinity S7 S70D 27-inch: $200 (43% off $350)",

    "description": "Macworld In just a couple of days, Apple will take the wraps off the next version of iOS, expected to bring a new look, a new name, and a couple of new apps. And according to a new report, some of the most-used older apps are getting updates too. In Mark Gurman’s annual pre-keynote roundup, he writes about a few apps getting a refresh as part of iOS 26. Among the changes are: Safari: Apple’s browser will get “a significantly updated look,” to match the rest of iOS 26. Gurman says the UI redesign will be “highlighted by a more transparent and glassy address bar.” Camera: The popular app will get a redesign focused on simplicity, according to Gurman. He says Apple found the iOS 18 interface “a bit clunky” and will rethink the approach for iOS 26. Messages: As previously rumored, the Messages app will gain support for polls within conversations. Additionally, you’ll be able to set unique backgrounds for each chat that “will sync between devices, including those of other users, meaning that you and the people you are chatting with have the same look.” Phone: A new look is on the way with “a new view that combines favorite contacts, recent calls and voicemails into a single, scrollable window.” Gurman says the look will be optional via a toggle in settings. Additionally, Gurman has previously reported that Apple will bring the Preview app to the iPhone, as well as tweaks to Calendar and CarPlay. You can learn all about the new features during the WWDC keynote beginning at 10am PT on Monday.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
