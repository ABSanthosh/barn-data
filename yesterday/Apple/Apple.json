    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "With iOS 18, loving your iPhone is a real chore",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2476360/with-ios-18-loving-your-iphone-is-a-real-chore.html",
    "description": "Macworld It‚Äôs fair to say that iOS 18 is more highly customizable than any prior release. The big personalized lock screen update of iOS 16 definitely let us add some personality to our iPhones, but that‚Äôs nothing compared to the freedom to fiddle afforded in iOS 18. Unfortunately, that means you‚Äôre going to have to do a little work. Apple‚Äôs latest major update lets you customize the lock screen shortcuts, expanded customization of the Action button (which is now available on all new models), finally gives you full control over the Home screen layout and color, and includes an all-new Control Center with multiple pages, third-party controls, resizable controls, and more. And let‚Äôs not forget the redesigned Photos app, which moved around and reorganized everything. The freedom to customize these things to your liking is unprecedented, but so is the need to customize these things. The defaults aren‚Äôt particularly great, and in some cases have infuriated users who update and can‚Äôt stand the way Apple has changed things. You can really love iOS 18, but you‚Äôll have to spend a decent chunk of time setting things up the way you like them first. What a chore! Make the Action button more useful Last year, the Action button was only for the iPhone 15 Pros, but this year it‚Äôs on all four iPhone 16 models. What‚Äôs more, Apple has added a few more options to it, and it‚Äôs easy to set up, so let‚Äôs start there. Open Settings \u003e Action Button and swipe through the options to pick something you think might be a little more useful than the mute function. Apple Apple Apple Apple provides lots of options, but the most powerful one is the ability to launch a Shortcut, which lets you perform powerful actions with a single long press of the Action button. You can play around with it or find some good examples at MacStories.net. My favorite function is to set the Action button to open the Control Center, which is only possible if you‚Äôre running iOS 18.1 (in beta, at the time of this writing). Here‚Äôs how: Make a new Shortcut and add the ‚ÄúShow Control Center‚Äù action to it. That‚Äôs it! (Here‚Äôs a link to mine if you find that useful‚Äîopen it on your iPhone.) Then go to the Action Button settings menu and set it to activate that shortcut. Swap out your Lock screen buttons The next easiest thing to do in getting iOS 18 customized to the way you like it is to swap out your Lock Screen buttons. The two buttons for the flashlight and camera have been staples of the Lock Screen for so long that you may have never considered what else you might want them to be. But now that the iPhone 16 has quick access to the Camera with the Camera Control button and less of a need for a dedicated Lock Screen button, Apple has given everyone using iOS 18 the ability to swap out one or both of your buttons with third-party apps or functions. To get started, long press on your Lock Screen (if you‚Äôre on your Home screen, swipe down your notifications shade from the top left edge to enter the Lock Screen). Tap Customize, tap Lock Screen, and then tap one of the icons to change it. There are many to choose from‚ÄîShazam, Stopwatch, ChatGPT or any other app you might like. Foundry Foundry Foundry Rearrange and redesign your Home Screen Maybe you have your Home screen (or screens) set up just the way you like. Perhaps you‚Äôre holding onto a dozen folders from years past, refusing to give the App Library a chance. That‚Äôs fine, but you may still enjoy a little glow-up to your Home screen. Tap and hold any empty spot on your Home screen until the icons all jiggle and get a (-) symbol in the corner. You can drag around your icons wherever you want now, even leaving empty spaces for widgets or to see your wallpaper better. And there‚Äôs more. From this view, tap Edit in the upper left and then Customize. Here you can change icon size, set them to always be Dark or Light, or give them a custom color-tinted look. If you want to go further, add widgets (drag same-size widgets on top of each other to make a smart stack) or remove entire Home screen pages to keep everything tidy. Control the Control Center The Control Center is vastly different in iOS 18, with new pages and buttons and a whole new layout. This will probably take more time than any other customization step, but it can also have the most impact (especially if you set your Action button to open Control Center, as described above). Open Control Center (swipe down from the upper-right corner) and tap the ‚Äú+‚Äù button in the upper-left corner. This will put you into Edit mode. You can now tap and drag controls to rearrange them or tap and drag the corner to resize them. Some controls really look and act differently at different sizes, so you‚Äôll need to experiment with them. Foundry Foundry Foundry Bear in mind that the Control Center has multiple pages, and you swipe up and down to flip between them. You can also put multiple copies of the same control on different pages, or even the same page if that makes sense. Once you‚Äôve got things where you want them, you can tap the ‚Äú+ Add a Control‚Äù button at the bottom of the screen to add new controls. Some of the apps you have installed can provide controls too, and others will be updated to add new controls over time. Fix the Photos app The new Photos app in iOS 18 has been met with mixed reviews (to put it charitably), but most of its problems come from all the scrolling and swiping you have to do to get to what you want. But there‚Äôs a fix. Scroll all the way down to the bottom and tap Customize and Reorder. There, you can turn off the categories you don‚Äôt want and drag the ones you do want into a different order. With a little pruning, the Photos app gets a lot easier to use, much more customizable, and as easy to use as before. Foundry Foundry Foundry",

    "description": "Macworld Whether you‚Äôre looking to gift an Apple product or just pick one up for yourself, we‚Äôve scoured the web for the best prices on everything from Macs to MacBooks, iPads to iPhones, Apple Watches to Apple TVs, and more. If you are wondering if Apple has sales, prepare to be disappointed. Apple rarely discounts its own products‚Äìeven during its annual Black Friday shopping event, it traditionally elects to give out gift cards rather than actual price reductions. It also offers year-round discounts to students, including a Back To School event where students can get up to $150 in gift cards when purchasing certain Apple products. There‚Äôs also the Apple Refurbished Store where you can sometimes grab a bargain. But if you want a new Apple device right now, other stores often offer up Apple discounts worth grabbing. In this article, you‚Äôll find real-time pricing at all major retailers for Apple‚Äôs current lineup, and we‚Äôve also highlighted some of the top discounts each week. Plus, for even more deals, we‚Äôve linked to our dedicated deals round-ups for each product category. Use the table of contents to jump to the best deals right now for the Apple product you want‚Äìincluding the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and the AirPods 4 which were announced in September 2024. Best AirPods deals Foundry Foundry Foundry New AirPods were announced by Apple in September 2024. We aren‚Äôt seeing any deals on the new AirPods 4 yet, but they will be listed here as soon as we see any discounts. There are new colors for the AirPods Max to look out for too. Following the launch of new AirPods, the AirPods 2nd-gen and AirPods 3rd-gen were discontinued, however, we expect to continue to see deals on those products until stock runs out.

We recommend checking Verizon, AT\u0026T, and T-Mobile‚Äôs sites if you‚Äôre looking to change carriers or add a new line. Apple also offers trade-ins and carrier deals through its website. We also recommend that you look at our round-up of iPhone 14 deals as well as iPhone 15 deals for U.S. readers, and with the arrival of the iPhone 16 we will be tracking Where to get the best iPhone 16, Plus, Pro, and Pro Max deals in the U.S. In the U.K., we frequently see Apple-certified resellers discount unlocked iPhones. Look for money off at Amazon, Currys, and Very.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
