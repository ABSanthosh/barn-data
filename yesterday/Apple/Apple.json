    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/673295/how-to-use-macbook-with-lid-closed-stop-closed-mac-sleeping.html",
    "description": "Macworld There are a lot of different reasons why you might want to use your MacBook with the lid closed. You might want to plug into an external display and move your MacBook out of the way to free up space on your desk (although you could always use both screens). Alternatively, you might want to download a software update or play music from your Mac and have found that as soon as you close the lid the download or music will stop. If you want to stop your Mac from sleeping when you close the lid then you‚Äôll find out how to do that below including the MacBook closed lid settings you need. One related problem you might come across if you are using your Mac with the lid closed is that when it comes to turning your Mac on it would seem that you have to open the lid to press the power switch‚Ä¶ Luckily there is a workaround for that scenario that you might find useful. So we have also included advice about how to turn on your Mac without opening the lid below. See also: Best stands for MacBook and Best MacBook docking stations. How to use a MacBook with the lid closed The good news is that using a MacBook with the lid closed is a lot simpler than it used to be if you are using a newer Mac and a newer version of the Mac operating system. In fact, if you are experiencing issues using your Mac with the lid closed then it is likely that you could address this by updating your Mac to a recent version of macOS, assuming your Mac supports it (see our macOS compatibility checker). The crucial ingredient is an external monitor. Connect an external keyboard (can be wireless). Connect an external mouse (can be wireless). Connect an external monitor. If you are using a Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, make sure that Bluetooth is on and that the peripherals are paired with the Mac. After your Mac notebook‚Äôs Desktop appears on the external display, close the computer‚Äôs lid. Your external monitor may flash off for a moment but it will then show your Desktop (you may need to wake your Mac by pressing a key on the keyboard or moving the mouse). You may find that your MacBook needs to be plugged in via the power adapter for the screen to appear on the external monitor, but ours didn‚Äôt. You can read more about using a second display with your Mac here. But even with these settings, if you aren‚Äôt attached to an external monitor closing the lid will cause the Mac to sleep. What if you don‚Äôt want to plug in an external display? Foundry How to stop a MacBook from sleeping when the lid is closed Suppose you don‚Äôt want your MacBook to sleep when you close the lid? Maybe it is busy downloading something and you don‚Äôt want it to stop, but you need to carry it somewhere. Or maybe you‚Äôve left it downloading an update overnight or syncing your Time Machine backup, and you‚Äôd prefer not to see the backlit keyboard. In another scenario you might want to play music from the MacBook without having to have the lid open‚Äìsomething likely to appeal to a few DJs. The problem is that your Mac will go to sleep when you close the lid if it‚Äôs not plugged in and connected to an external display. Prior to changes that came with macOS Ventura there was an option to set your Mac never go to sleep in System Preferences (macOS Monterey or older). In macOS Monterey and older Open System Preferences. Go to Battery (or Energy Saver). Select ‚ÄúPrevent your Mac from automatically sleeping when the display is off.‚Äù In macOS Ventura and later If you are running macOS Ventura or later you might be wondering where the energy saver and battery settings are that you need, and if it is still possible to set your Mac to sleep or wake at a particular time. We answer those questions below. Open Terminal Enter the following command: sudo pmset -a disablesleep 1 That should stop your Mac sleeping. However, a better option may be to use a third-party app, such as Amphetamine or Caffeinated. Amphetamine is a free download from the Mac App Store here. Amphetamine keeps your Mac awake by overriding the Energy Saver settings. We review Amphetamine here. Caffeinated is available on the Mac App Store here for$3.99/¬£3.99, this app also overrides the Energy Saver settings to keep your Mac awake, preventing your Mac from going to sleep. How to play music with your Mac‚Äôs lid closed You can use the free Amphetamine app to keep your Mac awake while the display is closed, here‚Äôs how: Once installed on a Mac you will find a pill-shaped icon in the menu bar at the top of the screen. You can choose from options such as Start New Session While File is Downloading or While App is Running. If you want to keep Music (or what app you are using)running with the lid closed, first, you need to have that app open. Then follow these steps: Click on the Amphetamine icon in the menu bar. Click on Quick Settings. In the Session Defaults section, deselect ‚ÄúAllow system sleep when display is closed.‚Äù Go back to the main menu and select While App is Running and pick Music or the app you are using. If your app is not open, it will not appear in the list. Only apps that are running appear. You will now be able to shut your Mac‚Äôs lid and continue listening to Music. Foundry How to continue a download with a MacBook lid closed You could also use Amphetamine if you wanted to download something with the screen closed, but you can also set your Mac to wake for network access, which should mean your Mac can still run updates in the background even if it‚Äôs sleeping. In macOS Ventura and later Open System Settings. Go to Battery. Click on Options. Make sure that ‚ÄúWake for network access‚Äù is set to Always. In macOS Monterey and older There is a similar setting in Monterey and older that you can use to make sure downloads continue in the background. Open System Preferences. Go to Battery (or Energy Saver). Choose ‚ÄúWake for network access.‚Äù See: How Apple has revamped System Preferences in macOS Ventura. Foundry How to turn on the MacBook with the lid closed If your setup means your MacBook is attached to a display you will be able to use it without having the display open‚Äìbut what about when you need to turn it on? At that point, you will need to open the lid to press the Power button right? Not necessarily. It‚Äôs easy to wake your MacBook from sleep without opening the lid. Just click or move the mouse or tap on the keyboard. But what if you want to start the Mac up without opening the lid to reveal the power button? Can it be done? It can! (Sort of) macOS Ventura and later In older versions of macOS it was possible to set your Mac to switch on and off at certain times of the day. Unfortunately, this is no longer as simple to set up. To schedule your Mac to turn on or off in macOS Ventura or later you need to use Terminal. Follow these steps: Open Terminal. enter one of the following pmset commands: pmset -g sched (See the current schedule).sudo pmset repeat wake M 8:00:00 (Schedule your Mac to wake at 8:00 a.m. every Monday.)sudo pmset repeat cancel (Cancel the current schedule.) Press Return. For more advice about how to do this consult Apple‚Äôs support page. We also cover How to schedule your Mac to turn on and off separately and How to set the power scheduler that disappeared in macOS Ventura. macOS Monterey and older: There is a setting in Monterey and older that lets you set your Mac to switch on at a particular time. Open System Preferences. Click Battery (or Energy Saver in older versions). Click Schedule. Now click beside Start Up or Wake and choose the days and times you want your Mac to start up. Note that the Mac will only turn on when it is plugged into power‚Äìyou could just leave the Mac unplugged, and then when you want it to start up, simply plug it in. Foundry",

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
