    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Macworld The first thing you should do after buying a new iPhone 16, be it an iPhone 16 Plus, Pro or Max, or the latest iPhone 16e, is to admire it and then swiftly cover it up. Buy yourself an iPhone 16 case to protect your precious mobile after splashing a ton of cash on it, and add some style to make your new handset more personal. Cases come in more shapes and size and with more functionality than you’d believe. We have hand tested the best to find the perfect case for your iPhone 16, 16 Plus, 16e, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max. Best clear iPhone 16 cases Best-looking iPhone 16 cases Best protective cases for iPhone 16 Best leather and leather-alternative iPhone 16 cases Best iPhone 16 cases with wallet Best iPhone 16 case with camera accessories Best iPhone 16 case with built-in keyboard Best iPhone 16 cases with lanyards Best phone slings iPhone 16 case: Protection The most common causes for accidental smartphone damage are: dropping your phone on the ground, it falling from a pocket or bag, or it being knocked off a table. The main results of such phone accidents are cracked and scratched screens, followed by chipped corners and sides. In fact, research shows that within 10 weeks of purchase, half of all new phone users will drop their handset. D’oh! Even a basic phone case will offer some protection against such everyday drops and knocks, and some are built to withstand more catastrophic accidents. A few years ago, such ultra-protective cases meant you’d be carrying around something the size and weight of a brick, but modern materials mean that protective cases can be relatively slim and light. Clever design and tough-but-thin materials such as Kevlar and Graphene are key to the levels of robustness—but it remains the case that the bulkier the case, the more protection it will offer as long as it is also clever and made of the right stuff. Let’s face it the iPhone is basically made front and back of glass—even if it is a new version of Ceramic Shield that Apple claims is “two times tougher than any smartphone glass”—and glass dropped on the floor usually ends in despair. Look for raised edges (known as a bezel) around the screen that will protect it from drop cracks and scratches—it lands on these edges and not the fragile screen. Another point of obvious weakness is the camera lens area, and you should go for a case with a raised edge around that part, too, in case the phone lands that side down. Where we have the exact dimensions, we have included this information in our case reviews below. Look for button covers—in metal or plastic. Some cases prefer cutouts but may offer less protection as a result. The iPhone 16’s new Camera Control on the right side of all the iPhone 16 models (except the 16e) is capacitive so it can’t be covered using standard materials in the same way as the other iPhone buttons can. In its own cases, Apple (and Apple-owned Beats) plus a growing roster of third parties such as OtterBox, ESR, dbrand, Benks and Torras (all reviewed below) utilize a piece of sapphire crystal coupled with a conductive layer to communicate finger movements—including taps, slides and swipes—to the button below. iPhone 16 case: Style Apple makes the iPhone a thing of sleek beauty and offers a small range of colors (exciting for the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, but rather dull for the Pro and Pro Max, and black or white 16e). If you want to keep this Apple elegance while still protecting the phone, choose a clear case that won’t detract from the Apple designers’ art. If you want to add more personality—if only to distinguish your iPhone from those of your family, friends or colleagues—there are hundreds of designs to choose from. Some are quite beautiful, some fine art, and some I wouldn’t want to be seen with in a dark room. And iPhone 16 cases come in many forms: wallet cases, cases that support bike and car mounts, phone pouches, sleeves, slings and cases with belt-clips. Here we keep adding the best we can find as they come in for testing. iPhone 16 case: Fit Ensure you choose the right case for your exact model so that it fits correctly over the buttons and camera lenses for uninterrupted use. Where possible we have linked to the buying pages for each model: iPhone 16 and 16e (6.1 inch), iPhone 16 Plus (6.7 inch), iPhone 16 Pro (6.3 inch) and iPhone 16 Pro Max (6.9 inch). Don’t think you can squeeze your new 16 model iPhone into a case for an older model. Sometimes a new iPhone is the same size as the previous model, but not the 16 unfortunately. Upgraders need a new case. iPhone 16 case: magnetic wireless charging Also make sure that the case is MagSafe compatible so that you can charge wirelessly with a MagSafe charger while your iPhone 16 stays in its case. So-called “clear” cases sadly require a huge white ring on their back to be compatible with MagSafe charging. Colored, patterned or leather cases hide their magnets better. The entry-level iPhone 16e surprisingly doesn’t support MagSafe so this is less of a benefit for that model. You can, of course, still charge via a USB-C cable—which will always be the fastest way to charge an iPhone—and an iPhone charger. Best clear iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16e, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max If covering up Apple’s iPhone offends your inner Jony Ive, look for a clear, transparent case that keeps the iPhone’s looks as wonderful as they were straight out of the box. 1.

Why pick out a Pink or Desert Titanium iPhone 16 Pro Max, only to cover it up in a black plastic case or something with badly drawn flowers on it? With Apple’s Clear case, you get decent protection without ruining the look of the phone.(If you want a black case or flowery pattern instead of Apple’s small palette of colors, we have plenty for you to choose from lower down this feature. The Apple Clear Case is made from a blend of optically clear polycarbonate and other flexible materials, with a scratch-resistant coating on both the inside and outside. While it’s more protective than silicone cases and features a robust-looking 2mm camera lip, you can find tougher cases, which we have reviewed below. There is one part of the case that isn’t clear—the white MagSafe ring on the back. As with all the Apple cases, the Camera Control is covered with a capacitive button that allows for finger taps and gestures without compromising on protection. The bottom of the case is a large cutout, however, leaving the USB-C port, speakers and microphone exposed. At 29g it’s super light, and while the rigid case adds a little bulk, it’s worth a little compromise for that layer of protection. All materials and coatings are optimized to prevent yellowing over time. There are also cheaper clear cases, which we have also tested for you. But the Apple badge is a sure sign of quality, as you’d expect. The colors on the new iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max models aren’t as exciting as the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, though, so we wouldn’t blame you for deciding on something more joyful. Apple is not yet selling its Clear Case for the entry-level iPhone 16e. 2. ESR Zero Clear Case for iPhone 16 – Best budget clear iPhone 16 case Pros Shows off iPhone’s color Flexible Affordable Cons Basic protection Price When Reviewed: $15.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $7.99 View Deal ESR $15.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $7.99 at Amazon$15.99 at ESR MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 27g Raised edge: 1mm Camera edge: 0.7mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max If you want basic protection for your new iPhone 16, the clear ESR Zero Clear Case has a 1.2mm front edge to protect the screen and a smaller-than-most 0.7mm camera guard. It’s made from a crystal-clear polymer, which ESR claims resists yellowing for longer than cheaper cases. It is wireless compatible so you don’t need to flip the case off to charge wirelessly. ESR also makes other less flexible but tougher clear cases, such as the iPhone 16 Air Armor Clear Case with better drop protection and AirGuard corners. The iPhone 16 Pro Classic Hybrid Case has a tough scratch-resistant acrylic back and is available in a Shimmer effect that adds a little more excitement and personality to your average clear case. The iPhone 16 Classic Hybrid Case with Stash Stand, which features military-grade protection and a handy built-in kickstand for stable viewing, is reviewed below. These clear alternatives add a little more weight and cost but are recommended for their extra protection and features. 3. Totallee Super Thin Case for iPhone 16 – Slimmest, lightest hard clear iPhone 16 case Pros Slimmest clear case Lightest case Cons Basic protection MagSafe costs more Price When Reviewed: From $35 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $35 View Deal Totallee $35 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $35 at Amazon$35 at Totallee MagSafe compatible: Optional Weight: 8g Button covers: Covered Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear, Frosted Clear, Frosted Black, Frosted Red, Frosted Green, Frosted Navy Blue Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max This is the slimmest (0.5mm) iPhone 16 case we have tested and—by a long way—the lightest at just 8g. Totallee claims the case weighs 0.2oz, which is 3g but our scales weighed it at 8g, which could just be a failing of our scales. In either case, even 8g is barely noticeable. Even at this weight, there are button covers, and a cutout for the Camera Control. There is a clear version and a similar Frosted Clear model, plus a bunch of other frosted colors to choose from. Note that you have to pay a little more for the MagSafe-compatible versions, which no doubt add a little weight and thickness in parts. 4. ESR iPhone 16 Classic Hybrid Case with Stash Stand – Best clear iPhone 16 case with stand Pros Shows off iPhone’s true color Built-in kickstand Cons Heavy Price When Reviewed: $22.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $17.99 View Deal ESR $22.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $17.99 at Amazon$22.99 at ESR MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 41g Raised edge: 1.2mm Camera edge: 0.7mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout or Covered Colors: Clear, Clear/Black, Clear/Blue, Clear/Pink, Clear/Green, Clear/Gray Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max A more functional clear option is ESR’s Classic Hybrid Case with Stash Stand, available for all models of the iPhone 16 family. Make sure you choose your exact model. It is transparent, aside from the required giant MagSafe icon, and more affordable than the Apple clear case. The kickstand—otherwise hidden in the camera ring—is an added bonus, working in both landscape and portrait modes. The metal stand is an extra camera guard when not in use. ESR even suggests you can use it to carry your iPhone on your finger when your hands are full. If so, you’ll be interested in the protection it offers if it slides off your finger… There’s the usual tough talk of military-grade protection, with the case featuring shock-absorbing AirGuard corners and a 0.7mm camera lip. At 40g, it’s one of the heavier clear cases, which is caused by the handy metal kickstand. An option with covered Camera Control is available, as is one with just a cutout. 5. Casetify clear Impact and Bounce Cases for iPhone 16 – Most customizable clear iPhone 16 case Pros Shows off iPhone’s true color Protection level options Built-in kickstand option Cons Not entirely transparent Price When Reviewed: From $72 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Casetify $72 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $72 at Casetify MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 45g Raised edge: 1.4mm Camera edge: 2mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16e | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max One of our favorite clear options is Casetify’s Impact and Bounce cases, which are both available for all models of the iPhone 16 family. Casetify offers these cases in a selection of protection levels and handily shows you what each case will look like depending on the color of your iPhone. It is solidly built and feels robust, offering a minimum of 6.6ft (2m) drop protection up to 32.8ft (10m) if you choose the Ultra Bounce Case. It’s one of the first clear cases that fits the new iPhone 16e. For a little extra outlay, the Impact Case can be ordered with an integrated stand, otherwise hidden in the camera ring. The case edges aren’t clear because they feature extra-protective EcoShock or TesseLock designs. On one side there are sockets to easily attach phone charms. Casetify The Bounce Case boasts 21.3ft (6.5m) drop protection, while the Ultra Bounce promises an incredible 23.8ft (10m). The more protection, sadly the less of the original phone can be seen even in a clear case, but most of the shock absorption on the Bounce case family protrudes from the corners. 6. Rokform Crystal Case iPhone 16 – Most protective clear iPhone 16 case Pros Shows off iPhone’s color (mostly) Robust protection Cons Not entirely transparent Not MagSafe compatible Heavy Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $69.99 View Deal Rokform £69.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $69.99 at Amazon£69.99 at Rokform MagSafe compatible: No Weight: 75g Raised edge: 2mm Camera edge: 1mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Clear with black trim Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max For those who want to see and show off their iPhone’s original coloring, but still gain maximum protection, Rokform offers its Crystal Case for the iPhone 16 family. This is more solid looking than even the Casetify Ultra Bounce reviewed above. As you’d expect, that protection comes at the price of some bulk and heft. It’s not fully clear because its black sides, edges and corners are made from a military-grade polycarbonate and TPU combination to absorb shocks from drops and falls. At present, the Rokform cases are too thick to work with all MagSafe chargers so you will likely need to remove your phone from the case to charge it wirelessly. The company is planning a thinner version, and we’d recommend waiting for that MagSafe-compatible version if you want accessible wireless charging. The case also features the Rokform’s famous twist-lock and magnetic mounting system for bike, motorcycle and car mounts. If you’re going biking with iPhone on your handlebars, a super-protective case is a must. Rokform does ship internationally, but you’ll need to check the fees depending on your region, and remember that customs charges also vary by country. 7.

While it looks almost invisible—except for the necessary white MagSafe area— this case, made from recycled polycarbonate and TPU, still offers 8-foot drop protection with corner air pockets. The sides and buttons feature a frosted texture for enhanced grip. Also included is a handy dedicated lanyard loop. The straight clear Incase Slim Case for MagSafe is joined by shaded models in four subtle color ways. Best-looking iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16e, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max While some will prefer a clear case to keep their iPhone’s natural color, others are easily bored and want a splash of difference, from plain new colors, through pretty or cool patterns, to fully customizable designs. We’ve counted hundreds of designs on offer, so there must be something here for you and your iPhone 16. 1.

There’s enough choice here to satisfy most people, but if you prefer to see the color of the iPhone itself, look to a clear case; see above. Apple pretty much threw out all its lovely Silicone colors from the iPhone 15 (Guava, Orange Sorbet, Winter Blue, Black, Storm Blue, Clay. Light Pink, Cypress, Sunshine, Pink, Soft Mint, Light Blue) and dreamt up a whole new bunch, many of which are poppy and vibrant. It is as protective as you need for everyday calamities except big falls—if you want ultra protection, look to our best protective cases reviewed further down. If you are prone to letting your phone slip out of your hand, look for cases made from TPU, Kevlar or Graphene. It is made with a soft-touch, almost silky 55% recycled silicone material. Inside, the lining is soft microfiber to protect the iPhone itself from scratches. Apple has added a silicone button to the Action button but left the new Camera Control button covered up with a conductive layer to communicate finger movements to the control—at the time of writing, only the OtterBox iPhone 16 case has anything similar with most other cases using a simple cutout for the Camera Control. Apple has somehow engineered a little screen animation when you place the iPhone inside the Silicone Case, which is a nice—if otherwise not very useful—touch. Aside from the colors and the attention to detail, people flock to this Apple case apart because it’s made by Apple and has the famous logo on the back. You can’t go wrong buying an Apple-made case, but you can find more options elsewhere. 2. Casetify iPhone 16 Case – Best custom iPhone 16 cases Pros Many customization options Protection levels Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: From $62 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $35.70 View Deal Casetify $62 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $35.70 at Amazon$62 at Casetify MagSafe compatible: Yes (where stated) Weight: 69g (Ultra Case) Raised edge: 1.4 to 1.6mm Camera edge: 2 to 3.8mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Cutout Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Multiple customization options Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16e | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max Amazon: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max While the iPhone 16 and 16 Plus colors have some panache, the 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max iPhones are a bit metal bachelor pad in our opinion. To add some fun you need a non-clear case, and if you want to impose your own personality then look for customization options. The most customizable range of iPhone 16 cases we’ve seen are from Casetify, where you can mix and match colors, patterns, prints, artists, and personalization options, as well as several levels of protection. Prices vary and rise depending on the protection levels, but for most you get a wide range of design options. The level of choice is almost overwhelming, and you’ll have fun choosing the case that looks just right for you. A new Harry Potter range of iPhone 16 cases and accessories has recently been added. You can add a name or short word, plus add hearts and stars, fonts, and text colors if you desire. Some cases feature a pull-out stand, which is otherwise hidden in the camera ring. Casetify also offers a range of protection levels: Impact (8.2ft drop protection, 4x MIL-STD-810G or 6.6ft and 3x with a ring stand), Bounce (21.3ft drop protection, 6x MIL-STD-810G), Ultra Bounce (Bounce corners, 32.8 ft. drop protection, 10x MIL-STD-810G) and, for the 16 Pro and Pro Max, Ultra (Ultra Bounce corners, 32.8 ft. drop protection, 10x MIL-STD-810G, 6-layered rugged protection). The raised bezel to protect the screen can be either 1.4mm or 1.6mm, and the protective camera ring from 2mm to 3.8mm. The Impact Ring case features the tallest camera-protecting lip at 3.6mm, the biggest we’ve seen in our tests. You’ll find all the customization options direct from Casetify—see the links above. 3.

You could well end up buying more than one! Aside from the 95+ designs, you can choose between the Classic and Bold case models for each type of iPhone 16. The Classic Collection is lighter and more flexible with a glossy finish, while the Bold Collection is more protective and comes with a matte finish. The Bold models have ribbed sides, which adds real grip, making it less likely that you’ll drop your iPhone in the first place—but if you do there’s impressive 8-foot drop protection and a 3mm raised screen lip (only 1.3mm on the Classic), the highest we’ve tested. The camera edge could be a little higher, but we are big fans nonetheless. Casely adds small shipping fees if bought direct—these are calculated at final checkout. Uniquely Casely offers club membership where subscribers receive a new phone case every month, with exclusive members-only styles released each month. Users choose a style or Casely can send a surprise case. 4. dbrand Grip Case for iPhone 16 – Best grippy iPhone 16 case for cool designs Pros Many cool design options Camera Control cover Tactile grippy sides Price When Reviewed: $59.90 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price dbrand $59.90 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59.90 at dbrand MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 45g Raised edge: 1.5mm Camera edge: 0.5mm Button covers: Plastic Action button: Covered Camera Control: Covered Colors: Nearly 50 designs available Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16e | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max We love the drand Grip Case for several reasons. First, as the name suggests, it is supremely grippy but still slides from a pocket with ease. The sides feature gripped stripes on a textured frame and further ridged, easy-to-locate buttons. This should mean you are less likely to drop your iPhone unless you or someone else is really trying to make it happen. Second, the screen has a tapered edge, allowing for easy edge-swipes along the center of the display with just a 0.4mm raised lip but a much more protective 1.5mm lip on the top and bottom. The camera lenses are protected with a 0.50mm lip but also features a “hooded” design around the entire camera housing, tapering both the rubberized rim and the rigid frame of the case to protect the cameras. This symmetrical design ensures that the camera protrusions don’t rock back-and-forth while sitting flat on a table surface. Third, dbrand has now caught up with Apple and added a capacitive touch-enabled button with a built-in printed circuit board for localized touch actuation for the iPhone 16 family’s Camera Control. We expect more case manufacturers to add Camera Control buttons but dbrand should be congratulated as one of the first. Finally, we appreciate the wide range of techy and weird designs, from Area 51, X-Ray, Toxic Waste and Solar Flare among many others. 5.

We tested the Ostand 360° Spin Fusion MagSafe Case (also known as the Ostand Spin Flagship) on an iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max, but available for all models of the 16. The magnetic ring that gives it its name is embedded in the back. It can be extended out, tilted, and rotated through 360 degrees whereby it snaps neatly into place every quarter turn. The case is built with a conductive zinc alloy that Torras claims ensures uninterrupted MagSafe charging. It feels gorgeous and slides easily from a trouser pocket unlike stickier silicone cases. The frame of the case is subtly textured to make it more grippy to help you avoid drops. Torras makes an almost bewildering variants of the Ostand: the 360° Spin Fusion that we tested and a similar 360° Spin Stand (also known as the Ostand Spin Classic) that lacks some of the new styling, grip and protection but now offers a covered Camera Control button. The R Fusion has its hinge located within back compartment, allowing the full O-ring to rotate and hinge for different angles and offers a little more protection. You can also forgo the rotatable ‘O’ stand and choose either a more traditional ‘P’ stand of ‘L’ stand that flips out from the camera edge.

The standard Silicone Core range has the widest selection of colors, but the Silicone Stacks models include an attractive raised effect on the back that set them apart from other silicone cases. There’s a range of vibrant and cool colors. The Silicone Stacks model is available in the exquisitely named Tangerine Orange, Bubblegum Pink, Mist Green, Phantom Black, Stone Gray and Super Sonic Blue. The standard Silicone Core is in Air Blue, Blue Print, Jade Green, Lilac Purple, Popcorn Yellow, Phantom Black, Sandstone Pink and Stone Gray. On top of the color and back-effect choices the cases boast metal buttons and a lovely silky soft touch that will have you stroking the case like the seats of a new car. Drop resistance up to 1.2 meters is claimed, although we’d have preferred a little more screen and camera edge height. 7.

The slim, lightweight profile ensures a comfortable fit in your pocket or hand, while up to 93% post-consumer recycled materials underscores a commitment to sustainability Zagg’s London Snap range is covered with a fabric finish in a variety of playful designs, including a glow-in-the-dark Maze model.

We think this adds a certain gravity to the phone’s looks. Protection level is high without making the case too bulky and the reinforced AiroShock impact-absorbing corner bumps are reasonably subtle. It has rippled grip ribs and side eyelets for wrist straps and phone slings. There is also a range of Mous mounts for bikes, cars and motorbikes that work with the company’s Interlock Case. The screen and camera edge height is a little lower than on most cases. 9.

It has one of the widest ranges of iPhone 16 case models, and is favored by Apple as one of the few case manufacturers it allows to sell on its store. Here we highlight the Lumen and Figura case designs. The Lumen Case for iPhone 16 is sleek and minimalist with a clear, scratch-resistant case with fun pops of color, and textured side grips, as well as raised edges protect camera and screen. Like the Apple cases it keeps the Camera Control covered, with a conductive layer to communicate finger movements.The super-slim Figura Case features psychedelic patterns that are hydro-dipped by hand. The graphics envelop the case from edge to edge. The material is flexible with a soft touch. It now includes a limited edition case featuring a photo taken by NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope of The Lagoon Nebula, an interstellar cloud in the Sagittarius constellation. 10.

The plant-based phone cases are made from two commonly used biodegradable polymers. Known for its rigid and transparent properties PLA (Polylactic Acid) is derived from renewable resources such as wheat straw. PBAT (Polybutylene Adipate Terephthalate) is a biodegradable copolyester that offers flexibility and durability. Together they make an eco-friendly material that works well for phone protection. You can also add a recycled glass screen protector. Despite being plastic-free the smooth but grippy Wave cases have “been “military grade” (MIL-STD 810) drop protection, shock-absorbing corners and feature a generous protective 2mm lip around the screen and camera—one of the tallest we have seen. Not all sustainable products are boring—the Wave cases come in a wide range of bright colors and printed designs. The case material adds a natural fleck to the design. The standard and Etched case designs aren’t MagSafe compatible but will charge wirelessly. However, you can pay a little more for an integrated magnet that makes the case MagSafe compatible, which we would recommend. 11.

Now it’s owned by Apple and still makes some cool headphones, but its cases seem rather superfluous, offering little more than a glossy hardshell alternative to Apple’s much more fun but less protective Silicone iPhone 16 cases. It feels more like a colored version of the Apple Clear Case. They do boast much more interesting bold interior accent colors, but these would have been better on the outside surely. One benefit of being an Apple brand is that the Beats iPhone 16 cases also feature the sapphire crystal conductive layer that covers the Camera Control. 12. Latercase Thin Case for iPhone 16 – Thinnest, Lightest iPhone 16 case Pros No-bulk minimalism Thorough lens protection Cons Minimal screen edge Cutouts rather than buttons Price When Reviewed: $59 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $59 View Deal Later Case $59 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $59 at Amazon$59 at Later Case MagSafe compatible: Yes Weight: 11g Button covers: Cutout Action button: Cutout Camera Control: Cutout Colors: Black, Midnight, Coffee, Crimson, Willy Blue Available for: iPhone 16 | iPhone 16 Plus | iPhone 16e | iPhone 16 Pro | iPhone 16 Pro Max This is the lightest and thinnest case we have tested for the iPhone 16 family. The Atom Soft Snap, reviewed below, is equally thin but isn’t a classic case as it doesn’t have any side or screen protection. Weighing just 11g and measuring 0.6mm thin, the Latercase Thin Case is made with tough aramid fibers coated with a tactile slightly grippy matte finish. It is too thin to protect your phone from nasty falls—the screen edge is barely there—but it will certainly prevent scratches and resist small-scale knocks and bumps. This is a great case if you want to get some protection but with no discernible added bulk or weight. 13.

It’s more of a protective back plate. It maintains the thinness of the iPhone 16 by adding only protection and color to the phone’s back and camera lenses. The case pops on and off with a snap, as the name suggests, and its lack of bulk means it will slip into and out of your pocket with ease. While its lightweight minimalism will appeal to the slim and thin iPhone enthusiasts, it’s not for the cautious. There is no raised—or indeed any—front lip or side protection but the case is compatible with separate screen protectors. Soft Snap is made from 100% recycled post-consumer plastic with a soft touch coating, with an interior that is lined with recycled plush microfiber. Atom Studios also offers a more traditional but still eco-friendly iPhone 16 case: the dual-material Split Wood Fiber Case that is part aluminum and part eucalyptus oil-infused wood fiber. This case does offer solid 10-foot drop protection, with a 1mm raised edge—lower than on some cases but enough to save a screen from a small fall. The Camera Control is a cutout. Atom Best protective iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16e, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max A case isn’t there just to make your iPhone look pretty. The best cases offer reasonable protection while adding as little bulk as possible by using the latest, strongest materials. Kevlar is the material used to make bulletproof vests—it’s also known as Aramid Fiber. Graphene is even stronger. Zagg claims the graphene used in its Denali Snap case is “harder than a diamond, yet more elastic than rubber, and up to 200x stronger than steel”. That suggests a fall onto the pavement—or indeed off a cliff—might not be fatal for your phone. Some protective iPhone cases go full out and don’t care about their bulk as long as they protect your iPhone from the biggest disasters that can befall it. We’ve tested protective iPhone 16 cases from the thin to the very thick. 1.

This is down to its Graphene-infused back plate. Graphene is the strongest material known to man—supposedly up to 200x stronger than steel. The case’s border features TPU. The camera lip isn’t as high as on some cases but it should protect the lenses when the phone is placed or dropped down flat. Its rugged, textured finish adds a good grip, and when it’s not in your hand there’s an integrated metal kickstand that works in both landscape and portrait modes. It is constructed with up to 89% post-consumer recycled materials. Zagg has a wide range of iPhone 16 cases, and its SoHo Snap, in a range of two-tone colors depending on which country you are shopping from. U.S. customers have the widest choice including a fetching Currant color, although only U.K. buyers can get their hands on the light blue version. It gains protection points as it also features a graphene-infused backplate with 10ft (3m) drop protection. 2.

It’s a woven fiber, giving it a slightly textured grippy feel, to keep the iPhone from falling out of your hand in the first place. With some cases that sometimes leads to a struggle to pull it quickly from a pocket but we didn’t find this to be a problem with the Benks Kevlar cases. The metal frame on the back gives raised protection around the camera lenses—one of the best we’ve seen. The buttons on the sides are nicely solid in the TPU frame that offers superior shock resistance. It weighs 39g, which is light for a case offering such protection. Benks also sells a lighter ArmorAir model that has exposed buttons and no TPU frame. The ArmorPro can withstand a 6-foot drop; the ArmorAir just 4ft. Add a touch of personality with the Aurora ArmorAir Case that features stripes of color meant to resemble the etherial northern lights. The newer Benks Prestige ArmorPro Case has the same features plus a covered Camera Control. Both are MagSafe compatible, and priced the same—although there are slight price differences with the back pattern options. 3.

Plus, Pro and Pro Max. It looks the part, quite solid and slab-like but more flexible on the sides than the Rokform Rugged Case, see above. The integrated metal kickstand pulls out from the camera ring. It is constructed with a three-layer design (TPU soft shell, TPE hard shell, and shock-absorbing Poron lining) that ESR claims can withstand drops from as high as 23 feet. The 2.4mm raised edge is one of the highest we’ve tested. Unlike most macho protective cases, it’s available in a range of colors depending on the model of iPhone 16, including one in a fetching pink. 4.

If you drop it, Smartish claims its air-pocket corners can withstand a drop from 6 feet, which should account for most non-giant-related accidents. Slightly less grippy but still grippier than most cases, the Smartish Gripmunk case has the same textured sides for a firmer hold than you’ll get with a glossy case. What is extra special about these Smartish cases is the ability to personalize the case back with a photo and text. This is easy to create on the Smartish website, uploading images and typing text until you have your perfect combination given the options available. For the Gripzilla case you are limited to the black case color, but you get further color options with the Gripmunk. The company also sells an iPhone 16 case with a built-in wallet. The Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 can hold three credit or travel cards, and this part of the case can also work as a kickstand that lets you prop up your phone in landscape orientation. As with similar wallet cases, having the cards at the back of your phone case adds convenience but removes the wireless charging opportunity—for which you will need to remove your phone from the case. 5.

Not dropping the phone in the first place is better, that’s what. The Speck Presidio2 Grip MagSafe with ClickLock features no-slip inverted grips and tactile side ridges to create a strong grip. Should the phone slide from your hand anyway, the case provides 13-foot drop protection via its Armor Cloud technology that includes a perimeter lined with air capsules that compress and suspend the phone like an airbag. Note that we did find the case quite tricky to remove, so tight is it to the phone, but you shouldn’t need to take the phone out as it’s MagSafe friendly. Speck also sells iPhone 16 cases without the drips and in different colors. 6.

Don’t make the same mistake as me and try to force your iPhone directly into the case—first you need to deconstruct it and then build it around your phone. This might seem a pain, but you can see the level of protection you are building around your precious new phone. It features shock-absorbing corners that don’t stick out too much like on some ultra-protective cases. The final layer provides grippy sides and back to help prevent phone drops in the first place. One feature lacking from most cases is a protective port cover to stop fluff and other debris entering the USB-C opening. I’ve had to make a couple of trips to the Apple Store to remove dust and dirt that I couldn’t find myself, so appreciate this feature. OtterBox also offers a two-part Defender Pro XT that is slimmer but features most of the non-XT features. Both models can be bought with a free holster that clips to belts or bags and can double as a kickstand. 7.

Even the repulsive buttons are slanted unlike on any other manufacturer’s cases. You’ll find the same on Vena’s vCommute case with wallet. What distinguishes it from similar tough, cases such as the Rokform Rugged Case also reviewed here, is its detachable but sturdy Belt Clip Swivel Holster that can swivel 270 degrees. If you want to free the phone your pocket a belt clip can be a handy and practical solution. It can even be manipulated into a landscape or portrait kickstand. The holster can be placed over the iPhone screen or its back depending on your carrying needs. It is made with dual-layer polycarbonate and TPU with corner guards that Vena claims can survive drops from above 8 feet. The case wraps round the iPhone’s camera lenses, and there’s a cover for the USB-C port to stop debris entering the phone and derailing wired charging. The vArmor also beats the Rokform case with its support of MagSafe wireless charging. 8.

This is the phone case that Judge Dredd might carry in his holster. Like its clear-ish Crystal Case reviewed in our clear case section higher up, the Rugged Case features N52 Neodymium magnets that mean you can very securely clamp your encased iPhone onto any metal surface, plus Rokform’s RokLock twist-lock mounting system for twist-lock bike mounts, motorcycle mounts and car and golf-cart mounts. The impact-resistant polycarbonate protective shell features reinforced corners and extra camera protection that makes it a little chunkier than standard cases but reassuringly so, and not ridiculous. It is more rigid than the Zagg Denali Snap case, reviewed above, which also features a slightly more raised lip around the camera. In its current form it is sadly not compatible with MagSafe wireless charging, but a newer and slimmer version is in the works, promises the company. If wireless charging is something you require or desire while your iPhone 16 is still in the case, we’d recommend waiting for the upgraded version, which we will report here. The Camera Control is a cutout rather than a button, but the Action button is now covered. The buttons are plastic rather than the metal found on some other cases. Rokform claims the case can withstand drops of up to 6 feet (1.8m) due to its construction from a combination of high-impact polycarbonate and rugged TPU for impact resistance and cushioning. The Rugged Case comes in black only, while the Crystal Case will show off the iPhone’s true body color. 9.

Unlike many of the cases reviewed here it boasts metal side buttons, although the Camera Control is a cutout. As with the other Pitaka cases, it is constructed from robust aerospace-grade aramid fiber (aromatic polyamide) blended with shockproof TPU sides. This tough material resists scratches, abrasions and exposure to chemicals. An added benefit is that this weave gives the case textured patterns that stand out from the crowd. Inside it is lined with soft Nappa leather to provide cushioning for the back of the phone. It is also slim and lightweight unlike chunkier protective cases and slides in and out of a pocket with ease. At present, the Military-Grade Protective Case is available for the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max only. For all iPhone 16 models, the Pitaka Tactile Woven Case is thinner and even lighter (19.4g) and available in a series of woven designs, such as Sunset, Moonrise, Over The Horizon, and Milky Way Galaxy. There are also special versions, in collaboration with vintage fashion brand Aries, that incorporate Lumitex technology, which allows the case to self-illuminate in the dark after absorbing light energy. Designs include Alien, Credit Card, and NoProblemo. For the ultra-minimalist, the Pitaka Ultra Slim Case (18-35g) is available in Black/Grey, Forest Green, and Ocean Blue. Best leather iPhone cases for iPhone 16, 16e, 16 Plus, 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max Apple made a deliberate move away from leather with its accessories at the launch of the iPhone 15 and has stuck to its vegan ways with the iPhone 16. Apple’s alternative was a micro twill called FineWoven—however, customers were quick to complain that it easily picked up stains from just about anything it come into contact with, and the company has rightly abandoned it for its new iPhone. If you want a leather alternative we recommend the vegan leather MOFT MOVAS case, reviewed below. But if you are happier with the real animal skin thing, there are some great leather cases to choose from, as you’ll find by reading on. 1.

It has four different cases available for the iPhone 16, three of them are crafted from premium leather and a new Eager to win some green points, the company points out that sustainable “DriTan water-free leather tanning” is involved—this uses the moisture already present in the hides. The buttons, camera bump, microfiber lining, and polycarbonate inner shell are made from recycled plastic. All the cases feature machined-metal buttons, 1mm raised bezel and a metal rear camera bump for superior protection. If you want a leather iPhone case with some extra benefits, the Mujjo Full Leather Wallet Case (for iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max) turns your iPhone into a physical as well as digital wallet. The leather card pocket can hold two or three bank, ID or travel cards. Note that the cards must be removed for wireless charging—even with cards removed, the magnetic connection is not as strong as with the cases that don’t include a wallet at the back, although it does still work with MagSafe chargers. To be fair, the same is true for all wallet-cases we tested. Available in Dark Tan, Black, or Monaco Blue. The Mujjo Full Leather Case (all models except the 16 Plus) is a more classic leather case without the wallet at the back, with a machined-metal rear camera bump that protects lenses. It’s available in a range of colors depending on the iPhone model. If you agree with Apple that leather is not for you, the Mujjo Maizcase is made with an Italian bio-leather, created with a blend of corn and other cereals and recycled polyester. It’s available in Steel Blue only. The Mujjo iPhone 16 Pro Shield Case (for iPhone 16 Pro and 16 Pro Max) is designed to be super protective, as the name suggests, and is available for the two Pro models of the 16. Mujjo claims that drop protection is rated to 15 feet (5m), and it features an “ImpactCore internal bumper”. Take your choice of colors from Black or Steel Blue. 2.

You’ll find them in our roundups of the best laptop sleeves and in previous collections of the best iPhone cases. Woolnut hasn’t moved far with its Leather Case for iPhone 16, which looks much like the same for all the other iPhones since the 12. And why stray from a classic case? The full-grain leather cover the slim polycarbonate and TPU frame is from Scandinavia, of course, and the interior features soft microfiber. The buttons are made from aluminum, not plastic as used on most cases. The tapered cutout for Camera Control feels sensuous on the finger. Altogether a lovely, understated case. 3.

Each of these iPhone 16 cases are MagSafe compatible and feature a robust 360-degree TPE bumper and 1mm raised ridge above the screen and camera lenses—with 5-foot drop protection. Uniquely, the company can personalize the case with a hand-debossing service that stamps your initials deeply into the leather’s surface. 4.

The Snap Case is made from MOFT’s own MOVAS-P, a four-layer soft-touch vegan leather that the company claims is non-fading and fingerprint, scratch and stain resistant.

The raised front edge is 1.3mm, offering excellent screen protection, and the camera cutout is elevated by 1mm. There is a special version that is compatible with a Phone Lanyard for hands-free use, priced separately at $29.99. Best iPhone 16 cases with wallet There are several great choices for iPhone 16 cases that feature built-in wallets. Scan the reviews above for some examples, such as: Mujjo Full Leather Wallet Case – beautiful design and stylish wallet Smartish Wallet Slayer Vol. 2 – Practical three-card wallet Some include wallets that attach to the case magnetically and other have the wallet built in. Note that built-in wallets usually affect wireless charging, especially with cards inside. You’d need to remove the Smartish Wallet Slayer case to use wireless charging, for example. 1.

In the standard Vena vCommute up to three cards can be stored inside the case, covered with a classy leather folding door that can also be used as a landscape kickstand. Cards feel more secure here than sticking out of the back of the case or stored in a separate accessory that magnetically clamps to the back of the phone. The downside is that the standard version is not MagSafe compatible for wireless charging, even with the cards removed. Hence the vCommute with a removable MagSafe-compatible wallet. Detach the wallet part and you can wirelessly charge the phone within the case. Just don’t forget to re-attach the wallet when you get up to leave your wireless charger! 2.

The Decoded Leather Detachable Wallet Case is more flexible. It’s actually two cases in one as the standard case magnetically clamps onto a full-grain Ecco leather fold-out wraparound that features the wallet card slots behind the front panel. The detachable wallet includes three card slots, plus storage for banknotes. This front part offers double protection for the screen aside from the raised edge found on the case. There’s further magnetic magic on the folding closure. The case promises 1.2m drop protection, and the button covers are metal for further robustness and precise control. The whole package is surprisingly slim for a full wraparound wallet. You could place the bare phone straight onto the wraparound cover, but you’d lose the 360-degree protection should the phone be dropped. Decoded also offers a more traditional one-piece Leather Case, without the wallet wraparound part. 3.

Stuffed full the Flex Pouch might just about fit in a coat pocket. Even if you just want to store a few cards, we found the Flex Pouch a tight hold. It is slightly wider at the top and tighter on the bottom. Once emptied, it pings back to its original flat form. With an AirPods case inside, you can use the case as a landscape stand. The case itself feels robust and is available in three colors. Each of these can then have either an opaque or similarly colored pouch on the back.

The two brown versions (dark ganache and tan Sienna) feature natty bold colors on the inside. There are various color options depending on your iPhone 16 model and wallet case choice. If you want to add just a separate magnetic wallet to your phone without the case, or with a different case, consider the Mujjo Full leather Magnetic Wallet for iPhone.

Best iPhone case with built-in keyboard One of the joys of a smartphone is its lack of physical keyboard, which is why BlackBerry no longer makes phones. But … but… there are some benefits of ditching the virtual keyboard and freeing up valuable screen space after all. 1.

Actually, it’s not as mad as it sounds. Not using the screen keyboard can give you back nearly half your usable screen, and it allows navigation within and between apps with fewer swipes and taps by turning each of its 37 keys into customizable action buttons for over 100 shortcuts, leveraging iOS’s native Shortcuts app and accessibility settings that are otherwise inaccessible to iPhone users.

You can even create an Android-like Back button. Additionally, the shortcuts can unlock advanced automations such as calling Uber, emailing meeting updates, and controlling smart home devices. The Clicks version for iPhone 16 lacks some of the iPhone 15 Clicks crazy colors, but the new ochre color is still quite out there.

Wearing your phone hanging from a lanyard can free up your hands while keeping the phone close for easy access. The chunkiest lanyard option comes with the most protective case, the $79 Odyssey Ultra Case—clearly the choice of Odysseus on his adventures. The case features interchangeable corners so you can replace the lanyard hooks with reinforced shockproof corners if you need protection rather than a neck-based strap. The 25mm Fidlock Utility Strap is not dainty in the least. This case has a central. ring stand that can rotate 360 degrees for precise adjustments in wither landscape and portrait orientation. It is U.S. military drop-test certified, providing protection from drops as high as 25 feet.

Coming with an adjustable leather strap, it can be worn over the shoulder or as a cross-body. Its zinc alloy clasp is well placed so that it doesn’t obstruct the camera lenses. Mageasy also offers a robust $39 MagStand 360 M with Rotating Ring Holder Protective Case, which doesn’t boast the lanyard option but is a solid and well-built clear iPhone 16 case with the same 360-degree ring stand as the Odyssey Ultra but with a lesser (but still impressive) 16-foot drop protection. 2.

The BodyGuardz Paradigm Pro case, available for iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max, makes heat dissipation one of its core strengths with both a wrist strap and air vents along both sides. The company names this system of vents “EnduraCore technology”, and it’s a clever move to both improve the iPhone’s temperature and distinguish it from other cases. For non-Pro owners, there’s the BodyGuardz Ace Pro, which also comes with a detachable wrist strap but not the air vents. You do get a Black Leopard spot pattern, though. Both cases promise 18-foot drop protection and shock-absorbing corners. The wrist strap might deter pickpockets and other phone thieves, preventing speedy snatches out of your grasp.

Inside, with a light diamond-patterned lining, there’s a side pocket that is foam-padded to cradle the iPhone, and two stretch pockets for your AirPods or whatever small items you don’t want to keep in your pockets. There’s even space in the central compartment for a slim 16oz water bottle, as well as keys. At the back you’ll find (but thieves won’t see) a zippered pocket that’s perfect for cash or a passport.

We have to trust the manufacturer’s claims on this but we did examine the raised screen and camera edges for robustness.",

A deeply discounted MacBook Pro Not only is this 13.3″ MacBook Pro available at an incredible price — it’s got a Touch Bar!
