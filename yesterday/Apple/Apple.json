    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2820280/shocking-security-breach-of-16-billion-logins-includes-apple-ids.html",
    "description": "Macworld Cybernews reported on Wednesday on its research that resulted in the online discovery of 30 datasets that include 16 billion records of user login information for “pretty much any online service imaginable,” including Apple, Facebook, and Google. The records include a URL and login information. Since this data is what is often collected by malware, it appears that these records are a result of numerous infostealer attacks. Cybernews states that the datasets do include overlapping records, but the enormity of the data collection makes it difficult to compare individual records in order to conclude how many users have been exposed. The exposed datasets have not been previously reported, except for one discovered by Jeremiah Fowler that had 185 million unique usernames and passwords. The datasets are also made available temporarily and are taken down after some time. Cybernews states that new databases appear “every few weeks” with “fresh, weaponizable intelligence.” It is also not clear as to the origins of the datasets and who is behind the data collection. How to protect yourself To protect yourself from malware, avoid downloading software from repositories such as GitHub and other download sites. Apple has vetted software in the Mac App Store and it is the safest way to get apps. If you prefer not to patronize the Mac App Store, then buy software directly from the developer and their website. If you insist on using cracked software, you will always risk malware exposure. Never open links in emails or texts you receive from unknown and unexpected sources. If you get a message that looks like it is from an entity that you do business with, check the sender’s email address and inspect the URL carefully. If you see a link or button, you can Control-click it, select Copy Link, and then paste it into a text editor to see the actual URL and check it. Phishing attacks often involve a user inadvertently visiting a website with a mistyped URL. So, verify the URL you have typed into your browser. Bookmark the sites you visit frequently so you don’t have to type in the URL every time. In some instances, you can use a search engine; type the name of the place you want to visit, and then click on the link after looking at the URL it goes to. For example, type “Macworld” into the search engine you use, and then click on the link that’s designated at www.macworld.com. This way isn’t as efficient, but if you make a typo, you’ll see it in the search and the search engine will steer you in the right direction. In an instance where you believe your data was exposed in a data breach, there are a few steps to take to protect yourself: If you continue to use the service that was breached, change your password and enable two-factor verification. Check your credit report and freeze it. This will help block unauthorized approvals to financial services that are being made in your name. If you need to sign up for a service (such as a loan or credit card), you can temporarily unfreeze your account so a credit check can be performed. Check your records for all of your financial institutions. If you access them online, change your passwords and enable two-factor verification. Some institutions also provide alerts when attempts are made to access your account. Use a service such as Have I Benn Pwned to see if your email address was involved in a data breach. Apple releases security patches through OS updates, so installing them as soon as possible is important. It’s also important to update the apps on your Mac, which you can do through the App Store or the app’s settings. Macworld has several guides to help, including a guide on whether or not you need antivirus software, a list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans, and a comparison of Mac security software.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2816608/hate-liquid-glass-youll-still-love-how-ios-26-supercharges-your-favorite-apps.html",
    "description": "Macworld iOS 26 is finally here – well, at least its first developer beta. As shown by Apple at the WWDC keynote last week, the update brings a bunch of improvements to the iPhone’s operating system. There are more customization options for iMessages, real-time translation for phone calls, and of course, the new Liquid Glass interface. But iOS 26 also introduces many new under-the-hood technologies that will help developers supercharge their favorite apps once the update arrives on your phone this fall. Here are five ways your apps will get even more capabilities in iOS 26: Frequent fliers With iOS 26, Apple has unveiled some great updates for the Wallet app. For example, tickets have been redesigned so that they can display even more information about an event. But there’s a new feature designed specifically for airline apps. Thanks to a new API available to developers, airlines will be able to show details of their services included in the customer’s fare and even provide upgrade options, all directly from the Wallet app on the iPhone. As an example, an airline ticket in the Wallet app can now show whether you have priority boarding or a checked baggage allowance. And if you want an upgrade, you’ll be able to get it with just a tap. In addition, with the user’s permission, airline apps can automatically add a ticket to the Wallet app as soon as you check in with no need to open the app and tap the “Add to Apple Wallet” button. Upgraded tickets in the iOS 26 Wallet app will also provide real-time flight tracking information, and you can share the tracking with your friends or family. iOS 16 will make your boarding passes and flight tracking much snazzier.Apple Gamers unite! For gamers, iOS 26 introduces several new technologies that will improve performance and the overall experience on your iPhone. One of these improvements relates to touch controls within games. Currently, developers working on an iPhone or iPad game that requires more advanced controls have to design their own touch controls. This leads to a certain inconsistency, as each game has different controls. Not to mention that it makes the developer’s job more difficult. In iOS 26, Apple now provides its own touch controls for buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, throttles, and touchpads. This not only makes it much easier for developers to implement but also ensures a better experience for players. The controls can be customized for each game, but will still be based on Apple technologies for better response. And with the new Games app, which comes pre-installed on iOS 26, developers can implement specific Challenges and Activities so that players can invite their friends to play along. And finally, Metal 4 brings next-level gaming on Apple silicon devices. Sound the alarm Also with iOS 26, developers finally have the ability to implement alarms in their apps. Currently, apps are limited to sending you regular notifications in most cases, but now they will also be able to provide full-screen alarms, similar to the iPhone’s native alarm. That means your favorite recipe app will now be able to set an alarm for you without you having to open the Clock app. Developers can implement their own interface for the alarm and set different options for countdown and snooze functionality as well as live activity on the Lock Screen. Alarms are everywhere in iOS 26—and that’s a great thing.Apple Bye-bye passwords Apple joined the FIDO Alliance back in 2020, along with other companies such as Google and 1Password, to work on passkeys, an authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with security keys and biometrics. Many apps and websites already provide support for passkeys, and with iOS 26, Apple is introducing many improvements that will make adopting passkeys even easier. With the update, iPhone and iPad apps can let users create a new passkey account with just a tap. The feature not only generates a passkey but also pre-fills your personal data, such as name and email, so you no longer have to waste time filling in long sign-up forms. Passkeys can be authenticated with Face ID or Touch ID, and credentials are synchronized between all your Apple devices via iCloud. Double up One of the main complaints about iOS is how it limits background activities. As a way of saving battery and hardware resources, Apple has only let apps run certain activities in the background, such as GPS and audio. Because of this, users must keep an app open when they’re doing something important, such as uploading files or exporting a video. Thankfully, this has changed with iOS 26 thanks to a new API for running tasks in the background. Developers can implement this API in their apps so that tasks that take longer can run in the background, meaning that users can switch to other apps without interrupting the previous task. Imagine being able to use other apps while exporting a video in Final Cut for iPad or uploading your photos to Google Photos in the background. That’s exactly what will happen once third-party apps are updated with this technology. You’ll finally be able to do two things at once on your iPhone and iPad.Apple And much more There are many other new APIs coming with iOS 26, and they open up a whole new world of possibilities for developers. However, one thing you need to keep in mind is that each app needs to be updated to take advantage of these new technologies. In other words, don’t expect to see apps with these features before iOS 26 is released to the public in September. For now, iOS 26 is only available as a developer beta. Apple says a public beta will be available in July and the full release will arrive this fall. The update is compatible with iPhone 11 and later.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
