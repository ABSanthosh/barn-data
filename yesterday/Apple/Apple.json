    "description": "Behavioral information from an Apple Watch, such as physical activity, cardiovascular fitness, and mobility metrics, may be more useful for determining a person's health state than just raw sensor data, according to a new scientific study.A new scientific study uses behavior information derived from Apple Watch sensor data for health predicitons.Over the years, Apple has collaborated with medical researchers on a variety of issues, ranging from menstrual cycles and even pickleball, to hearing loss and sleep tracking. The iPhone maker has also examined the training and cardio exercises that marathon runners do, as part of a multi-year Heart and Movement Study that used the Apple Watch.The Heart and Movement Study is part of a broader initiative to promote healthy movement and enhance cardiovascular health. Now, another Apple-sponsored research paper, which relies on data from the Heart and Movement Study, explains how behavior data can often serve as a more significant health indicator relative to conventional biometric data obtained through hardware sensors.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2845725/apples-packed-spring-2026-release-lineup.html",
    "description": "Macworld A new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman details Apple’s current release plans for the first half of 2026. Much of it was already expected, but the biggest scoop is that Apple is considering delaying the new M5 MacBook Pros—originally slated to be released this fall—until early next year. This fall still looks pretty full. We’ll have the new iPhone 17 lineup, including a new super-thin iPhone 17 Air, updated Apple Watches, new iPad Pro models, and perhaps an updated version of the Vision Pro headset and A18 Pro-powered MacBook. New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models were set to be released this fall, but Apple may release them early in 2026. “The timing remains fluid,” Gurman notes. While nearly all the Apple Silicon MacBook Pros have been released in October or November, the M2 MacBook Pro was released in January of 2023, so this new timing is not unprecedented. Update MacBook Air laptops are also still expected to launch in the spring. Later in the spring, they’ll be joined by an iPhone 17e, which is similar in scope to the iPhone 16e released this year, and a new entry-level iPad and iPad Air. The iPads and MacBooks are what are dubbed “chip and ship” models—there aren’t any major new features expected, just upgraded processors. Apple is also expected to release its first external Mac monitor since the Studio Display was released in 2022. Not much is known about the new display’s specs, other than that it is expected to remain at a 27-inch size. The current Studio Display is missing several higher-end features, including ProMotion and HDR. Apple is still working on its affordable smart home hub product, which was supposed to be released this spring but was delayed due to its reliance on new Siri features and upgrades that have fallen far behind schedule. This device, which some call the “HomePad,” is now expected to launch in the first half of 2026. So, according to Gurman, Apple’s release lineup for the first half of 2026 includes these products: M5 MacBook Pro New Studio Display iPhone 17e iPad update iPad Air update M5 MacBook Air Smart Home hub",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
