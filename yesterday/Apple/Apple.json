    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Apple Arcade FAQ: Only two new games in March 2025",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/232599/apple-arcade-faq-list-of-games-price-compatibility-coming-soon.html",
    "description": "Macworld Gaming subscription services are all the rage now, but Apple Arcade isn‚Äôt a little different from the likes of PlayStation Plus, EA Play, or Xbox Game Pass. If you‚Äôve got questions about it, we‚Äôve got plenty of answers. Updated February 26, 2025: Only two games are scheduled to be released in March. On March 6 we‚Äôll get Crazy Eights: Card Games+ and Piano Tiles2+. What is Apple Arcade? Apple Arcade is a gaming subscription service for iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AppleTV that features several hundred games. The games are a mix of genres and styles, and include original games you‚Äôll only find on the service and others that can be found on the regular App Store or even other platforms. Apple Arcade isn‚Äôt a streaming service like Xbox Live Cloud Gaming or GeForce NOW. Games must be downloaded onto your device in order to be played. What do I need to run it? Apple Arcade was made available as part of iOS 13, iPad OS 13, tvOS 13, and macOS Catalina or later. Some of the more visually-intensive games may only run well on newer hardware, though, and some Mac games require macOS 11 (Big Sur). How much does Apple Arcade cost? Apple Arcade costs $6.99/¬£6.99 per month, and you‚Äôll also get a one-month free trial or you can get three months free if you purchase a new iPhone, iPad, Apple TV or Mac. To claim your free trial click here. You can get Apple Arcade for less than $6.99 a month if you subscribe for a year upfront. A year of Apple Arcade is $49.99/¬£49.99 (so $4.16 a month). If you‚Äôre currently on the $6.99 month-to-month plan and want to switch to the annual plan and save some money, you can do so on your¬†iPhone or iPad. Open the App Store app, then tap your account icon in the upper right. Tap Subscriptions, then tap the entry for Apple Arcade. Here, you can switch to the annual plan. Apple Arcade is also included in the Apple One subscription bundles, which range from $20 a month to $38 a month and include access to Apple Music and Apple TV and iCloud storage. There is also a month free trial of Apple One. To claim the trial, or sign up for Apple One, click here. How do I sign up for Apple Arcade? There isn‚Äôt an Apple Arcade app‚Äîit‚Äôs built into the App Store. On your iPhone, iPad, or Mac open the App Store and look for the Apple Arcade tab at the bottom of the screen (or in the left column on macOS). A sign-up screen with a Try It Free button will appear. After the trial you‚Äôll be charged either the monthly or annual fee, depending on your selection. When subscribing, you‚Äôll need to enter your Apple ID password or use Touch ID or Face ID to sign in, and you‚Äôll have to confirm your subscription purchase a few times. Once you‚Äôre done with the sign up, the Arcade section of the App Store shows what games are available to you. To access a game, tap on it in the App Store, then tap the Get button. When the game is done installing on your device, the Get button turns into a Play button, and you can tap it to launch the game. The game app icon will also appear on your device‚Äôs Home page. On the Apple TV, there actually is an Arcade app. Open that to see the sign-up offer. You‚Äôll also find an Arcade tab within the App Store. Does my subscription include family sharing? Yes. One $6.99 per month subscription can be shared between up to six people (including you). How do I cancel Apple Arcade? First off, keep in mind that if you cancel Apple Arcade (either before your free trial is up or after subscribing), you won‚Äôt be able to keep playing the games unless you re-subscribe. If you‚Äôre okay with that, you can use the same process you use to cancel any other subscription service. Here‚Äôs the easiest way to do it on the iPhone and iPad: Open the App Store app and tap on your profile photo in the upper right. In the screen that pops up, press Subscriptions near the top of the page. You‚Äôll then see a list of active subscriptions, and Apple Arcade should be listed there. Tap it. You‚Äôll either see Cancel Free Trial or Cancel Subscription toward the middle of the page that appears. Tap whatever option is available, then Confirm Cancellation. And here‚Äôs how to cancel Apple Arcade on the Mac: Open the App Store app and then press the icon with your profile photo in the lower left. The Account window will appear, and you should then click View Information at the top of the window. Enter your password when/if prompted. When your Account Information appears, scroll down to the Manage section and click the Manage link to the right of Subscriptions. When the list of your active subscriptions appears, click Edit to the right of Apple Arcade. Toward the middle of the page that appears, you‚Äôll see a button that says either Cancel Free Trial or Cancel Subscription. Click it, then click Confirm Cancellation and Confirm. Do Apple Arcade games have in-app purchases? No. In Apple‚Äôs words, ‚Äúsince every game includes access to the full experience, including all game features, content, and future updates, no additional purchases will be required.‚Äù Even games that have in-app purchases on the App Store won‚Äôt have any in Apple Arcade. Do Apple Arcade games have ads? Also no. On a related note, Apple says Apple Arcade has no ad tracking. Is Apple Arcade a game streaming service like GeForce NOW or Xbox Game Streaming? No. All Apple Arcade are downloaded. Are there demos for Apple Arcade games? No, and they‚Äôre not really necessary. Like App Store apps, games download quickly and can easily be removed if you don‚Äôt want to keep it anymore. Apple partly envisions Apple Arcade as a way of letting players try out games with more freedom than the App Store currently allows (which is basically none). In Apple‚Äôs words, ‚Äúrather than pay upfront for each game, a subscription to Apple Arcade will give players the opportunity to try any game in the service without risk.‚Äù The service has a free trial, though, as we‚Äôve seen with other Apple subscription services. Am I able to keep playing Apple Arcade games if I cancel my subscription? No. As with most subscription services, you only have access while you‚Äôre a subscriber. Can I use controllers with Apple Arcade games? Yes. In additional to traditional MFi (Made for iOS) controllers, you can pair some specific Bluetooth controllers for either PlayStation or Xbox with either your iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV. Since many Apple Arcade games are playable on Mac and Apple TV (where controller support is more common), many games will support them. Some games, especially those that are also available in the broader App Store and only for iPhone or iPad, have no controller support. Recently Apple relaxed the requirements for MFi controller certification, which may have grown out of the Apple Arcade negotiations. How often are new games released? Games are typically released on the first Friday of each month. There are some rare exceptions. What games have been released so far?

    "title": "Mac security researchers expose two new exploits",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2620602/mac-security-researchers-expose-two-new-exploits.html",
    "description": "Macworld Two new Mac exploits discovered recently are good reminders of best practices for staying safe, such as not letting strangers access your computer, staying up to date with software updates, and getting your software from known trusted sources. The first exploit involves Parallels, the virtual machine that allows the Mac to run Windows, Linux, and older versions of macOS. The vulnerability is on Intel Macs running Parallels and allows an attacker to gain root access by exploiting holes in the Parallels VM creation routine. The attacker needs to have access to the Mac to perform this, however. Researcher Mickey Jin decided to post about the vulnerability that was reported to Parallels seven months ago, in an attempt to get the company to issue a fix. Parallels has posted a knowledgebase article about the flaw, stating that Parallels Desktop 20.2.2 and Parallels Desktop 19.4.2, which will include fixes, will be issued within this week. Apple silicon Macs are not affected. The other new exploit, reported by security firm Proofpoint, involves a new malware called FrigidStealer. The attack occurs when a user gets an email containing a URL, and when the user opens it, a webpage launches with an alert stating that the browser needs to be updated. When the Update button is clicked, an installer is saved to the Mac, and the user is instructed to open it by Control-clicking on the app icon and selecting Open from the pop-up menu. Opening the file this way bypasses Gatekeeper, macOS‚Äôs built-in security that checks for malicious apps. This then installs the malware. The FrigidStealer malware attacks have been targeting users outside of North America. If installed, it records information and files related to passwords, browser cookie data, and anything created in Apple Notes. How to protect yourself The easiest way to protect yourself from malware is to avoid downloading software from repositories such as GitHub and other download sites. Apple has vetted software in the Mac App Store and is the safest way to get apps. If you prefer not to patronize the Mac App Store, then buy software directly from the developer and their website. If you insist on using cracked software, you will always risk malware exposure. Never open links in emails or texts you receive from unknown and unexpected sources. If you get a message that looks like it is from an entity that you do business with, check the sender‚Äôs email address, and inspect the URL carefully. If you see a link or button, you can Control-click it, select Copy Link, and then paste it into a text editor to see the actual URL and check it. Apple releases security patches through OS updates, so installing them as soon as possible is important. It‚Äôs also important to update the apps on your Mac, which you can do through the App Store or through the app‚Äôs settings. Macworld has several guides to help, including a guide on¬†whether or not you need antivirus software, a¬†list of Mac viruses, malware, and trojans, and a¬†comparison of Mac security software.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
