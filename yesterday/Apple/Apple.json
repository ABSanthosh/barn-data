    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/667144/macbook-air-or-macbook-pro.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple currently sells two laptop lines: the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. The MacBook Pro comes with a 14-inch or 16-inch display and the MacBook Air has either a 13.6-inch or a 15-inch display. And among those models are an even wider range of specs. In this article, we are concerned with the Mac laptops best suited to average use: home, student, and office work. There are 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by M4 Pro or M4 Max chips that are better suited to pro users and have much higher prices, and they aren’t included here. But if you are thinking your needs might extend a little further on the pro side, you may be interested to read Which MacBook Pro or our guide to all of Apple’s laptops. We’ll be considering the following similarly specced Mac laptops: 13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2 (launched July 2022, memory update October 2024) 13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3 (launched March 2024, memory update October 2024) 14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (launched October 2024) 15-inch MacBook Air, M3 (launched March 2024, memory update October 2024) For advice about the best MacBook, we also have a buying guide, see: Best MacBook: Which Mac laptop is best? We also offer advice about how much storage, RAM and cores in How much MacBook RAM, SSD, Cores do you need? Off to university? Read our guide to the best MacBook for students. Want a Black Friday deal? See: Best MacBook deals this Black Friday. MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro compared Here are the four Mac laptops that have our attention. We will compare design, specs, displays, price and other features below. 1. Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (M2, 2022) Price When Reviewed: $999 Best Prices Today: $749 at Amazon$749 at Best Buy$899 at B\u0026H The cheapest Mac laptop. The M2 version of the MacBook Air was introduced in 2022. In October 2024 Apple increased the standard amount of Unified Memory (RAM) to 16GB without increasing the cost. It’s the cheapest Mac laptop, but we think you should spend $100/£100 more to get the newer model which has a faster chip. 2. Apple 13-inch MacBook Air (M3, 2024) Price When Reviewed: $1,099 Best Prices Today: $844 at Amazon$849 at Best Buy$999 at B\u0026H The M3 version of the MacBook Air was introduced in March 2024. In October 2024 Apple increased the standard amount of Unified Memory (RAM) to 16GB without increasing the cost. It’s great news that Apple has increased the RAM without increasing the price as we did feel that 8GB was insufficient. It’s a great Mac laptop, the only reason not to buy one right now is that Apple will probably be updating it in spring 2025. Read: M4 MacBook Air: Everything you need to know. 3. Apple 15-Inch MacBook Air (M3, 2024) Price When Reviewed: $1,299 Best Prices Today: $1,044 at Amazon$1044 at Best Buy$1199 at B\u0026H The 15-inch M3 MacBook Air was introduced in March 2024. There is no longer a 15-inch version of the M2 MacBook Air, so if you want the larger display this is the one to buy. In October 2024 Apple increased the standard amount of Unified Memory (RAM) to 16GB without increasing the cost. As with the 13-inch MacBook Air, the only reason not to buy one is that Apple may be updating it soon, but if you can’t wait we don’t think you will be disappointed. 4. Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4, 2024) Price When Reviewed: $1,599 | $1,799 | $1,999 Best Prices Today: $1,399 at Amazon$1399 at Best Buy$1474 at Walmart Electronics The M4 MacBook Pro arrived in October 2024. It has more powerful siblings in the M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro, but for those with average requirements, it’s sufficient and better suited to more intensive operations than the MacBook Air. This is a Mac to choose if you need a little more oomph than the MacBook Air can give but don’t have the money for a MacBook Pro with M4 Pro chip. Read our full Apple 14-inch MacBook Pro (M4) review MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Design The design of the MacBook Air hasn’t changed since Apple revealed it in June 2022 and you could have been forgiven for thinking you were looking at a MacBook Pro. Gone is the tapered edge for which the Air was famous, replaced with a more uniform design. The MacBook Air is still thinner–albeit fractionally–but it is also very slightly larger than the old version of the Air, thanks to the bigger screen. Looking at the screen you will notice the other glaring difference in the new design: the MacBook Air has a notch like the one that’s also seen on the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro and iPhones. This enables the bigger screen and conceals a much better FaceTime camera, so it’s not a bad thing, although some people don’t like notches. If you miss that tapered design that made the MacBook Air instantly identifiable it is still available if you buy the M1 version of the MacBook Air. Apple no longer sells this model as a new laptop, but limited M1 MacBook Air inventory may be available in the Apple Certified Refurbished Store and you may still be able to pick one up from a third party–see our round-up of the Best MacBook Air deals. If a 13.6-inch screen isn’t big enough for you, Apple added a 15.3-inch MacBook Air to the lineup in June 2023. This larger model looks identical to the 13.6-inch MacBook Air, and shares (mostly) the same specs, it’s just bigger. 15-inch MacBook Air (left) and 14-inch MacBook Pro (right).Foundry The 14-inch MacBook Pro is a bit chunkier and heavier than the 15-inch MacBook Air due to the fans needed for heat dissipation, while the Air is, unsurprisingly, wider and taller, thanks to the bigger display. Both models have a Touch ID sensor built into the keyboard, and six-speaker arrays (the 13-inch Air only has a four-speaker sound system). The sound on the MacBook Pro is described by Apple as “High Fidelity,” by which we assume Apple is indicating it is superior to the Air. Connectivity for both models is via Bluetooth 5.3 and Wi-Fi 6E. With the October 2024 MacBook Pro update to the M4 chip, the 14-inch MacBook Pro now has a 12-megapixel camera with support for Center Stage and Desk View. The MacBook Air still has the 1080p FaceTime HD camera. The MacBook Pro camera is much better, in case you’re concerned with quality for video conferences. Another difference between these MacBooks is the color choices. There are four color choices for the 13-inch MacBook Air and the 15-inch MacBook Air: Midnight (dark blue), Starlight (gold), Space Gray and Silver. The Starlight shade is paler gold, while Midnight is close to black with a dark blue hue. The 14-inch MacBook Pro with M4 offers only Silver and Space Black options. There are four different color options for the MacBook Air.Apple MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Dimensions The 13-inch MacBook Air is lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro, as you’d expect, but the 15-inch MacBook Air is also lighter than the 14-inch MacBook Pro. 14-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 3.4 pounds (1.55 kg) 15-inch MacBook Air, M3: 3.3 pounds (1.51 kg) 13-inch MacBook Air, M3: 2.7 pounds (1.24 kg) The MacBook Air is thinner than the MacBook Pro. Apple The 15-inch MacBook Air is the largest of the M3 laptops, but because it’s thinner, it weighs less than the Pro. The 13-inch MacBook Air dimensions aren’t much smaller than those of the 14-inch MacBook Air. 15-inch MacBook Air, M3: 13.40 x 9.35 x 0.45 inches (34.04 x 23.76 x 1.15cm) 14-inch MacBook Pro, M4: 12.31 x 8.71 x 0.61 inches (31.26cm x 22.12cm x 1.55cm) 13-inch MacBook Air, M3: 11.97 x 8.46 x 0.44 inches (30.41 x 21.5 x 1.13cm) MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Display Here are the specs at a glance: 13-inch MacBook Air M3: 13.6 inches diagonal, 2,560 by 1,664 pixels 14-inch MacBook Pro M4: 14.2 inches diagonal, 3,024 by 1,964 pixels 15-inch MacBook Air M3: 15.3 inches diagonal, 2,880 by 1,864 pixels The MacBook Air has either a 15.3-inch or a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display. The MacBook Pro comes with a superior 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR panel. The screen on the Air is a bit bigger, but the image quality is not as good as the screen on the MacBook Pro–it still looks great, though. The 15-inch Air’s display runs at a resolution of 2,880 by 1,864, while the 13-inch offers 2,560 by 1,664. Both Airs have a maximum brightness of 500 nits, which is half of the Pro’s 1,000 nits in normal use, or a third if you’re running HDR content at a max of 1,600 nits. This is achieved by the Pro display incorporating mini-LEDs rather than the Air’s standard LCD screen. Perhaps the biggest difference though is that the Pro features ProMotion, meaning that the refresh rate tops out at 120Hz, again double that of the Air’s 60Hz refresh rate. This helps keep scrolling and animations smooth and crisp. Any of these displays will be great for everyday use and long hours of work, but the Pro has the edge when it comes to features. With the M4 MacBook Pro, Apple introduced a nano-texture glass option that has a matte-like finish for $150. This option is not available on the MacBook Air, and if you need to cut down the glare from the display, it’s a feature to consider. 15-inch MacBook Air (left) and 14-inch MacBook Pro 2023.Foundry MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Specs All of Apple’s laptops are powered by Apple’s silicon. Amidst the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro offerings are two generations of chip: the M2 in the $999 13.6-inch MacBook Air, an M3 in the 13.6-inch and 15-inch Air models, and an M4 in the 14-inch MacBook Pro that we are considering here (there are also M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro options for those who need more power). To learn more about all the Mac processors read our Mac processor comparison and see how the M3 stacks up against all of Apple’s chips. In October 2024 Apple upped the standard memory in all the MacBooks – including those introduced previously. This means all MacBook Air and MacBook Pro now have 16GB RAM as standard, most likely because of the requirements of Apple Intelligence, Apple’s AI that comes with macOS Sequoia. Apple didn’t raise prices. This is how the specs in the various MacBook Air and the 14-inch MacBook Pro standard configurations compare: MacBookPriceCPUGPUMemorySSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2 (2022)$999/£9998-core, M28-core, M216GB (up to 24GB)256GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024) $1,099/£1,0998-core, M38-core, M316GB (up to 24GB)256GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024) $1,299/£1,2998-core, M310-core, M316GB (up to 24GB)512GB SSD13.6-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024) $1,499/£1,4998-core, M310-core, M316GB (up to 24GB)512GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024)$1,299/£1,2998-core, M310-core, M316GB (up to 24GB)256GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024)$1,499/£1,4998-core, M310-core, M316GB (up to 24GB)512GB SSD15-inch MacBook Air, M3 (2024)$1,699/£1,6998-core, M310-core, M324GB (up to 24GB)512GB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,599/£1,59910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)512GB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,799/£1,79910-core, M410-core, M416GB (up to 32GB)1TB SSD14-inch MacBook Pro, M4 (2024)$1,999/£1,99910-core, M410-core, M424GB (up to 32GB)1TB SSDThe specs look similar, but expect more power from newer processor generations. There are also M4 Pro and M4 Max MacBook Pro models that we discuss in our MacBook Pro comparison and our Best MacBook guide. If you glance at the specs above, the closest comparison is between the $1,499/£1,499 15-inch MacBook Air and the $1,599/£1,599 14-inch MacBook Pro. The extra money for the MacBook Pro includes a better display, one more Thunderbolt port, an HDMI port, an SDXC Card slot, a better camera, and built-in fans to cool the laptop so it can maintain performance on long tasks. You may or may not need those features. With a smaller budget the 13.6-inch MacBook Air, M2 (2022) looks like a good deal at $999/£999. The main problem with this machine is the smaller SSD, not just because it’s smaller, but also because the 256GB SSDs are known to be slower. It still might be a good choice despite the SSD, because that probably won’t matter to you if the apps you use aren’t frequently writing to the hard drive. There are other factors that can slow down the MacBook Air though. Because the Air is compact and fanless it is less able to manage heat, and therefore may run slower in order to keep cool if you really push it. If it’s power you need then the benchmarks give a clearer picture (MacBook Pro M4 benchmarks are not yet available. We will update this chart as soon as we get the data. For your reference, you can see how the rest of the chips compare): As you can see from the scores above, the M3 shoots ahead of the M2 and M1, in fact it even scores above one configuration of the M1 Pro. But, if you really need a powerful machine you might want to look at the M4 Pro MacBook Pro or shop around for a M3 Pro MacBook Pro which it’s likely will remain on sale for some time even though Apple has discontinued that model. See our round-up of the Best MacBook Pro deals. If you need to push your Mac with graphic-intensive apps a MacBook Pro would be a better choice.Foundry RAM All the MacBooks showcased above now come with 16GB of Unified Memory at their base configuration. The M1 only supported up to 16GB memory, but the M2 and M3 chip bring an option to upgrade to 24GB RAM. The M4 MacBook Pro can support 32GB RAM. If you need more memory than that you need to look to the M4 Pro and M4 Max, which can support 48GB in the case of the M4 Pro and up to 128GB for the M4 Max. In October 2024, Apple updated the MacBook Air so that it comes standard with 16GB of RAM–it was 8GB before. So, now all Macs start with 16GB of RAM. Our advice is to get as much RAM as you can afford as you can’t upgrade it later. See: Apple’s MacBook Pro memory problem. Storage Apple offers a 256GB storage option at the entry-level for both the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Air. The entry-level MacBook Pro starts at 512GB. There are some concerns about this 256GB SSD, with reports that its SSD is up to 50 percent slower on read speeds and 30 percent on write speeds. We found that these observations were indeed true when we ran our own set of tests using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test. This may matter if you are using apps that access the SSD often, but it may not make a difference in typical use. For this reason, if you can afford a 512GB model we recommend that. You can opt for up to 2TB SSD. MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Battery life and charging When it comes to battery life these Macs are miles ahead of the old Intel MacBook models. According to Apple, the MacBook Air offers 18 hours battery life, while the 14-inch MacBook Pro offers an amazing 22 hours (the same as the 16-inch MacBook Pro). In our own testing, the 15-inch M3 MacBook Air battery lasted 19 hours. The battery inside the M3 MacBook Air is the same as that in the M2 models so we didn’t expect any difference in testing. The battery in the M4 MacBook Pro is bigger than that in the M3 MacBook Pro (72.4-watt hours, up from a 70-watt-hour battery). The M3 model had “Up to 22 hours Apple TV app movie playback” and “Up to 15 hours wireless web” while the M4 model is stated as 24 and 16 hours respectively. The M4 MacBook Pro lasted about 20 hours in our test. In regular daily use, battery life is just as great. It’s a weird feeling, opening up your laptop and doing work for 20 minutes and seeing that the battery percentage hasn’t changed even a single percent, but that’s how it is with Apple silicon. Obviously, battery life varies based on what you’re doing, but for this laptop’s target market–the everyday home and productivity user–it’s hard to think that you’ll ever have to charge up before the day is done. It’s not just how long the battery lasts that matters, but also the charging speed. Charging can be fast if you use a good USB-C power adapter. A standard 35W dual-port adapter can achieve a 10 percent charge in 10 minutes (30 percent in 30 minutes). Apple’s 61W USB-C Power Adapter increases this to 72 percent charge in 30 minutes. See our comparison test of Apple’s M2 MacBook Air chargers as well as the best USB-C charger for your MacBook. The MacBook Air ships with a braided MagSafe cable and compact 35W dual-USB-C Power Adapter (in all but the base configuration).IDG MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Ports and expansion Over the years it’s felt like Apple has been on a mission to remove ports from Macs in order to make them slimmer and slimmer. This has been a disadvantage for many, although generally if you need more or different ports you can just plug in an adapter or a dock (read: Best USB-C hubs and adapters for Mac). The older M1 MacBook Air offered only two USB 4 ports two USB/Thunderbolt ports, so one of those had to be used for charging (as was also the case with the 13-inch MacBook Pro). Thankfully, with the arrival of the 2022 MacBook Air, Apple added a MagSafe charging port thereby freeing up the two USB ports so one doesn’t have to be given over to charging (this also applies to the 15-inch model). The MacBook Pro features even more ports. On the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro, you get three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a MagSafe charging port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, HDMI, and a SDXC card slot. The MacBook Air with MagSafe as well as two USB/Thunderbolt ports compared to the 2020 M1 MacBook Air.IDG MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Audio and camera The MacBook Air offers a 1080p FaceTime camera, which is superior to the 720p FaceTime camera on the now-discontinued M1 MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro. The 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro has a 12MP Center Stage camera that automatically keeps the user in the center of the frame. The camera also supports Desk View, which can show the desk space in front of the laptop. This is an upgrade from the M3 MacBook Pro, which had the same 1080p FaceTime camera as the MacBook Air. The 15-inch MacBook Air has a benefit over the 13.6-inch MacBook Air model: if features a six-speaker sound system with force-canceling woofers, compared to a four-speaker sound system. Apple describes the speaker system in the 14-inch MacBook Pro as a high-fidelity six-speaker sound system with force-cancelling woofers, indicating that it is superior to that in the 15-inch Air. Apple also refers to a “studio-quality three-mic array with high signal-to-noise ratio and directional beamforming” in the 14-inch Pro, while both Air models offer only a “three-mic array with directional beamforming”. All Mac laptops offer a 3.5mm headphone jack.  MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Price and buying advice When Apple introduced the M3 version of the 14-inch MacBook Pro in October 2023 it replaced a much cheaper 13-inch MacBook Pro with M2 chip that started at $1,299/£1,349. Now, the entry-level M4 14-inch MacBook Pro costs $1,599/£1,599 for a 10-core CPU, 10-core GPU, 512GB SSD entry-level laptop. That’s quite a leap from $1,299/£1,299 for the 8-core CPU, 10-core GPU MacBook Air with 512GB SSD. With no ‘budget’ MacBook Pro available, the MacBook Air is the only option for those looking for a bargain. If you are looking for the cheapest option the $999/£999 M2 MacBook Air would appear to be the clear winner. But the starting price of the MacBook Air M3 is only $100/£100 more. Our advice is to spend the extra money if you can afford to or look for a deal that reduces the M3 MacBook Air to a price you can afford. The price of the MacBook Pro is higher, and on everyday tasks it performs the same as the MacBook Air, but it does offer better performance on long, CPU-intensive tasks, like image and video rendering and similar tasks. (Not to mention the better screen, HDMI port, and SDXC Card slot.) At just $100/£100 more than the 15-inch MacBook Air with M3 and the same 512GB SSD, it actually represents good value for money. We recommend getting the best machine you can afford at the time of purchase because you won’t be able to upgrade down the line, this may require you to upgrade the RAM and storage before you make your purchase. The other factor that may be important to you is the screen size, which is where the MacBook Air is the clear winner, but if you are going to plug your Mac into an external display whenever you are at your desk this shouldn’t be a decision breaker. See our round-up of the best displays for Mac, also bear in mind that it can be complicated using more than one external display with some MacBooks. So which MacBook should you choose? If you are on a budget it has to be the MacBook Air and you won’t be disappointed, especially now that Apple has upped the memory to 16GB as standard (do make sure you aren’t buying an older version with 8GB memory). If you need a bit more power than the Air can offer the M4 MacBook Pro will see you good. But if you need even more power you’ll have to fork out for the M4 Pro or M4 Max MacBook Pro models. Luckily, you don’t have to pay full price for a MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, check out our best MacBook Air deals and best MacBook Pro deals articles for the best discounts available. Finally, a word of warning: if you see a lower price on an Intel MacBook we strongly recommend that you don’t buy it as Apple is unlikely to support Intel Macs for much longer.

    "description": "Macworld It’s never been easy to upgrade the storage in Macs, so it’s always a good idea to buy an external drive to provide extra storage for all your work files, photos, videos, and games. And, of course, you should always have an external drive available for making Time Machine backups in case anything ever goes wrong. Modern solid-state drives (SSD) are the best option as they’re really fast, reliable, and compact. However, SSDs are still relatively expensive, with 1TB drives costing around $100/£150, whereas that same amount of money can get you a 4TB basic desktop hard drive with a USB interface (drives with high-speed Thunderbolt ports tend to be more expensive). Hard drives are slower than SSDs, but if you need lots of storage for your important files and back-ups then a good old-fashioned hard drive is still the most affordable option. (If it’s an SSD you are after, read Best external SSD for Mac.) There are plenty of choices, too, with compact, portable hard drives designed for use with laptops, and desktop drives with larger capacities if you really need a lot of storage. Some hard drives also provide additional features, such as built-in docks with lots of Thunderbolt and USB ports, or perhaps allowing you to open up the casing of the drive and insert a new drive for an instant upgrade. Below we rank the best hard drives we have reviewed recently, plus you’ll find general buying advice that explains what you should be looking for. Looking for a Black Friday deal?

Seagate Ultra Touch HDD: Best Mac hard drive Pros Competitive price 2TB, 4TB or 5TB storage Password protection and encryption Cons Average performance Larger and heavier than original model Price When Reviewed: $99.99 (2TB), $159.99 (4TB), $164.99 (5TB) Best Prices Today: $99.99 at Seagate$103.73 at Walmart$106.82 at Amazon The original Seagate Ultra Touch was a pocket-size hard drive with an attractively slim and lightweight design. It was a fairly old design though, limited to either 1TB or 2TB of storage, and it was still using an old USB 3.0 interface that required an adaptor in order to work with more modern Macs and PCs with USB-C. This updated version of the Ultra Touch updates most aspects of the drive’s design. It’s slightly larger and heavier, but now starts with a minimum of 2TB storage, with 4TB or 5TB models also available if you need additional storage. This new model now has a USB-C interface too, with a lengthy (50cm) USB-C cable included as well. The 2TB model – which is finished in cloud white – is still fairly slim, measuring just 13.2mm thick, 80mm wide and 115mm long, and weighing a modest 168g, so it’s a good option if you just need a lightweight, portable drive that you can slip into your pocket or a bag. The 4TB and 5TB models are finished in a darker pebble grey and are slightly larger and heavier, measuring 23mm thick and weighing 267g. You can’t buy the Ultra Touch directly from Seagate, so you’ll have to shop around online, and prices do seem to vary quite a lot. Seagate pricing is as follows: $164.99/£179.99 for 5TB, $159.99/£154.99 for 4TB, $99.99/£109.99 for 2TB. However, the average prices that we came across during testing were around $79.99/£99.99 for the 2TB model that we tested, while the 4TB and 5TB models are around $124.99/£139.99 and $207.99/£164.99 respectively. Performance is similar to that of the original Ultra Touch, at 130MB/s for both read and write speeds, which is around average for a portable drive such as this. The Ultra Touch includes some additional features too, such as the ability to create mirror folders on your Mac and the Ultra Touch drive that are automatically synced and updated whenever you make any changes to those folders. The Toolkit app also provides 256-bit encryption and password protection for extra security, making the Ultra Touch a good option for people who need to keep important files secure when they’re working away from the office. Customers in the US can also use Seagate’s Data Recovery service to rescue files in the event that the drive is damaged (although this service isn’t available in all regions).–Cliff Joseph 2. LaCie Mobile Drive: Best value Pros Competitive price LaCie’s ToolKit app Cons Not the fastest hard drive available Price When Reviewed: $79.99 (1TB); $109.99 (2TB); $149.99 (4TB); $169.99 (5TB) Best Prices Today: $79.34 at Amazon79.99 at LaCie$94.99 at Adorama LaCie’s Mobile Drive has been on our list of the best hard drives for Mac users for a while and this version was released in 2022. The 2022 Mobile Drive adopts an Apple-style slimline, rectangular design with smooth rounded corners with the LaCie logo right in the center. Prices start at a competitive $79.99/£69.99 for a drive with 1TB storage (that’s a price cut from the initial £79.99 in the U.K.), but there are also models with 2TB, 4TB, and 5TB available too. The 1TB and 2TB models measure just 10.4mm thick, 85mm wide, and 118mm long, and weigh 200g, so they’re easy to pick up and carry around with your laptop. The 4TB and 5TB models are a little thicker – at 20.4mm – and weigh 300g, but that’s still a good size for portable hard drives that provide such high capacity. They’re all constructed out of recycled aluminum, and sturdy enough to cope with life on the road. You can use them for your Time Machine backups, but LaCie’s ToolKit app – for macOS 10.14 or later – also allows you to create a Mirror folder that is automatically updated whenever you make any changes to the files or data within that folder. The drive has a USB-C interface, with a USB-C cable included in the box, and recorded write and read speeds of 126MB/s and 130MB/s respectively when running the BlackMagic Disk Speed Test. There are faster hard drives available, but that’s still a respectable speed for a compact hard drive such as this, and the Mobile Drive 2022 remains a good, affordable backup drive for MacBook owners – and even owners of desktop Macs who may need the larger 4TB or 5TB models. —Cliff Joseph 3.

It’s an enclosure with a 2.5-inch hard drive inside that’s shock-mounted, and the rugged aluminum case is surrounded by a silicon sock for extra protection. It will withstand minor abuse, more when off than on and the disks are spinning, but your best bet with any hard drive is not to treat it like a hockey puck. The connection is USB-C with a speed rating of 5Gbps (USB 3.1/Gen 1)–plenty fast enough for any hard drive. The drive warranty is for three years. You’ll get around 120MBps writing and 127MBps reading maximum (with large files) from the ArmorATD on your Mac. Good stuff. The Armor ATD arrives formatted to exFAT so you’re good to go out of the box under both macOS and Windows. However, exFAT will extract a 5 percent max penalty, so Mac users will want to reformat the drive. –Jon L. Jacobi Read our full G-Drive ArmorATD review 4. Western Digital My Passport Ultra for Mac – Big storage in a small case Pros Up to 6TB of storage Far cheaper per terabyte than SSDs Type-C connectivity Attractive design fits in your (large) pocket Cons Hard drive-level performance Price When Reviewed: $84.99 (2TB), $129.99 (4TB), $139.99 (5TB), $199.99 (6TB) Best Prices Today: $85 at Western Digital$89.99 at Amazon$129.99 at Best Buy The WD My Passport Ultra for Mac is a 2.5-inch external USB hard drive that offers a pretty decent storage capacity of 6TB for around $200/£200. The 5TB unit currently offers the best bang for your buck at $28 per terabyte.  The drive delivers 110MBps read and write speed, making it suitable for media streaming and Time Machine backups running in the background. The My Passport Ultra for Mac features a USB-C port. Until recently, external 2.5-inch USB hard drives unanimously used USB micro-B SuperSpeed connectors (for extra power) on the drive and USB-A on the other end of the cable. WD bundles a USB-C to USB-C cable and a USB-C to USB-A adapter to accommodate older and current connection scenarios.  The first time you attach the drive a.dmg file for installing WD’s Discovery application appears. Discovery can import your data from your Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive accounts. You’ll also find links for the WD Drive Utilities, WD Security (encryption, password protection), and a branded version of Acronis’s True Image backup software. It’s not a bad software bundle, you don’t have to use it of course.  In our tests the My Passport Ultra for Mac delivered a transfer rate of up to 110MBps, which is fast enough for several audio or movie streams. But in a world becoming accustomed to 3GBps speed on USB4/Thunderbolt external SSDs you may not find this fast. It is still a great storage device for a large multimedia collection and is suitable for background backup with Time Machine. The My Passport Ultra for Mac is a great storage device for a large multimedia collection and can stream across the network at 2.5Gbps. Read our full My Passport Ultra for Mac review 5.

There are also 4TB and 5TB models, while the 6TB model costs a reasonable $184.99/£165.99.The 2TB model is slimmer and lighter than the others, measuring 13.5mm thick, 75mm wide, and 107mm long, and weighing just 140g. The 4TB and 5TB models increase to a thickness of 19.2mm, while the 6TB model is 20.6mm thick, weighing 210g.The My Passport drive still uses an ageing USB Micro-B interface, but Western Digital includes a USB-A cable with a separate USB-C adaptor for compatibility with newer Macs with USB-C and older Macs with USB-A. We’ve also looked at the My Passport Ultra for Mac (above), which uses USB-A pr USB-C via an adaptor. The My Passport drive also includes Western Digital’s Discovery app for Mac and Windows, providing password protection and encryption features. Read our full Western Digital My Passport review 6. WD Black P10: Best for gamers Pros Competitively priced Cons USB 3.2 with USB-A cable – USB-C adapter not included Price When Reviewed: From $79.99 Best Prices Today: $79.98 at Western Digital$84.99 at WesternDigital com$134.99 at Target The WD Black P10 provides a more portable alternative to the WD Black D10, which is geared for desktop use. It’s not as fast as the D10, but it can draw power from a USB port, so you can simply plug it into any Mac, PC, or games console when you need to back up your files. It’s relatively large for a portable drive, measuring a chunky 20mm thick, 88mm wide, and 118mm long, but its reinforced casing is sturdy enough to cope with being bumped around in a backpack when you’re traveling. The drive is rated at a relatively modest 140MB/s for both read and write performance, although our tests actually recorded speeds of 120MB/s and 110MB/s for read and write performance respectively. That’s not going to break any records, but it’s fine for the occasional Time Machine backup or for storing lots of games, photos, videos, and other multimedia files. The P10 is also competitively priced, starting at just $89.99/£80.99 for a healthy 2TB of storage. There are 4TB and 5TB models available too, so the P10 is a good option for Mac users who have really large collections of photos and videos that they can’t fit onto their Mac’s internal drive. The only oddity is that the P10 uses an aging USB 3.2 interface. There’s a USB cable included, but it has a USB-A connector, so you’ll need to provide an adaptor for Macs that only have USB-C. —Cliff Joseph 7. Seagate Expansion Desktop: Smart and fast Pros Low price per terabyte Up to 24TB Cons Requires AC adapter Price When Reviewed: 4TB: $120 I 6TB: $110 I 8TB: $160 I 10TB: $270 I 12TB: $300 I 14TB: $430 I 16: $230 I 18TB: $250 I 24TB: $540 Best Prices Today: $119.99 at Seagate You will need to reformat the Mac you will need to reformat the Seagate Expansion Desktop with a Mac. Once complete, the drive should be detected and you will be able to use it as you would any hard drive. It measures approximately 7-inches long, by 4.9-inches wide, by 1.65-inches thick and weighs around 2.5-pounds and comes in black with plenty of ventilation grating, and diagonal grooves spicing up significantly what would otherwise be a bland countenance. It’s not bad looking. The Seagate Expansion Desktop is available in a variety of capacities and can provide up to 24TB in a single unit. You won’t get that much storage in an SSD, and even if you could this will cost a lot less than the same allocation in an SSD. Of course, the difference is that an SSD is a lot faster, but our 16TB test unit was a lot faster than you might think. Instead of the usual 120- to 140MBps its smaller 2.5-inch cousins read and write at, the Expansion Desktop managed almost 280MBps. While it’s not fast compared to an SSD, the Expansion Desktop is workable for streaming and background operations, is far faster than 2.5-inch external HDDs, and you sure as heck can’t beat the capacity. 8. Western Digital My Book: Great if you need A LOT of storage Pros Up to 22TB storage Good performance (for a hard drive) Competitive price Cons Uses old USB 3.0 interface  Requires mains power Price When Reviewed: $134.99 (4TB), $159.99 (6TB), $179.99 (8TB), $259.99 (12TB), $299.99 (14TB), $319.99 (16TB), $349.99 (18TB), $499.99 (22TB), $579.99 (24TB) Best Prices Today: $99.99 at Walmart$119.99 at Amazon$119.99 at Lenovo USA More and more people are now using a MacBook as their main computer, so the trend with hard drives in recent years has been towards smaller, more portable drives that you can easily carry around with your laptop. That’s fine if you only need 1TB or 2TB of storage, but there are times when you may need a larger, desktop drive that can store several terabytes of files and data. Western Digital’s My Book range of desktop drives has been around for quite a few years, but the range provides up to 24TB of storage (we looked at the 22TB model) – which should be more than enough for photographers, designers and video-editors who work with large, high-res files every day. Prices actually start at $134.99 / £120.99 for a My Book drive with 4TB of storage, and there are several other models along the way before you reach the 22TB drive that we review here, which costs $499.99 / £502.99, and the 24GB drive that costs $579.99 / £570.99. Not surprisingly, the My Book is very much designed for desktop use. It measures 6.7 x 1.9 x 5.5-inches (170 x 49mm x 139mm), and weighs 2.20 pounds (1kg), and also requires a mains power supply, so it’s not a drive that’s going to leave your home or office very often. It’s a bit odd that the drive still uses an aging USB 3.0 interface, with a USB-A cable provided for connecting to a Mac or PC, so you may need to provide a USB-C adaptor for Macs that no longer have USB-A ports. However, the My Book does provide good protection and security for all your files, with 256-bit encryption and password protection available in the WD Security app for Mac and Windows. The drive itself has a three-year warranty, and professional users might also want to sign up for WD’s Data Recovery plan – from $9.99 / £9.99 for two years – which can retrieve lost data if the drive does get badly damaged. Performance is good too – despite the aging USB interface – with the My Book recording read and write speeds of 215MB/s. That’s almost twice as fast as most of the smaller, portable drives that we review here, so the My Book will be a good option for people who need a lot of storage for their important work files. And if 22TB isn’t enough, there’s also a model called the My Book Duo, which provides RAID storage options using two internal hard drives for a total of 44TB of storage for $1,119 / £1,289.99. 9. Seagate Special Edition Firecuda: Best for collectors Pros It’s Baby Yoda! ToolKit app Cons USB-C adapter not included Formatted for Windows PCs, so you’ll need to reformat it using Disk Utility Price When Reviewed: $139.99 Best Prices Today: $82.99 at Walmart Electronics$99.99 at Best Buy$139.99 at Seagate Seagate has a range of special edition Firecuda drives that sport designs taken from Marvel and Star Wars films. There are drives with Spiderman, Boba Fett and the Mandolorian, but our favorite is the ‘small and powerful’ Baby Yoda drive (yes, we know his name is Grogu, but he’ll always be Baby Yoda to us). And, when attached to your Mac, the drive is even displayed on your desktop with a Baby Yoda icon as well. These special edition drives are only available with 2TB storage. They’re priced at $139.99/£139.99 on Seagate’s website, which is a little pricey for a 2TB drive so you’re paying a bit extra for the Star Wars vibe. Some are now discounted including Grogu, who is now $59.99 in the U.S., and we have seen them at lower prices elsewhere online. It’s a little larger than some portable drives, measuring 14.5mm thick, 80mm wide, and 122mm long. It’s sturdily built though and only weighs 167g, so it’s still light enough to just pick it up and slip it onto a bag with your laptop when you’re traveling. The only minor oddity with the design is that it uses a USB 3.2 interface with a USB-A cable–to provide compatibility with Xbox consoles, apparently, so you’ll need a USB-C adaptor if your Mac only has USB-C. The Firecuda drive is formatted in the ExFat format for Windows PCs, but you can reformat it for Macs using Disk Utility, and Seagate’s ToolKit app will run on any Mac with macOS 10.14 or later. The drive will work with Time Machine on your Mac, but the ToolKit app also allows you to create a special Mirror folder on your Mac that is always kept in sync with a matching Mirror folder on the Firecuda drive. The app even lets you customize the colored lighting effects for the status light on the front of the drive too. Seagate doesn’t quote a speed for the drive, but we recorded read and write speeds of 130MB/s in our tests. Professional users might prefer a faster hard drive or SSD, but that’s a respectable speed for a portable hard drive such as this, and the Firecuda is a really good – not to mention seriously cute – option for day-to-day backups on your Mac. –Cliff Joseph 10. LaCie 1big Dock: Best for pro and creative users Pros Multiple ports including a second Thunderbolt port, DisplayPort 1.4 interface and memory card slots Cons Smallest capacity of 4TB Price When Reviewed: $369 (4TB); $469 (8TB); $519 (10TB); $679 (16TB); $789 (18TB) Best Prices Today: $349 at B\u0026H$354 at Walmart$369 at LaCieNot Available at Amazon As the name suggests, LaCie’s 1big Dock is more than just a straightforward hard drive. It starts at $369/£349.99 for a drive with 4TB storage, going up to $889/£869.99 for 18TB, and its 7,200rpm IronWolf Pro hard drive provides strong performance with read and write speeds of 235MBps via its Thunderbolt 3 port. That makes it a good option for anyone that needs a fast drive for large video, photos, and audio files. The primary Thunderbolt port also provides power for charging a MacBook laptop as well. You even have the option of popping open the front panel to swap out the standard hard drive and insert a new drive to provide an instant upgrade. But the thing that really makes the 1big Dock stand out from most of its hard drive rivals is its built-in hub and connectivity features. There’s a second Thunderbolt port that will allow you to connect additional Thunderbolt and USB-C devices, and a DisplayPort 1.4 interface for an external monitor. The front of the drive also provides a standard USB 3.0 port and slots for both SD and CompactFlash (CF) memory cards, making it a great option for creative users who need to import files from cameras and other devices. There’s also a version of the 1big Dock available that uses faster solid-state storage too–of course, it’s quite a bit more expensive. –Cliff Joseph 11. WD Black D10: Best budget performer Pros Competitive price Fast Cons 8TB model only Requires USB-C adapter Requires external power supply Price When Reviewed: 8TB – £259.99 Best Prices Today: $165.31 at Walmart$169.99 at Best Buy$189.99 at Adorama Western Digital’s WD Black drives are primarily aimed at gamers who want a fast drive to boost loading times for their games, which explains why the menacing black design of this D10 desktop drive looks like a piece of heavyweight munitions from the Call Of Duty games. But a fast drive will also appeal to anyone that has a lot of photos, videos, and audio files that they want to store on their Mac, and the D10 has other features that can come in handy too. Some aspects of the design are a little odd. There’s only one version available, with 8TB storage, although its $240/£199.99 price tag on Amazon is still competitive for a fast drive such as this. It’s equipped with only an old USB A interface (even though it is USB 3.2) perhaps to provide compatibility with older games consoles, so you’ll need an adapter if your Mac only has USB-C. Its 7,200-rpm drive provides very good performance, reaching read and write speeds of 245MBps and 240MBps, respectively. The D10 requires an external power supply, so it’s very much designed for desktop use, but it also has two additional USB 3.2 ports on the back of the drive that can provide power to other devices, such as an iPhone or iPad. These ports are only for charging, though, so you can’t use the D10 as a dock for connecting peripherals such as a printer or memory stick. –Cliff Joseph How to choose the right Mac hard drive We’ve rounded up the best Mac hard drives above, but before making a buying decision you need to think about how you’ll be using the device. To find the best hard drive for your needs, you need to answer a few questions. How much storage do I need? Hard drive storage is relatively cheap. Unless you are really out to save your pennies, the smallest size of hard drive we’d recommend is 1TB. Upgrades to 2TB, 3TB, and even 4TB are also cost-effective–the price per megabyte goes down the higher the capacity, so making the bump up to the next model is a good idea. Each terabyte can store around 11,000 music albums at 192kbps quality, but such storage doesn’t seem so grand when you start archiving 4K video. Portable or desktop? If you think you’ll be happy with a 1TB to 4TB hard drive, you can buy a portable drive. These use small 2.5-inch disks, and they fit happily into a coat pocket. Portable drives are usually bus-powered, too. This means you just need to plug them into your desktop or laptop, no separate power supply is required. There’s just one cable, and the drive will barely take up any space. If only an ultra-high capacity hard drive will do, consider a desktop unit. These use larger 3.5-inch drives and tend to cover capacities from 4TB to 18TB. They’ll need to be plugged in for power; that’s fine if it stay home all of the time, or moves from office to office. Rugged drives for travel Some portable drives offer ruggedization. Shock protection is the most important kind for a hard drive, as unlike an SSD they have moving parts that can be permanently damaged following a drop. Rugged drives usually have some form of rubber coating that soaks up impact forces, and a toughened enclosure that won’t dent, crack or collapse under any normal amount of pressure. A few also have water resistance. While few are rated IP68 like an iPhone 11 Pro, meaning they can be submerged in water without damage, several can handle rain or water jets/splashes. What extra features do you need? Buy a larger drive, though, and you’re more likely to get other features. Desktop units may have a built-in “hub”, letting you plug-in memory cards or peripherals using USB ports. These are particularly useful if your current setup has limited connectivity, or the USBs you do have just aren’t that handy. Which connector do you need? Matching the hard drive’s connector to those of your laptop or desktop is also essential. You’ll get a cable in the box, but it will either terminate with a USB-A or USB-C shaped plug, as seen here: USB-A (left) and USB-C. Unless you have an old Mac or MacBook that only offers the old USB-A port, you’ll will want the newer USB-C connector, which also doubles up as Thunderbolt. Every Mac sold by Apple in the past few years features a USB-C style connector, although some Mac desktops still offer the older USB standard as well.  Not all USB-Cs are the same, though. The USB-C port on Macs also supports Thunderbolt 3 and in some cases Thunderbolt 4. USB-C is based on USB 3.1 and offers up to 10Gbps. Thunderbolt 3 offers up to 40Gbps. Thunderbolt 4 also offers 40Gbps, but has a few other advantages, including a 32Gbps data rate, which will be a benefit to anyone who needs to transfer large video files to from the drive to their desktop for editing. There’s also a new USB 4 standard that offers between 20Gbps and 40Gbps bandwidth that you will see alongside the newer Thunderbolt 4 standard, but note that USB 4 doesn’t offer all the features of Thunderbolt. It’s clear that Thunderbolt is a better option than USB if you are looking for the best interface for your hard drive, but Thunderbolt options are likely to be more expensive than their USB counterparts. Wireless and NAS Not every hard drive needs to be plugged in: you can also opt for a network-attached storage (NAS) drive which enables to to wirelessly transfer files and backups. These network-attached storage drives connect to your home Wi-Fi to share their data with other devices in your home. That might be a smart TV, Apple TV, a tablet or laptop. A NAS is particularly useful if you want to set up a media server at home. This is like a wireless jukebox you can fill with videos, photos and music. Read our best NAS drives feature for more.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
