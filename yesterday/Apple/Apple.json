    "title": "My 64GB iPhone was so low on space it barely worked. Here’s how I saved it",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2774952/64gb-iphone-storage-crashes-icloud-photos-imessage-apps.html",
    "description": "Macworld With the launch of the iPhone 16e and 11th-gen iPad, Apple has officially phased out all devices with 64GB of storage in favor of 128GB as the entry-level option. That’s great for new buyers, but there are a lot of people who still have 64GB iPhones and iPads that are too new to replace. I know from experience: I own an iPhone 12 mini and a 6th-gen iPad mini, both otherwise great devices, and it’s become a headache to manage the latest versions of iOS with such a small amount of space. If you also have a device with 64GB of storage and have been struggling with constant low storage alerts, I’m here to help. Here’s how I made my devices usable again without having to buy a new one. iOS has a storage management problem The ideal amount of storage varies from person to person. For people who mainly use their phone for messaging and browsing the web, the 64GB entry-level option was usually enough. But over the last several years, iOS itself as well as many apps have required much more space. For example, if you only install Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, and YouTube on your phone, you already end up taking up more than 1GB of storage before any caches or downloads. As for iOS itself, the latest version of the operating system takes up more than 10GB and possibly twice that with System Data. Given that you’ll probably want to download more than four apps onto your phone, filling up 64GB of storage doesn’t take long. With just 64GB of storage, older iPhones can run out of space quickly.Foundry While larger system and app sizes are inevitable as we get more advanced features, Apple is partly to blame for not optimizing how iOS and iCloud manage storage. In theory, iCloud automatically decides what to download to your device based on available space, but what happens most of the time is that iCloud tries to download all your files, even when you don’t need them. iMessage can also become a problem, as the system keeps a large cache of all your messages and attachments.  All of that is to say, when an iPhone or iPad reaches its storage limit, the device becomes virtually unusable. Apps crash, the camera won’t launch, it becomes impossible to install system updates… the situation gets bad. But things aren’t hopeless. If you’re dealing with an iPhone or iPad that has run out of available storage, here are a few things I do to make it usable again Remove unused apps This might seem obvious, but the first step is to find out what exactly is taking up your iPhone’s storage. To do this, go to Settings \u003e General \u003e iPhone Storage. There you’ll see details of how much space each app is using, as well as the system. If your device has reached the state of crashing due to a lack of free storage, you can start by removing some installed apps. Start by deleting apps you no longer use. You can sort the list by size or last used date, which will make it easy to see any seldom-used apps that are eating into your storage space. If you can’t bring yourself to part with any of your apps, you can also temporarily remove an app from your device without deleting its data. To do this, tap on an app in the iPhone Storage settings and choose the “Offload App” option. This will delete the app itself by storing its data, documents, and settings. That way, when you reinstall the app, everything will be restored as if it were never deleted. Also in the iPhone Storage settings, you may want to enable the option “Offload Unused Apps,” which will automatically remove apps that haven’t been used in a while, but without deleting any data. Delete old iMessage chats If you’re a heavy iMessage user, be aware that your conversations can take up a lot of space on your iPhone or iPad. Unfortunately, even though iCloud backs up all your messages in the cloud, it also keeps them downloaded and eats up storage on your phone. You can set your iPhone to automatically delete messages after 30 days or a year.Foundry Until Apple resolves this, we recommend deleting your old chats. Go to Settings \u003e Apps \u003e Messages and look for the option “Keep Messages.” You can set iMessage to automatically delete old messages after 30 days or 1 year, which will continuously free up your iPhone’s storage. However, just remember that changing this will also delete messages from your other Apple devices. It’s an all-or-nothing scenario, however, and there’s no easy way to save individual conversations or back them up to an external drive, so if you want to keep any specific conversations, you’ll need to put in a little work. There are some third-party apps that could help, but for the most part, you need to save each attachment individually and screenshot conversations. Change the iCloud Photos settings Photos and videos are the biggest culprits when it comes to eating up storage space. Similar to iMessage, iCloud Photos also backs up your photos without removing them from your devices, and that can be a problem when you’ve only got 64GB of storage. There are a couple of things you can do. Obviously, the first is to go through and delete old videos, screenshots, or duplicate photos from your camera roll. The Photos app has a tab under Utilities where you can easily find any duplicate photos and videos in your library—you may be surprised by how many you have. Optimizing photo storage can help free up precious space on your 64GB iPhone.Foundry You can also head over Settings \u003e Apps \u003e Photos and check that the “Optimize iPhone Storage” option is on. This will allow your iPhone to remove some of the full-resolution photos from your device and only download them when you want to see them. But in some cases, you may need an even more aggressive solution. On my devices, for example, I have more than 700GB of photos and videos in iCloud. So, even with optimized iPhone storage, there’s still a lot of data that ends up being downloaded to my phone. If you’re in a similar boat, consider turning off iCloud Photos and removing all the photos and videos stored on your device. Instead, you can periodically transfer the photos you snap or save to your Mac or an external drive.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
