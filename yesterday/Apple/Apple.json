Credit: AppleThe 2024 iPad mini doesn't get rid of the problem entirely, but reduces the effect — despite no obvious change to the display driver board. The teardown by iFixit.com did, however, uncover some of Apple's changes to the new model — including an interesting change to the Apple logo seen on the back of the device.In addition to upgrading the chip to the A17 Pro and the minimum RAM to 8GB so that the new iPad mini supports Apple Intelligence, Apple has upgraded the base storage to 128GB. Because of the new chip, the 2024 iPad mini now supports both the Apple Pencil, and the new Apple Pencil Pro. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/672613/how-to-run-windows-apps-on-a-mac.html",
    "description": "Macworld There are a number of options available that allow you to install Windows on your Mac – either using Boot Camp on older Macs with Intel processors, or using virtualization programs such as Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion, which can run on Macs with both Intel and Apple Silicon processors. Installing a full version of the Windows operating system on your Mac is a good option – provided you have a fast Mac, with plenty of memory and storage – as you should then be able to run any Windows software you want, ranging from games to professional-level business, graphics or design software. However, there’s another option that allows you to run many Windows apps and games on a Mac without even needing to install Windows at all. The most well-known program in this area is CrossOver, which is described by its developers at Codeweavers as a compatibility layer or translation layer. Instead of requiring you to install the entire Windows operating system on a virtual machine, CrossOver allows you to create a ‘bottle’ that mimics some aspects of the Windows operating system. CrossOver for Mac Read our review Price When Reviewed: $59.95 for a year, $494 for life Best Prices Today: $74 at CodeWeavers You can install individual Windows apps inside that bottle, using the app’s normal installer program, and when you launch the app CrossOver translates the Windows programming code within that app into equivalent programming code for the macOS. This makes it possible to run your Windows apps on a Mac without actually needing to install Windows at all. CrossOver works with hundreds of different Windows apps and games – many people use it specifically for gaming, but CrossOver works with a lot of Windows business software as well. Pros and cons of Crossover CrossOver tells you how well the app will run.Foundry In many ways, this is an ideal solution for people who only need to run a limited number of Windows apps or games on their Mac, as it provides better performance than using virtualization programs like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion. It’s cheaper too, as you don’t need to pay a subscription fee for Parallels Desktop, and you don’t even need to buy a copy of Windows either. However, compatibility is more of an issue with CrossOver and similar programs, such as Whisky, so you may find that there are some Windows apps or games that may not run properly at all. In some ways, CrossOver is similar to Apple’s Rosetta software, which translates software that was written for older Macs with Intel processors so that it can run on newer Macs that use Apple Silicon processors, such as the latest M3 and M4 chips. CrossOver is based on an open-source project called WINE, which you can download for free. However, WINE is a pretty complex piece of software, so Codeweavers developed CrossOver as a commercial product that provides greater ease of use for people who aren’t experienced programmers or developers. CrossOver costs $74/£60 per year, but that price also includes 12 months of technical support in case you have any problems with particular Windows apps or games that you need to run. There is also a $494/£414 version you can own for life. A 14-day trial available for CrossOver is also available so that you can see if it works with the Windows software that you want to run. Codeweavers also maintains a compatibility database with help and information about running hundreds of Windows apps and games. It’s worth mentioning that Apple’s Game Porting Toolkit for developers shares some of the same open-source code developed by Codeweavers for CrossOver, so even Apple recognizes how well CrossOver works. Other options for running Windows apps on a Mac Using Whisky to install Windows apps on a Mac.Foundry The Game Porting Toolkit is primarily aimed at developers who want to bring their Windows games to the Mac, but there’s a program called Whisky that is based on elements of the Game Porting Toolkit, but aimed at a wider audience. Whisky is a kind of halfway-house that sits somewhere between the open-source WINE and the commercial CrossOver. Whisky is also open-source, so it’s free to download, although it lacks the more polished interface and the technical support that you get when you pay for CrossOver. Whisky Read our review Price When Reviewed: Free Best Prices Today: Free at Whisky There’s one other option that allows you to run Windows software on your Mac without actually installing Windows– and it comes from Microsoft itself. Windows 365 is an online service that gives you access to a Cloud PC that is running Windows on one of Microsoft’s online servers (not to be confused with Microsoft 365, which is now the name for the old Microsoft Office suite). As long as your Internet connection is fast enough you can connect any device to Microsoft’s servers – including Macs, iPads or Android devices – and stream Windows straight from the cloud. But where CrossOver and similar programs largely focus on gaming, Windows 365 is primarily aimed at business users. It’s quite expensive too, with prices starting at $31/£34.56 per month, although you can try it for one month free before paying for the full subscription. Windows 365 Price When Reviewed: $31 – $66 per month Best Prices Today: $31 at Microsoft How to run Windows apps in Crossover Search for the Windows application you want to install.Foundry The key to installing Windows software using Crossover Office is understanding what a bottle is, because upon installing anything you’ll be asked to create one. It’s actually very simple – a bottle is just a fake C: drive, just like you might find on an actual PC, complete with all the folders you might find there such as C:windows, or C:Users. Crucially, however, it also includes the correct system components that allow that Windows apps to run. Normally when you install a Windows app using Crossover Office you’ll install it into a fresh bottle of its own, which is isolated from the rest of the system, although existing bottles can be used more than once. Because there are many different versions of Windows – from Windows XP up to Windows 11 – there are readymade bottles to match each. CrossOver has been authorized by Microsoft to run Windows 11 on Macs with Apple Silicon. YOu therefore need to select the bottle with the version of Windows you want into which you can install the Windows app you wish to run. Start Crossover Office, and then click the large button marked Install a Windows Application. If the application is popular – such as Microsoft Office – then you can simply type its name in the dialog box that appears under the Select an Application to Install heading. Note how after a few seconds you see a report about how well the app will run. Select the entry from the dropdown list that matches what you typed, then click the Continue button. Next, you’ll have to tell Crossover Office where the installer file is. This might be a single .exe file, in which case you should click Choose Installer File and then select it.If you’re installing from a DVD-ROM, or an ISO image, then click Choose Installer Folder, and select it. Click Continue when done. Finally, click the Install button to kick-off the installation routine. Its very likely several system components will be downloaded and installed, and you might have to click through each of them just like when installing them on Windows. The screen might also flash as installers start and then instantly disappear. Don’t worry – this is normal. Finally, you’ll be prompted to install the actual product, and this might involve entering the serial number, for example. Just work your way through the wizard as you would when installing on an actual Windows computer. However, you might want to leave your Mac alone as the installation steps complete in case you accidentally interfere with anything. Once installation has finished, Crossover Office will complete a handful of familiar housekeeping tasks, such as creating file associations, before reporting that it has finished. You can then click the Done button.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2426453/m4-chip-rollout-release-imac-macbook-pro-mac-mini-air-studio-pro.html",
    "description": "Macworld The next major cycle of Mac upgrades revolves around the M4 chip and it’s starting this week. Instead of an event, Apple teased “an exciting week” of releases starting Monday, with several new M4 Macs making their debut. And if the rumors are correct, this is just the start, with every Mac in Apple’s lineup getting an update within the next few months. For the first time since Apple silicon arrived, every model will soon be running the same chip. Here’s what’s coming this week—and beyond. Coming this week M4 iMac The iMac’s M4 upgrade is scheduled for the fall.Foundry Release date: Reports indicate that Apple will refresh the M4 iMac this week, just a year after Apple released the M3 iMac. The M3 iMac replaced the M1 iMac, which was released in May 2021. Given the fact that the iMac has just one chip (the base M4) and isn’t likely to get much more than a new processor, iit’s likely that this is the first release of the week Design: Apple won’t change anything about the iMac design. The current 24-inch iMac design was introduced in May 2021, and it will almost certainly remain in place for a few more years. Chip: The 24-inch iMac features base M-series chips, so the new iMac will have the base M4. Benchmarks have shown that the M4 offers a 20 percent improvement over the M3. Features: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Retina display, change the port configuration (two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports (two additional USB-3 ports, and gigabit ethernet on the mid-and high-end models), and a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Rumors say Apple could release a new iMac with a display as large as 32 inches and a higher-end M4 chip. It’s unlikely that such an iMac is ready for this fall, though Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman recently reported that “it’s unclear if that will be an M4 product or something that comes the following year or later.” Find out the latest about the M4 iMac. M4 MacBook Pro The MacBook Pro will get its M4 upgrade this fall.Foundry Release date: Apple will release the M4 series of MacBook Pro this week with an expected ship date of November 1. It’s almost exactly a year after Apple released the M3 MacBook Pro lineup. We expect the MacBook Pro to arrive on Tuesday to launch the full line of M4. Design: Apple won’t change anything about the MacBook Pro design. The 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro design was introduced in 2021. This design will be in place for a few more years. Chip: Apple releases the MacBook Pro with three versions of its M-series chip: A base chip, a Pro chip, and a Max chip. The M4 Pro and M4 Max will be variants of the base M4, implementing more CPU and GPU cores and more unified memory. The M4 chips will offer a 20 percent improvement over the M3 chips they replace. Features: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina XDR display, change the port configuration (MagSafe 3, two or three Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, HDMI, an SDXC Card slot, and a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 MacBook Pro. M4 Mac mini The M4 Mac mini may have a new, smaller design than the current M2 Mac mini (above).Foundry Release date: The biggest announcement of the week will be the Mac mini, replacing the M2 model, which arrived in January 2023. Before that, the M1 Mac mini was released in November 2020. Given the rumors, the Mac mini will likely be Apple’s last announcement this week. Design: The Mac mini will undergo a drastic change, according to Gurman. It will get even smaller, with a footprint about the size of the Apple TV. This would make the Mac mini more of a competitor to the Raspberry Pi, a small PC that’s often used in special setups. Chip: Apple currently offers the Mac mini with a base or Pro M-series chip, and this will continue with the new design. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, the Mac mini with a base M4 chip will ship “immediately,” while the M4 Pro model won’t be available until late October. Features: The smaller design could mean that the Mac mini doesn’t offer some of the ports the current Mac mini offers. Gurman reported that Apple has tested three models that have at least three USB-C ports, a power connector, and an HDMI port. And while Gurman didn’t say so, the USB-C ports are probably also Thunderbolt ports. The current M2 Mac mini has a gigabit ethernet port, USB-A ports, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The latest rumors don’t say whether the alignment will change. While the ethernet and audio jack are likely to stay, It’s possible that Apple will drop the USB-A ports. Wi-Fi 7 support is also possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 Mac mini. Coming in 2025 M4 MacBook Air The MacBook Air will wait until 2025 for its M4 upgrade.Foundry Release date: The M4 upgrade for the MacBook Air looks like an opportunity for Apple to set a regular release period for the company’s most popular Mac. The M4 MacBook Air is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2025, about a year after Apple released the M3 MacBook Air. The M1 Air was released in November 2020; the M2 Air in July 2022; the 15-inch M2 MacBook Air was released in June 2023. The M4 Air release is a chance to establish a spring cycle for the MacBook Air that Apple could make a regular event. Design: Apple won’t change anything about the MacBook Air design. The current design was introduced in 2022 and it won’t change for several more years. Chip: The 2025 MacBook Air will have a base M4 chip, similar to that used in the iPad Pro. Benchmark results show that the M4 offers a 20 percent improvement over the M3 it will replace. Features: Apple is not expected to upgrade the Liquid Retina display, change the port configuration (MagSafe 3, two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, a 3.5mm audio jack), or upgrade the camera or speakers. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 MacBook Air. M4 Mac Studio The M4 Mac Studio is scheduled for a 2025 release.Willis Lai/Foundry Release date: The Mac Studio will not get an upgrade to the M4 until 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The current Mac Studio was released in June 2023 at WWDC, while the first Mac Studio was released in March 2022. So, it appears that the M4 Mac Studio won’t arrive until spring 2025 or at WWDC 2025 in June. Design: The Mac Studio’s design will be only three years old by the time it is updated to the M4, so it won’t change and will maintain its design for several more years. Chip: Apple outfits the Mac Studio with Max and Ultra M-series chips. So, the 2025 Mac Studio will likely have M4 Max or M4 Ultra chips. The current Mac Studio features M2 Max and Ultra chips, so the jump in performance should be impressive. Features: Apple probably won’t change anything about the ports. On the back, the Mac Studio has four Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports, two USB-A ports, gigabit ethernet, HDMI, and a 3.5mm audio jack. On the front of the Mac Studio is an SDXC Card slot; the Mac Studio Max has two USB 3 ports, while the Mac Studio Ultra has two Thunderbolt/USB 4 ports. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 Mac Studio. M4 Mac Pro The design of the Mac Pro hasn’t changed since 2019, and it’s not expected to do so.Foundry Release date: The Mac Pro will not get an upgrade to the M4 until 2025, according to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The current Mac Pro was released in June 2023 at WWDC. The M4 Mac Pro won’t arrive until late 2025 or at the earliest, WWDC 2025 in June. Design: Though the design of the Mac Pro is 11 years old, no reports of a redesign have been made. The Mac Pro is made to accommodate internal expansion cards, so if a redesign is in the work, it will keep the tower form factor, which separates it from the Mac Studio. Chip: Apple uses Ultra versions of its M-series chip for the Mac Pro. The current Mac Pro has a M2 Ultra; the upgrade in 2025 will be a M4 Ultra. Features: No reports have been made about the Mac Pro’s features, and, likely, Apple won’t change anything about the slots, ports, or chassis. Wi-Fi 7 support is possible since the Wi-Fi Alliance made the standard official at the beginning of January. Find out the latest about the M4 Mac Pro.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
