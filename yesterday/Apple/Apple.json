Though multiple less-than-credible sources believed this would happen with iOS 18, it never did. Recently, however, other leakers have said a visionOS-style redesign would instead debut with iOS 19 and macOS 16.Now, a report publication The Verifier, spotted by MacRumors, claims that watchOS 12 will receive the same visual treatment. The Apple Watch will reportedly contain user interface elements heavily inspired by the Apple Vision Pro operating system, with semi-transparent and revamped menus, icons, and more.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s Magic Mouse doesn’t usually go on sale—and we’ve never seen it this low. Apple’s Magic Mouse with a Lightning port is available for an all-time low of $60 at Woot right now, a savings of $20 and 25 percent off its MSRP. That’s not just a great a discount—it’s the lowest we’ve ever seen. This isn’t the newest version of the Magic Mouse, but other than a Lightning port instead of USB-C, it’s identical to the one Apple sells. You probably already know that you need to flip it upside down to charge it, but that’s the same with the newer model. If you don’t have Lightning cables anymore, don’t worry because there’s a USB-C to Lightning cable included in the box. You won’t even have to charge it that often because the internal battery will last for about a month before it needs your attention again. Apple’s Magic Mouse with a super low profile that features a single clickable surface with two customizable buttons and a multi-touch area that you can use to scroll and swipe with ease. The sleek design also allows you to glide across the desk however you need. So go and order your Apple Magic Mouse for $60 at Woot while you can still get one. Apple gear always sells out fast and this one is a clearance item so it’s likely to go quickly, so hurry up before they disappear like magic. Snag a 25% discount for the Apple Magic MouseBuy now at Woot",

Apple’s MagSafe technology, supported by all models of iPhone since the iPhone 12 (except the iPhone SE and 16e), presents a more efficient way of wirelessly charging compatible iPhones. MagSafe is the ring of magnets around the iPhone’s internal charging coil that senses compatible accessories and magnetically snaps securely into the most efficient charging position with the right accessories. With MagSafe, you’re less likely to wake up to find your phone wasn’t correctly placed on the wireless charger so didn’t charge at all! We have tested a lot of magnetic chargers—MagSafe, Qi2 and Compatible—and here inform you which one will work best for you. There are simple magnetic wireless chargers, multi-device chargers for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, travel chargers, car chargers and more. Best simple MagSafe chargers Best 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers Best 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers Best 4-in-1 MagSafe Chargers Best travel MagSafe chargers Best MagSafe charging stands with power banks Best MagSafe car charger Best wireless charging desk mat Best wireless charging sleeve Offering up to 25W power output in the right configuration, MagSafe charging is much faster than basic 7.5W magnetic wireless charging. A new Qi2 standard, supported by the iPhone 13/14/15/16 family (and unofficially the iPhone 12 but strangely not the latest 16e) offers similar 15W speed charging. MagSafe or Qi2 certification Apple certifies MagSafe accessories to ensures that the output charging is 15W for most iPhones, and up to 25W for iPhone 16 (with Apple’s new MagSafe charger only). Non-certified magnetic but “MagSafe-compatible” chargers are usually just 7.5W with a ring of magnets to hold your phone in place. Certified MagSafe chargers also have a single-wire NFC antenna that allows the iPhone to identify the device and a built-in magnetometer to prevent compass interference while you are using your iPhone while it’s charging. In our tests, 15W MagSafe and new Qi2 chargers are evenly matched for charging speeds. 7.5W MagSafe compatible chargers, as you might expect, take around twice as long—certainly in the early stages of charging. But don’t rule out 7.5W chargers as they are often high quality, nearly always noticeably cheaper and just take a while longer to fully charge an iPhone. The king of the hill is Apple’s new MagSafe charger which is definitely faster at 25W, but only with iPhone 16 or later. Foundry Simple vs multi-device magnetic chargers The most basic form of MagSafe or magnetic charger is the simple pad that latches on to the compatible iPhone. Some pads feature a pop-out arm so the iPhone can be propped up while charging. There are also products that can simultaneously charge an iPhone plus other Apple devices, such as an Apple Watch or wireless AirPods charging case. Note that the AirPods case must be of the wireless variety, and the original AirPods case lacked this functionality. The base of a multi-charger could also be used to charge a second iPhone but mostly not magnetically and at 5W rather than 7.5W, 15W, or 25W. Also see our round up of the Best Apple Watch chargers and stands. Best simple MagSafe chargers A simple MagSafe charging pad is the cheapest route to wireless iPhone charging. It’s still half as fast as using a standard Lightning or USB-C cable, however, and if you are going to the bother of connecting this product to a wall charger, why not just use a Lightning (iPhone 14 or earlier) or USB-C (iPhone 15 and up) cable? You can fast-charge an iPhone to 50% battery in under 30 minutes using a cable, while it takes around 50 minutes to wirelessly charge iPhone from 0 to 50% using even 15W MagSafe. That said, there are interesting options to choose from. After these we’ll look at more multi-functional MagSafe chargers. 1. Apple MagSafe Charger – Best simple MagSafe charger for fastest wireless Pros 15W for Qi2 and most iPhones 25W for iPhone 16 and up Cons Expensive, especially at 2m Price When Reviewed: $39 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $36 View Deal $36 View Deal $36 View Deal $36.99 View Deal $39 View Deal $39 View Deal $39 View Deal $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 25W (MagSafe), 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1m (3.3ft), 2m (6.6ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White The most obvious MagSafe Charger to buy for your Apple iPhone is, of course, the Apple MagSafe Charger. It’s the charger that Apple would have shipped with the iPhone if it did such things anymore. It’s as minimalist a design as you’d expect from Apple–it looks a lot like a giant Apple Watch Charger. You can also use it to charge your AirPods. Apple now sells a new version of this charger that offers 15W Qi2 support and, more importantly, a faster 25W charging speed with iPhone 16 (and later). It also added a 2-meter length option for $10/£10 more, which is very welcome. A 30W USB-C power adapter is required for 25W charging. In our tests using the Apple MagSafe Charger we wirelessly powered up an iPhone 16 Pro from 0% to 50% in just 30 minutes. The standard 1m cable is too short to comfortably charge and use your iPhone at the same time, or maybe stretch from a power socket to a nearby table, so we recommend the 2m upgrade. Don’t forget that this Apple charger still requires a USB-C power adapter—at least 20W if you want 15W charging and at least 30W to enable 25W charging. Twelve South An aesthetic partner is the Twelve South Forte Charging Stand pedestal, pictured above, that is a cradle for the Apple MagSafe Charger that can then hold the iPhone in portrait or landscape and tilts 70-degrees. Tilt the top back to create a flat platform for charging AirPods. It’s pricy for just a cradle but it effectively creates the only potential 25W wireless charging stand for the iPhone 16 and up. 2. Anker Qi2 MagGo Wireless Charger Pad – Best budget simple MagSafe charger Pros Fast 15W for iPhone 1.5m cable Inexpensive Price When Reviewed: $21.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Anker $21.99 View Deal $24.99 View Deal $29.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black, White Another basic magnetic charger, Anker’s MagGo Wireless Charger Pad works just like the Apple pad, and also at a fast 15W—although it’s technology is Qi2 rather than Apple MagSafe. iPhone 16 owners should consider spending the extra on the Apple charger (reviewed above) for its special 25W charging speed. Owners of iPhone 15 or earlier can rest assured that this charger is as fast as the Apple one. It works just as well, though, and is one of the cheaper premium magnetic chargers. The cable is a decent length at 1.5m—half again as long as that on the base model Apple MagSafe Charger pad, but not as long as on the top-end 2m Apple charger or the 2m Belkin MagSafe charger reviewed below. 3. Belkin BoostCharge Pro Portable Wireless Charger Pad 15W – Best simple MagSafe charger with stand Pros Fast 15W for iPhone 2m cable Built-in stand Cons High list price Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Belkin $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Cable: 2m (6.6ft) Wall charger: Optional Colors: Black, White Available in two predictable colors, the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Charger Pad is as fast as Apple’s Charger and comes with a longer cable and handy pop-up stand. The cable is twice as long as Apple’s, which makes using the phone much easier when charging. It’s also thicker nylon-braided cable with a handy integrated silicone cable tie. Its list price is higher than Apple’s, which is a surprise, so you’re paying a premium for the longer premium cable and the kickstand but we think it’s worth the extra if you must have a certified 15W MagSafe charger. Check our price comparison here for cheaper online prices. An alternative is the 15W Anker Qi2 MagGo pad, reviewed above, which has a 1.5m cable but no stand. Again, a straight cable connection will be faster but we like the kickstand, which you don’t get with a standard cable connection. You can buy with a 27W power adapter included or just on its own if you already have a wall charger to use. There are a few very similar Belkin Charger Pads so make sure you get what you’re after. For example, there is a slower but more affordable 7.5W MagSafe-compatible BoostCharge Charger Pad ($29 and sometimes cheaper from Amazon U.S. and Amazon U.K.) that lacks the stand. If you just want a cheap MagSafe-compatible charging pad, this is a decent option. Be warned: Belkin also sells a Qi Wireless Charging Pad that lacks the magnetic connection so is not recommended as it will be picky where the phone is placed and slower to charge as a result. 4. ESR HaloLock Kickstand Wireless Charger – Best budget magnetic charger with stand Pros Inexpensive Kickstand Color options Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $35.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $11.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White, Black, Blue, Pink This is a small, simple magnetic charging pad that has a kickstand that lets you prop your attached iPhone 12/13/14/15/16 up either in landscape or portrait mode for video viewing or hands-free FaceTime calls. It’s a more affordable but slightly slower alternative to the Belkin pad reviewed above. The detachable cable length is reasonable at 1.5m and matches the four colors, so is wildly more flamboyant than the other magnetic wireless chargers tested here, except for… 5. Casetify Magnetic Wireless Charger – Widest choice of fun designs Pros Hundreds of options Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $40 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Casetify $40 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Many cool and/or odd patterns We picked the English Breakfast pattern for its sheer wanton oddness but there are plenty of other patterns (Acid, Checks, Cherry Blossom) and pictures (Yeti, Harry Potter, Snoopy) to choose from. Indeed, there are a sometimes baffling 759 different wireless charger designs to choose from. Most are quite random but there are themes such as Street Art and Anime, plus characters such as Doreamon and SpongeBob, and individual artists, with the option to customize a plain charger with text. This 100% recyclable slim charger has eco sustainability points, too, as it’s made with recycled aluminum and printed with eco-friendly ink. 6. Anker MagGo Qi2 Wireless Charger Stand – Best budget magnetic charging stand Pros Fast 15W for iPhone Rotating charging pad Price When Reviewed: $35.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Anker $35.99 View Deal $39.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White, Black This simple magnetic charging stand has a rotating charging pad that means you can position your iPhone in landscape or portrait mode for hands-free FaceTime calls. It uses Qi2 so can charge wirelessly at 15W. While it’s more affordable, if you own AirPods too, you might consider the not-much-pricier 2-in-1 MagGo version, reviewed lower down. 7. Nomad Stand / Stand One – Sturdy but stylish 15W Qi2 and MagSafe charging stands Pros Fast 15W for iPhone 2m cable Robust stand Cons Non-adjustable charging pad Expensive for one-device charger Price When Reviewed: $100 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Nomad $100 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2 Stand or MagSafe Stand One) Cable: 2m (6.6ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black or White; Stand One: Carbite or Silver The Nomad Stand uses the MagSafe-based Qi2 magnetic wireless charging technology, so offers the same fast 15W charging speed as MagSafe at a reduced price. Nomad also sells a MagSafe version, the Stand One, for $10 more but everything is otherwise the same except for the color options: the Stand comes in Black or White, while the Stand One is available in Carbite (which really is black) and Silver. The Nomad Stand and Stand One look like 2-in-1 chargers, with the area at the back of the stand begging to be a simple Qi charging pad for your AirPods, but it’s an iPhone-only charger. It’s a lovely looking stand that is the sturdiest wireless charging stand we’ve tested, with a real heft and an anti-slip rubber base. It is decidedly heavy (1.35lbs or 613g), so could be used as a paperweight if you have your desk fan turned up too high. It’s made of metal with a glass panel that gives it a glossy look from the front. The 21-degree viewing angle works well for comfortable viewing but if you want to customize the angle to your own liking you’ll need to choose one of the more adjustable 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 wireless chargers reviewed below. Nomad does make a 3-in-1 version, the $180 Stand One Max, which can charge iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods at the same time. This also looks great and charges the iPhone at a rapid 15W. It does have a flaw, unfortunately, in that it can’t charge the iPhone in landscape orientation (for Apple’s StandBy mode) when charging a Watch at the same time as the two charging pads are too close to each other. Otherwise, it’s a fine-looking, if again a little expensive, fast charger. Best 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers Why restrict your charger to just one device? You can buy MagSafe chargers that tackle up to six different devices at the same time. Here, we start with basic 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers that can wirelessly charge your iPhone and AirPods case (the case must be wireless-charging enabled). Most multi-device chargers are stands but there are also folding travel chargers that work equally well full-time on your desk or nightstand or on the road with you at your hotel or office space. Some 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 magnetic chargers are more portable than others so make sure to keep reading this feature for our list of Best travel MagSafe chargers, which may better suit your needs than these more static chargers. 1. Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – Best 2-in-1 magnetic charger Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad Folds for travel Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $59.91 View Deal $79.99 View Deal $79.99 View Deal $79.99 View Deal Satechi $79.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.2 m (4ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Aluminum gray With a remarkably small 3.5-inch square (9cm) footprint, this 2-in-1 charger uses the new Qi2 wireless charging technology to match MagSafe on 15W speed. The AirPod charging pad charges at 5W and could be used to charge a second phone, although much slower than using the raised magnetic pad. It even folds up flat to make it travel friendly, although you’ll need to supply your own USB-C wall charger. It’s pretty light at just 9.6oz (272g). 2. Ugreen 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Charger Stand – Best budget 2-in-1 magnetic charging stand Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad USB-C port for Watch cable Compact and folds for travel Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1 m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Aluminum gray While the Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand, reviewed above, can fold into a portable package, it is nowhere near as compact and lightweight (7.5oz or 212g) as Ugreen’s 2-in-1 magnetic wireless charger, which folds down into a tiny pocketable cube (2.4 x 2.4 x 1.5 inches or 6 x 6 x 4cm). Once open there’s a 5W Qi pad for AirPods and a 15W Qi2 pad for iPhone. A USB-C port on one side allows you to plug in your Apple Watch charging cable for 5W speedy charging, too—so you can almost call it a 3-in-1 except that you need a Watch charging cable to connect. The iPhone-charging pad can be raised to about 3 inches (8cm), and can be angled to your preference. Ugreen also sells a cheaper $39 MagSafe-compatible 2-in-1 Magnetic Charger that charges the phone at a slower 7.5W. 3. Ugreen Qi2 15W 2-in-1 MagFlow MagSafe Charger Stand Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad Compact and folds for travel Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $34.99 View Deal $49.99 View Deal Ugreen $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1 m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Aluminum gray Ugreen also sells this flatter 2-in-1 that is also rated at 15W as it uses Qi2 wireless charging. Its iPhone charging module can be angled from 0 to 70 degrees. Folded flat it measures 4.6 x 2.2 x 0.9 inches (11.6 x 5.5 x 2.4cm). While this is an able, well-built and travel-friendly wireless charger, we prefer the company’s 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Charger Stand, reviewed above, as it features a spare USB-C port at its side for charging a third device. However, you may prefer its slimmer profile when folded for storage or travel. 4. Anker MagGo 2-in-1 Qi2 Wireless Charger Stand – Budget 2-in-1 magnetic charging stand Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $35.59 View Deal $49.99 View Deal Anker $49.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black or White The Anker MagGo range has a version for just about everyone, and this is a 2-in-1 version of the simpler iPhone-only magnetic wireless charger stand reviewed earlier. It is not portable like the Satechi and Ugreen 2-in-1 chargers, also reviewed above, but it is a good-looking stand for your desk or nightstand. Built to charge both an iPhone 12/13/14/15/16 and wireless AirPod case charger, it is reaches the same 15W phone charging heights with its Qi2 technology. The AirPods are charged at 5W, which is standard for all such multi-device magnetic chargers. You get angled landscape (up to 45 degrees) and portrait modes with this good-looking stand from one of our favorite premium accessory makers. The magnetic link is super strong so you don’t need to worry about the iPhone falling off even during re-angling. If you’re not in a hurry, you can still find the Anker 7.5W PowerWave model a little cheaper but we like the faster charge on the 15W version. If you’re in a real hurry you’d be better off using a cable than using even a 15W or 25W certified MagSafe charger anyway. 5. Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Wireless Charging Dock with MagSafe 15W – Best designer magnetic charger Pros Charges iPhone or AirPods and Watch Designer looks Fast 15W for iPhone Fast Apple Watch charging Includes 30W charger Cons Pricey Price When Reviewed: $119.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $101.99 View Deal $101.99 View Deal $119.95 View Deal $119.95 View Deal Belkin $119.99 View Deal $119.99 View Deal $119.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide View more prices Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: 30W AC power adapter Colors: Charcoal, Sand We’ve chosen this fast magnetic charger not because of its heroically long-winded name but for its designer good looks. It’s a minimalist 2-in-1 charging stand that can wirelessly charge an iPhone at 15W and fast-charge an Apple Watch. The top pad can angle at up to 70 degrees. Steve Jobs and Jony Ive knew that tech should aspire to timeless design, and it’s no surprise that Apple has chosen to stock the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Dock MagSafe charger in its stores. There are other magnetic wireless chargers reviewed here that can do more and at lower prices, but this is one we’d proudly place on our designer desk to show off rather than hide away. The dock’s organic looks are complemented by the two available neutral yet naturalistic colors: Charcoal and Sand.

Although it doesn’t include an Apple Watch charging module, there is a 5W USB-C port that you can connect your Watch-charging cable into and charge all three devices simultaneously. It might not be as pretty a 3-in-1 solution as its own MagSafe-certified Boost Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad, reviewed above, but as a 2-in-1 solution it is cheaper and better suited for those who haven’t succumbed to every Apple device available. Being certified as Qi2 means that it can wirelessly charge at the same 15W as official MagSafe chargers but not 25W like the Apple MagSafe Charger can for the iPhone 16 and later. Belkin Belkin also sells a MagSafe version (at the same 15W as the Qi2 model) in a richer range of colors, including orange, pink and purple, exclusively through the Apple Store (and U.K. Apple Store). Both versions are reassuringly heavy so you won’t pull it off your bedside table when you remove your iPhone from the magnetic pad. This makes it less obviously portable, but it’s small and flat enough to slip into a backpack. As it’s a pad you can’t angle the phone into StandBy mode. If you want to more easily see the time on your nightstand, consider one of the charging stands reviewed above. It ships with a 30W USB-C wall charger and cable. Best 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers If you have brought full-in on the Apple product ecosystem, and have iPhone, AirPods and an Apple Watch, there are some great 3-in-1 magnetic chargers that will wirelessly charge all three devices simultaneously. 3-in-1 charging stands save you precious desk space or keep your nightstand or bedside table clear of clutter, while ensuring that you don’t run out of power during the day. 1.

It offers fast 15W iPhone wireless charging and 5W Apple Watch fast charging in a small-footprint design (3.7-inch square base) that tucks the Apple Watch charger at the back. The Watch charger is detachable, meaning you can remove it and take it with you to plug directly into any USB-C charging port. This is a useful option missing from most other 3-in-1 chargers. Where this charger excels is wireless charging speed. Although it offers the same 15W speed, a fan-based cooling technology called CryoBoost with advanced heat-dissipation that makes the operation more battery friendly—resulting in significantly faster charging times. In our tests the Qi2-based ESR 3-in-1 Charger with CryoBoost took only 10 minutes longer to charge an iPhone 16 Pro to 50% than Apple’s 25W MagSafe Charger, reviewed at the top of this article. The ESR’s Qi2 pad is not adjustable, although you can position the iPhone in either landscape (StandBy) or portrait orientations. In this way it lacks the front-facing flexibility of the HiRise 3 Deluxe, but it is available at a significantly lower price and much faster. It comes with a decent-length cable and a 30W USB-C wall charger. Its closest rival in looks is the Journey Trio 3-in-1, reviewed below, which also features a detachable Watch charger. In terms of budget, it’s a close run race with the Anker Qi2 MagGo 3-in-1 Stand, which has a different design and a more powerful USB-C charger. Check the prices to see which is the most affordable at the time of reading. A slightly cheaper non-CryoBoost model can be found on Amazon and from ESR direct. If you can spend the extra on the CryoBoost model (Amazon / ESR) the cooling tech should make charging faster. Read our full ESR Qi2 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station with CryoBoost review 2.

It has the same small 3.5-inch square (9cm) footprint, and Qi2 wireless charging technology to match MagSafe on 15W speed. The AirPod charging pad charges at 5W and could instead charge a second phone, although much slower than with the MagSafe pad. Apple Watch charging is fast, with the back-mounted pad providing 5W of power. It too folds up flat to make it travel friendly, and this time comes with a 45W USB-C chargers that is further boosted with U.K. and E.U. travel adapters. For a 3-in-1, it’s light at just 10.7oz (302g). The cuter and more compact Anker 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below, weighs 14.3oz (405g). It’s not as affordable as the ESR so misses our budget recommendation. However, with its foldability and travel plugs, this makes a great charging station choice for at base and on your travels—see lower down for more best MagSafe travel chargers. if you don’t mind the Watch at the back, this charger’s flexibility and fast speeds makes it an easy recommendation. 3. Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe – Most adjustable 3-in-1 MagSafe charger Pros 3-in-1 charging Fast 15W for iPhone Fast charge Watch Adjustable pad Includes charger Cons Only in black Not the fastest on iPhone Price When Reviewed: $149.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $99.99 View Deal $119.99 View Deal $119.99 View Deal Twelve South $149.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: 40W AC power adapter Colors: Black A 3-in-1 charger that can re-power iPhone, AirPods and Watch is a boon for Apple fans, but most of the products we’ve tested take up quite a lot of desk space. The stylish HiRise 3 Deluxe, as its name suggests, goes more vertical and so has a smaller footprint—handy for bedside tables and other places where a giant charging stand is less welcome. It is fully Apple certified, so can fast-charge any MagSafe iPhone (iPhone 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 models but not SE) at 15W as well as fast-charge an Apple Watch (Series 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra) at 5W and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd generation AirPods, and all AirPods Pro) at 7.5W. That said, in tests we did find the HiRise 3 noticeably slower than some chargers when powering up an iPhone. Look to the ESR Qi2 3-in-1 Charger with CryoBoost if you want the fastest iPhone wireless charging in a multi-device format, although that stand is not as adjustable as this one. It’s 6 inches (15.4cm) high, 3.4in (8.5cm) wide and 6.3in (15.9cm) deep. In comparison, the Belkin 3-in-1 is 13.5cm wide. For an even smaller footprint, consider the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station, reviewed below. The MagSafe iPhone charger can angle and tilt by 35-degrees, and hold the device in either landscape or portrait—so works well in iOS StandBy mode. The Watch charger is also tiltable and we like the way everything but the AirPods case is front-facing. The base charges at 7.5W and can be used to power up AirPods or a second iPhone, and the Watch part fast charges at 5W.

You could pay half again for a full MagSafe 3-in-1 charger that offers the same 15W iPhone power. It too offers fast 15W iPhone wireless charging and 5W Apple Watch fast charging but in a coat-stand design that is sturdy and with iPhone and Watch facing the front. This differs from the ESR charger, which places a detachable Watch charger at the back. We prefer the Watch at the front so we can still interact with it, but it does make the stand’s base larger (5.5 inch diameter vs ESR’s 3.7-inch square base). Neither the iPhone or Watch charging pad is tiltable. You can, however, position the iPhone in either landscape (StandBy) or portrait orientations. It comes with a 5-foot cable and a powerful 40W USB-C wall charger. 5.

The iPhone can be rotated in either portrait or landscape mode, but it can’t be angled up or down. This is where the Anker charger wins out in the battle of the affordable 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers. If you are buying in Australia (Alogic is an Australian company), you get a 20W charger, but elsewhere you’ll need to use your own wall charger. While this was once a great price point, the arrival of Qi2-based 15W 3-in-1 chargers has brought faster charging down to the same ball park of under $100. As such, the ESR Qi2 3-in-1 and Anker MagGo 3-in-1 represent better value than the Alogic MagSpeed 3-in-1 Wireless Charger—although you may prefer this design. 6.

Although on the heavy side, it’s super-compact and great for travel. The Watch charging part is hidden in the cube until you need it. It comes with a 30W USB-C wall charger with switchable UK and EU plug fittings that slide onto the US plug prongs. Its tiny footprint means it takes up little space on your desk or bedside cable, too. If you don’t own an Apple Watch, consider the equally dinky Ugreen 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand, reviewed in our 2-in-1 roundup above. The stand works in landscape and portrait orientations but isn’t high. It does have adjustable viewing angles up to 60°. A similar 3-in-1 charger from the same company is the A-frame Anker 737 MagGo, which can also simultaneously charge an iPhone (at 15W), AirPods and Watch. Aside from the shape, the only real difference from the Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe is that the slightly cheaper 737 doesn’t support fast-charging for the Apple Watch. 7.

In fact, it beats its nearest competition, the Belkin Boost Charge 3-in-1 Wireless Charing Pad, reviewed below, not just on price but on flexibility. Where the Belkin features an adjustable Watch charging module (for Nightstand mode) like the Anker, its iPhone charging pad only allows for a flat placement, while the Anker has a pad that can be raised and tilted 90-180 degrees—it could even be described as a stand/pad combo.

It’s a little shorter and comes with a more powerful 45W wall charger plus international travel plugs (US, UK, EU). It has 15W iPhone Qi2 charging, 5W Apple Watch fast charge and 5W AirPods Qi charging pad. The iPhone pad can be raised to create a stand, just like the Anker. The Anker charger is cheaper so look out for discounts to see if the Satechi can get close on price. With a vegan leather base, the Satechi beats the Anker on looks but otherwise the two are near identical in function. In fact, it beats its nearest competition, the Belkin Boost Charge 3-in-1 Wireless Charing Pad, reviewed below, not just on price but on flexibility.

This model is a flat pad that also includes the possibility to leave the Watch in Nightstand mode as a bedside or desk clock. We would have preferred if the phone charger could also be angled to prop up the phone for video viewing, like you can with the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Pad reviewed above. While minimalist in design, it does take up a fair section of desk–measuring about 23cm across and 8cm wide, and the iPhone sticks out at either side. It’s around the same size as the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Pad. The pad format is better for travel portability than a charging stand, and it comes with its own wall power supply unit, so you don’t need to add your own USB-C charger. 10.

This is more stylish that other wireless charging stands, having a Sixties space-age design with chrome arms, and a silicone-covered plastic base. A stand is useful as it lifts the charging phone to a height that makes it easier to FaceTime or watch videos without having to hold the phone aloft. It can hold the phone in either portrait or landscape mode. In order to support the weight of the phone, the circular base has to be quite wide, at 13.5cm. For a smaller footprint 3-in-1 charger consider the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe or OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station—both reviewed above.

The charging modules are fixed, which doesn’t give you any flexibility for adjusting the phone position aside from choosing whether to place it in either landscape or portrait orientation.

Any MagSafe iPhone (12/13/14/15/16) can be wirelessly charged at up to 15W, faster than non-certified MagSafe-compatible chargers. AirPods and Apple Watch will each charge wirelessly at 5W. The iPhone can be placed in either portrait or landscape mode. At the back is a stand where you can place an iPad, which can be wired charged via a side-mounted USB-C port at up to 30W. All devices can be charged simultaneously as the power supply has a 65W total output. The Watch module that ships with the 4-in-1 charger can handily be situated on either the right- or left-hand side depending on your preference. Modules attach magnetically. The Apple Watch extension can be disconnected from the main station and charged via a USB-C port to become a standalone wireless charger when traveling. Another Zens product that can charge four devices at the same time, the aluminum Zens 4-in-1 MagSafe + Watch Charging Station ($109.99) is also certified Made for MagSafe so can fast-charge an iPhone 12/13/14/15/16 at 15W. The base features a 5W Qi charging pad allows for charging wirelessly rechargeable AirPods or other Qi compatible device, but the Watch charger isn’t rated as fast-charge like some you’ll find on other products reviewed here. The fourth device is charged using a side-mounted USB-C port, so is wired rather than wireless like the parts for iPhone, Watch and AirPods. Rated at 18W charging, this USB-C connection can fast-charge another iPhone or charge an iPad. The supplied 45W wall charger comes with US, UK and EU adapter plugs so you can take the Zens 4-in-1 Charging Station on your travels. 2.

The 5W Watch charging pad is certified for fast-charge. The Hyper Juice Next is the most portable 4-in-1 MagSafe charger we have tested as the iPhone and Watch stand folds down to a flatter, more travel-friendly shape. The 45W power supply also comes with international plug heads for U.S., U.K., E.U. and A.N.Z. There’s also a further uSB-C port for input only, but useful if you’d rather not carry the power supply with you on your journey or just want to plug it into an existing multi-port charger at home. The base is solid but the overall 664g weight might put you off travelling with it in your hand luggage. Best travel MagSafe chargers Many multi-device magnetic chargers take the form of elegant and frankly quite bulky stands that are designed to sit on a desk or bedside table/nightstand and stay there. Having a 3-in-1 MagSafe charger that can slip in a pocket, handbag or backpack would be even more useful when traveling between offices, homes or hotels. Thankfully, there are some truly great 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 travel-friendly portable MagSafe chargers, and we have tested the best of them here. 1.

It measures 2.36 x 2.36 x 1.4 inches (6 x 6 x 3.6cm) when folded and weighs just 3.8oz (108g). The 5W Watch-charging module folds on the top. The iPhone mostly lays flat, but it can be placed into a more useful StandBy mode as a stand with some folding wizardry. There are other 15W 3-in-1 foldable charger contenders—for example, the $109 Kuxiu X40Q 3-In-1, reviewed below.

Twelve South You can save some money but have a greater choice of colors with the company’s $99 ButterFly SE version, pictured above, which uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe but at the same 15W charging speed.

The 5W Watch-charging module is tucked away on the underside and can lie flat or sit up at an angle for Nightstand mode. The Qi2 pad raises to create a stand for your iPhone, in either portrait or landscape mode for StandBy mode. You can also charge an iPhone with the charger folded and the Qi2 pad on top.

It’s special because it folds up into such a compact aluminum alloy package—measuring 2.7-x-2.7-x-1.2 inches (6.8-x-6.8-x-3cm). It weighs 7.4oz (210g). The Kuxiu X55 3-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger is a more affordable ($50 / £59) solution, but charges the iPhone at 7.5W rather than 15W. The X40Q also feels sturdier in action but as a budget option the X55 is worth considering for your travels. We also like the ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set, reviewed below, which is an inch longer and a little wider, but nearly half the depth. The Kuxiu 3-in-1 chargers beat the ESR because their Apple Watch chargers are integrated and not an attachable module. Again, it’s horses for courses—if you like the idea of having a detachable Watch charger that you can carry separately, then the ESR takes the crown. The Journey SWIV 3-in-1, reviewed below, is a little larger but noticeably lighter, and also can fast-charge the Apple Watch. It lies flat so doesn’t have the stand function. 5.

It’s lightweight and foldable, which makes it a great travel solution if you own iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. Both the Kuxiu X55 and the Evolved 3-in-1 Foldable Charger are a more compact package for Apple Watch and iPhone owners because their Watch-charging modules are built-in. The Journey SWIV is about the same weight as the ESR but without the detachable nature of the Watch charger. It also can fast-charge a Watch unlike the ESR or Evolved foldable chargers. It measures 4.5-x-2.6-x-0.63 inches (11.3-x-6.6-x-1.6cm). There’s a smart travel case included that fits in the 20W charger, cable, Watch attachment and folding charging stand. 7.

While it’s not the fastest wireless charger (7.5W iPhone and 2W Watch) you can connect a cable to the power bank’s 18W USB-C port for speedy charging. The OtterBox 2-in-1 Power Bank with MagSafe, reviewed below, offers faster wireless charging (15W and 5W) but is a much chunkier slab to carry around as the power bank is integrated rather than detachable. 2.

It can charge an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods wireless charging case at the same time, plus you can detach the iPhone charging pad and take it with you as a power bank. You can also detach the Apple Watch charger and slot that into any charging USB-C port, including that on the power bank. On top of all that, you can fold the whole thing up and pack it in its own carry case. Fully certified, it boasts 15W wireless iPhone charging, and can fast-charge a Watch at the same time. The power bank’s battery capacity is 5000mAh, which in our tests gave us nearly a three-quarter recharge. There are alternatives, such as the OneAdaptr OneGo, reviewed below, that feature a 10000mAh power bank with much higher recharge potential—but none are rated as fast at charging as the Matrix Ultimate. Read our full Alogic Matrix Ultimate Fold 3-in-1 Stand with Power Bank review Best MagSafe car charger In the old days cars had cigarette-lighter sockets, but today a power/charging port for your phone or other device is more common. A magnetic wireless charger in your car is the latest must-have gadget and we’ve tested a bunch to find the best on offer. 1. Belkin Boost Charge Pro Wireless Car Charger with MagSafe – Best MagSafe car charger Pros 15W for iPhone Dedicated car accessory Cons Not compatible with all car vents Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Belkin $79.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Cable: Built-in Wall charger: 12V car charger included Colors: White Use your iPhone for satnav directions or to have easy access to your playlists in the car with this MagSafe-certified wireless charger and car vent mount, which works in both landscape and portrait modes. It has an integrated USB-C cable, and a 12V car charger adapter for cars that come with USB-A ports. The magnetic link is strong, which should mean that it can cope with any big bumps in the road. It works best with straight, horizontal vent slats up to 3mm in thickness and 20mm in depth. It does work with vertical slats, but there might be slight movements if the mount is overloaded with weight, says Belkin. As one of the the first dedicated MagSafe-certified 15W car mount available, it is expensive compared to some. If you can handle a lower charger rate, the Belkin BoostCharge Magnetic Wireless Car Charger 10W does pretty much the same job for a lot less. Or you can buy Spigen’s Mag Fit Phone Holder Car Mount and add Apple’s MagSafe Charger (reviewed above) for pretty much the same 15W result. That product is also available in black, like most car vents. 2.

No competitor offers a comparable range of functions. What makes the MagEX Car Mount Pro 2 unique is its built-in NFC support and ability to work with iOS’s Shortcuts app. The NFC chips can trigger a short command when the iPhone is held over them. For example, when getting into the car, the NFC can trigger the iPhone to set the focus to “Do not disturb” and play your favorite music.  Pitaka also offers a version for Tesla Model 3 and Y cars.

ESR Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Car Charger (Halolock) – Best budget MagSafe car charger Pros 15W for iPhone Dedicated car accessory Inexpensive Cons Not compatible with all car vents Car charger not included Price When Reviewed: $35.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $19.99 View Deal ESR $35.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black While still able to charge at a fast 15W Qi2 chargers are mostly cheaper than the Apple-certified MagSafe—but as Qi2 is based on MagSafe you have nothing to fear choosing this cheaper option. It comes with a 1m USB-C cable, with USB-A adapter if your car still has that older standard. You can clip it into the slats on your car’s air vent (ESR says it is compatible with 99% of all cars, which we can’t verify) or you can use the included 3M adhesive mount for a semipermanent attachment to your car’s dashboard—don’t use this on a nice leather or fabric (or curved) dash. Best wireless charging desk mat 1. Journey ALTI Wireless Charging Desk Mat Pros Stylish charging desk mat Reversible Cons 7.5W for iPhone Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Journey $129.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black, Light Gray This smart desk mat includes a detachable side strip that includes a magnetic wireless charging pad for phone and a non-magnetic section to charge your AirPods. Not only is the mat reversible, with smooth, wipeable vegan leather on one side and warmer-feel felt on the other, but you can pull back the mat to stow paper and notes to help reduce clutter. It’s quite a large mat, measuring 780 x 70 x 4mm. The Light gray color is actually more of a warm stone tone. The charging panel connects to the mat with a light magnetic snap, and can be positioned on either side simply by flipping the mat round 180 degrees, depending on whether you are left or right handed. As it’s MagSafe compatible rather than certified, it charges the iPhone at 7.5W rather than 15W, but will charge other compatible phones at the higher power. Earbuds can be charged at up to 5W. The magnetic fit is strong so you can’t knock it off its charging position with a stray flick of an arm. Journey Journey also offers a faster and fancier version of the Alti. The Journey Alti Play, available in the US for $139.99 or Australia for AU$159.99, offers faster wireless iPhone charging (15W vs the Alti’s 7.5W) and cool button-controlled ambient nine-color RGB lighting effects with that will attract gamers or anyone who wants to add some effects to their workspace. As with the original Alti the magnetic charging panel can be attached to either the right or left side. It does differ in having just one non-reversible side but its fine-weave microfibre lycra cloth surface is designed for a more precise mouse action. The rubber anti-slip underside keeps the mat firmly in place. All Alti wireless charging desk mats come with a USB-C cable but require a charger; recommended 30W or higher. Best wireless charging laptop sleeve Protect your MacBook and charge your wireless devices at the same time. 1. Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging Pros Luxury MacBook sleeve MagSafe-compatible charging Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Journey $129.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black, Light Gray The premium-quality, vegan leather Journey NEXA laptop sleeve bills itself as a “4-in-1”, and it certainly is multi-functional. As well as protecting your laptop during travel, it includes two wireless chargers (one MagSafe compatible at 7.5W; one 5W for AirPods or a second phone) and can work as both a desk mat and mousepad to free your workspace of clutter. While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the best iPhone chargers) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful MacBook charger. Read our full Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging review Why wireless? Wireless charging is convenient and fine for situations when you don’t need a super-fast recharge. If you’re leaving your home in 20 minutes and need as much juice as possible, plug in the Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 or later) as even a 12W USB charger can power up an iPhone a third faster than wireless, and 50% faster if you use a 20W USB-C PD charger. It is less wearing than constantly inserting a cable into your phone, and more reliable as that vulnerable cable port can fill with fluff and dust after all the time spent in your trouser pocket or bag and it’s one of the most common reasons that an iPhone refuses to charge even when connected with a cable. It’s easy to clean with a toothpick (but please do it softly!) but will affect most of us at some time. Wireless charging isn’t affected by the build-up of dust and fluff in the phone port and is also less vulnerable to oxidation and corrosion. With wireless, you don’t have to remember to run around trying to find who’s taken your charging cable, and it’s certainly a lot neater. Of course, wireless charging is not really wireless, unless you are using a portable MagSafe battery pack. The MagSafe charger is still connected by a cable to your wall charger; it’s just the connection to the phone that is properly wireless. What else you need Some MagSafe chargers come with their own wall charger, but most require you to add your own. Apple recommends at least a 20W USB-C power adapter (wall-socket charger) and we agree. Except for the 25W Apple Charger you won’t get over 15W charging power from a MagSafe charger to the iPhone, but 20W all but guarantees you’ll get as much power as you can. We have tested the best iPhone wall chargers to help you choose a recommended solution.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
