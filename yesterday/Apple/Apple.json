    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/229086/best-laptop-bags-2.html",
    "description": "Macworld A good MacBook bag shares many qualities with Apple’s laptops. We want it to be tough, so it needs to be made from good materials. We want to use it for multiple tasks, so it needs to have plenty of pockets and compartments. Let’s admit it, with the diminishing number of ports on the MacBook, the bags often have the edge. And since we all admire good design here, we certainly don’t mind if the bag looks fantastic. Plus, whatever MacBook you’ve got, Air or Pro, you’ve probably spent enough on it that you don’t want to risk it breaking—and don’t mind spending just a little more to keep it safe. There’s no shortage of companies out there that make protective accessories for MacBooks, from laptop bags and rucksacks to sleeves, covers, and cases that clip on directly, and plenty of them do their best to be just as stylish as the Mac they’re protecting. We’ve rounded up a selection of our favorite cases, sleeves, backpacks, roll-tops, shells and totes for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, whether you have a 13-, 14-, 15- or 16-inch model, to keep your Mac safe. All of the bags below fit those criteria, but we’ve been careful to choose bags that meet specific needs. Keep in mind that every bag here won’t fit every MacBook, but if a bag can’t handle the 16-inch MacBook Pro, we’ve been sure to make a note of it.

The sleeve snaps shut with a neat magnetic bumper. Available in Black, Slate, Navy, Bronze and a leather-free Saltbush. Bellroy Apple sells only one MacBook sleeve in its online store: the leather-free Bellroy Caddy for Mac Laptops, which is available in two sizes for 13-14-inch MacBooks and the 15- and 16-inch MacBooks.

When you arrive at the office, hotel or just back home, it doubles up as a deskpad with chargers for your iPhone (7.5W MagSafe) and AirPods (5W). While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the best iPhone chargers) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful MacBook charger.

It comes in Black, Granite Black, and Slate Blue depending. The slim shoulder bag protects your laptop by suspending it, so that it doesn’t touch the bottom of the bag. It’s also encased in foam. The shoulder strap is easy to adjust and has a non-slip pad to make it more comfortable. With a subtle luggage trolley sleeve, it can slip onto the telescopic handle of a suitcase for easy of use when not on your back—handy for busy travel interchanges and crowded trains and buses. It’s well-made, with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coated webbing handles with rivets, reverse coil zippers, and water-repellent C6DWR coating applied to the fabric. Inside there are plenty of sections and pockets (we counted 10 but there could be even more hidden away) to help with organization. Cable-routing means you can charge your laptop or other devices while still in the bag. if you fancy something more business-like check out the Troubadour Apex Briefcase, reviewed further down, which is smarter but costs a fair amount more than the STM Myth.

Pakt Travel Backpack 2.0 – Best MacBook travel backpack Pros Premium build Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Multiple carry options AirTag pocket Sustainable materials Price When Reviewed: From $325 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Pakt $325 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $325 at Pakt Fits: up to 16-inch We haven’t found a laptop backpack that beats the Pakt Travel Backpack for storage smarts, comfort and versatility. There are many imitators but this remains our favorite, and there’s a recent version 2.0 that makes it even better and more environmentally friendly. The 35L backpack model meets the carry-on criteria for most airlines. It weighs 4.1lbs, and measures 21.5 x 12.5 x 8 inches (55 x 32 x 21 cm). The 45L backpack, however, exceeds those limits so you’ll have to pray that you’re not pulled aside as you check-in or board the plane. It weighs 4.4lbs, and is sized 23 x 13 x 9 inches (60 x 33 x 24 cm). You can use it as a backpack, but also hide away the straps and carry by the side handles as a duffle or via a top handle. This might make the 45L bag appears smaller than it looks strapped to your back, and you can get it through check-in with all that extra storage. An expansion pocket adds additional packing space without adding to these dimensions. Check your favorite airline for carry-on limits. It features a handy clamshell interior with two compartments, so you can pack the backpack like a suitcase. Spread out open, it should fit under a bed or couch, saving you from unpacking to a wardrobe for short stays. Between the compartments, a padded sleeve gives robust but luxury protection to your MacBook (up to 16 inches). You can access the laptop from the top, making a security check much less hassle. There’s a multi-section front admin pocket that will handle a bunch of tech gear you might need close to hand, such as AirPods, chargers, power banks and cables, or even an iPad. There’s also a key leash in this part. Pakt sells a 15L Everyday Bag that can fit inside the Travel Backpack. On the plane, you could remove this and store by your feet for easy access, and then slide it back in the pack when you take that out of the overhead when you disembark. There are so many great extra features: the water-bottle holder is generous in size yet a tight elasticated hold; a zipped, hidden pocket at the back and bottom of the pack is handy for placing your phone, wallet and pocket fodder when you are passing through airport security; one of the pocket sections includes a deep AirTag holder; you can pull out hidden accessory straps on one side; and there’s roller-luggage passthrough to give your back a rest. With this version 2.0 of its Travel Backpack, Pakt uses rNylon (recycled nylon), which it claims can be recycled indefinitely—making it a more sustainable material than even rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate). It is covered in a water-repelling, tear-resistant PFC-free DWR coating, and is available in either Black, Forest or Ocean colors. Stubble \u0026 Co The Roll Top 20L – Best MacBook roll-top backpack Pros Premium look and feel Plenty of accessible pockets Striking range of colors Price When Reviewed: $170 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Stubble \u0026 Co $170 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $170 at Stubble \u0026 Co Fits: 13-inch (15L bag) and 13-16-inch (20L) versions A roll top bag is simple to use as they have fewer straps and zips than a traditional backpack. They feature a wide top opening so you can quickly see what’s inside and make it easier to reach in and pull out your belongings. It is adjustable in volume as unused space can saved and bulking reduced by rolling up the top flap as you close it. Tighten the strap to condense the loa or loosen when more space is required. Previously we have championed the Ogio Alpha Convoy 525r Rolltop Backpack, which I have used happily for several years. However, our heads and minds have been turned by Stubble \u0026 Co’s The Roll Top, available in either 15L or 20L capacities. We tested the spacier 20L model. Its more waterproof than the Ogio and has smarter colour accents as well as eight overall color options: Black, Yellow, Urban Green, Arctic White, Tasmin Blue, Concrete, Sand and Ember Orange. The padded laptop compartment is easily accessed at the side of the bag. The 20L version fits up to a 16-inch MacBook; the 15L allows for a 13-inch laptop. Inside the laptop compartment and also lining inside the main bag are contrasting colours: inside the black, white, concrete and green bags, it’s a striking orange. The main compartment has a reinforced, magnetised roll top closure. I’m used to a more click-tight buckle fastening but am getting the hang of the G-hook fastener. There are five internal organiser pockets, including two with mesh. On each side are generous elasticated side pockets for your water bottle, umbrella or bike lock. And, an essential if carrying the bag off your back, there’s a top grab handle. Roll-tops are often used by cycle couriers for their fast, easy access, and the Stubble \u0026 Co Roll Top features a bike light anchor and reflective trim for enhanced visibility and road safety.

While this smart and stylish, without being too formal, laptop briefcase is called Rugged, its looks and build quality are at the luxury end of the laptop bag scale—and it’s priced accordingly, although it’s not over the top for a premium business briefcase that’s handmade by expert craftsmen in Spain.

That said, we wouldn’t take this laptop briefcase out hiking in the woods—it’s just too lovely to dump in some mud outside your tent.

Harber London Nomad Organiser – Best Premium Organizer for MacBook Pros Pockets for tech organization Premium luxury leather looks Can hold MacBook and iPad Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Bulks up quickly if over-stuffed Expensive Price When Reviewed: $404 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Harber London $404 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $404 at Harber London Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch While a laptop seems like a self-contained unit, with keboard, screen, trackpad, hard drive and everything all in one tidy package, it’s not quite as easy as that. You need a charger and charging cable for starters, and when you’re on the move you have to carry around your AirPods, and maybe you prefer a proper mouse to the MacBook’s trackpad. And what if you have an iPad to work on, too? A simple sleeve can’t cope with all that lot, but the Nomad Organiser, from luxury bag maker Harber London, certainly can. The Nomad has ten pockets: a padded one for your MacBook Pro, and another padded pocket that fits an iPad from 9.7 to 12.9 inches, and capacious enough to handle the tablet with a Smart Cover. Be warned, though, that holding both laptop and tablet, the sleeve can be tricky to close if you are stuffing in chargers and other tech too. One lower pocket is big enough for your MacBook charger, but you’ll notice a bump in the fine lines when closed. I prefer to keep my bulky stuff in a wider-opening bag—check out our favorite tech organizer bags—and use this sleeve for the thinner essentials. Two pockets are zipped for safe-keeping (for example, cash or memory cards) and there’s a handy key fob strap. There’s a couple of holders for pens or an Apple Pencil. There’s a phone pocket, too, but I’m not sure I’d want all my devices in one place, and most of us prefer our phone at hand in a pocket or more-easy-to-dip-in bag. If you do, it’s large enough for a Pro Max iPhone. Below that pocket are a couple of slots for credit or travel cards, and above it are five straps that will hold an AirPods case, cables and even an AirTag—after, all, at this price, even the sleeve on its own is definitely worth keeping tabs on at all times. I’d have preferred elasticated straps for a firmer hold but I can appreciate the all-leather design looks super lush. You can carry the Nomad Organiser under your arm, via a subtle built-in handle, or you can attach a matching strap to sling it over your shoulder like a messenger bag. It is a premium MacBook sleeve, handcrafted with full-grain Spanish leather, and really does shout cool luxury. Available in Tan, Dark Brown, Black and Navy. Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman – Quality, luxury leather MacBook sleeve Pros Good quality and unique Cons Gaps at the bottom make it less waterproof Expensive Price When Reviewed: $197 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Manuel Dreesman $197 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $197 at Manuel Dreesman Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch The Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman isn’t cheap at $197/£153/€175, but you get luxury MacBook protection. It’s a slim leather sleeve that the MacBook slots into. I tried the 13-inch MacBook Air version, but there’s a sleeve for every current MacBook size, and the company says they can make a sleeve for any laptop. Manuel Dreesman is an independent atelier of handcrafted leather products, based in Barcelona, Spain. It ships all over the world. Sliding it in at first was a bit tight, but it got easier over time, leather being one of those materials that gets softer with use. The gaps at the bottom of the case, which probably make it easier to slide it in and out, stop it from being as waterproof or as protective as it might otherwise be. The sleeve comes in a range vegetable-tanned leather colors. We tested the tan version, but there’s also black, cream, red, green, blue, orange, light blue and light green on offer.  Leather is a good choice for a case like this, but it’s an expensive choice. Manuel Dreesmann claims that it sources the leather locally and that it is fine grain, which means it’s top quality. It makes the cases in its workshop in Barcelona using traditional techniques and ships all over the world.  Read our full Manuel Dreesmann Leather Case review Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets Wool felt interior Cons No sealed pockets Price When Reviewed: $98 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price $84.13 View Deal Harber London $98 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket $84.13 at Amazon$98 at Harber London Fits: 11-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Similar to the Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve, reviewed above, the Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve is made from premium full grain leather and features outside pockets to store your charger and cables. It looks classy and is available in tan or black. There are versions for all recent models of MacBook. It boasts a soft but protective dense 100% wool felt interior that will keep your MacBook cosy.

We recommend getting a well padded backpack that is designed for carrying a laptop. A well designed backpack will include lots of areas insider the bag to store things in: such as a front pocket, a large main compartment and a large side pocket. Quilted shoulder straps and a padded back should ensure the backpack is comfortable to wear. It’s pricy, but the Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe is a good option.

    "description": "Macworld Many of us are quite used to carrying around a handy power bank to top up our iPhone batteries during a long day away from a power socket, but these pocketable battery packs are usually not powerful enough to keep an unplugged and energy-hungry MacBook going all day. We’ve rounded up the best portable laptop power banks with battery capacities high enough to recharge a fading Apple MacBook if you won’t be able to plug it into an electrical outlet for some time. Despite new laptops boasting improved battery life duration, it’s easy for your trusty MacBook to lose power after a day of intense meetings and PowerPoint presentations. No one wants to see the Mac’s “Your battery is running low” warning, especially when halfway through watching a downloaded Netflix series on a long-haul flight. We looked at seven main factors for recommending laptop power banks: battery capacity, charging speed, total power output, power input, USB ports, portability and safety. Power bank battery capacity The larger the laptop power bank’s capacity the more charges it will be able to give your MacBook. While nearly all laptop power banks give their battery capacity in milliamp hours (mAh) it’s more instructional to know the battery capacity in watt hours (Wh) as Wh provides a more accurate estimation of a battery’s energy capacity for devices with varying power requirements. A 13-inch MacBook Air has a battery capacity of around 50Wh. The 16-inch MacBook Pro’s battery is rated at nearly twice that—just under 100Wh. To find out the Wh rating of your MacBook, check our our list of all the MacBook battery capacities. In theory, a 100Wh power bank could recharge the smaller laptop twice and the larger one once. While it’s not quite that simple, you will certainly get more charge from a power bank with a higher Wh rating. Watt hours is also the measure used by airlines to determine whether you can carry the power bank onto a plane with you: see below our list of the best MacBook power banks for national and international in-flight battery regulations. Manufacturers are required to mark lithium-ion batteries with the watt-hour rating, but it’s often not clearly indicated on the packaging or on the power bank itself—look for some tiny writing on one side of the battery pack and you’ll eventually find the Wh rating. Don’t worry, we’ve done that for you in our recommendations below. You can calculate the number of watt-hours your battery provides if you know the battery’s nominal voltage (V) and capacity in ampere-hours (Ah), by using this calculation: Ah x V = Wh. If you know only the battery’s milliampere hours (mAh), divide that number by 1,000 to get the ampere-hours (Ah). For example, 1200mAh divided by 1,000 = 1.2Ah. Then multiply that number by the power bank’s voltage. Battery to laptop charging speed The speed at which a power bank can charge your laptop is important, especially if you are charging the MacBook while using it. Like any USB-C charger, look for the wattage at which the power bank can output power. A small laptop requires perhaps as little as 40W to keep it powered up. A larger MacBook might require 65W or 100W. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W. In technical terms, chargers and power banks have a USB PD (Power Delivery) rating. PD 3.0 has a maximum power output of 100W. PD 3.1 (useful for the 16-inch MacBook Pro) can output at 140W. The PD rating is assigned to each USB port (see below). That top-end MacBook can be charged at 100W, but it will take longer to charge. If you use a much lower wattage charger, or power bank, your MacBook battery might not fill up as fast because the laptop battery is being used by your applications. As such we haven’t looked at any laptop power bank rated at under 65W and make recommendations for each power bank we have tested as to which MacBook model it is best suited for. It is fine to use a 140W PD 3.1 charger or power bank on a smaller laptop—nothing untoward will happen as the power output is regulated by the laptop being powered. Indeed, you can safely charge your AirPods case with a 140W charger even though it won’t take more than 5W. Total power output A power bank with multiple ports will also have a maximum total output, which is how much power all the ports can give out together at one time when each is connected to a different device. A power bank might have two ports each rated at 100W, but if the total power output is 100W then that power will be shared between the ports. Look for a total power output that means the power bank can handle charging multiple devices at the same time at full speed. Power input Power Input is the wattage at which the power bank itself can be charged via a USB-C charger. Again, the more watts, the faster the charge up to the power bank’s full capacity. USB ports A power bank needs at least one USB port to carry the power from itself to the device being charged. USB ports today come in two basic varieties: old-school rectangular USB-A and modern reversible USB-C. You will get the fastest charge using USB-C at the power bank end. At the MacBook end, the USB-C end of the cable will connect with the MacBook’s Thunderbolt port, which is identical to USB-C in looks and basic operation. Thunderbolt is backward compatible with USB-C. Look for power banks with multiple USB ports so you can charge more than one device at a time: more than one laptop, or a laptop plus a phone or two, or your AirPods case and Apple Watch. A USB-A port might be useful if you need to power-up a device whose charger uses the older standard; for example, a Fitbit. Power vs portability There are some giant power banks, usually called portable power stations, that can keep a family going all weekend, but they are way too large to carry with you on your travels. Our sister site PCWorld.com has tested the best of these much larger portable power stations. As a rule, the higher the battery capacity, the larger and heavier the power bank. We have included size and weight so you can determine if each power bank suits your traveling needs. Some laptop power banks are built to last in the great outdoors so will feature more rugged IP-rated shells; read on for our reviews below. There are much smaller, lighter and more portable power banks for phones—check out our recommendations of the best power banks for iPhone. You could use some of these to recharge a laptop but we recommend the power banks tested and reviewed here for the best results when powering up a laptop. Power bank safety Batteries can present a fire risk in certain circumstances, such as rapid overheating (a process called thermal runaway), overcharging and exposure to high temperatures. As such we recommend only power banks from trusted, premium manufacturers with a long record of producing safe, high-quality products. You will find cheaper power banks, but we believe that the safety of the device you are charging, your home or office, plus your bag if carrying it around with you, are paramount. If you want to take your power bank on a plane, there are also regulations to abide by—or you’ll be leaving it at the Security Desk. See below the chart of our favorite laptop power banks for international airline rules on permitted power banks and batteries. Which power bank is best for your MacBook in 2025? We have indicated which models of MacBook we think each power bank is best suited to, but that doesn’t mean you can’t pair any with different MacBooks. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can be fast-charged at 140W (using Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable) so owners of that model should look for a PD 3.1 power bank. But even a 13-inch MacBook Air will work well with the higher-capacity power banks. They might not charge any faster, but they will be recharged more times if you pick a high-capacity battery pack.

It is a great fit with the top-end 16-inch MacBook Pro, which has a battery rated at around the same watt hours (99.6WH) as this power bank (99.56Wh). Attach Apple’s USB-C to MagSafe 3 Cable to the power back and you can utilize one of the 140W PD 3.1 ports to fast-charge the 16-inch Pro. Although the power bank ships with a 140W-capable cable, Apple allows fast-charging only using its proprietary charging cable. Anker claims that you can fast-charge that top-end MacBook Pro up to 50% in 28 minutes. An iPhone 14 could be charged four and a half times over if using all of the power bank’s battery capacity. In our tests, we charged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to full power with a little battery power remaining in the pack. There are three USB ports. Each of the two USB-C ports can be used to power at 140W. While it has a maximum total output of 250W you can’t fast-charge two 16-inch MacBook Pros at the same time—when using the two USB-C ports at the same time one runs at 140W and the other at 100W, which is still powerful enough to fast-charge one laptop and still charge another simultaneously. When using all three ports, one USB-C will have 140W potential, the other USB-C can charge at up to 92W and the USB-A port at 18W, which is enough to fast-charge an iPhone. You can recharge the power bank itself in under 40 minutes using the two USB-C ports at the same time at an impressive 170W—faster than any other laptop power bank we have tested. This is a sophisticated power bank with some tricks of its own. It can be controlled by an app, which gives real-time charging stats (Remaining Charging Time and Input and Output power indicators) and can be optimized to help extend the battery life of the devices being charged as well as its own. You can even use the app’s Find Device feature to activate a sound alert from the power bank when you need to locate it. The Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank is available in either black or gold colors. In reality, the “black” color is more of a metallic gray. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

It has a huge battery capacity but is still portable, although you wouldn’t want to carry it around in your backpack all day, and it’s too powerful to take on a commercial flight. It has a handle so is carriable, but the bulk and weight mean it is one to move around inside or carry in a car. It would be the perfect power companion on a camping trip. It’s not super-heavy, but it is noticeably larger than the other laptop power banks tested here. Keep it powered up in case of power outages and it should keep your laptop and phone going for days. In our tests we recharged a 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro 1.8 times, so you can expect to get maybe as many as two charges for a MacBook Air. The Pro charged from 5% to 90% in an hour, which impressed us. There are five ports (three USB-C and two USB-A) with a maximum simultaneous power output of 300W. As it has a 140W PD 3.1 USB-C port, it can be used to fast charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro. At the same time, you could charge another top-end MacBook Pro at 100W, and use one of the USB-A ports at 22.5W. The smart display shows the remaining battery, total input and output power. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

The cable, which is 27.6 inches (70cm) long fully outstretched, wraps neatly into a groove at the top of the power bank. There’s a spare USB-C port at the bottom, so can charge only two devices simultaneously compared to three or more from some of the other battery packs tested here. At 15.1oz (429g) it’s lighter than the Anker 20000mAh power bank, which weighs 18.7oz (529g). It’s available in either Black or Silver Gray. The USB-C ports (60W output and input, 65W total output) aren’t as powerful as the 20K Anker, which has a 100W port, a 200W max output and 100W input, but if you aren’t after top-line speed this is the lightest and most travel friendly laptop power bank we’ve tested. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

It wins points for its built-in USB-C cable, although at 6 inches (15cm) it’s not as long or handy as the 2.3-foot (70cm) retractable cable on the Baseus. It is also a less powerful: 45W vs 60W via USB-C, and charges itself slower, too. It recharged our test MacBook Pro to 75%, again a little off the Baseus performance but probably enough for most users in need of a power boost. At 45W it’s fine for the MacBook Air but a little underpowered for the Pro MacBooks, which will charge a little slower. (We’re only interested in Apple’s MacBook here but if you also own a Xiaomi laptop, its USB-C connectors can charge at 55W and the USB-A supports 33W UFCS charging for some Chinese phones.) The lower power input and output plus shorter cable, along with a slightly heavier weight, are compromises you may well overlook when you see the price. This is a great-looking—in either black or a cool white—and solidly performing portable battery pack for your laptop. It’s also available in the U.K. unlike the Baseus. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

It doesn’t feature that power bank’s 140W PD 3.1 USB-C ports, instead packing two 100W USB-C ports and the same 65W USB-A port. That doesn’t rule it out as a battery pack for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, but it can’t fast-charge Apple’s largest laptop. It’s a great option for the smaller MacBooks unless you need as much power in the bank as you can carry. As the maximum power output is 200W, you could simultaneously charge two MacBooks at 100W. Using all three ports, you can power a MacBook at 100W, another at 60W and still have 40W over for a third MacBook or any other device. Like its big sibling, the Anker 200W 20000mAh Power Bank features a clear display but doesn’t work with the Anker app. While the 27650mAh Anker Prime can be charged itself at 200W, the Anker 200W 20000mAh Power Bank can be charged at a lower, but still reasonable, 100W using just one of its USB-C ports. Available in either gray (Anker calls it black) or gold. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

Despite its somewhat confusing name, the Cuktech 15 has a 20K (20000mAh) battery that managed to charge our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro to 60% power. That’s not as impressive as the Baseus 20K Power bank reviewed above but at under $50/£50 it’s one of the cheapest MacBook battery pack that we trust. You can use it as a multiple-charge iPhone power bank, too: it should charge an iPhone 15 around 3.5 times. You double-click the power button to enter low-power mode for devices such as a smartwatch or headphones. With the three USB ports all in action, you can charge the MacBook at 65W and share the remaining 20W between the other USB-C and USB-A ports. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

The battery capacities of both are identical, but the Ugreen is noticeably lighter even though its dimensions are closely aligned. Each has a smart display that tells you more than enough about what’s going on between the power bank and the devices being charged. The Ugreen Nexode is a more portable solution, but we still prefer the Anker Prime model for its impressive USB ports. The Anker has two 100W USB-C ports, while the Ugreen’s USB-C ports are rated at 100W and 30W. As the Ugreen power bank has a maximum power output of 130W, this doesn’t matter, but the Anker can pump out 200W simultaneously, making its powerful ports more useful. Power input is also better on the ANker (100W) vs the Ugreen (65W). However, we’ve seen the Nexode Power Bank 20000mAh priced more competitively than the Anker Prime 20000mAh, and that weight difference may be important to you. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

The compromise is its 65W USB-C ports, but these are fine for the MacBook Air and the entry-level 14-inch MacBook Pro. It’s also fine for larger MacBooks unless you need the fastest charging. It should charge a MacBook Air to about 70% battery capacity. It’s also a great option for iPhone users, as it can power up an iPhone 14 or 15 Pro twice over. If your MacBook Air just needs a small power boost, and you want to keep your iPhone going, this is a great compact option. Maximum simultaneous output is 130W, using both USB-C ports, so you can power two MacBooks at 65W each at the same time. There’s no USB-A port if you still need the old USB standard. The smart display shows you how much battery capacity is remaining in the power bank. Unlike the other Anker Prime laptop power banks, the 12000mAh model is available in the gray color only—no gold for the budget-conscious. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

As with the Anker, there are three USB ports, with one at the required 140W for fast-charging a 16-inch MacBook Pro. The other two ports aren’t as powerful as the Anker’s though: 45W vs 140W, and 30W vs 65W. An M2 MacBook Air should be fully charged with a little power left over for your iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch. Power input is also not as great, but at 110W it’s impressive enough compared to most. Maximum simultaneous power output is 210W—again not as high as the Anker but still respectable. The Cuktech’s display gives more data than the Anker, which is informative for wattage junkies but probably overkill for most of us, who just need to know how much battery life remains in the power bank. Anker’s dedicated app is perhaps more useful. Again, this is a nice to have and the Cuktech power bank does the important stuff of recharging the laptop at a price point that is noticeably lower than Anker’s. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

The three top-mounted USB ports support PD 3.1 so it is particularly useful for owners of the 16-inch MacBook Pro, which can be fast-charged using one of this power bank’s 140W ports. As total power output is also 140W, you can’t charge another device at the same time as fast-charging that top-end MacBook. If you want to simultaneously charge more devices, look for a power bank with a higher maximum power output. The similarly designed Anker Prime 27650mAh, reviewed above, can use all three of its ports up to 250W. The Ugreen 48000mAh Portable Power Bank, also reviewed previously, is a larger unit but can reach 300W total power output. The Alogic Ark has a smart display screen that shows you how fast devices are charging, remaining battery capacity, and how long it will keep charging at the current speed. It’s a well-priced laptop power bank so you might be happy to choose the Ark over an alternative that can pump out more power at one time. Great for: 16-inch MacBook Pro.

As it charges at a maximum 65W, it’s better suited to the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, rather than the more powerful versions of the 14- and 16-inch Pro MacBooks that prefer a 100W or higher charger. That said, if your 16-inch Pro is on an outdoors adventure, the Survivor will still charge it, just a little slower than a 100W or 140W power bank.

It is slim (1.8cm) and almost square rather than a rectangular obelisk. This makes it easier to slip into the laptop compartment of a backpack or case. There are four ports: two 100W USB-C, and two 30W USB-A. The 20000mAh capacity is enough to charge a 13-inch MacBook Air from zero to 100% once, with about 5% remaining. The Blade HD also recharges via either of the two USB-C ports—although at 65W it’s slower than others reviewed here. In our tests it reached 90% after just 90 minutes and is fully charged after just under two hours—batteries always take longer to fill the last part of the charge. Like other laptop power banks, it features a smart display, but this one is harder to read than the others tested here. It provides information about the capacity percentage, voltage, and current, as well as the approximate time for the charging process, but the practical benefit of the display would be even greater if the power was displayed in watts and not in a combination of volts and amps. Baseus makes good products but can be let down by a confused product lineup. As well as the “Blade HD“, there is also a “Blade” with very similar specs and price but slightly longer (6.4 vs 5.3 inches). As far as we can tell, only the Blade is available in the U.K. while the smaller Blade HD is available in the U.S. and E.U. Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

In fact, it has a lower battery capacity, lower power output and lower power input., plus two fewer USB ports. It is, however, remarkably slim—even slimmer than the Blade HD—and lightweight, and it’s a great fit for the MacBook Air. Like the Anker Prime 27650mAh Power Bank, reviewed above, it can connect to a basic app to show you much the same data as you’ll see on its smart display. The display is small but easier to read than on the Blade HD. It’s available in blue, silver or orange colors, and you can pick one of these colors for the display via the app. Great for: 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air.

As such it is bigger than most power banks but it would survive outdoors much longer and has a big enough battery to keep a bunch of devices charged up before being introduced to a wall charger again. Behind a protective rubber flap there are three USB ports: two old-school USB-A and one USB-C. We would have preferred more USB-C, which is used on most modern devices, and that singular USB-C port is also where you will charge the power bank itself. The USB-C port outputs at up to 65W and receives power at 60W. Each of the USB-A ports can output at 18W. Total simultaneous power output is 65W. Uniquely, there is also a 24W DC 5525 port if your devices can be powered using this connection. 65W is great for the lower-end 14-inch MacBook Pro and 13 and 15-inch MacBook Air, but more powerful versions of the 14-inch Pro will prefer a 100W charger. The power will recharge even a 16-inch MacBook Pro, but slower than with a 100W or 140W power bank.

We think the slab shape works better for portability, while the more vertical Anker shape looks good when sitting on your desk. Offering 140W PD 3.1 via one of its USB-C ports, it is ideal for fast-charging the 16-inch MacBook Pro. Maximum power output, however, is only a little over 140W so there’s not much power left if you want to charge another device at the same time. There’s not enough battery to fully recharge Apple’s top-end MacBook Pro, but it gets very close when recharging our test 14-inch M2 MacBook Pro. It is closest to the 27650mAh Anker prime power bank, and while having a little lower battery capacity it is nearly a quarter of the weight so is easier to carry around with you. The Ugreen battery pack can charge the same number of devices (three) as the Anker, but the Anker can pump out 250W of power simultaneously while the Ugreen is limited to 145W. The Anker is also much faster to re-charge itself, with 170W power input compared to Ugreen’s 65W.

This power bank should have enough juice in it to fully recharge a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air. This model has a 100W power output so is less able for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, although it would still offer enough recharge to give even that laptop a few more hours of usage on the road, although with a total 100W, it’s limited to also charging other devices at the same time as a larger laptop.

Great for: 14-inch MacBook Pro, 13-inch or 15-inch MacBook Air. Ugreen Which spare batteries and power banks can you take on a plane? When damaged, short-circuited or overheated, batteries can catch fire and explode, so there are regulations in place to ensure safety onboard commercial aircraft. If you are lucky you’ll find a charging point at the airport, but we know these are usually already taken. Many plane seats also have a USB port, but it’s often old-school USB-A where most chargers these days use the more modern, powerful and reversible USB-C connector. You’d be wise to carry your own USB-C wall charger, which you can use if your plane seat includes a regular AC power socket. Remember that you might need a travel adapter depending on the nationality of the airline. Most national and international batteries in flight regulations allow for lithium-ion batteries up to 160Wh, if permitted by the individual airlines. U.S. TSA and FAA battery and power bank regulations The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) states that any “spare (uninstalled) lithium ion and lithium metal batteries, including power banks and cell phone battery charging cases, must be carried in carry-on baggage only”. Both TSA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FFA) state that “with airline approval”, passengers may also carry up to two spare larger lithium-ion batteries (101–160Wh). TSA requirements apply to both air carriers and airports, and the FAA requirements only apply to commercial airlines. U.K. Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) battery and power bank regulations Up to two “spare batteries for portable electronic devices containing lithium-ion batteries exceeding a Watt-hour rating of 100Wh but not exceeding 160Wh when carried for personal use are allowed for carry-on baggage and on one’s person. They are not permitted in checked (hold) baggage.” European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) battery and power bank regulations The European Union regulations are stricter: “If the Wh is higher than 100 but not higher than 160, you will need an approval from the operator to carry the item”. EASA also states that “power banks should not be connected or providing power to a device while on board the aircraft”. So you can carry the power bank with you but not actually recharge your phone or laptop while on the plane.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
