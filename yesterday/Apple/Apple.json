Any business owner knows branding and logos can make a major difference, so why are you still using Google Drive to share assets and files with your clients? Ditch Google Drive for Cloudbrand, a¬†white-label cloud storage¬†platform that lets you customize your cloud with company branding and logos for the ultimate client experience. Grab lifetime access while it‚Äôs available for $89.99 (reg. $588) for a little while longer. With this plan, you‚Äôll get¬†250GB of white-label space¬†and the ability to create up to 25 custom portals. Are you building a custom site for a client? Set up a specific client cloud portal for them, and customize it with your domain, email, logo, and colors so they‚Äôll see them each time they open up the link to review your designs. Another bonus of Cloudbrand? Your clients don‚Äôt need to create an account to download their files. They can access it independently, and the platform lets you invite clients to join your specific branded cloud storage portal.

    "description": "Macworld Finding an unlocked iPhone for cheap is rarer than a can of dandelion and burdock, but if you‚Äôre looking for one, today‚Äôs your lucky day: Amazon‚Äôs Woot is selling an unlocked iPhone 15 in black with 512GB of storage for $670 (512GB), a savings of $329 off Apple‚Äôs already reduced price and the best price we‚Äôve ever seen. The iPhone 15 isn‚Äôt able to run Apple Intelligence, but it‚Äôs ready for everything else iOS 18 has to offer, with an A16 processor, 6.1-inch OLED display, and Apple‚Äôs innovative Dynamic Island. You‚Äôll also get an excellent camera system with a 48MP main lens and a 12MP ultra-wide lens. It doesn‚Äôt have a telephoto camera like the Pro models, but Apple‚Äôs computational advancements allow it to have 2x zoom enabled by quad-pixel sensor. And of course, you‚Äôll get years of updates. We gave the iPhone 15 4 stars in our 2024 review, calling it ‚Äúanother example of Apple‚Äôs straightforward excellence.‚Äù And our opinion hasn‚Äôt changed a year later. Since this iPhone isn‚Äôt brand new, it‚Äôs not eligible for AppleCare, but it‚Äôs not refurbished either. Woot promises that the phone is in ‚ÄúPristine‚Äù condition and has ‚Äúnever been in customer hands.‚Äù It will have ‚Äúa test sticker showing¬†100% battery life and inside¬†a sleek custom black box,¬†not the original retail packaging.‚Äù It comes with a one-year warranty from Apple but again, it‚Äôs not eligible for AppleCare. So if you want a great iPhone at a great price without needing to jump through carrier hoops, go grab this deal before it‚Äôs gone forever. Buy it now",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
