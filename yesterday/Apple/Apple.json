    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",

    "description": "Macworld Sure, the AirPods Pro 2 might be a couple of years old, but Apple keeps making them better through firmware features. The latest turns them into a bonafide hearing aid with iOS 18.1, but what’s even better, however, is the fact that you can get these $249 earbuds for just $179 right now. When we reviewed the AirPods Pro 2, we gave these earbuds a near-perfect 4.5-star rating, appreciating the audio quality, the excellent noise canceling, and the superb transparency mode. “On the outside, not much has changed with these second-generation AirPods Pro. But the sound quality has improved a lot, noise canceling is much better, transparency mode is top-notch, and battery life is finally up to par. There’s not a lot here you can’t find on other models, but Apple makes it easy and has caught up to its fierce competition,” our review reads. Featuring the H2 chip, these earbuds promise a deep and immersive sound with crisp, high notes and a rich bass. They come with four pairs of silicone tips in multiple sizes so you can obtain that perfect noise cancellation level. Since our review, the AirPods Pro 2 has gained a USB-C case, Adaptive Audio, Conversation Awareness, and Personalized Volume, and can even act as a hearing aid with a built-in clinical-grade test. And since they’re available for nearly 30 percent off their regular price, it would be a shame not to take advantage of this Amazon deal. So go grab the AirPods Pro 2 for $179 and treat your ears to great sound and good health. Get the best earbuds for $70 offBuy it now at Amazon",

    "description": "Macworld One of my favorite Mac apps is Pixelmator Pro, an image editing tool I use daily. On Friday, the company behind the app announced that Apple is acquiring it. While that sounds like great news for the Pixelmator team and Apple users, my first reaction was a sense of dread that an app I frequently use will be drastically different in the future or may no longer exist in its current form. I started using Pixelmator primarily to escape Adobe’s subscription-only model for Photoshop. Pixelmator is available for a one-time purchase of $50, which is much friendlier to my wallet than Photoshop’s $20 per month or Photoshop Elements’ $100 for a “3-year term license,” whatever that means. I also wanted to support the Pixelmator team in making Mac-only apps. While developers can make a living as a Mac-only developer, the market isn’t as big as Windows, or even iOS. The Pixelmator team makes top-notch software and they deserve as much support as they can get. When I first started using Pixelmator Pro instead of Photoshop, I had a lot to learn about the app’s user interface. After using Photoshop for years, undoing all that muscle memory took time. But it helped that Pixelmator Pro has a great UI that makes sense, and it didn’t take long to get comfortable. But now, with the acquisition news, I’m afraid that’s all going to be thrown out the window. Pixelmator Pro isn’t going to change “at this time,” says the Pixelmator Team. That’s not very reassuring. My major concern is that the one-time purchase plan is going to disappear. Apple’s Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro are one-time purchase Mac apps, so there’s hope that this will be the case with Apple Pixelmator Pro. But the iPad versions of Apple’s Pro apps are subscription purchases, so there’s a recent precedent of Apple implementing such purchase plans. Apple’s Services revenue is valuable to its bottom line and making its Mac apps subscription-based is something the company could do to help Services revenue grow. Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro were Apple acquisitions, but Apple didn’t have a presence in those software categories in the first place. They do with Pixelmator and Photos, so my other concern is unfounded and far-fetched, but what if Apple decides to end Pixelmator as a stand-alone app and incorporate it into the Photos app, possibly as a paid Photos+ option? That’s not ideal—Photos is an app for maintaining your photo library, and it’s not ideal for my work. What makes more sense is if Apple incorporated the Photomator app into Photos and left Pixelmator as its own app. Overall, this seems like good news for the Pixelmator Team–Apple made a great acquisition and I’m happy to see them succeed. But let this be my plea to Apple to keep Pixelmator Pro as an affordable, stand-alone app that I can rely on for years and years.",
