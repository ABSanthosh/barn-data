    "description": "Macworld AI-based search options may be coming to Safari across Apple’s platforms. At least, that’s what Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior VP of services, testified in the Justice Department’s lawsuit against Alphabet Inc. The lawsuit is over Google’s monopoly over search and whether it broke antitrust law. One of the ways it was said to have done this is by paying Apple to maintain its position as the default search engine in Safari (realistically, the only web browser for over a billion iPhone users). Last year, the court found Google to be acting as a monopolist, claiming it “has acted as one to maintain its monopoly. It has violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act.” Now, Google is in court again to discuss exactly what the remedy should be—will Alphabet/Google’s properties be broken apart? If so, how? In his court appearance, Eddy Cue remarked on the Safari search deal with Google and where things are headed, according to a report from Bloomberg. Cue said Apple is “actively looking at” changing the way search works in Safari to focus on AI-powered search engines. Searches actually dipped on Safari last month for the first time, he said, which he attributed to people getting their answers from AI. Cue said he believes AI-based search products like those from Perplexity, Anthropic, and OpenAI will eventually replace the standard search one gets from Google. He expects to add those as search providers to Safari in the future, adding, “We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default.” Cue said the products still need to improve before that happens, however. He said making Google the default search was a natural choice because the other search engines were valid choices. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way,” he added. Meanwhile, Google is moving ahead rapidly to incorporate AI into its search results and will soon debut a new “AI mode” for its search. In general, it seems that the public dislikes AI stuff inserted into search results, and the only feedback we see is that “Google is ruining search” and that more people just get answers to things they need from social media, instead. Google had a chance to be the AI partner for Apple Intelligence in iOS 18, instead of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. There was a “bake-off” between the two, but Google’s term sheet, he says, “had a lot of things Apple wouldn’t agree to and didn’t agree to with OpenAI.” Google is widely rumored to become an option for extended AI features in iOS 19, providing users with a choice between ChatGPT, Gemini, and perhaps others. The following paragraph of Bloomberg’s story is illuminating: Still, [Cue] believes Google should remain the default in Safari, saying that he has lost sleep over the possibility of losing the revenue share from their agreement. He said Apple’s agreement with Google today on regular search still has the best financial terms. This description of the proceedings makes it sound like Cue believes AI search, while not good enough right now, is the future and will soon be better for most users. But the billions of dollars Google pays to be the default is too good to give up.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2750722/how-much-battery-these-switched-off-apple-watch-functions-save.html",
    "description": "Macworld There are countless online guides offering to help you stretch your Apple Watch’s battery life, generally by turning off all the flashiest features. But I wanted to be more scientific about it. I wanted to know which features drain the watch’s battery the most, and how much extra life you’ll gain by turning each of them off. That way we can decide for ourselves whether it’s worth the sacrifice to turn off the always-on display, for example, or the watch’s various health features. Let’s test! How we tested For this experiment I wore two identical watches (the 46mm Apple Watch Series 10 without cellular) for two weeks. We did our best to ensure that they were in largely the same condition. One had 120 charges under its belt, the other–borrowed from a colleague–had 162. The number of recorded workouts on the two devices should be comparable too: my colleague cycles, while I dance. Not together, of course. I wore the two Apple Watches at the same time (one on each wrist) across four runs of the test. In two runs, the always-on display function was activated on one watch and not on the other. All other settings were the same. In the third run, background app updates, irregular heart rhythm notifications and general app notifications were deactivated on one watch, and left alone on the other. And in the fourth and final run, all settings were identical on both watches to check they were at an equivalent battery level. This last run gives scientific validity to the rest of our findings. Results As you can see from the graph above, the Apple Watch running always-on mode already achieves excellent battery life of more than 30 hours. (It should be noted that I received very few notifications from the apps on my Apple Watch during the tests, which may have helped.) But the watch without always-on lasted 10 to 12 hours longer. That’s a significant increase in battery life from turning off a single (albeit useful and popular) feature. In the next run (purple and green lines in the graph above), always-on was activated on both watches, but I switched off background app refresh, irregular heart rhythm notifications, and all app notifications (green). Although it’s the best performance in the graph, the differences are nowhere near as dramatic as when I deactivated always-on. Turning off these features earned us an extra five hours. It wasn’t until the fourth run that I noticed an oddity. While synchronizing screenshots, I disconnected the watch on the left wrist from the iPhone, and paired the one on the right. In previous runs, the left watch had shown better running times, regardless of settings. When the other watch was actively paired, the picture changed, and ultimately the watch on the right wrist lasted longer than the one on the left. Conclusions Any features that turn on the screen, whether that’s always-on or excessive notifications, will drain the battery. That’s obvious. But the degree to which these features affect battery life varies. If you use notifications sparingly, this will have a positive effect on battery life. But managing without always-on will produce far larger gains, delivering an Apple Watch with unprecedented battery performance. You can also be strategic in your use of always-on: pick an always-on face that only displays the time when it’s locked, rather than lots of additional information. This gives you the best of both worlds. We’ve read online advice to turn off background updates and heart rate notifications, but these seem to be nothing more than snake oil. Turning off these functions hardly affects battery life, and irregular heart rhythm notifications can be one of the Apple Watch’s most useful functions. My advice is to keep them switched on. Finally, we found that being disconnected from its companion iPhone for several hours has a negative effect on the Apple Watch’s battery life. This even applies to models without cellular. So if you go jogging, it’s best to take your iPhone with you.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
