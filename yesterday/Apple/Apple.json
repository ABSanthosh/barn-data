    "description": "Macworld Every year without fail, the new iPhone delivers one of the best cameras on any smartphone. Basically, any iPhone you buy—even the previous year’s model—will snap excellent photos and record videos in stellar quality. It’s that consistency, along with the popularity of Macs among photo and video professionals, that makes the iPhone so popular among photographers and videographers. Whether you’re a pro or just an enthusiast, the iPhone that is best for photography is almost always the newest one—but that also tends to be the most expensive option, so is that the model you should buy? While the top of the range iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max both offer advanced cameras and impressive technologies that will result in professional-looking photographs, the other iPhones still take excellent photos and are worthy of consideration. We will run through the current iPhones that Apple is selling now, along with some iPhones from the past few years. This way we can advise on the best iPhone for photography that fits within your budget.  Apple iPhone 16 Pro Read our review Price When Reviewed: $999 Best Prices Today: $999 at Apple | $999.99 at Best Buy You may also like to read our iPhone buying guide and our iPhone comparison. How the iPhone cameras compare Every year, with each new iPhone, Apple improves the camera and video features of its iPhones. We’ll begin with an overview of the camera specs for the current iPhone models, before going on to look at the camera features that Apple has introduced over the years.  With the iPhone 16 line, the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have the same camera hardware, while the Pro models had different telephoto cameras last year. The Pro models differentiate themselves from the non-Pro models with the telephoto camera (as usual) and a sharper 48 megapixel ultra-wide camera. iPhoneMain cameraUltra WideTelephotoOptical ZoomiPhone 16 Pro/Max48MP, f/1.7848MP, f/2.212MP, f/2.80.5, 1, 2, 5xiPhone 1648MP, f/1.7812MP, f/2.20.5, 1, 2xiPhone 15 Pro Max48MP, f/1.7812MP, f/2.212MP f/2.80.5, 1, 2, 5xiPhone 15 Pro48MP, f/1.7812MP, f/2.212MP f/2.8 0.5, 1, 2, 3xiPhone 15 Plus48MP, f/1.612MP, f/2.40.5, 1, 2xiPhone 1548MP, f/1.612MP, f/2.40.5, 1, 2xiPhone 14 Pro Max48MP, ƒ/1.7812MP, ƒ/2.212MP, ƒ/2.80.5, 1, 2, 3xiPhone 14 Pro48MP, ƒ/1.7812MP, ƒ/2.212MP, ƒ/2.80.5, 1, 2, 3xiPhone 14 Plus12MP, ƒ/1.512MP, ƒ/2.40.5, 1xiPhone 14 12MP, ƒ/1.512MP, ƒ/2.40.5, 1xiPhone SE12MP, ƒ/1.80.5, 1xRecent handsets that are no longer sold by Apple are shown in italics, you may still be able to buy one of these models. Looking at the specs sheet you wouldn’t think the iPhone 16 offered an improvement over the iPhone 15, but its Ultra Wide camera supports macro photography, which is very popular. The cameras can now shoot spatial photos and video, too. “Hidden Gem” (water bead in leaf) by Jirasak Panpiansin (@joez19).

Apple “Hidden Gem” (water bead in leaf) by Jirasak Panpiansin (@joez19). Macro photograph, shot on iPhone 13 Pro Max. Apple Apple The apertures are also a significant variation across iPhones, changing practically every generation as Apple tries to design an iPhone capable of even better low-light photography. An ƒ/1.6 aperture on the iPhone 15 will take in more light than the ƒ/1.8 aperture on the iPhone SE, for example. You may therefore be wondering if the ƒ/1.6 aperture would match the ƒ/1.5 aperture in the iPhone 14, but the aperture is only part of the story. In each generation, Apple also improves the camera sensor, image pipeline, and processing software. The iPhone 14 Pro gained a quad-pixel sensor that combines every four pixels into one large quad-pixel equivalent to 2.44 µm, and this is retained in more recent iPhones. Another benefit of the newer iPhone cameras is second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which was a new feature of the iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max, and is now only available in the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max. This enhances the sensor-shift optical image stabilization found on the iPhone 15, 14 and the 13-series. The 5x zoom introduced in the iPhone 15 Pro Max make a huge difference in telephoto shots, and it is retained in both the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max.

The Photonic Engine (which arrived with the iPhone 14 range) is a computational photography technology that can make low-light photos look better, among other things.  The Photonic Engine builds on the Deep Fusion software, which arrived with the iPhone 11. The Deep Fusion process involves the camera taking multiple shots with different exposures and combining them using AI to produce better images that the tiny sensors in a smartphone would otherwise be capable of.  Photographic Styles arrived with the iPhone 13 and also features on the iPhone SE (3rd generation). These are preset styles that are applied when you take a photograph, rather than adding a filter after the photo is taken. The benefit is that adjustments are applied to the right elements of an image—maintaining skin tones, etc—rather than to the whole image. The five presets are Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm and Cool and you can adjust Tone and Warmth for each. If you find a Photographic Styles you are happy with you can set it so your iPhone always uses it, saving you editing time later. You can of course edit your photos later using the filters in the Photos app.  New to the iPhone 16 line are second-generation Photographic Styles, which offer greater control over color and tone mapping with an easier interface. They can also be applied non-destructively after the shot is taken, and even changed, while the first Photographic Styles had to be applied as you took the photo. It’s a really big deal—proper application of the new Photographic Styles can allow you to produce iPhone shots let look a little more natural, contrast-y, and less over-saturated. A low-light photo taken with the iPhone 15 Pro. A low-light photo taken with the iPhone 15 Pro.Jim Martin / Foundry A low-light photo taken with the iPhone 15 Pro.Jim Martin / Foundry Jim Martin / Foundry With every generation, Apple seeks to improve low-light photography. This is no more apparent than in the automatic Night Mode settings that arrived in the iPhone 11 and have improved over the generations since. A Night Mode Portrait setting arrived with the iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max, and is available in all Pro models since. Speaking of portraits, Portrait Mode is available in iPhone SE (2nd generation) and later, iPhone X and later, and the iPhone 7 Plus and iPhone 8 Plus. There is also a Portrait Lighting feature in the iPhone X and 8 Plus and later that allows you to select one of five effects to ‘light’ your portrait. You can adjust the depth of field for these portraits to create more or less background blur. Since the iPhone 15, you have been able to take regular shots and apply the portrait effect later if you wish, as they record depth information as well. The Portrait Mode also inspires Cinematic Mode for making videos on the iPhone. With this setting the camera can record video with a shallow depth of field, so that there is more focus on the subject. Cinematic Mode is available on the the iPhone 13-series and later.  Another video mode that arrived recently is Action Mode. A features of the iPhone 14-series, Action Mode lets you capture smooth video when you’re moving. Smart HDR has been around since the iPhone XS and XR in 2018, but with the 15 generation iPhone it’s now at Smart HDR 5. Those are some of the standout features that have arrived in recent years, but there is so much more. For example, Live Photos let you take 3 second captures with each picture so you can pick the still image you want, create a Gif-like effect, or just keep the short clip. You can make a QuickTake video by holding the shutter button on the iPhone XS, iPhone XR, and later. And, of course, every iPhone can shoot time-laps and slo-mo videos as well as square, Portrait, and pano photographs.  Are iPhones good for video? All iPhones currently sold offer 4K video recording at 24 fps, 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps, 1080p HD video recording at 25 fps, 30 fps or 60 fps and Slo-mo video support for 1080p at 120 fps or 240 fps. New to the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max is 4K Dolby Vision video at up to 120fps. The differences relate to features like Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and 14-series (but on only in 4K HDR on the iPhone 14-series and up), ProRes and Macro video recording (only available on the Pro and Max iPhones, and HDR video recording, which is not available on the iPhone SE. The video recording features of the iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max are superior to the previous generation, with the addition of Log video recording and the Academy Color Encoding System. ProRes video recording up to 4K at 120 fps with external recording equipment for these models too. An omission on the iPhone SE is Audio Zoom, which can help reduce background noise when recording and is present on iPhones 11 and later.  Features like Action Mode and Cinematic mode, mentioned above will no doubt prove useful to anyone making video with their iPhone.  Best iPhone Camera 1. Apple iPhone 16 Pro Price When Reviewed: $999 Best Prices Today: $999 at Apple $999.99 at Best Buy The iPhone 16 Pro and Pro Max have identical camera systems this year. They improve upon the iPhone 15 Pro Max with an upgraded 48 megapixel ultra wide camera, but the real improvements come from the addition of a new Camera Control button and improved software. The second-generation Photographic Styles are a big improvement over the previous version of the feature, giving you more creative control over how your photos and videos look. The Camera Control button can open your camera app (even third-party apps), acts like a shutter button, and can be tapped and swiped to adjust image controls like exposure or zoom. If you’re into video, you’ll appreciate the improved microphones, higher 120fps 4K frame rate, and AI-powered audio mix feature that lets you quickly produce videos that sound great.

Apple iPhone 16 Price When Reviewed: $799 Best Prices Today: $799 at Apple$829.99 at Best Buy Even better than the older Pro models is this year’s regular iPhone 16. Sure, it lacks a dedicated telephoto camera and it doesn’t shoot in ProRES video, but it can zoom in to a 2x optical image using the main camera’s 48 megapixel sensor. It supports the new Photographic Styles, has the Camera Control button, and now takes macro photos and video and Spatial video too. Between the Camera Control button, features like Audio Mix, and the new photographic styles, we’d take the regular iPhone 16 over the iPhone 15 Pro. Read our full Apple iPhone 16 review 3.

This is a big increase over the 3x/77mm telephoto camera on the iPhone 15 Pro. The digital zoom also increases from 15X to 25X. The new ultra-wide camera, in both of the pro iPhone 15 models, gains a new anti-glare lens coating and better night mode quality.

Shots are saved in 24MP by default so it shouldn’t fill up all your memory. The iPhone 15 can take 2X telephoto shots despite not having a dedicated telephoto lens.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/671574/best-apple-watch.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple released only one new Apple Watch in 2024: the Apple Watch Series 10. It offers a refined design and a few modest upgrades over the Series 9. Apple did not update the Ultra 2, and instead just added a new color option. You can also still buy the Apple Watch SE from 2022. In this guide, we will help you decide which Apple Watch is best for you. We’ll compare the features, specs and price as well as offer advice on choosing cases, colors, and straps in our Apple Watch comparison chart so you can be confident you are choosing the right Apple Watch.  Here’s what you need to know before buying an Apple Watch.  What does an Apple Watch do? Practically every Apple Watch ever made has offered the same set of basic functions. Apple Watch can be used in conjunction with an iPhone (or separately if the user has a cellular contract) to:  Make or take phone calls  Read and send text messages Read and send emails Listen to music or podcasts Receive notifications relating to iPhone and Apple Watch apps  Use apps, such as Maps for navigation, a calculator or a compass Track fitness, including steps and calories burned Monitor your health, including heart rate Detect a fall or car crash Tell the time – especially if your watch has an always-on display (they don’t all offer that) Act as a flashlight (or torch)  Pay via Apple Pay  Track your sleep  The Apple Watch doesn’t need an iPhone to work, but it helps, and it is needed for initial setup. See: Does an Apple Watch work without an iPhone? There’s another choice to be made. Do you need an Apple Watch with cellular connectivity or not?  We examine GPS versus cellular in a separate article, read: Should I buy a cellular Apple Watch. If you choose a cellular version of the Apple Watch you’ll be able to leave your iPhone at home and use your Watch for making calls, receiving texts, and streaming music. Apple Watch can also support Family Setup if you are looking for a Watch for someone who doesn’t have an iPhone.

Generally, each Apple Watch offers a few more features than the one that came before it. Below we will run through the features available on each Apple Watch so you can see what you are getting for your money.   Apple isn’t the only place where you can buy an Apple Watch, and if you shop around you can still buy older models that Apple doesn’t sell. To get the best deal on an Apple Watch take note of the best prices shown below, you might also like to look at our roundup of the Best Apple Watch Deals. Apple Watch Ultra 2 Pros 1 to 3,000 nits brightness Ultra-only capabilities for extreme sports Double Tap Tough exterior Cons No price drop in the U.S. Only one size Price When Reviewed: $799 (base) Best Prices Today: $799 at Amazon$799 at Apple$799.99 at Target When it arrived in 2022 the Apple Watch Ultra was the ultimate Apple Watch. Designed for athletes and adventures it wasn’t the watch for everyone, but it went beyond the standard Apple Watch with features for divers (like depth gage, water temperature sensor, and water resistance to 100 meters) and features for hikers such as precision dual-frequency GPS. It is also constructed from tougher materials: a titanium case and a sapphire crystal cover for the screen.  The Ultra’s battery life is better than the standard series. For the 2022 models, it was up to 36 hours for the Ultra and 18 hours for the Series 8, and those figures are the same for the 2023 models. You can eke out even more battery life too, up to 72 hours in Low Power Mode, but again this is the same as 2022.  As for what’s different in the second-gen Apple Watch Ultra, like the Apple Watch Series 9 the 2023 Ultra features the S9 chip which is superior to the previous generation with 60% more transistors than the S8, a four core Neural Engine that is twice as fast than the S8, and 30 percent faster graphics. You might wonder why you need this power but it allows for things like smoother animations, faster and more accurate dictation, Siri on device and the Double Tap feature.  In 2022 the Apple Watch Ultra screen offered 2,000 nits of brightness. This has now increased to 3,000 nits (while the Series 9 now gets 2,000 nits). This should make it easier to see the screen in bright light, perhaps on the ski slopes. The always-on screen can also turn down to 1 nit so as not to disturb others.  Like the Series 10 the Ultra 2 offers the new U2 Ultra-wideband chip that enables Precision Finding to make it easier to find your iPhone. Rather than just ping with iPhone, you will get navigation instructions on the watch.  The original Ultra has the Action Button, to make controlling the Watch a bit easier, but the second-gen model goes a step further. Thanks to the new Double-Tap gesture you won’t have to touch the screen to control the Watch, useful if your other hand isn’t free. Just tap your thumb and index finger together and the gesture is recognized by the watch (via sensors and algorithms) so that the primary action of what ever app is showing will be triggered. You will also be able to use on-device Siri to do – like ask Siri to open Watch apps or check or input data.  Read our full Apple Watch Ultra 2 review Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm) Pros Bigger, easier-to-read display Faster charging Refined design Cons Still only 18 hours battery life Blood Oxygen unavailable in the U.S. Price When Reviewed: $399 Best Prices Today: $377 at Amazon$382.99 at Walmart Electronics399 at Apple The Series 10 is a modest set of improvements over the Series 9, but Apple hasn’t changed the price so it’s still a better buy. Notably, the watch is now a tiny bit thinner and larger, just enough to make the display slightly easier to read (it’s got wider viewing angles, too). Performance hasn’t changed and neither has battery life, still rated at 18 hours, but there’s a new water temperature sensor and the ability to sense depth up to 6 meters. The premium model is now Titanium instead of Stainless Steel, which results in a big weight reduction. The titanium Series 10 is barely heavier than the aluminum model, while the stainless steel Series 9 was a lot heavier. The Series 10 charges faster, too. It will go from 0-80% in 30 minutes instead of 45 minutes, which is enough of a change to make a real difference. If you have a Series 8 or Series 9 this isn’t an upgrade you need, but it’s probably the best Apple Watch to get if it’s your first one or you’re coming from a much older model, unless you live the sort of life of adventure that necessitates the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) Pros Cheapest Apple Watch Crash detection Fall detection Cons Lacks many of the health sensors of the other Watches: no ECG, no O2 Smaller, cramped screen Price When Reviewed: $249 (GPS only) Best Prices Today: $189 at Walmart Electronics$199.99 at Target $249 at Amazon The Apple Watch SE which arrived in 2022 is the second generation SE, with the first being introduced in 2020. The 2022 Apple Watch SE introduced new features and component improvements compared to the original. Like the Series 8 and subsequent Watches, it offers Crash Detection and an improved Compass app. The heart sensor in the SE (old and new) is second-generation, while the Series 7 and above offer a third-generation heart sensor. The SE also lacks the temperature sensor for cycle monitoring. You also don’t get Blood Oxygen monitoring or the ability to perform an ECG. Like the Apple Watch Series 9 the SE comes in two sizes, but the screen is slightly smaller than the screen on the Series 9 (and the Series 8) at 44mm and 40mm, rather than 45mm and 41mm. This means the screen is a little bit more cramped, especially when compared to the Ultra’s 49mm screen. Speaking of the screen, the SE doesn’t offer an always-on display like the other watches, so if that is likely to be a point of frustration for you it’s a good reason to upgrade. Battery life is the same 18 hours as the Series 9 (and Series 8). Read our full Apple Watch SE (2nd generation) review How the new Apple watches compare  That’s an overview, but in a little more detail here’s how the features of each Apple Watch compare.  Size  When it arrived in 2022 the Apple Watch Ultra was the biggest Apple Watch Apple had ever sold. The 2023 model has the same 49mm case with a screen that is capable of displaying six lines of text, so you can see more information at a glance than you can on the other Apple Watches. The 49mm case allows for a 410 by 502 pixels screen.  You can see more text on the Apple Watch Ultra You can see more text on the Apple Watch UltraApple You can see more text on the Apple Watch UltraApple Apple But the new Series 10 is actually slightly larger in the 46mm model, with 1220 square millimeters of display area compared to the Ultra 2’s 1185 square mm. Prior to the Series 7, the Series 6 had a 44mm case that had been introduced with the Apple Watch Series 4. It is this case that features on the Apple Watch SE. The 44mm screen means there are 368 by 448 pixels on the display, for a size of 977 sq mm. Not everyone wants a big watch though. If you have slim wrists you might prefer a smaller case, in which case Apple offers a smaller variant of each watch (aside from the Ultra, which only has a 49mm case).  There is a 42mm case option available for the Series 10 with 374 by 446 pixels and an area of 989 sq mm. The Apple Watch SE offers a 40mm case with 324 by 394 pixels screen of 759 sq mm. The difference between the screen size in the 46mm model and the 44mm model, and the 42mm model and the 40mm model is a lot larger than the 2mm difference would suggest. Design  There may be three variants of the Apple Watch in 2023, but there are a number of combinations that mean that there are more design differences than you might expect.  As we explained above, there are five sizes to choose from if you consider all models: 49mm, 46mm, 44mm, 42mm and 40mm.  In addition to the sizes, Apple uses two different materials for the cases: aluminum for the Watch SE; aluminum or titanium for the Series 10; and titanium for the Ultra 2. For each case there is a choice of colors:  Aluminium comes in midnight, starlight, rose gold, and silver. Titanium is available in gold or natural on the Series 10, or natural and black on Ultra 2. As well as a choice of case color, you also have a vast choice of straps or bands to go with the Apple Watch, some are only compatible with certain Watch sizes (see: Do Apple Watch straps fit all models? Some add a considerable expense to the cost of the Apple Watch.  The Apple Watch Ultra has a choice of three straps designed to be rugged and suitable for extreme sports enthusiasts, these new straps can be used with the larger Apple Watches as well. Take a look at all the watch straps on offer on Apple’s site. We discuss the best Apple Watch straps and Apple Watch straps: how to find the perfect size separately. Durability  Various elements of the Apple Watch Ultra 2 design help it withstand altitudes, high temperatures, low temperatures, immersion, freeze/thaw, shock, and vibration. So if you want a watch that can be worn at a depth of 40 meters (it’s certified for scuba diving) the Ultra 2 will be the one for you. Also making the Ultra a little better able to withstand knocks is a sapphire front crystal display, around which raised edges of the case provide protection. The Apple Watch Series 9 (and 8) also features strong sapphire glass on the Stainless Steel models. There’s Ion-X screen glass on the aluminium models.  The Apple Watch Ultra can be used by divers The Apple Watch Ultra can be used by divers Apple The Apple Watch Ultra can be used by divers Apple Apple All three watches are “Swimproof” according to Apple, but they are not equal in this respect. The Apple Watch 10 and SE have a water resistance rating of 100 meters and Apple suggests that they can be used for shallow-water activities like swimming in a pool or ocean. The Apple Watch Ultra has a water resistance rating of 50 meters and includes a Depth gauge and water temperature sensor. With these feature it’s no surprise that Apple states that the Ultra can be used for recreational scuba diving, however Apple adds that “Apple Watch Ultra should not be used for diving below 40 meters” and also points out that “water resistance can diminish over time”. The Ultra offers the same IP6X dust resistance as the Series 10. The SE does’t offer this certification. Display  When Apple describes the Apple Watch as being, for example, 44mm, that’s the case size, not the display size. The display area is as follows:  Apple Watch Ultra 2: 49mm, 1164 sq mm display area, 3,000 nits brightness Apple Watch Series 10: 46mm, 1220 sq mm display area, 2,000 nits brightness Apple Watch SE, 44mm, 977 sq mm display area, 1,000 nits brightness Apple Watch Series 19: 42mm, 989 sq mm display area, 2,000 nits brightness Apple Watch SE, 40mm, 759 sq mm display area, 1,000 nits brightness Both the Apple Watch Ultra and the Apple Watch Series 10 offer an Always-On display, a feature that was also shared by the Apple Watch Series 5 and later. The Apple Watch SE doesn’t offer an Always-On display.  The 2023 Ultra display offers up to 3,000 nits brightness, up from 2,000 in the previous generation. This beats the Series 10, which now has 2,000 nits, and SE which offers 1,000 nits brightness. This should make the Ultra easier to read in particularly bright light, for example, when skiing.  Health and Safety features  All the Apple Watches offer Car Crash detection, a feature that arrived in 2022. All the Apple Watches offer Car Crash detection, a feature that arrived in 2022. Apple All the Apple Watches offer Car Crash detection, a feature that arrived in 2022. Apple Apple Cycle Tracking: Just like the Series 10, the Ultra offers temperature sensing for Cycle Tracking, which was a new feature introduced with the 2022 Watches that should help women trying to get pregnant identify when they have ovulated. Blood Oxygen: You’ll also find the Blood Oxygen app (which arrived with the Series 6) in the Ultra and Series 10 Watches. Measuring blood oxygen can alert the wearer to any reduction of oxygen in their bloodstream and can help with management of conditions like asthma. This isn’t available in the SE. Due to a patent battle, this feature is disabled in watches sold and used in the United States, though it may return via a software update in the future. ECG: The Apple Watch 10 and Ultra offer the ECG app (introduced with the Series 4). The 2022 SE can’t perform an ECG (electrocardiogram), but it can notify you of high and low heart rate and irregular heart rhythm, as can the other Watches.  Crash Detection: In 2022 Apple Watches gained the ability to detect a car crash. This feature means that if you are in a severe car crash while wearing any Apple Watch from 2022 or above, the Watch will detect the impact and dial emergency services if you are unresponsive (you’ll get a 10-second warning).  Fall Detection: Another safety features that is shared by all the Apple Watches is Fall Detection (the feature arrived with the Apple Watch Series 4). If the watch identifies that you have fallen it will sound an alarm and display an alert so you can confirm if you are ok. If you aren’t ok the watch can call the emergency services. If you don’t have a cellular plan for your Apple Watch you will need your connected iPhone to be nearby for the call to be placed.  Siren: This safety feature is unique to the Ultra (1 and 2). That model can play a 86-decibel siren that is audible up to 600 feet (182 meters), handy if you get lost on a mountain. Compass \u0026 Backtrack: Speaking of mountaineering, the new 2022 Watches gained an improved Compass app with and Backtrack feature that should help you avoid getting lost. The Apple Watch Ultra 9 and 2) could be better at this job though because it features a new dual-frequency GPS that should make it better at positioning you because it won’t be affected by tall trees and buildings. If you are frustrated that your Watch can’t pinpoint your exact location when you are trying to use it for directions amid tall buildings this is a feature for you.  Sleep Tracking: The Apple Watches can also track your sleep and wake you up. Since watchOS 8 the Apple Watch has been able to track your breathing rate, notifying you of possible health issues. Specs  Chip: The 2023 Apple Watch Ultra 2 has the S9 chip and the Series 10 has the S10 chip, but they appear to be identical in performance The S8 chip in the SE (as well as in 2022’s Series 8 Apple Watch and the original Ultra) didn’t offer a significant power boost over the S7, which itself wasn’t a lot better than the S6. While the S6 delivered just a 20 percent boost in performance over the Series 5, which launched in 2019. GPS: Both the Apple Watch Series 10 and SE have L1 GPS, while the Apple Watch Ultra (1 and 2) offer Precision dual-frequency (L1 and L5) GPS. L1 GPS is the standard GPS, but it can be blocked by tall buildings and other obstacles. L5 GPS is more advanced and should cope better with buildings blocking the satellite signal.  U2: The Apple Watch Series 10 and Ultra 2 both offer an upgraded ultra-wideband chip that will improve their ability to track the location of an object, such as the iPhone 15. This improves on the U1 chip in the Series 8 and Ultra 1. Note the Apple Watch SE is the only Apple Watch that doesn’t even include the U1 chip. Wi-Fi: Wi-Fi connectivity is better in the Series 10 and Ultra: the SE offers only 2.4GHz 802.11b/g/n, while the Apple Watch 8 and Ultra both added 5GHz Wi-Fi to that, as do the 2023 Watches. Double Tap on Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch 9 is probably the feature we are most excited about. Double Tap on Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch 9 is probably the feature we are most excited about. Apple Double Tap on Apple Watch Ultra 2 and Apple Watch 9 is probably the feature we are most excited about. Apple Apple Battery life  The Apple Watch Ultra 2 offers 36 hour battery life (as did the original Ultra). This is much more than the other Watches’ 18 hours. The Series 10 offers faster charging (0-80% in 30 minutes), an improvement over prior models’ fast charging (0-80% in 45 minutes). That 36-hour figure for the Ultra can be even higher though if you use the Low Power Mode you should be able to get up to 72 hours, according to Apple. This same Low Power Mode brings the Watch 9 battery life to 36 hours. That’s battery life measured in typical use, but athletes and other users might not be quite so typical. Apple says that there’ll be enough battery power to get users through a triathlon (that’s a 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride, and a marathon of 26.2 miles). The problem for other Apple Watch users is that the battery would probably run down if you were tracking such extensive exercise.  Check out our roundup of the best Apple Watch chargers and docks. Which Apple Watch to buy  As you can see from the above, it’s not a simple case of being able to say a particular Apple Watch is the winner. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 clearly has the best features, but it’s big, perhaps too big, and it has a big price attached to it.  The Apple Watch Series 10 offers some enticing new features, and is probably the best choice for most users that don’t have specific need of the rugged outdoor qualities of the Ultra. The Apple Watch SE is Apple’s cheapest Apple Watch, starting at $249/£219, which will be a big point in its favor, but it’s not the cheapest Apple Watch ever sold. Apple used to sell the Apple Watch Series 3 for just $199/£179 for the 38mm version. The 2022 SE is cheaper than the 2020 generation though, which started at $279/£269. Along with a lower price, the SE also offers features such as Car Crash detection, but it lacks some of the health-related features that people are looking for.  It’s the health-related features that will probably stand out as the main differentiator between the SE and the Series 10, and this hasn’t changed from the previous generation. If the ability to check blood oxygen, take an ECG, and temperature monitoring, are important to you then it has to be the Series 10. If those aren’t something that you think you need then the SE will be quite sufficient.  And if you are off up a mountain, diving in the ocean, or heading out for a marathon, then the Ultra is the way to go.  Older Apple Watches  These Apple Watches were still being sold by Apple prior to September 2023. They have now been discontinued but you will possibly be able to buy a refurbished model from Apple’s Refurbished Store, or from one of the resellers below. Apple Watch Ultra  The original Apple Watch Ultra was sold for $799/£849 when Apple launched it in 2022. The new model has a lower price outside the U.S. so do be aware that if the price isn’t lower than the new model it’s not a good deal! This was the ultimate Apple Watch, but is it the watch for you? Apple designed it for athletes and adventures, so if that isn’t you maybe it would be overkill, or maybe you need the new features that the other Watches don’t offer, such as the better GPS and the larger screen.

But the Series 8 could still be a good choice if you find it at a good price. It offers the ability to track temperature and detect car crashes. The Series 8 cost $399/£419 for the 41mm version and $429/£449 for the 45mm version when Apple still sold it–which, if you are outside the U.S., is more than the Series 9 costs now.

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
