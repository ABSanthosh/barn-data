    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "description": "Macworld Apple has racked up more Emmy nominations than ever before. Apple’s press release states, “Apple TV+ today earned a record-breaking 81 Emmy Award nominations across 14 hit Apple Original titles,” but Apple counts its two nominated commercials, which nobody else does. Anywhere else you look, you’ll see 79 nominations. When Apple says “record-breaking” they must mean they broke their own record, which was the 72 nominations it received last year. It is by no means a record for a single network, as HBO Max has 142 this year and Netflix has 120. The second season of Severance earned a whopping 27 nominations, more than any program from any network this year. The standout hit–for Apple–is its comedy The Studio. It earned 23 Emmy nominations, tied with The White Lotus for third place overall and a record for any comedy in its first season. Other standout shows include Shrinking and Slow Horses (two of our favorite Apple TV+ shows), with seven and five nominations, respectively. Lots of nominations doesn’t mean lots of winners, though. We’ll find out which series won and for what at the Creative Arts ceremonies on September 6 and 7 and the Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony on September 14. If you want to know what to watch, we maintain a complete list of all the Apple TV+ shows and movies here. We also maintain a list of upcoming projects so you know what to look forward to. If you don’t have Apple TV+, we have to covered, with our article telling you how to get Apple TV+ for free or discounted.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html",
    "description": "Macworld In just a couple of months, Apple will unveil the iPhone 17. But you don’t need to wait to find out what it’s all about. Rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced, and there isn’t much we don’t know by now. Here’s everything we know about Apple’s new iPhones so far—and be sure to check back until the big event in September. Updated July 16: We now have confirmation of all the colors for all the iPhone 17 models, from internal documents listing the Pantone values. iPhone 17 release date: When is the next iPhone coming out? Here’s something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September—usually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here’s when the most recent models were released: iPhone 15: September 12, 2023 iPhone 14: Sepember 7, 2022 iPhone 13: Sepember 14, 2021 iPhone 12: October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid) Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than others due to production issues. So expect pre-orders around September 12 and on sale from September 19. @macworld.com iPhone 17 rumor roundup #apple #iphone #fyp ♬ original sound – Macworld – Macworld iPhone 17: Price We haven’t yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line. Most rumors suggest the “Plus” model will be replaced by the new super-slim “Air” model, which will take over its price in the lineup as well: iPhone 17: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB/128GB ($799) iPhone 17 Air: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB/128GB ($899) iPhone 17 Pro: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB/256GB ($1,099) iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB/256GB ($1,199) This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max. Now that Apple has introduced the iPhone 16e there may also be an iPhone 17e joining the lineup in September 2025, although we don’t know if it will be updated in September 2025, or if that model won’t arrive until spring 2026. The price is likely to be $599 for the iPhone 17e, unless Apple introduces an iPhone 17e in place of the iPhone 15, with a price of $699, in which case the iPhone 16e could remain in the lineup with its $599 price tag. iPhone 17: Colors We’ve heard a lot of rumors of the iPhone 17 colors over the past few months. Now we have independent confirmation from internal documents that list the Pantone colors of the various models. iPhone 17 Black (same as iPhone 16) White (same as iPhone 16) Steel Gray (Pantone 18-4005-TPG) Green (Pantone 2282 U) Purple (Pantone 530 U) Light Blue (Pantone 658 U) iPhone 17 Air Black (same as iPhone 16) White (brighter/colder than the iPhone 16) Light Blue (Pantone 657 U) Light Gold (Pantone 11-0604 TPG Gardenia) The blue shade of the iPhone 17 Air (left) will be lighter than the iPhone 17 (right).Foundry iPhone 17 Pro / Pro Max Black (same as iPhone 16 Pro) White (same as iPhone 16 Pro) Gray (similar to Natural Titanium) Dark Blue (Pantone 19-4025 TPG Mood Indigo) Orange (Pantone 1501243 TCX Papaya) The iPhone 17 Pro will have a VERY dark blue indigo color and a “papaya” orange.Foundry iPhone 17: New slimmer ‘iPhone 17 Air’ model Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a new “Slim” model with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. The much slimmer size will come at the expense of battery capacity, as there just isn’t room for a battery as thick as you find in other iPhones. Leaker yeux1122 has said the battery capacity is to be around 2,800mAh, which is more than 20% less than the battery in any iPhone 16 model. According to Korea’s Sisa Journal in January 2025, the so-called iPhone 17 Air will be 6.25mm thick and cost in the same price range as the iPhone 16 Plus (starting at $899 U.S.). A medium post from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the “thinnest part” of the new ultra-slim iPhone is just 5.5mm thick, but it’s difficult to know what that means without more context. The camera bump, according to Weibo leaker Ice Universe, will be 4.0mm thick, bringing the total phone thickness to 9.5mm at the camera. Additionally, a report from Majin Bu in July claims the selfie cam will shift from the right side of the Face ID sensors to the left. We’re unsure if the iPhone 17 Air will have the A19 or A19 Pro (reports vary), but it is expected to have only a single 48 megapixel rear camera and the new 24 megapixel front camera that all iPhone 17 models will get. An episode of the YouTube channel Unboxed Therapy featured a “dummy model” version of the phone from a third-party supplier. It’s our best look yet at the overall size and thin design. The iPhone 17 Air is also expected to feature a titanium frame, while the other iPhones will be made of aluminum. This may be due to titanium’s greater resistance to bending, which could be necessary given how thin the phone is. iPhone 17: Cameras All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a 24MP front-facing camera. An October 2024 research note from analyst Jeff Pu added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a 48MP telephoto camera along with a new 24MP front camera. According to a later report from Majin Bu, the 48MP telephoto camera will have a zoom of 3.5x (85mm), with an optical “crop zoom” mode similar to today’s 48MP wide camera, so you can shoot 12MP 7x (160mm) shots before the digital zoom kicks in. A report from The Information in July 2024 claims that “at least one” model will feature a mechanical aperture, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far. The iPhone 17 Pro and Air models are expected to feature a new “camera bar” design, where the large rectangular bump holding the rear cameras now stretches across the entire width of the iPhone. The regular iPhone 17 should have its two camera stacked vertically in a narrow bump., similar to the iPhone 16 today. Sonny Dickson In late June, Majin Bu posted photos of an iPhone 17 Pro dummy unit and its new camera bar. Majin Bu/X iPhone 17: Rumored specs and features Various rumors suggest that the new iPhones could benefit from the following updates: Battery The only rumored battery capacities so far are for the iPhone 17 Air (around 2,800mAh) from yeux1122 and the iPhone 17 Pro Max (around 5,000mAh) from the Weibo account Instant Digital. For the iPhone 17 Pro Max, that’s about 8% more capacity than the iPhone 16 Pro Max. Design and display The always-on display is supposed to finally be available on the non-Pro models. In addition, some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple’s iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device. Others claim that the non-Pro models will get a 120Hz display, but without the variable refresh rate of ProMotion. Apple is also said to be working with Corning on a new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass for the iPhone 17 lineup. However, a report in May claimed that Apple had scrapped the new glass due to production issues. Dynamic Island The iPhone 17 Pro Max may have a smaller dynamic island. Rumors have changed back and forth—Jeff Pu said the dynamic island (or rather, the hardware “pill” that the island surrounds) will be smaller in the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Then Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it will be the same size as current models. Then leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo said it will indeed be smaller. Processor We don’t know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models will get an A19 Pro, while the non-Pro models may get a standard or cut-back version of the A19, or perhaps a more souped up variant of the A18. A persistent rumor claims Apple will use a vapor chamber plate to distribute heat in the iPhone 17 Pro models, and leaker Majin Bu has an image of some production parts for it. Charging In June, 91mobiles spotted a new MagSafe charger compliant with the Q1 2.2 standard. That could mean that the iPhone 17 will support 50W charging over MagSafe, a massive boost over the current 25W capabilities in the iPhone 16. RAM Since Apple bumped every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, rumors have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to 12GB. In a report concerning RAM suppliers, Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple wants the regular iPhone 17 to feature 12GB as well, but supply shortages may be an issue. Wireless When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; the C1 modem isn’t quite good enough for Apple’s top-tier iPhones yet, and the C2 won’t be ready in time. Apple has its own Wi-Fi and Bluetooth chip that is expected to appear in the iPhone 17, however. iPhone 17 software: What was announced at WWDC? Apple didn’t reveal anything new about the iPhone 17, but we learned that iOS 26 will bring a lot of exciting new features to all iPhone users. A new Liquid Glass design language uses translucent layers and specular highlights to give all the interface elements a glass-like look that adds depth and realism to the user experience — a look and feel that will consistent across all Apple devices. Many of the iPhone apps are getting updates as well. The Phone app will feature a Call Screening option for vet incoming calls, and a Hold Assist function to detect hold music and let you know when someone has picked up. Messages will gain the ability to create polls in group texts for quick and easy consensus-taking on dates to meet or places to eat, and the like. Maps will use AI to make navigation more personalized with preferred routes and previously visited places. Moreover, a report by Mark Gurman in late June claims that Apple help back some iOS 26 features at WWDC, so there will likely be some new tricks for the iPhone 17. See our article on how iOS changes everything and what is new in iOS 26 to learn more about these features and many others. iPhone history The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone 16e are the current-generation models available from Apple.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
