    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2853877/the-ios-26-public-beta-is-here-but-you-probably-shouldnt-install-it-yet.html",
    "description": "Macworld It’s been a month since Apple released the first developer beta of iOS 26, and iPhone users are no doubt excited to try out the new version, as it introduces the Liquid Glass design among other cool features. With the release of the public beta, you may be wondering whether it’s worth installing iOS 26 on your iPhone or if you should wait until September. If you really want to try the new software, read on as we detail how smooth or buggy the iOS 26 beta is, and whether you should actually install it right now. iOS 26 is filled with tempting new features  There are many new features in iOS 26. Most notable, it has a new eye-catching Liquid Glass design that simulates a transparent layer for menus and panels, with depth and reflections. From new wallpapers to transparent icons and floating menus, Liquid Glass brings a fresh look to the iPhone’s operating system that you need to see and experience to understand. But even if you don’t care about Liquid Glass, there’s more to see in iOS 26. With iOS 26, you get live translations for phone calls and FaceTime. You can also see translations in iMessage conversations, all powered by Apple Intelligence. Speaking of Apple Intelligence, Visual Intelligence has been upgraded with the ability to circle anything in a screenshot to search for it on the web. Among many iPhone features, iOS 26 also includes a few new AirPods features.Foundry AirPods are also getting new tricks with iOS 26. In addition to letting you control the iPhone camera remotely, Apple’s earbuds can now work as high-quality microphones for the first time. This is great news for creators who want to shoot video without needing a lavalier mic. In addition, the update brings many quality-of-life improvements, such as smarter spam filters in Messages, estimated charging times, AutoMix (a DJ-like feature for Apple Music), and the option to set a custom snooze duration in the Clock app. Resist the temptation for now So how stable is the iOS 26 beta right now? Based on my experience running the latest beta on different iPhones, I can say that the update is reasonably stable – but there’s a lot to keep in mind. On my iPhone 16 Pro Max, the latest beta runs as smoothly as iOS 18 did. While I noticed a lot of frame drops and crashing apps in the first two betas, that’s no longer the case. If you’re planning to install the iOS 26 beta on one of the latest iPhones, such as the iPhone 15 or iPhone 16, you probably won’t face any significant performance issues. Yes, the iPhone may overheat a bit depending on what you’re doing (such as taking photos or playing games), but overall, it’s quite possible to use the device normally for regular tasks. iOS 26 is nice, but you’ll be better off waiting than installing the beta right now.Foundry At the same time, this doesn’t mean everything is perfect. After all, we’re talking about beta software. Although Apple has already fixed the most critical bugs, there are still minor issues here and there. For instance, some apps may not work very well with iOS 26, as developers are still working on updates to make them fully compatible. I also noticed some interface glitches, likely due to the adjustments Apple is still making to Liquid Glass. Battery life, while improved in the latest beta, is still not ideal if you need to spend all day without a charger nearby. But if you have an older iPhone, such as an iPhone 11 or 12, you might want to wait a bit longer before updating to the iOS 26 beta. In my tests, these devices still struggle to run the beta smoothly. I’m sure Apple will further optimize the update for these models. What about other betas? In addition to iOS 26, there are also betas available for iPadOS 26, watchOS 26, tvOS 26, macOS 26, and visionOS 26. Overall, my experience with these betas is quite similar to the iOS 26 beta. The latest betas of iPadOS 26 and macOS 26 are pretty stable. On the Mac, most of the apps I use every day (Pixelmator Pro, Slack, etc.) seem to be working just fine with the beta, although I’ve noticed Final Cut Pro crashing a few times. When it comes to tvOS 26 and watchOS 26, the changes are so subtle that I don’t even feel like I’m running beta software. Just be aware that you can’t downgrade your Apple TV or Apple Watch in case something goes wrong. Liquid Glass is cool, but it’ll be just as cool in September.Foundry Should you install the iOS 26 public beta? I understand the excitement of trying out new features (and a brand-new interface) ahead of the official release. If you’re okay with experiencing a few bugs while using your iPhone, iOS 26 is already at a fairly stable stage for a beta. Again, bugs are there, but they (probably) won’t make your phone unusable. However, my advice to everyone is: don’t install the beta unless you really need it for some reason. And don’t forget: if you’re going to install beta software, make sure you back up your device before updating. Make sure to back up your iPhone using a Mac or PC and archive the backup data so that you can downgrade in case something goes wrong. And besides, you only have a couple of months left to wait: iOS 26 is expected to be officially released to the public in September.",

    "description": "Macworld Apple’s iOS 26 plans, in brief The new iOS update is called iOS 26, not iOS 19 Redesign features translucent Liquid Glass effect Phone to get Call Screening, Hold Assist, and Live Translations Apple revealed its plans for its next iOS update at the WWDC keynote on June 9, 2025. iOS 26, coming to iPhones later this year, will bring a brand new look and lots of new features that will simplify and enhance the way we use existing apps. In this article we cover everything you need to know about iOS 26, including when iOS 26 will launch, which iPhones it will be compatible with, and all the new features and apps that are coming with the iPhone update. We also have the latest information about the iOS beta, for those who are keen to get iOS 26 on their iPhones now. It’s iOS 26, not iOS 19 The upcoming iOS is known as iOS 26, rather than iOS 19. In 2025 Apple is breaking with tradition and switching to a simpler naming convention that relates to the year, rather than a sequential number: it is 26 because iOS 26 will not launch until late 2025, and will be the operating system until late in 2026. Apple is using 26 for all of the operating system updates across the board, including the next iPadOS update, macOS Tahoe, the new watchOS and more, all of which were announced at WWDC.  iOS 26 Release date: When is the new iOS coming out? Date TBC: 15 September, 2025 predicted iOS 26 isn’t out yet, at least not for the general public. It will likely be available to install on compatible iPhones in September. This will likely happen shortly after the September event and the launch of the iPhone 17 and new Apple Watches.  iOS 26 Beta release date: Where is the public beta? Latest Developer Beta: Version 4 (second build), July 24, 2025 Latest Public Beta: July 24, 2025 You don’t have to wait until the full release to try the new software out. Apple runs a developer beta and a public beta for those who want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public. Both betas are free, though the developer beta requires a free registration as a developer. The first version of the iOS developer beta was released following the WWDC keynote, so developers could immediately begin testing it with their products. This beta is not stable and there were reports of issues from those who installed it straight away. Apple updated the first developer beta a few days after the launch. As of July 24, the developer beta is in version 4. Apple released the first Public Beta on July 24. It corresponds with the the second release of Developer Beta 4 (build 23A5297m). Between WWDC and the official release in the fall, Apple will release a string of beta releases, typically eight or so in total. We have a separate article that details how to join Apple’s beta software program so you can test the new software as soon as the beta arrives. Anyone using the beta is encouraged to file bug reports using the included Apple’s Feedback Assistant app so that the company can address them. If you want to learn more about the beta read: What’s in the latest iOS beta and how to get it. And make sure you read why we advise against installing the iOS beta. iOS 26 supported devices: Which iPhones get iOS 26 iOS 26 is a free software update for iPhone 11 and later The iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max will miss out on iOS 26 Apple Apple has confirmed the following iPhones will get iOS 26, we’ve included the year that phone launched. iPhone 16e (2025) iPhone 16/16 Plus/16 Pro/16 Pro Max (2024) iPhone 15/15 Plus/15 Pro/15 Pro Max (2023) iPhone 14/14 Plus/14 Pro/14 Pro Max (2022) iPhone SE (3rd gen) (2022) iPhone 13/13 mini/13 Pro/13 Pro Max (2021) iPhone 12/12 mini/12 Pro/12 Pro Max (2020) iPhone SE (2nd gen) (2020) iPhone 11/11 Pro/11 Pro Max (2019) When Apple updates the operating system for its devices it often means that certain models are not compatible with the update. The iPhone XR, XS, and XS Max, which were supported by iOS 18 and launched in 2018, will miss out on iOS 26.  This doesn’t mean that those 2018 iPhones are unsupported by Apple. Apple will continue to issue security-related software updates to iOS 18 for a few more years. Read about how long iPhones are supported to find out which iPhones are no longer supported with security updates.  Nor does this mean that all the supported iPhones get all the new features. As was the case in 2024, only certain iPhones can support Apple Intelligence powered features. That’s the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and the whole of the  iPhone 16 range. This means that if your phone isn’t one of those mentioned you miss out on features such as the Visual Intelligence and Genmoji updates, as well as the Phone app ability to manage your unwanted calls.  Find out how the new iOS compares with the current version in our comparison of iOS 26 vs iOS 18: What’s different, what’s new, and should you update? iOS 26 design: Liquid Glass and other design changes Apple During the WWDC keynote Apple previewed the new iPhone features coming later in 2025. The biggest change is a visual one: a bold new redesign called Liquid Glass. What is Liquid Glass? The new design features a graphical user interface that Apple is calling Liquid Glass, which creates a translucent effect that mimics the qualities of glass. The new Liquid Glass theme represents the biggest change to iOS since iOS 7 was introduced in 2013. Back then Apple dropped the skeuomorphic design in favor of flat symbolic icons. This time everything is more curved, less flat, with translucent elements reflecting or refracting the content in the background, and resizing to fit around what is onscreen. The Liquid Glass elements will also change color to reflect the content beneath as you scroll and it will be possible to see blurred and refracted elements of the background through the top layer. Apple says that it will feel more like interacting with the physical world, with elements dynamically reacting to your touch. The company also says the changes “blur the lines between hardware and software”. This new Liquid Glass design extends to all of Apple’s products and to all of Apple’s apps. You’ll see the effect on the Dock, widgets and icons. Panes, windows, buttons and menus will be presented as translucent layers with specular highlights. Apple says that it will also make design changes that will simplify app interfaces to make the controls more visible. Initial feedback to the new Liquid Glass design was negative with some beta testers complaining that content wasn’t visible due to the overlaying of menus over background images, later versions of the beta have dialled this back to make the menus more visible. Interface changes  Apple Apple is adapting the interface to focus more on what is on the screen rather than cover things with tools and menu bars. Menus will shrink as you scroll to reveal the content below. Apple is also removing some of the clutter from menus to simplify things and emphasise the more frequently used options. For example, rather than occupying a rectangular bar at the bottom of the screen, groups of controls will appear on floating elements that pop out additional controls, change as you move between views, and are tucked away when you scroll. These changes to the menus are designed to make it easier to access the features you use most often, and discover others. Apple is trying to make iOS and its apps more intuitive.  A good example of how these design changes will be applied is the Lock Screen, which will be more adaptive. The image you choose as your wallpaper will be scaled to fit the height and width of the Lock Screen and positioned to fill the available space around elements like the time. Additionally, the wallpaper image will slide up as notifications come in. We’ll discuss the changes coming to individual apps below, but essentially Apple is making it easier to find the tools you usually use, without the clutter of all the other features you don’t need. iOS 26 and Apple Intelligence Apple has been having trouble with some of it’s AI efforts, especially the Siri features that were touted at WWDC 2024. Apple had promised that iOS 18.4 would bring a major update to Siri, where it would be better at natural conversations with the user, using personal context, awareness of what is on screen, and the ability to perform in-app actions. Apple has since confirmed that these Siri-related features have been pushed back until 2026, which means they should come as an update to iOS 26, perhaps in March, but we could be waiting even longer. Apple still had a number of impressive Apple Intelligence powered features to show off at WWDC though. In fact, some of the new features coming to Spotlight on the Mac look like some of the features promised for Siri. Some of these new Apple Intelligence features will make a big impact in apps, especially the Phone app, which we will discuss below. Another beneficiary of Apple Intelligence is Visual Intelligence, which was introduced in iOS 18 and gains a very useful ability in iOS 26. Visual Intelligence in iOS 26 Visual Intelligence in iOS 26.IDG In iOS 18 you can use Visual Intelligence by holding up the iPhone to view something you are curious about, triggering Visual Intelligence (via the Camera Control button if you have one, or via the Control Centre if not) and viewing information about what you were pointing the camera at. It could identify a building, or offer to add the date from a poster to your calendar, for example. That’s all very well when you are out and about, but what about when you are just browsing the web and want to know where something someone is wearing is from or where a video is being filmed? In iOS 26 it will be possible take a screenshot and look up information about that image and products in it using Visual Intelligence. You can also ask ChatGPT for information about the screenshot.  Genmoji and Image Playground in iOS 26 Apple Also benefitting from Apple Intelligence is Genmoji, another feature that arrived with iOS 18. Genmoji lets you create custom emoji using AI. To create a Genmoji you type a description in the Describe an Emoji field and tap on Create New Emoji. You can use photos of people you know as a basis and refine the emoji until it represents what you are looking for. The emoji will then be available in your emoji keyboard to use. In iOS 26 the Genmoji interface is getting a redesign. Users will be able to mix two emoji together, or alter an existing emoji to create something new, or even combine an emoji and a Sticker (which can be created from a photo). Users will be able to further customise emoji inside Image Playground, changing expressions. Image Playground, which is Apple’s app for making AI-generated images, arrived in iOS 18 and is getting an update in iOS 26. In iOS 26 it will be possible to use ChatGTP styles and prompts, such as an oil painting as well as those provided by Apple to create images in Image Playground. iOS 26 new apps and updated apps  Phone: Call Screening and Hold Assist Translations Camera app overhaul With each iteration of iOS the set of apps Apple provides grows and evolves, and many of the changes coming to the apps on the iPhone are shared by those same apps on Apple’s other devices. iOS 26 is no different. This time some of the upcoming changes are going to be quite transformative to how you use the phone – and by which we mean the telephone aspect to the iPhone.   Phone app The phone app might not be the one we use the most, but as Apple says, it is fundamental to the iPhone. With iOS 26 the phone app is getting a big update that essentially turns it into a PA and a spam filtering tool.  Apple is tapping into Apple Intelligence to bring new Voice Mail summaries to surface the most important information, but even more exciting, it is aiming to eliminate unwanted calls with a new Call Screening option that can answer the call in the background, ask the caller to explain their reason for calling, and then provide a text summary of those details to you before you decide whether or not to take the call. Of course this may make it harder to ignore calls from people you ought to actually speak to, but it will be a good way to siphon off spam and hoax calls from unknown numbers. That’s not all. Another new feature is Hold Assist, which will automatically detect hold music and mute the call until it is connected to an agent. As a result you can get things done without having to keep your phone speaker playing irritating hold music until someone answers. When an agent becomes free they will be informed that you are there and your phone will ring alerting you to the connection and you can take the call. It’s going to be like having your own receptionist.  Another change in the Phone app should make it impossible to accidentally tap on contact in the Recents list and call them. Currently, if you tap on a name in your Recents list it will automatically call that person. A new setting will allow you to turn off “Tap Recents to Call”. @macworld.com iOS 26 makes the iPhone a better…phone? #wwdc #iphone #fyp ♬ original sound – Macworld – Macworld Live Translations Also coming to the Phone app, but also present as a features in Messages and FaceTime, is Live Translations, which will help you communicate with someone who speaks another language. With this feature you will be able to have a conversation with some who speaks a different language to you. If you are familiar with the Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy this is almost at the level of having a Bable Fish. If you are speaking to some via the phone app the iPhone will translate what it being said, with a spoken voice translating what has been said into your language. The recipient will also hear translations in their own language. Apparently they don’t need to have an iPhone. The main restriction right now is that Live Translation for Phone is available only for one-on-one calls in English, French, German, Portuguese, and Spanish. As we said above, it’s not only the Phone app that will get the Live Translation features. FaceTime and Messages will as well. And Translation is also finding its way into the Music app. FaceTime  When speaking to someone via FaceTime you will see real-time captions in your own language. Live Captions aren’t entirely new to FaceTime, you can already turn on that functionality in Accessibility \u003e Live Captions – although this only works if your language is set to English U.S. As well as the new Live Translation feature, FaceTime also gets changes to the interface designed to surface the controls you need while keeping the caller visible. For example, controls float to the bottom right and recede when you don’t need them.  The FaceTime call list also gets a new look, with video messages autoplaying as you scroll.  Messages Apple If you are using Messages to communicate with someone who speaks a different language what you type is translated into their language and vice versa. As with the phone, Messages is getting a screening tool to combat spam. On-device spam detection will give you “total control over who appears in your conversation list,” according to Apple. It is already possible to filter out spam by using the Unknown Senders list in Messages, but in iOS 26 Messages will have a greater ability to screen for spam, and it will make sure you still receive verification codes and other critical or time sensitive messages. Also in Messages you will be able to add a background image to Group Chats and a new option to create a poll will be available. Messages will even suggest a poll if a situation calls for one. Anyone can add options to the poll, as well.  Those who have access to Apple Cash (still U.S. only) can also access this from group chats.  Apple Music In Apple Music you will be able to follow the lyrics alongside the translation into your own language. For some languages you will even see a pronunciation guide. Also coming to the Music app is a new auto-mix option that uses AI to fade between songs and match beats like a DJ would. There is also a new animated Apple Music artwork option for the Lock Screen.  Interface changes should also mean it is faster and easier to get to the music you are in to. For example, you can pin your favourite album or playlist to the top of your library.  Apple Camera \u0026 Photos In iOS 26, Apple is redesigned camera app, hiding most of the lesser used camera shooting modes and options to simplify the increasingly cramped layout and giving users quick access to settings. In the Photos app there will be the ability to add 3D effects to photos. Games Apple is finally tidying up the gaming experience on the iPhone with a brand new Games app. With half a billion people playing games on iPad, according to Apple, it’s about time.  Apple says it is creating a new destination to help its gamers get more out of their games. The Games app will offer various tabs to make finding the games you are playing or have played easier. The Home tab reveals what’s most relevant to you. The Library tab shows all the games you have ever downloaded.  There is also a Play Together tab where you can see what your friends are playing, play games with them, compare scores, and invite them to play games. You can also challenge them to beat your highest score in single player games. Turning single player games into fun competitions with friends, with scores in real time. This will be Apple’s second attempt to get users to connect socially: remember iTunes Ping? (Apple would probably rather you forgot). Apple Another change coming to gaming on iPhone (and iPad) is a new consistency to hoe touch controls are applied in games. Developers working on an iPhone or iPad game that requires more advanced controls have always had to design their own touch controls, and this can be inconsistent. In iOS 26, Apple will provides its own touch controls for buttons, thumbsticks, dpads, throttles, and touchpads. Apple Wallet Like Apple Cash many of the new Apple Wallet features are U.S. only, such as the ability to add Drivers Licenses to Apple Wallet.  Apple says there will be more ways to pay with Apple Pay in iOS 26, for example you can redeem points or choose to pay in instalments. That feature is currently available in nine states. From the fall Apple says it will be possible to add a U.S. passport, but only for use for flights inside the U.S.  There will be a new API for developers to take advantage of, enabling them to provide customers with more information within the Wallet app, such as details of the services included with the fare and upgrade options that can be accessed from within the Wallet app. You can also track Apple Pay orders, with Apple Intelligence finding the order details and tracking information and keeping them together for you.  Passwords \u0026 Autofill The Passwords app, introduced in iOS 18, is also getting an update. You can check changes that you’ve made to accounts logged in the Passwords app, view previous passwords that were used for these accounts and see when they were altered. In addition, iOS 26, Apple is introducing improvements that will make using passkeys easier. Passkeys is an authentication method that replaces traditional passwords with security keys and biometrics. Many apps and websites already provide support for passkeys, and with the iOS 26 update, it will be possible for iPhone and iPad apps to enable users to create a passkey with just a tap. Passkeys can be authenticated with Face ID or Touch ID, and credentials will be synchronized between your Apple devices via iCloud. It will also be possible to pre-fill personal data, such as name and email, so you no longer have to waste time filling in long sign-up forms. Even better, iOS 26 will be able to autofill verification codes from Gmail and WhatsApp. Verification code autofill may also work in Google Chrome, currently verification codes only work with Apple’s Safari browser. Apple Maps  Apple The Maps app also gets an update, using Apple Intelligence to understand your regular commutes and learn your favourites. With this information it will be able to warn you if you should take a different route due to traffic.  Another change to Maps is that if you want it to it can log (with encryption) Visited Places, which will make it easier to find and recall places you have been to in the past. It’s easy to delete this history too.  Reminders In iOS 26, Reminders will suggest things such as tasks and grocery items, plus follow-ups based on your emails or other text on your iPhone, Mac, and more. Notes Notes will gain Markdown. Weather Satellite-based weather. Clock You will finally be able to set a snooze duration of between one and 15 minutes, rather than being stuck with set eight minute snoozes! You will also gain the ability to set alarms from inside other apps. For example, you could set an alarm from within a recipe app without you needing to open the Clock. AirPods related features: Pause Media When Falling Asleep Existing AirPods should get some new features due to the iOS 26 update. These include a new feature that will enable AirPods to pause when they sense the wearer has fallen asleep. Code in the iOS 26 beta indicates that this feature is tied to iOS 26, rather than the AirPods line specifically – it may even work on Apple’s Beats headphones. In addition it will be possible to easily switch between different audio input devices – so you could switch from AirPods as dedicated microphones to another device, for example. Other new features in iOS 26 There are lots of other changes coming to iOS itself, many of which will improve the overall experience. Running tasks in the background iOS 26 will have a new API for running tasks in the background. So you won’t have to keep an app open when they’re doing something important, such as uploading files or exporting a video. Users can switch to other apps without interrupting the previous task. Adaptive Power Mode This feature aims to extend battery life by adjusting performance based on usage patterns. Where Low Power Mode throttles your iPhone’s performance and kills certain background activities to save energy, Adaptive Power Mode makes smaller adjustments to your iPhone’s performance based on how you use it. As a result the impact should be subtler, and potentially something users could keep on at all times. Battery Intelligence: AI-powered battery management iOS 26 will introduce a feature dubbed Battery Intelligence. This presents the estimated charging duration to reach 80% (then 100%) when connected to a charger – so you know how long you will need to change your iPhone before you can leave the house. A new adaptive low power mode has been spotted in the iOS 26 developer beta. This doesn’t replace the regular low power mode (that’s still around) but instead uses machine learning to make adjustments that could help eke out a little more juice from your battery. In addition, the Lock Screen will now display estimated charging times to hit 80 percent and 100 percent battery power. RCS Universal Profile 3.0 and other Android ‘friendly’ features Support for RCS Universal Profile 3.0 may come in an update to iOS 26. RCS 3.0 will encrypt iPhone-to-Android messages, and offer other features to make communicating between iPhones and Android phones more seamless. Currently, Android users can edit a message within 15 minutes of it being sent – this works in iOS 18.5 and the iOS 26 developer beta but the iPhone displays the edited message as a new one with an asterisk rather than replacing the message with the edited message. iPhone users are able to edit messages sent to other iPhones, but they are not yet able to edit RCS messages sent to an Android phone. RCS 3.0 should also make this available to iPhone users. There also be simplified eSIM transfer from Android.",

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple’s Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber’s The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. […] Phil’s appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers — remember, developer relations is all under Phil — might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn’t have (they’re pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple’s enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *     *     * For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community — and I can’t help but suspect that it won’t come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We’ll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it’s easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that’s either not the case, or it doesn’t stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I’m not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I’ve decided that it’s best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple’s leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",
