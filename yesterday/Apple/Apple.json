    "description": "Technological advancements have meant that devices are lasting longer than ever. But one of the first parts to go is often the battery. Laptop batteries can especially be a problem, since many of us keep our laptops plugged in much of the time. But there’s a new solution designed to improve your battery health: Chargie. Despite Apple and other device makers having solutions for battery aging that sets charge limits at 80% automatically, the reality is it isn’t always reliable or available or on older devices that don’t support the feature. Chargie makes it easy by giving you the ability to manually adjust the charging limit along with a fully controllable daily scheduler to keep the battery at a much safer 50% or 60% while you can, and also have it at 90 or 100% at times when you need longer battery life. more…",

    "description": "China-based Bytedance has one last avenue to avoid the sale of its TikTok social media service after losing a court appeal to invalidate a US law that requires the service be sold by January 19, 2025.TikTok's issues with the US government and courts continue.In its decision, the US Court of Appeals noted that the law requiring the sale of TikTok was a bipartisan effort in order to counter \"a well-substantiated national security threat posed by the PRC (People's Republic of China).\" The US government believes that Bytedance's ownership of TikTok gives them — and thus the Chinese government — access to a vast trove of personal data collected from users.TikTok will likely appeal to the Supreme Court, which could result in an extra 90-day stay on enforcement of the law if the court agrees to hear the case and President Biden approves the stay. If it refuses the appeal, TikTok could be facing a ban or forced sale in the US in early January, despite the 170 million Americans using the social media service.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/229086/best-laptop-bags-2.html",
    "description": "Macworld A good MacBook bag shares many qualities with Apple’s laptops. We want it to be tough, so it needs to be made from good materials. We want to use it for multiple tasks, so it needs to have plenty of pockets and compartments. Let’s admit it, with the diminishing number of ports on the MacBook, the bags often have the edge. And since we all admire good design here, we certainly don’t mind if the bag looks fantastic. Plus, whatever MacBook you’ve got, Air or Pro, you’ve probably spent enough on it that you don’t want to risk it breaking—and don’t mind spending just a little more to keep it safe. There’s no shortage of companies out there that make protective accessories for MacBooks, from laptop bags and rucksacks to sleeves, covers, and cases that clip on directly, and plenty of them do their best to be just as stylish as the Mac they’re protecting. We’ve rounded up a selection of our favorite cases, sleeves, backpacks, roll-tops, shells and totes for the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, whether you have a 13-, 14-, 15- or 16-inch model, to keep your Mac safe. All of the bags below fit those criteria, but we’ve been careful to choose bags that meet specific needs. Keep in mind that every bag here won’t fit every MacBook, but if a bag can’t handle the 16-inch MacBook Pro, we’ve been sure to make a note of it. Bellroy Laptop Sleeve – Best MacBook sleeve Pros Premium feel Magnetic closure Colors Price When Reviewed: $55 Best Prices Today: $55 at Amazon$55 at Belkin Fits: 13-14-inch and 15-16-inch versions Bellroy is a Australian accessory brand that makes premium bags, cases and wallets, and its laptop sleeves offer high-quality protection. Outside, the woven, water-resistant material is eco-friendly—made from 100% recycled PET bottles. Inside, the quilted microfiber lining features a soft ridge that holds your laptop in place. The sleeve snaps shut with a neat magnetic bumper. Available in Black, Slate, Navy, Bronze and a leather-free Saltbush. Bellroy Apple sells only one MacBook sleeve in its online store: the leather-free Bellroy Caddy for Mac Laptops, which is available in two sizes for 13-14-inch MacBooks and the 15- and 16-inch MacBooks. There’s fold-down, front-pocket access and a foam-padded laptop sleeve, as well as two stretch mesh pockets and mesh pen slips. Case Logic Laptop Sleeve – Best budget MacBook sleeve Pros Tight fit Padded Color range Price When Reviewed: $31.99 Best Prices Today: $23.03 at Amazon$29.99 at Adorama$29.99 at B\u0026H Fits: 13-inch Case Logic makes many laptop sleeves that are suitable for various sizes of MacBook and come in all number of colors. The Case Logic Laptop Sleeve fits a 13.3in MacBook, such as the M1 MacBook Air or M2 MacBook Pro. It’s form-fitting, so the MacBook shouldn’t slip about inside, and it features padding for extra protection. There is woven webbing along the sides to further protect the laptop and strengthen the case. It’s a slim case that should fit nicely inside your bag.  Available in a range of strong colors, including Pink, Dark Blue, Lime Green and Teal. Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve – Best wireless charging sleeve Pros Luxury sleeve Includes MagSafe wireless charger Doubles as desk pad Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: $129.99 at Journey Fits: 13-14-inch, and 15-16-inch versions The Journey NEXA laptop sleeve bills itself as a 4-in-1, and it certainly is multi-functional. As well as protecting your laptop during travel, it includes two wireless chargers (one MagSafe compatible) and can work as both a deskpad and mousepad to free your workspace of clutter. Slide your MacBook into the soft but padded-for-protection vegan leather sleeve, and you’ll be impressed by the luxury feel of this premium laptop sleeve. When you arrive at the office, hotel or just back home, it doubles up as a deskpad with chargers for your iPhone (7.5W MagSafe) and AirPods (5W). While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the best iPhone chargers) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful MacBook charger. The Journey NEXA 4-in1 Laptop Sleeve is available in Black or a fetching stone-like Dove Gray. Read our full Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging review STM Myth Laptop Brief – Best MacBook shoulder bag Pros Slim 7L storage bag with pockets Handle and detachable shoulder strap Price When Reviewed: $79.95 Best Prices Today: $47.97 at Lenovo USA$78.76 at Amazon$79.95 at STM Fits: up to 14-inch STM’s Myth laptop bag will fit up to 14-inch MacBooks, although it officially stated up to 13-inch laptops. It comes in Black, Granite Black, and Slate Blue depending. The slim shoulder bag protects your laptop by suspending it, so that it doesn’t touch the bottom of the bag. It’s also encased in foam. The shoulder strap is easy to adjust and has a non-slip pad to make it more comfortable. With a subtle luggage trolley sleeve, it can slip onto the telescopic handle of a suitcase for easy of use when not on your back—handy for busy travel interchanges and crowded trains and buses. It’s well-made, with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) coated webbing handles with rivets, reverse coil zippers, and water-repellent C6DWR coating applied to the fabric. Inside there are plenty of sections and pockets (we counted 10 but there could be even more hidden away) to help with organization. Cable-routing means you can charge your laptop or other devices while still in the bag. if you fancy something more business-like check out the Troubadour Apex Briefcase, reviewed further down, which is smarter but costs a fair amount more than the STM Myth. Incase Edge Hardshell for MacBook – Best MacBook hard shell Pros Protects in use Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: $49.99 at Amazon$49.99 at Incase Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Choose a hard shell if you want to wrap your precious MacBook in robust scratch and bump protection but still be able to use it in action. The minimalist and lightweight Incase Edge Hardshell MacBook Case comes in clear and see-through black versions for all of the current MacBooks in Apple’s laptop range. It protects with raised edge bumpers in its high-impact resistant polycarbonate shell. All ports and buttons remain fully accessible. Rubberized feet keep the MacBook securely in place and less likely to slip off its surface. Available from Apple, Amazon and direct from Incase. Troubadour Apex 3.0 Backpack – Best premium MacBook backpack Pros Super stylish Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Hidden iPhone pocket AirTag pocket Cons Premium price Price When Reviewed: $245 Best Prices Today: $225 at Amazon$245 at Troubadour$389 at Walmart Electronics Fits: up to 17-inch Apple builds its MacBooks to a high spec and premium design, so if you are carrying yours around in a backpack maybe that should also be top-notch, too. And, like Apple’s products, the Troubadour Apex 3.0 comes with a premium price tag attached. You do get your money’s worth, with chic styling and a generous selection of storage pockets, including one for your iPhone hidden in one of the straps, which means you can access it—or other valuable item such as your wallet—without having to remove the bag from your shoulders. And there’s even a special pocket for an Apple AirTag. The laptop section is at the back and easy to access, with easily enough space for a 16-inch MacBook Pro. Altogether there are 14 sections or pockets, pen holders and zipped enclosures. It features a trolley sleeve on the back to attach to a suitcase handle, and a robust handle at the top for when you want to give your shoulders a rest or not bump into people in crowded spaces. The Apex 3.0 is lightweight and comfortable but still generous, with a 25L capacity. There is also a Compact version, with a 16L capacity. It is available in Black, Navy, Air Force Blue and Obsidian Green. Troubadour also sells a sling version, the Apex Sling. While not large enough to fit even a 13-inch MacBook, it does have a padded pocket for an iPad mini. It features many of the larger backpack benefits, such as the quality build, good looks, sustainable materials, hidden iPhone pocket and AirTag pocket. Further down we review the Apex Tote and Apex Briefcase for flexibility in the. smart range. Full Troubadour Apex 3.0 Backpack review. Pakt Travel Backpack 2.0 – Best MacBook travel backpack Pros Premium build Plenty of storage Smart organizer sections Multiple carry options AirTag pocket Sustainable materials Price When Reviewed: From $325 Best Prices Today: $325 at Pakt Fits: up to 16-inch We haven’t found a laptop backpack that beats the Pakt Travel Backpack for storage smarts, comfort and versatility. There are many imitators but this remains our favorite, and there’s a recent version 2.0 that makes it even better and more environmentally friendly. The 35L backpack model meets the carry-on criteria for most airlines. It weighs 4.1lbs, and measures 21.5 x 12.5 x 8 inches (55 x 32 x 21 cm). The 45L backpack, however, exceeds those limits so you’ll have to pray that you’re not pulled aside as you check-in or board the plane. It weighs 4.4lbs, and is sized 23 x 13 x 9 inches (60 x 33 x 24 cm). You can use it as a backpack, but also hide away the straps and carry by the side handles as a duffle or via a top handle. This might make the 45L bag appears smaller than it looks strapped to your back, and you can get it through check-in with all that extra storage. An expansion pocket adds additional packing space without adding to these dimensions. Check your favorite airline for carry-on limits. It features a handy clamshell interior with two compartments, so you can pack the backpack like a suitcase. Spread out open, it should fit under a bed or couch, saving you from unpacking to a wardrobe for short stays. Between the compartments, a padded sleeve gives robust but luxury protection to your MacBook (up to 16 inches). You can access the laptop from the top, making a security check much less hassle. There’s a multi-section front admin pocket that will handle a bunch of tech gear you might need close to hand, such as AirPods, chargers, power banks and cables, or even an iPad. There’s also a key leash in this part. Pakt sells a 15L Everyday Bag that can fit inside the Travel Backpack. On the plane, you could remove this and store by your feet for easy access, and then slide it back in the pack when you take that out of the overhead when you disembark. There are so many great extra features: the water-bottle holder is generous in size yet a tight elasticated hold; a zipped, hidden pocket at the back and bottom of the pack is handy for placing your phone, wallet and pocket fodder when you are passing through airport security; one of the pocket sections includes a deep AirTag holder; you can pull out hidden accessory straps on one side; and there’s roller-luggage passthrough to give your back a rest. With this version 2.0 of its Travel Backpack, Pakt uses rNylon (recycled nylon), which it claims can be recycled indefinitely—making it a more sustainable material than even rPET (recycled polyethylene terephthalate). It is covered in a water-repelling, tear-resistant PFC-free DWR coating, and is available in either Black, Forest or Ocean colors. Stubble \u0026 Co The Roll Top 20L – Best MacBook roll-top backpack Pros Premium look and feel Plenty of accessible pockets Striking range of colors Price When Reviewed: $170 Best Prices Today: $170 at Stubble \u0026 Co Fits: 13-inch (15L bag) and 13-16-inch (20L) versions A roll top bag is simple to use as they have fewer straps and zips than a traditional backpack. They feature a wide top opening so you can quickly see what’s inside and make it easier to reach in and pull out your belongings. It is adjustable in volume as unused space can saved and bulking reduced by rolling up the top flap as you close it. Tighten the strap to condense the loa or loosen when more space is required. Previously we have championed the Ogio Alpha Convoy 525r Rolltop Backpack, which I have used happily for several years. However, our heads and minds have been turned by Stubble \u0026 Co’s The Roll Top, available in either 15L or 20L capacities. We tested the spacier 20L model. Its more waterproof than the Ogio and has smarter colour accents as well as eight overall color options: Black, Yellow, Urban Green, Arctic White, Tasmin Blue, Concrete, Sand and Ember Orange. The padded laptop compartment is easily accessed at the side of the bag. The 20L version fits up to a 16-inch MacBook; the 15L allows for a 13-inch laptop. Inside the laptop compartment and also lining inside the main bag are contrasting colours: inside the black, white, concrete and green bags, it’s a striking orange. The main compartment has a reinforced, magnetised roll top closure. I’m used to a more click-tight buckle fastening but am getting the hang of the G-hook fastener. There are five internal organiser pockets, including two with mesh. On each side are generous elasticated side pockets for your water bottle, umbrella or bike lock. And, an essential if carrying the bag off your back, there’s a top grab handle. Roll-tops are often used by cycle couriers for their fast, easy access, and the Stubble \u0026 Co Roll Top features a bike light anchor and reflective trim for enhanced visibility and road safety. Troubadour Apex Briefcase – Best MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Premium price Price When Reviewed: $245 Best Prices Today: $245 at Troubadour Fits: up to 16-inch If you desire the convenience of a shoulder or messenger bag with the smartness of a modern briefcase, another part of the stylish if pricey Apex line of laptop bags is the Apex Briefcase—in black only.

It is most definitely a special tote, with zipped inside storage and nine interior mesh, zipped or open pockets and compartment, plus two on the exterior.

When you tire of carrying the bag by its handles, you can turn it into a shoulder bag with the non-slip detachable strap. It available in Black, Scree (a stony color) and Basalt (grayish blue). Harber London Rugged Laptop Briefcase – Luxury MacBook briefcase Pros Can hold MacBook and iPad Pockets for tech organization Premium build Made from 100% Recycled Plastic Bottles Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $545 Best Prices Today: $545 at Harber London Fits: up to 16-inch If carrying a briefcase just reminds you of your schooldays or executives on Mad Men, think again as today’s stylish briefcases are less boxy and make a far better impression than dropping a boring backpack on the boardroom floor. While this smart and stylish, without being too formal, laptop briefcase is called Rugged, its looks and build quality are at the luxury end of the laptop bag scale—and it’s priced accordingly, although it’s not over the top for a premium business briefcase that’s handmade by expert craftsmen in Spain. And, yes, it is rugged with a water-resistant outer fabric shell made of recycled plastic bottles, so environmentally friendly too. That said, we wouldn’t take this laptop briefcase out hiking in the woods—it’s just too lovely to dump in some mud outside your tent. Available in two sizes—5.6L capacity for 13/14-inch and 7.5L for 15/16-inch laptops, it can hold a MacBook and a large iPad in its padded laptop and tablet compartments. It’s got special pockets for notebooks and your passport, as well as two clever detachable magnetic pouches for your chargers or other tech essentials. There are nine interior sections, holders for pens, and a row of card slots, as well as a dedicated integrated AirTag pocket. It can be carried by its full-grain cowhide leather handle or the detachable leather carry strap, and is available in Mocha, Black or Olive. Grams (28) Leather Folio – Best luxury sleeve with storage Pros Premium look and feel Neat accessory pockets Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $229 Best Prices Today: $189 at GRAMS28 Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch This super-stylish MacBook sleeve doesn’t just keep your laptop safely protected in transit, it also includes exterior and interior pockets to allow you to ditch the backpack and just look the business carrying a sleek fine Italian leather sleeve. The spacious interior has plenty of room for your MacBook Pro and is padded for extra care. Inside there are two pockets for your phone, a charger, cables, or other accessories such as a paper notebook, plus two pen holders and a card pocket. As a bonus there’s even a little pocket for an Apple AirTag. An front exterior pocket gives quick access to paperwork or just the latest issue of a newspaper or style magazine. You can personalize the Leather Folio with up to four letters, in white or colorless lettering. It measures 14.3-x-0.2-x-1 inches (36.3-x-25.9-x-2.5-cm, and weighs 15.2oz (430g). It’s available in Black, Dark Blue, Olive or Fossil Gray. For the 13-inch MacBook you’ll want the 114 Leather Folio, for 14-inch MacBook the 120, and 118 for a 15-inch or 16-inch MacBook. Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve – Smart sleeve with storage Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets In-sleeve charging Cons No sealed pockets Price When Reviewed: $76 Best Prices Today: $76 at Mujjo Fits: 14-inch, 16-inch Made from top-quality waterproof vegan leather, the Envoy Laptop Sleeve from Dutch design brand Mujjo offers portable storage not just for the MacBook but your favored accessories, too. There are tight outside pockets to store your charger and cables plus phone and other essentials. The laptop is secured by the classy sleeve’s magnetic opening that combines fast access with a firm close. Handily, there’s a generous side opening that allows for easy in-sleeve charging. At the back there’s an easy-access slip pocket for a notebook or passport. You can carry just about anything slim in this sleeve so don’t leave it unattended at the café! The Mujjo Envoy is available in Black or Blue and for both the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, although 13-inch and 15-inch MacBooks are comfortably (if slightly loosely) held, too. Harber London Nomad Organiser – Best Premium Organizer for MacBook Pros Pockets for tech organization Premium luxury leather looks Can hold MacBook and iPad Handle and detachable shoulder strap Cons Bulks up quickly if over-stuffed Expensive Price When Reviewed: $404 Best Prices Today: $404 at Harber London Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch While a laptop seems like a self-contained unit, with keboard, screen, trackpad, hard drive and everything all in one tidy package, it’s not quite as easy as that. You need a charger and charging cable for starters, and when you’re on the move you have to carry around your AirPods, and maybe you prefer a proper mouse to the MacBook’s trackpad. And what if you have an iPad to work on, too? A simple sleeve can’t cope with all that lot, but the Nomad Organiser, from luxury bag maker Harber London, certainly can. The Nomad has ten pockets: a padded one for your MacBook Pro, and another padded pocket that fits an iPad from 9.7 to 12.9 inches, and capacious enough to handle the tablet with a Smart Cover. Be warned, though, that holding both laptop and tablet, the sleeve can be tricky to close if you are stuffing in chargers and other tech too. One lower pocket is big enough for your MacBook charger, but you’ll notice a bump in the fine lines when closed. I prefer to keep my bulky stuff in a wider-opening bag—check out our favorite tech organizer bags—and use this sleeve for the thinner essentials. Two pockets are zipped for safe-keeping (for example, cash or memory cards) and there’s a handy key fob strap. There’s a couple of holders for pens or an Apple Pencil. There’s a phone pocket, too, but I’m not sure I’d want all my devices in one place, and most of us prefer our phone at hand in a pocket or more-easy-to-dip-in bag. If you do, it’s large enough for a Pro Max iPhone. Below that pocket are a couple of slots for credit or travel cards, and above it are five straps that will hold an AirPods case, cables and even an AirTag—after, all, at this price, even the sleeve on its own is definitely worth keeping tabs on at all times. I’d have preferred elasticated straps for a firmer hold but I can appreciate the all-leather design looks super lush. You can carry the Nomad Organiser under your arm, via a subtle built-in handle, or you can attach a matching strap to sling it over your shoulder like a messenger bag. It is a premium MacBook sleeve, handcrafted with full-grain Spanish leather, and really does shout cool luxury. Available in Tan, Dark Brown, Black and Navy. Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman – Quality, luxury leather MacBook sleeve Pros Good quality and unique Cons Gaps at the bottom make it less waterproof Expensive Price When Reviewed: $197 Best Prices Today: $197 at Manuel Dreesman Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch The Leather Sleeve from Manuel Dreesman isn’t cheap at $197/£153/€175, but you get luxury MacBook protection. It’s a slim leather sleeve that the MacBook slots into. I tried the 13-inch MacBook Air version, but there’s a sleeve for every current MacBook size, and the company says they can make a sleeve for any laptop. Manuel Dreesman is an independent atelier of handcrafted leather products, based in Barcelona, Spain. It ships all over the world. Sliding it in at first was a bit tight, but it got easier over time, leather being one of those materials that gets softer with use. The gaps at the bottom of the case, which probably make it easier to slide it in and out, stop it from being as waterproof or as protective as it might otherwise be. The sleeve comes in a range vegetable-tanned leather colors. We tested the tan version, but there’s also black, cream, red, green, blue, orange, light blue and light green on offer.  Leather is a good choice for a case like this, but it’s an expensive choice. Manuel Dreesmann claims that it sources the leather locally and that it is fine grain, which means it’s top quality. It makes the cases in its workshop in Barcelona using traditional techniques and ships all over the world.  Read our full Manuel Dreesmann Leather Case review Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve Pros Premium look and feel Accessory pockets Wool felt interior Cons No sealed pockets Price When Reviewed: $98 Best Prices Today: $84.13 at Amazon$98 at Harber London Fits: 11-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Similar to the Mujjo Envoy Laptop Sleeve, reviewed above, the Harber London Classic Leather MacBook Sleeve is made from premium full grain leather and features outside pockets to store your charger and cables. It looks classy and is available in tan or black. There are versions for all recent models of MacBook. It boasts a soft but protective dense 100% wool felt interior that will keep your MacBook cosy. However, there’s no magnetic closure or charging port like you’ll find on the Mujjo sleeve reviewed above. Woolnut Leather Sleeve for MacBook – Luxury leather sleeve Pros Premium look and feel In-sleeve charging Cons Lack of pockets Expensive Price When Reviewed: $119 Best Prices Today: $117.50 at Amazon$119 at Woolnut Fits: 12-inch, 13-inch, 14-inch, 15-inch, 16-inch Available in four deeply stylish colors (Black, Cognac, Green and Gray), the Woolnut Leather Sleeve snugly fits every recent MacBook from the 12-inch original, the Air and all the Pro models. Each size is tailor-made for every model. This minimalist sleeve might lack pockets but it is as luxe as you’ll find and will draw admiring looks and awed strokes from fellow MacBook owners. The exterior is made from full-grain Scandinavian leather, with the interior soft 100% natural wool felt from Germany.

Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe – Padded laptop bag Pros Premium backpack Plenty of pockets Decent 28L capacity Cons Premium price Price When Reviewed: $159 Best Prices Today: $159 at Amazon$159 at Timbuk2 Fits: 15-inch If you have an Apple laptop and intend to take it outside the house or office from time to time, it goes without saying that you will need a good sturdy bag to carry it in. We recommend getting a well padded backpack that is designed for carrying a laptop. A well designed backpack will include lots of areas insider the bag to store things in: such as a front pocket, a large main compartment and a large side pocket. Quilted shoulder straps and a padded back should ensure the backpack is comfortable to wear. It’s pricy, but the Timbuk2 Authority Laptop Backpack Deluxe is a good option. UAG Plyo Case – Extra robust laptop shell Pros Super robust shell Cons Particular about exact MacBook model Price When Reviewed: $79.95 Best Prices Today: $55.99 at Walmart Fits: 13-inch Some shell cases are built to do more than give your MacBook a bit of color. A number of manufacturers build hard shell cases that will add an extra layer of protection to your MacBook Pro or Air. UAG (Urban Armor Gear) makes impact resistant armour for your MacBook. The Plyo series has extra strength built into the cushioning corners and cooling vents to ensure that there is adequate airflow (to stop your laptop from overheating). Make sure you buy the exact shell for your model MacBook. Thule Gauntlet Attaché – Laptop briefcase Pros In-use hard-shell case Detachable shoulder strap Cons Black only Price When Reviewed: $74.95 Best Prices Today: $46.95 at Best Buy Fits: 13-inch If you are looking for a smart, tough-looking briefcase style bag with a solid construction, a good option is the Thule Gauntlet attaché. It’s a slim and rugged case with enhanced corner and edge protection. There is a single, removable shoulder strap as well as handles. You don’t even need to remove the Mac from the case to work.   Twelve South SuitCase for MacBook – Hard shell, carry-on fabric hybrid Pros Slim but in-use hard shell Handle Cons Lack of pockets Price When Reviewed: From $39.99 Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Twelve South$49.99 at Amazon Fits: 13-inch, 14-inch, 16-inch Laptop backpack and bags can be bulky, expecting you constantly to be travelling to airports or on trains, when sometimes you just need the convenience of a slim briefcase with the protection of a hard shell. SuitCase from Twelve South is an odd name for what is effectively a briefcase with a recessed handle, but it’s a great hybrid of sleeve, shell and carry on. There are three layers of protection: a water-resistant, quilted gray fabric exterior; underneath the twill textile is a layer of hard plastic to protect your MacBook from impacts; and inside is a soft layer of microfiber to protect the surface of your Mac. You don’t even have to remove your MacBook from the case to get working, and, when closed, dual zippers keep it securely closed, even when charging.",

    "description": "Macworld We’ve rounded up the best MagSafe, Qi2 and MagSafe-compatible magnetic chargers, from the plain pad to multi-functional stands (up to six devices charged), and even the most colorful—from snap-on chargers and modular stands to foldable power banks and full desk mats. Apple’s MagSafe technology, supported by all models of iPhone since the iPhone 12, presents a more efficient way of wirelessly charging compatible iPhones. MagSafe is the ring of magnets around the iPhone’s internal charging coil that senses compatible accessories and magnetically snaps securely into the most efficient charging position with the right accessories. With MagSafe, you’re less likely to wake up to find your phone wasn’t correctly placed on the wireless charger so didn’t charge at all! We have tested a lot of magnetic chargers—MagSafe, Qi2 and Compatible—and here inform you which one will work best for you. There are simple magnetic wireless chargers, multi-device chargers for iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods, travel chargers, car chargers and more. Best simple MagSafe chargers Best 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers Best 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers Best travel MagSafe chargers Best MagSafe charging stands with power banks Best MagSafe car charger Best wireless charging desk mat Best wireless charging sleeve Offering up to 25W power output in the right configuration, MagSafe charging is much faster than basic 7.5W magnetic wireless charging. A new Qi2 standard, supported by the iPhone 13/14/15/16 family (and unofficially the iPhone 12) offers similar 15W speed charging. PROMOTIONESR Qi2 3 in 1 Wireless Charging Station with CryoBoost Officially Qi2-certified 15W MagSafe iPhone charging gives you safer, faster, and more reliable charging, with CryoBoost technology to keep your phone cool and charging at maximum speed. Power all 3 of your essential Apple devices simultaneously; only compatible with iPhone 16/15/14/13/12 series, AirPods Pro/3/2, Apple Watch Ultra, Apple Watch Series 8/7/6/5/4/3/2/1, and Apple Watch SE 2/1 buy now MagSafe or Qi2 certification Apple certifies MagSafe accessories to ensures that the output charging is 15W for most iPhones, and up to 25W for iPhone 16 (with Apple’s new MagSafe charger only). Non-certified magnetic but “MagSafe-compatible” chargers are usually just 7.5W with a ring of magnets to hold your phone in place. Certified MagSafe chargers also have a single-wire NFC antenna that allows the iPhone to identify the device and a built-in magnetometer to prevent compass interference while you are using your iPhone while it’s charging. In our tests, 15W MagSafe and new Qi2 chargers are evenly matched for charging speeds. 7.5W MagSafe compatible chargers, as you might expect, take around twice as long—certainly in the early stages of charging. But don’t rule out 7.5W chargers as they are often high quality, nearly always noticeably cheaper and just take a while longer to fully charge an iPhone. The king of the hill is Apple’s new MagSafe charger which is definitely faster at 25W, but only with iPhone 16 or later. Foundry Simple vs multi-device magnetic chargers The most basic form of MagSafe or magnetic charger is the simple pad that latches on to the compatible iPhone. Some pads feature a pop-out arm so the iPhone can be propped up while charging. There are also products that can simultaneously charge an iPhone plus other Apple devices, such as an Apple Watch or wireless AirPods charging case. Note that the AirPods case must be of the wireless variety, and the original AirPods case lacked this functionality. The base of a multi-charger could also be used to charge a second iPhone but mostly not magnetically and at 5W rather than 7.5W, 15W, or 25W. Also see our round up of the Best Apple Watch chargers and stands. Best simple MagSafe chargers A simple MagSafe charging pad is the cheapest route to wireless iPhone charging. It’s still half as fast as using a standard Lightning or USB-C cable, however, and if you are going to the bother of connecting this product to a wall charger, why not just use a Lightning (iPhone 14 or earlier) or USB-C (iPhone 15 and up) cable? You can fast-charge an iPhone to 50% battery in under 30 minutes using a cable, while it takes around 50 minutes to wirelessly charge iPhone from 0 to 50% using even 15W MagSafe. That said, there are interesting options to choose from. After these we’ll look at more multi-functional MagSafe chargers. 1. Apple MagSafe Charger – Best simple MagSafe charger for fastest wireless Pros 15W for Qi2 and most iPhones 25W for iPhone 16 and up Cons Expensive, especially at 2m Price When Reviewed: $39 Best Prices Today: $29.99 at Amazon$29.99 at Walmart Electronics$36 at B\u0026H Output charging: 25W (MagSafe), 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1m (3.3ft), 2m (6.6ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White The most obvious MagSafe Charger to buy for your Apple iPhone is, of course, the Apple MagSafe Charger. It’s the charger that Apple would have shipped with the iPhone if it did such things anymore. It’s as minimalist a design as you’d expect from Apple–it looks a lot like a giant Apple Watch Charger. You can also use it to charge your AirPods. With the introduction of the iPhone 16, Apple started selling a new version of this charger that offers 15W Qi2 support and more importantly, a faster 25W charging speed with iPhone 16 (and later). It also added a 2-meter length option for $10/£10 more, which is very welcome. A 30W USB-C power adapter is required for 25W charging. The standard 1m cable is too short to comfortably charge and use your iPhone at the same time, or maybe stretch from a power socket to a nearby table, so we recommend the 2m upgrade. Don’t forget that this Apple charger still requires a USB-C power adapter—at least 20W if you want 15W charging and at least 30W to enable 25W charging. Twelve South An aesthetic partner is the Twelve South Forte Charging Stand pedestal, pictured above, that is a cradle for the Apple MagSafe Charger that can then hold the iPhone in portrait or landscape and tilts 70-degrees. Tilt the top back to create a flat platform for charging AirPods. It’s pricy for just a cradle but it effectively creates the only potential 25W wireless charging stand for the iPhone 16 and up. 2. Anker Qi2 MagGo Wireless Charger Pad – Best budget simple MagSafe charger Pros Fast 15W for iPhone 1.5m cable Inexpensive Price When Reviewed: $21.99 Best Prices Today: $21.99 at Anker$23.99 at Walmart Electronics$24.29 at Amazon Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black, White Another basic magnetic charger, Anker’s MagGo Wireless Charger Pad works just like the Apple pad, and also at a fast 15W—although it’s technology is Qi2 rather than Apple MagSafe. iPhone 16 owners should consider spending the extra on the Apple charger (reviewed above) for its special 25W charging speed. Owners of iPhone 15 or earlier can rest assured that this charger is as fast as the Apple one. It works just as well, though, and is one of the cheaper premium magnetic chargers. The cable is a decent length at 1.5m—half again as long as that on the base model Apple MagSafe Charger pad, but not as long as on the top-end 2m Apple charger or the 2m Belkin MagSafe charger reviewed below. 3. Belkin BoostCharge Pro Portable Wireless Charger Pad 15W – Best simple MagSafe charger with stand Pros Fast 15W for iPhone 2m cable Built-in stand Cons High list price Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: $29.87 at Amazon$42.27 at Walmart Electronics$49.99 at Belkin Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Cable: 2m (6.6ft) Wall charger: Optional Colors: Black, White Available in two predictable colors, the Belkin BoostCharge Pro Charger Pad is as fast as Apple’s Charger and comes with a longer cable and handy pop-up stand. The cable is twice as long as Apple’s, which makes using the phone much easier when charging. It’s also thicker nylon-braided cable with a handy integrated silicone cable tie. Its list price is higher than Apple’s, which is a surprise, so you’re paying a premium for the longer premium cable and the kickstand but we think it’s worth the extra if you must have a certified 15W MagSafe charger. Check our price comparison here for cheaper online prices. An alternative is the 15W Anker Qi2 MagGo pad, reviewed above, which has a 1.5m cable but no stand. Again, a straight cable connection will be faster but we like the kickstand, which you don’t get with a standard cable connection. You can buy with a 27W power adapter included or just on its own if you already have a wall charger to use. There are a few very similar Belkin Charger Pads so make sure you get what you’re after. For example, there is a slower but more affordable 7.5W MagSafe-compatible BoostCharge Charger Pad ($29 and sometimes cheaper from Amazon U.S. and Amazon U.K.) that lacks the stand. If you just want a cheap MagSafe-compatible charging pad, this is a decent option. Be warned: Belkin also sells a Qi Wireless Charging Pad that lacks the magnetic connection so is not recommended as it will be picky where the phone is placed and slower to charge as a result. 4. ESR HaloLock Kickstand Wireless Charger – Best budget magnetic charger with stand Pros Inexpensive Kickstand Color options Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $35.99 Best Prices Today: $19.99 at Amazon Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White, Black, Blue, Pink This is a small, simple magnetic charging pad that has a kickstand that lets you prop your attached iPhone 12/13/14/15 up either in landscape or portrait mode for video viewing or hands-free FaceTime calls. It’s a more affordable but slightly slower alternative to the Belkin pad reviewed above. The detachable cable length is reasonable at 1.5m and matches the four colors, so is wildly more flamboyant than the other magnetic wireless chargers tested here, except for… 5. Casetify Magnetic Wireless Charger – Widest choice of fun designs Pros Hundreds of options Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $40 Best Prices Today: $40 at Casetify Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Many cool and/or odd patterns We picked the English Breakfast pattern for its sheer wanton oddness but there are plenty of other patterns (Acid, Checks, Cherry Blossom) and pictures (Yeti, Harry Potter, Snoopy) to choose from. Indeed, there are a sometimes baffling 556 different wireless charger designs to choose from. Most are quite random but there are themes such as Street Art and Anime, plus characters such as Doreamon and SpongeBob, and individual artists, with the option to customize a plain charger with text. This 100% recyclable slim charger has eco sustainability points, too, as it’s made with recycled aluminum and printed with eco-friendly ink. 6.

It uses Qi2 so can charge wirelessly at 15W. While it’s more affordable, if you own AirPods too, you might consider the not-much-pricier 2-in-1 MagGo version, reviewed lower down. 7. Nomad Stand / Stand One – Sturdy but stylish 15W Qi2 and MagSafe charging stands Pros Fast 15W for iPhone 2m cable Robust stand Cons Non-adjustable charging pad Expensive for one-device charger Price When Reviewed: $100 Best Prices Today: $100 at Nomad Output charging: 15W (Qi2 Stand or MagSafe Stand One) Cable: 2m (6.6ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black or White; Stand One: Carbite or Silver The Nomad Stand uses the MagSafe-based Qi2 magnetic wireless charging technology, so offers the same fast 15W charging speed as MagSafe at a reduced price. Nomad also sells a MagSafe version, the Stand One, for $10 more but everything is otherwise the same except for the color options: the Stand comes in Black or White, while the Stand One is available in Carbite (which really is black) and Silver. The Nomad Stand and Stand One look like 2-in-1 chargers, with the area at the back of the stand begging to be a simple Qi charging pad for your AirPods, but it’s an iPhone-only charger. It’s a lovely looking stand that is the sturdiest wireless charging stand we’ve tested, with a real heft and an anti-slip rubber base. It is decidedly heavy (1.35lbs or 613g), so could be used as a paperweight if you have your desk fan turned up too high. It’s made of metal with a glass panel that gives it a glossy look from the front. The 21-degree viewing angle works well for comfortable viewing but if you want to customize the angle to your own liking you’ll need to choose one of the more adjustable 2-in-1 or 3-in-1 wireless chargers reviewed below. Nomad does make a 3-in-1 version, the $180 Stand One Max, which can charge iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods at the same time. This also looks great and charges the iPhone at a rapid 15W. It does have a flaw, unfortunately, in that it can’t charge the iPhone in landscape orientation (for Apple’s StandBy mode) when charging a Watch at the same time as the two charging pads are too close to each other. Otherwise, it’s a fine-looking, if again a little expensive, fast charger. Best 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers Why restrict your charger to just one device? You can buy MagSafe chargers that tackle up to six different devices at the same time. Here, we start with basic 2-in-1 MagSafe chargers that can wirelessly charge your iPhone and AirPods case (the case must be wireless-charging enabled). Most multi-device chargers are stands but there are also folding travel chargers that work equally well full-time on your desk or nightstand or on the road with you at your hotel or office space. Some 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 magnetic chargers are more portable than others so make sure to keep reading this feature for our list of Best travel MagSafe chargers, which may better suit your needs than these more static chargers. 1. Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand – Best 2-in-1 magnetic charger Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad Folds for travel Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: $79.99 at Satechi Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.2 m (4ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Aluminum gray With a remarkably small 3.5-inch square (9cm) footprint, this 2-in-1 charger uses the new Qi2 wireless charging technology to match MagSafe on 15W speed. The AirPod charging pad charges at 5W and could be used to charge a second phone, although much slower than using the raised magnetic pad. It even folds up flat to make it travel friendly, although you’ll need to supply your own USB-C wall charger. It’s pretty light at just 9.6oz (272g). 2. Ugreen 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Charger Stand – Best budget 2-in-1 magnetic charging stand Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad USB-C port for Watch cable Compact and folds for travel Price When Reviewed: $59.99 Best Prices Today: $49.99 at Amazon Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1 m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Aluminum gray While the Satechi 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand, reviewed above, can fold into a portable package, it is nowhere near as compact and lightweight (7.5oz or 212g) as Ugreen’s 2-in-1 magnetic wireless charger, which folds down into a tiny pocketable cube (2.4 x 2.4 x 1.5 inches or 6 x 6 x 4cm). Once open there’s a 5W Qi pad for AirPods and a 15W Qi2 pad for iPhone. A USB-C port on one side allows you to plug in your Apple Watch charging cable for 5W speedy charging, too—so you can almost call it a 3-in-1 except that you need a Watch charging cable to connect. The iPhone-charging pad can be raised to about 3 inches (8cm), and can be angled to your preference. Ugreen also sells a cheaper $39 MagSafe-compatible 2-in-1 Magnetic Charger that charges the phone at a slower 7.5W. 3.

Its iPhone charging module can be angled from 0 to 70 degrees. Folded flat it measures 4.6 x 2.2 x 0.9 inches (11.6 x 5.5 x 2.4cm). While this is an able, well-built and travel-friendly wireless charger, we prefer the company’s 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Charger Stand, reviewed above, as it features a spare USB-C port at its side for charging a third device. However, you may prefer its slimmer profile when folded for storage or travel. 4. Anker MagGo 2-in-1 Qi2 Wireless Charger Stand – Budget 2-in-1 magnetic charging stand Pros Charges iPhone and AirPods Fast 15W for iPhone Adjustable charging pad Price When Reviewed: $49.99 Best Prices Today: $43.99 at Amazon$49.99 at Anker Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black or White The Anker MagGo range has a version for just about everyone, and this is a 2-in-1 version of the simpler iPhone-only magnetic wireless charger stand reviewed earlier. It is not portable like the Satechi and Ugreen 2-in-1 chargers, also reviewed above, but it is a good-looking stand for your desk or nightstand. Built to charge both an iPhone 12/13/14/15/16 and wireless AirPod case charger, it is reaches the same 15W phone charging heights with its Qi2 technology. The AirPods are charged at 5W, which is standard for all such multi-device magnetic chargers. You get angled landscape (up to 45 degrees) and portrait modes with this good-looking stand from one of our favorite premium accessory makers. The magnetic link is super strong so you don’t need to worry about the iPhone falling off even during re-angling. If you’re not in a hurry, you can still find the Anker 7.5W PowerWave model a little cheaper but we like the faster charge on the 15W version. If you’re in a real hurry you’d be better off using a cable than using even a 15W or 25W certified MagSafe charger anyway. 5.

It’s a minimalist 2-in-1 charging stand that can wirelessly charge an iPhone at 15W and fast-charge an Apple Watch. The top pad can angle at up to 70 degrees. Steve Jobs and Jony Ive knew that tech should aspire to timeless design, and it’s no surprise that Apple has chosen to stock the Belkin BoostCharge Pro 2-in-1 Dock MagSafe charger in its stores. There are other magnetic wireless chargers reviewed here that can do more and at lower prices, but this is one we’d proudly place on our designer desk to show off rather than hide away. The dock’s organic looks are complemented by the two available neutral yet naturalistic colors: Charcoal and Sand.

Although it doesn’t include an Apple Watch charging module, there is a 5W USB-C port that you can connect your Watch-charging cable into and charge all three devices simultaneously. It might not be as pretty a 3-in-1 solution as its own MagSafe-certified Boost Charge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Pad, reviewed above, but as a 2-in-1 solution it is cheaper and better suited for those who haven’t succumbed to every Apple device available. Being certified as Qi2 means that it can wirelessly charge at the same 15W as official MagSafe chargers but not 25W like the Apple MagSafe Charger can for the iPhone 16 and later. Belkin Belkin also sells a MagSafe version (at the same 15W as the Qi2 model) in a richer range of colors, including orange, pink and purple, exclusively through the Apple Store (and U.K. Apple Store). Both versions are reassuringly heavy so you won’t pull it off your bedside table when you remove your iPhone from the magnetic pad. This makes it less obviously portable, but it’s small and flat enough to slip into a backpack. As it’s a pad you can’t angle the phone into StandBy mode. If you want to more easily see the time on your nightstand, consider one of the charging stands reviewed above. It ships with a 30W USB-C wall charger and cable. Best 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers If you have brought full-in on the Apple product ecosystem, and have iPhone, AirPods and an Apple Watch, there are some great 3-in-1 magnetic chargers that will wirelessly charge all three devices simultaneously. 3-in-1 charging stands save you precious desk space or keep your nightstand or bedside table clear of clutter, while ensuring that you don’t run out of power during the day. 1.

The stylish HiRise 3 Deluxe, as its name suggests, goes more vertical and so has a smaller footprint—handy for bedside tables and other places where a giant charging stand is less welcome. It is fully Apple certified, so can fast-charge any MagSafe iPhone (iPhone 12, 13, 14, 15 or 16 models but not SE) at 15W as well as fast-charge an Apple Watch (Series 7, 8, 9, SE and Ultra) at 5W and Apple AirPods (2nd and 3rd generation AirPods, and all AirPods Pro) at 7.5W. It’s 6 inches (15.4cm) high, 3.4in (8.5cm) wide and 6.3in (15.9cm) deep. In comparison, the Belkin 3-in-1 is 13.5cm wide. For an even smaller footprint, consider the OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station, reviewed below. The MagSafe iPhone charger can angle and tilt by 35-degrees, and hold the device in either landscape or portrait—so works well in iOS 17’s StandBy mode. The Watch charger is also tiltable and we like the way everything but the AirPods case is front-facing. The base charges at 7.5W and can be used to power up AirPods or a second iPhone, and the Watch part fast charges at 5W. Read our full Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe review 2.

It offers fast 15W iPhone wireless charging and 5W Apple Watch fast charging in a small-footprint design (3.7-inch square base) that tucks the Apple Watch charger at the back. The Watch charger is detachable, meaning you can remove it and take it with you to plug directly into any USB-C charging port. This is a useful option missing from most other 3-in-1 chargers. in our tests the Qi2-based ESR 3-in-1 charger was marginally faster than the MagSafe-based Twelve South 3-in-1, reviewed above,. This proves that you don’t need to buy and pay for MagSafe-certified chargers if the charger uses Qi2, which is based on MagSafe anyway. The ESR’s Qi2 pad is not adjustable, although you can position the iPhone in either landscape (StandBy) or portrait orientations. In this way it lacks the front-facing flexibility of the HiRise 3 Deluxe, but it is available at a significantly lower price. It comes with a decent-length cable and a 27W USB-C wall charger. Its closest rival in looks is the Journey Trio 3-in-1, reviewed below, which also features a detachable Watch charger. In terms of budget, it’s a close run race with the Anker Qi2 MagGo 3-in-1 Stand, which has a different design and a more powerful USB-C charger.

It has the same small 3.5-inch square (9cm) footprint, and Qi2 wireless charging technology to match MagSafe on 15W speed. The AirPod charging pad charges at 5W and could instead charge a second phone, although much slower than with the MagSafe pad. Apple Watch charging is fast, with the back-mounted pad providing 5W of power. It too folds up flat to make it travel friendly, and this time comes with a 45W USB-C chargers that is further boosted with U.K. and E.U. travel adapters. For a 3-in-1, it’s light at just 10.7oz (302g). The cuter and more compact Anker 3-in-1 Cube, reviewed below, weighs 14.3oz (405g). It’s not as affordable as the ESR so misses our budget recommendation, and we prefer the Watch charger to be front-mounted, which gives the Twelve South the overall crown but if you like the Watch at the back then we’d say go for this Satechi instead. However, with its foldability and travel plugs, this makes a great charging station choice for at base and on your travels—see lower down for more best MagSafe travel chargers. if you don’t mind the Watch at the back, this charger’s flexibility and fast speeds makes it an easy recommendation. 4.

It also matches that charging station in terms of charging speed and tilting charging pad. It’s fully certified for iPhone (so fast 15W) and Watch (fast 5W). The lower charging pad is rated at 5W and can be used to charge your AirPods or a second phone, although not magnetically and much slower than the main MagSafe pad. While this is an impressive 3-in-1 charger, we prefer the cheaper HiRise 3 Deluxe for its more flexible, front-mounted Watch charging module. However, if you don’t mid hanging the Watch at the back and prefer white over black, you should consider the Trio Ultra instead. The Trio Ultra also has a smaller footprint than the HiRise, and is a little taller, which some may prefer. It measures 6.7 inches high, 3.4in wide and 5.3in deep (16.9-x-8.6-x-13.4cm). Journey also offers a cheaper 7.5W version, the $119 Journey Trio 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station, below, which has the same measurements and tilting skills as the Trio Ultra but offers a slower iPhone charging pad (7.5W vs 15W). This model is available in either white or black. Journey The 7.5W version has some tricks up its sleeve, as its detachable USB-C Apple Watch charger means you can take it with you on your travels and simply plug it into a USB-C port—say on your MacBook—to charge your Apple Watch away from the charging stand. While it’s cheaper than the faster Trio Ultra, the more basic Trio doesn’t ship with a wall charger, so you’ll need to add your own. The 15W ESR Qi2 3-in-1, reviewed above, is similar in looks (with detachable charger) and is both cheaper and more powerful (15W vs 7.5W) than the basic Journey Trio 3-in-1. 5.

You could pay half again for a full MagSafe 3-in-1 charger that offers the same 15W iPhone power. It too offers fast 15W iPhone wireless charging and 5W Apple Watch fast charging but in a coat-stand design that is sturdy and with iPhone and Watch facing the front. This differs from the ESR charger, which places a detachable Watch charger at the back. We prefer the Watch at the front so we can still interact with it, but it does make the stand’s base larger (5.5 inch diameter vs ESR’s 3.7-inch square base). Neither the iPhone or Watch charging pad is tiltable. You can, however, position the iPhone in either landscape (StandBy) or portrait orientations. It comes with a 5-foot cable and a powerful 40W USB-C wall charger. 6.

The iPhone can be rotated in either portrait or landscape mode, but it can’t be angled up or down. This is where the Anker charger wins out in the battle of the affordable 3-in-1 MagSafe chargers. If you are buying in Australia (Alogic is an Australian company), you get a 20W charger, but elsewhere you’ll need to use your own wall charger. While this was once a great price point, the arrival of Qi2-based 15W 3-in-1 chargers has brought faster charging down to the same ball park of under $100. As such, the ESR Qi2 3-in-1 and Anker MagGo 3-in-1 represent better value than the Alogic MagSpeed 3-in-1 Wireless Charger—although you may prefer this design. 7.

Although on the heavy side, it’s super-compact and great for travel. The Watch charging part is hidden in the cube until you need it. It comes with a 30W USB-C wall charger with switchable UK and EU plug fittings that slide onto the US plug prongs. Its tiny footprint means it takes up little space on your desk or bedside cable, too. If you don’t own an Apple Watch, consider the equally dinky Ugreen 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand, reviewed in our 2-in-1 roundup above. The stand works in landscape and portrait orientations but isn’t high. It does have adjustable viewing angles up to 60°. A similar 3-in-1 charger from the same company is the A-frame Anker 737 MagGo, which can also simultaneously charge an iPhone (at 15W), AirPods and Watch. Aside from the shape, the only real difference from the Anker 3-in-1 Cube with MagSafe is that the slightly cheaper 737 doesn’t support fast-charging for the Apple Watch. 8.

In fact, it beats its nearest competition, the Belkin Boost Charge 3-in-1 Wireless Charing Pad, reviewed below, not just on price but on flexibility. Where the Belkin features an adjustable Watch charging module (for Nightstand mode) like the Anker, its iPhone charging pad only allows for a flat placement, while the Anker has a pad that can be raised and tilted 90-180 degrees—it could even be described as a stand/pad combo. It measures 9-x-3.4-x-0.5 inches (22.9-x-8.6-x-1.3cm) and weighs 12oz (340g). Read our full Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1 Pad) review 9.

This model is a flat pad that also includes the possibility to leave the Watch in Nightstand mode as a bedside or desk clock. We would have preferred if the phone charger could also be angled to prop up the phone for video viewing, like you can with the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Pad reviewed above. While minimalist in design, it does take up a fair section of desk–measuring about 23cm across and 8cm wide, and the iPhone sticks out at either side. It’s around the same size as the Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Pad. The pad format is better for travel portability than a charging stand, and it comes with its own wall power supply unit, so you don’t need to add your own USB-C charger. 10.

This is more stylish that other wireless charging stands, having a Sixties space-age design with chrome arms, and a silicone-covered plastic base. A stand is useful as it lifts the charging phone to a height that makes it easier to FaceTime or watch videos without having to hold the phone aloft. It can hold the phone in either portrait or landscape mode. In order to support the weight of the phone, the circular base has to be quite wide, at 13.5cm. For a smaller footprint 3-in-1 charger consider the Twelve South HiRise 3 Deluxe or OtterBox 3-in-1 Charging Station—both reviewed above.

The charging modules are fixed, which doesn’t give you any flexibility for adjusting the phone position aside from choosing whether to place it in either landscape or portrait orientation.

Fully Apple certified, it wirelessly charges an iPhone at 15W and can also fast-charge an Apple Watch. While it feels stable, we’d have preferred a less plasticky stand column.

It measures 5.6 inches high, and 4.6 inches both wide and deep (13.9-x-11.7-x-11.7cm). It’s a great multi-device charger but is beaten by the other two fast 3-in-1 products, which both feature more flexible, tiltable iPhone charging pads.

Zens 4-in-1 Modular Wireless Charger – Best 4-in-1 MagSafe charging stand Pros 4-in-1 (up to 6-in1) 15W for iPhone Modular Includes wall charger Cons Expensive Not Watch fast charge Price When Reviewed: $179.95 Best Prices Today: $179.99 at Zens Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: 65W AC power adapter Colors: Black The Zens 4-in-1 Modular Charging Station for iPhone with MagSafe, AirPods, Apple Watch and iPad is a MagSafe-certified charging stand that can handle not just four Apple devices but more if you buy extra charging modules to connect. Any MagSafe iPhone (12/13/14/15/16) can be wirelessly charged at up to 15W, faster than non-certified MagSafe-compatible chargers. AirPods and Apple Watch will each charge wirelessly at 5W. The iPhone can be placed in either portrait or landscape mode. At the back is a stand where you can place an iPad, which can be wired charged via a side-mounted USB-C port at up to 30W. All devices can be charged simultaneously as the power supply has a 65W total output. The Watch module that ships with the 4-in-1 charger can handily be situated on either the right- or left-hand side depending on your preference. Modules attach magnetically. The Apple Watch extension can be disconnected from the main station and charged via a USB-C port to become a standalone wireless charger when traveling. Up to three modules can be added, and different modules are available separately. Aside from extra Watch modules, the Single Wireless Charger Extension is a 10W wireless charging pad, and the Modular USB-hub Extension lets you recharge a USB-A powered device. Another Zens product that can charge four devices at the same time, the aluminum Zens 4-in-1 MagSafe + Watch Charging Station ($109.99) is also certified Made for MagSafe so can fast-charge an iPhone 12/13/14/15/16 at 15W. The base features a 5W Qi charging pad allows for charging wirelessly rechargeable AirPods or other Qi compatible device, but the Watch charger isn’t rated as fast-charge like some you’ll find on other products reviewed here. The fourth device is charged using a side-mounted USB-C port, so is wired rather than wireless like the parts for iPhone, Watch and AirPods. Rated at 18W charging, this USB-C connection can fast-charge another iPhone or charge an iPad. The supplied 45W wall charger comes with US, UK and EU adapter plugs so you can take the Zens 4-in-1 Charging Station on your travels. Best travel MagSafe chargers Many multi-device magnetic chargers take the form of elegant and frankly quite bulky stands that are designed to sit on a desk or bedside table/nightstand and stay there. Having a 3-in-1 MagSafe charger that can slip in a pocket, handbag or backpack would be even more useful when traveling between offices, homes or hotels. Thankfully, there are some truly great 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 travel-friendly portable MagSafe chargers, and we have tested the best of them here. 1. Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Folding Wireless Charging Station – Best 3-in-1 travel MagSafe charger Pros Charges Watch, iPhone AirPods 15W for iPhone Fast charge Watch Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $89.99 Best Prices Today: $89.99 at Amazon$89.99 at Anker$89.99 at Best Buy Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: 40W AC power adapter Colors: Black, White, Green, Pink Power specialist Anker is one of the first companies to release Qi2-compatible chargers, and the foldable Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station is a great example of what we can expect from the latest technology. It charges the iPhone (iPhone 13 and later) at 15W, and is also certified by Apple to fast-charge the Apple Watch, as well as Qi charge AirPods in a wireless charging case–all at the same time. Dominik Tomaszewski / Foundry It is super compact and folds up into a round pocketable shape that won’t take up much space in a bag or tidied away on your nightstand. It measures 2.36 x 2.36 x 1.4 inches (6 x 6 x 3.6cm) when folded and weighs just 3.8oz (108g). The 5W Watch-charging module folds on the top. The iPhone mostly lays flat, but it can be placed into a more useful StandBy mode as a stand with some folding wizardry. There are other 15W 3-in-1 foldable charger contenders—for example, the $109 Kuxiu X40Q 3-In-1, reviewed below. Anker has a squarer model, the identically named Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1), also reviewed below, which folds more easily into a traditional stand.

Twelve South ButterFly 2-in-1 MagSafe Charger – Best 2-in-1 travel MagSafe charger Pros Charges Watch and iPhone 15W for iPhone Can swap Watch for AirPods Fast charge Watch Portable Small footprint Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: $129.95 at Apple$129.99 at Twelve South Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: 30W AC power adapter Colors: Aluminum With a similar but smaller form the Twelve South ButterFly is an easily pocketable 2-in-1 charger that can handle iPhone and Apple Watch or iPhone and AirPods, charging two devices simultaneously. It is fully Apple certified, so fast wirelessly charges the iPhone at 15W and the Watch at 5W. You can’t get faster wireless charging—note that wired charging is much faster for iPhones. It’s a really clever, compact foldable size and offers MacBook-like styling. Unfurl the charger and the two wireless charging pads are revealed. You can fold 180 degrees and place the Watch in Nighstand mode. Flip it round, and you can set the iPhone in landscape StandBy mode. Yes, it’s expensive but it does come with a super-compact 30W USB-C wall charger that comes with interchangeable international plug heads: US, UK, EU and AU/NZ. Twelve South You can save some money but have a greater choice of colors with the company’s $99 ButterFly SE version, pictured above, which uses Qi2 instead of MagSafe but at the same 15W charging speed. In our experience it is a little more prone to scuffing but not scratches. It ships without a separate wall charger so you’ll have to use one you already own or buy one.

Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) – Compact travel MagSafe charger Pros 3-in-1 charging 15W for iPhone Fast charge Watch Compact Includes 40W charger Price When Reviewed: $109.99 Best Prices Today: $109.99 at Amazon$109.99 at Anker$109.99 at Best Buy Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: 40W AC power adapter Colors: Black, White We love Anker’s more circular folding Anker MagGo 3-in-1 Wireless Charging Station, reviewed above. The company also makes a squarer 3-in-1 15W Qi2 foldable charger with, as far as I can work out, exactly the same name and much the same charging features. It measures about the length and width of a credit card (3.5×2.36 inches; 8.9×6cm) and an inch (2.5cm) deep, weighing 6.9oz (195g). The 5W Watch-charging module is tucked away on the underside and can lie flat or sit up at an angle for Nightstand mode. The Qi2 pad raises to create a stand for your iPhone, in either portrait or landscape mode for StandBy mode. You can also charge an iPhone with the charger folded and the Qi2 pad on top. You need to unfold it only if you want to charge some AirPods or use the Qi2 pad as a stand. Read our full Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (Foldable 3-in-1) review 4. KUXIU X40Q 3-In-1 Foldable Magnetic Wireless Charger \u0026 Stand – Fast 3-in-1 travel MagSafe charger Pros 3-in-1 charging 15W for iPhone Foldable for travel Pad and stand function Super compact, lightweight design Price When Reviewed: $109 Best Prices Today: $87.99 at Amazon$109 at Kuxiu Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1 m (3.3ft) Wall charger: 30W AC power adapter Colors: Black, Gray, Titanium Gold, Wood Grain The Kuxiu X40Q 3-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger is a neat, portable way to charge all your Apple mobile devices—Watch, iPhone, AirPods—at the same time and fas fast as wireless charging can go. It’s special because it folds up into such a compact aluminum alloy package—measuring 2.7-x-2.7-x-1.2 inches (6.8-x-6.8-x-3cm). It weighs 7.4oz (210g). The Kuxiu X55 3-in-1 Foldable Magnetic Charger is a more affordable ($50 / £59) solution, but charges the iPhone at 7.5W rather than 15W. The X40Q also feels sturdier in action but as a budget option the X55 is worth considering for your travels. We also like the ESR HaloLock 3-in-1 Travel Wireless Charging Set, reviewed below, which is an inch longer and a little wider, but nearly half the depth. The Kuxiu 3-in-1 chargers beat the ESR because their Apple Watch chargers are integrated and not an attachable module. Again, it’s horses for courses—if you like the idea of having a detachable Watch charger that you can carry separately, then the ESR takes the crown. The Journey SWIV 3-in-1, reviewed below, is a little larger but noticeably lighter, and also can fast-charge the Apple Watch. It lies flat so doesn’t have the stand function. 5. Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Station Pros 3-in-1 charging Fast charge Watch Foldable for travel Super compact design Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $119.99 Best Prices Today: $119.99 at Journey Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Apple Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White This 3-in-1 iPhone/Watch/AirPods charger folds up extremely neatly into a compact and lightweight package that you wouldn’t really notice in a coat pocket. Of course, despite being wireless when charging your devices it still requires a wall charger (not included); it does comes with a USB-C cable. The MagSafe charger is compatible so only 7.5W but the Watch does offer 5W fast-charging for your wearable. The Watch module can lie flat or flip up for Nightstand mode—perfect for a bedside table. If you want a MagSafe travel charger with a stand, consider the Kuxiu X55, reviewed above. Read our full Journey SWIV 3-in-1 Foldable Wireless Charging Station review 6.

The Watch charging part is separate but plugs in once the stand is unfolded. When folded it can be used as a wireless charging pad. The iPhone can be set in either landscape or portrait orientation when the charger is doubling up as a stand. It’s lightweight and foldable, which makes it a great travel solution if you own iPhone, AirPods and Apple Watch. Both the Kuxiu X55 and the Evolved 3-in-1 Foldable Charger are a more compact package for Apple Watch and iPhone owners because their Watch-charging modules are built-in. The Journey SWIV is about the same weight as the ESR but without the detachable nature of the Watch charger. It also can fast-charge a Watch unlike the ESR or Evolved foldable chargers. It measures 4.5-x-2.6-x-0.63 inches (11.3-x-6.6-x-1.6cm). There’s a smart travel case included that fits in the 20W charger, cable, Watch attachment and folding charging stand. 7. Zens 2-in-1 MagSafe + Watch travel charger Pros 15W for iPhone Charges iPhone and Apple Watch Cons No Watch fast charge Best Prices Today: $99.99 at Zens Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Apple Watch fast charge: No Cable: 1m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White Coming in its own hard-shell travel case, the Zens 2-in-1 MagSafe and Watch travel charger is a portable delight for owners of iPhone (12/13/14/15/16 series) and Apple Watch. It is officially certified as Made for MagSafe, so charges at the full wireless 15W. Sadly the Watch doesn’t fast charge, too, but its arm folds out to create a kickstand for the iPhone in either portrait or landscape orientation. Best MagSafe charging stands with power banks Elsewhere we have reviewed the best magnetic battery packs that work with the iPhone 12/13/14/15/16, but if you want something more substantial we’ve tested the best MagSafe charging stands that include a portable power bank but can work as a standard charging station when you’re not out and about. 1. OneAdaptr OneGo – Best MagSafe charger with power bank Pros 3-in-1 charging 10000mAh power bank Cons 7.5W iPhone, 2W Watch Not Watch fast charge Price When Reviewed: $89 Best Prices Today: $89 at OneAdaptr Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 0.5 m (1.6ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: White or Black OneGo is a compact portable wireless charging station with a handy detachable, high-capacity (10000mAh) power bank that you can take with you on your travels. Folded it measure 6.1-x-3.1-x-1.5 inches (15.5-x-7.8-x-3.7cm). The Watch-charging module flips up from the back of the power bank. AirPods can be powered up at the back of the stand when the charger is unfolded. While it’s not the fastest wireless charger (7.5W iPhone and 2W Watch) you can connect a cable to the power bank’s 18W USB-C port for speedy charging. The OtterBox 2-in-1 Power Bank with MagSafe, reviewed below, offers faster wireless charging (15W and 5W) but is a much chunkier slab to carry around as the power bank is integrated rather than detachable. 2. Alogic Matrix Ultimate Fold 3-in-1 Stand with Power Bank Pros 3-in-1 fast charging stand 15W iPhone, 3W Watch Detachable 15W MagSafe power bank Foldable for travel Cons Low battery capacity Bulkier than slower rivals Price When Reviewed: $169.99 Best Prices Today: $169.99 at Alogic Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Watch fast charge: Yes Cable: 1.5 m (5ft) Wall charger: 36W AC power adapter Colors: White The Alogic Matrix Ultimate is multi-talented. It can charge an iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods wireless charging case at the same time, plus you can detach the iPhone charging pad and take it with you as a power bank. You can also detach the Apple Watch charger and slot that into any charging USB-C port, including that on the power bank. On top of all that, you can fold the whole thing up and pack it in its own carry case. Fully certified, it boasts 15W wireless iPhone charging, and can fast-charge a Watch at the same time. The power bank’s battery capacity is 5000mAh, which in our tests gave us nearly a three-quarter recharge. There are alternatives, such as the OneAdaptr OneGo, reviewed below, that feature a 10000mAh power bank with much higher recharge potential—but none are rated as fast at charging as the Matrix Ultimate. Read our full Alogic Matrix Ultimate Fold 3-in-1 Stand with Power Bank review Best MagSafe car charger In the old days cars had cigarette-lighter sockets, but today a power/charging port for your phone or other device is more common. A magnetic wireless charger in your car is the latest must-have gadget and we’ve tested a bunch to find the best on offer. 1. Belkin Boost Charge Pro Wireless Car Charger with MagSafe – Best MagSafe car charger Pros 15W for iPhone Dedicated car accessory Cons Not compatible with all car vents Price When Reviewed: $79.99 Best Prices Today: $79.99 at Belkin Output charging: 15W (MagSafe) Cable: Built-in Wall charger: 12V car charger included Colors: White Use your iPhone for satnav directions or to have easy access to your playlists in the car with this MagSafe-certified wireless charger and car vent mount, which works in both landscape and portrait modes. It has an integrated USB-C cable, and a 12V car charger adapter for cars that come with USB-A ports. The magnetic link is strong, which should mean that it can cope with any big bumps in the road. It works best with straight, horizontal vent slats up to 3mm in thickness and 20mm in depth. It does work with vertical slats, but there might be slight movements if the mount is overloaded with weight, says Belkin. As one of the the first dedicated MagSafe-certified 15W car mount available, it is expensive compared to some. If you can handle a lower charger rate, the Belkin BoostCharge Magnetic Wireless Car Charger 10W does pretty much the same job for a lot less. Or you can buy Spigen’s Mag Fit Phone Holder Car Mount and add Apple’s MagSafe Charger (reviewed above) for pretty much the same 15W result. That product is also available in black, like most car vents. 2. Pitaka Magez Car Mount Pro 2 – Excellent MagSafe car charger Pros 15W for iPhone Dedicated car accessory Excellent magnetic hold NFC shortcuts are helpful Cons USB charger not included Price When Reviewed: $69.99 Best Prices Today: $59.99 at Amazon$60 at Pitaka Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: Built-in Wall charger: Not included Colors: White The MagEZ Car Mount Pro 2 impresses across the board: fast charging, strong hold, and integrated NFC function. No competitor offers a comparable range of functions. What makes the MagEX Car Mount Pro 2 unique is its built-in NFC support and ability to work with iOS’s Shortcuts app. The NFC chips can trigger a short command when the iPhone is held over them. For example, when getting into the car, the NFC can trigger the iPhone to set the focus to “Do not disturb” and play your favorite music.  Pitaka also offers a version for Tesla Model 3 and Y cars.

ESR Qi2 Magnetic Wireless Car Charger (Halolock) – Best budget MagSafe car charger Pros 15W for iPhone Dedicated car accessory Inexpensive Cons Not compatible with all car vents Car charger not included Price When Reviewed: $35.99 Best Prices Today: $24.99 at Amazon$35.99 at ESR Output charging: 15W (Qi2) Cable: 1m (3.3ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black While still able to charge at a fast 15W Qi2 chargers are mostly cheaper than the Apple-certified MagSafe—but as Qi2 is based on MagSafe you have nothing to fear choosing this cheaper option. It comes with a 1m USB-C cable, with USB-A adapter if your car still has that older standard. You can clip it into the slats on your car’s air vent (ESR says it is compatible with 99% of all cars, which we can’t verify) or you can use the included 3M adhesive mount for a semipermanent attachment to your car’s dashboard—don’t use this on a nice leather or fabric (or curved) dash. Best wireless charging desk mat 1. Journey ALTI Wireless Charging Desk Mat Pros Stylish charging desk mat Reversible Cons 7.5W for iPhone Best Prices Today: $129.99 at Journey Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black, Light Gray This smart desk mat includes a detachable side strip that includes a magnetic wireless charging pad for phone and a non-magnetic section to charge your AirPods. Not only is the mat reversible, with smooth, wipeable vegan leather on one side and warmer-feel felt on the other, but you can pull back the mat to stow paper and notes to help reduce clutter. It’s quite a large mat, measuring 780 x 70 x 4mm. The Light gray color is actually more of a warm stone tone. The charging panel connects to the mat with a light magnetic snap, and can be positioned on either side simply by flipping the mat round 180 degrees, depending on whether you are left or right handed. As it’s MagSafe compatible rather than certified, it charges the iPhone at 7.5W rather than 15W, but will charge other compatible phones at the higher power. Earbuds can be charged at up to 5W. The magnetic fit is strong so you can’t knock it off its charging position with a stray flick of an arm. It comes with a USB-C cable but requires a charger; recommended 20W or higher. Best wireless charging laptop sleeve Protect your MacBook and charge your wireless devices at the same time. 1. Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging Pros Luxury MacBook sleeve MagSafe-compatible charging Cons 7.5W for iPhone Price When Reviewed: $129.99 Best Prices Today: $129.99 at Journey Output charging: 7.5W (Compatible) Cable: 1.5m (5ft) Wall charger: Not included Colors: Black, Light Gray The premium-quality, vegan leather Journey NEXA laptop sleeve bills itself as a “4-in-1”, and it certainly is multi-functional. As well as protecting your laptop during travel, it includes two wireless chargers (one MagSafe compatible at 7.5W; one 5W for AirPods or a second phone) and can work as both a desk mat and mousepad to free your workspace of clutter. While it comes with a USB-C cable, you’ll need to add your own charger (check our roundup of the best iPhone chargers) to connect with the USB-C port in the sleeve. Alternatively you can charge the MacBook itself while it sits protected in the sleeve—for this you’ll need a more powerful MacBook charger. Read our full Journey NEXA 4-in-1 Laptop Sleeve with Wireless Charging review Why wireless? Wireless charging is convenient and fine for situations when you don’t need a super-fast recharge. If you’re leaving your home in 20 minutes and need as much juice as possible, plug in the Lightning cable (or USB-C for iPhone 15 or later) as even a 12W USB charger can power up an iPhone a third faster than wireless, and 50% faster if you use a 20W USB-C PD charger. It is less wearing than constantly inserting a cable into your phone, and more reliable as that vulnerable cable port can fill with fluff and dust after all the time spent in your trouser pocket or bag and it’s one of the most common reasons that an iPhone refuses to charge even when connected with a cable. It’s easy to clean with a toothpick (but please do it softly!) but will affect most of us at some time. Wireless charging isn’t affected by the build-up of dust and fluff in the phone port and is also less vulnerable to oxidation and corrosion. With wireless, you don’t have to remember to run around trying to find who’s taken your charging cable, and it’s certainly a lot neater. Of course, wireless charging is not really wireless, unless you are using a portable MagSafe battery pack. The MagSafe charger is still connected by a cable to your wall charger; it’s just the connection to the phone that is properly wireless. What else you need Some MagSafe chargers come with their own wall charger, but most require you to add your own. Apple recommends at least a 20W USB-C power adapter (wall-socket charger) and we agree. Except for the 25W Apple Charger you won’t get over 15W charging power from a MagSafe charger to the iPhone, but 20W all but guarantees you’ll get as much power as you can. We have tested the best iPhone wall chargers to help you choose a recommended solution.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
