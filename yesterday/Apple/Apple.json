    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2644146/macos-16-release-beta-features-compatibility.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple‚Äôs Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is coming soon, and that‚Äôs when we will learn all about macOS 16, the next version of the Mac operating system (as well as iOS 19 the new iPhone OS and iPadOS 19). This version could include some big changes for the Mac, including a new look interface. Apple hasn‚Äôt made any formal announcements about macOS 16 so far, but rumors are starting to leak. This article keeps track of the reports, so you can get an idea of what to look forward to when macOS 16 is revealed in June and arrives on Mac later in the year. Update June 1: The next version of the Mac operating system may be called macOS Tahoe. macOS 16: Release date We‚Äôll get a first look at the next version of macOS at WWDC in June, but Apple‚Äôs official release of macOS 16 (possibly called macOS 26) will be in the fall, as is usually the case. The release of macOS 16 is likely to coincide with the release of iOS 19, which will probably happen a few days after the iPhone event in September 2025. We anticipate the September iPhone event will take place on September 9, so the software could be out around September 15 or 16. However, Apple has previously scheduled the update to macOS after iOS, sometimes as short as a week, sometimes as long as a month, so there could be a longer wait. Here is the recent shipping history for macOS. macOS 15 Sequoia: September 16, 2024 macOS 14 Sonoma: September 26, 2023 macOS 13 Ventura: October 24, 2022 macOS 12 Monterey: October 25, 2021 macOS 11 Big Sur: November 12, 2020 macOS 10.15 Catalina: October 7, 2019 macOS 10.14 Mojave: September 24, 2018 macOS 16: Developer and Public Betas However, you won‚Äôt have to wait until the full release to try the new software out. Apple will run a developer beta as well as a public beta, so if you want to try out the new features before they are released to the general public you will be able to do so. Both betas are free, though the developer beta requires a free registration as a developer. The first developer macOS Beta is usually shipped at the beginning of WWDC. In 2025 the WWDC keynote will take place on June 9. The public beta is released about a month later, usually after the developer beta moves to a second stage (beta 2). In 2024 the pubic beta arrived on July 15. Between WWDC and the official release in the fall, Apple will release beta updates to developers and the public. Anyone using the beta is encouraged to file bug reports using the included Apple‚Äôs Feedback Assistant app so that the company can address them. Learn more about participating in Apple‚Äôs beta software program so you can sign up and test the new software as soon as the beta arrives. macOS 16: What will macOS 16 be called? Unlike its other operating systems, Apple attaches a name to macOS. The current name is macOS Sequoia, but as it is version 15 of the software it‚Äôs also known as macOS 15. So, it follows that the next version of macOS will be macOS 16, except that there is a report from Mark Gurman of Bloomberg claiming that Apple will call the next version of its Mac operating system macOS 26. This will be in line with all its operating systems, so we can expect: iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26 and WatchOS 26. If this happens, it will certainly be less confusing for everyone! But macOS also has another name that isn‚Äôt tied to the number. Since OS X 10.9 in 2013, Apple has used names that are associated with California. Rumors of the new name will swirl before the official release. Some reportedly trademarked names that have circulated in recent years include California, Condor, Diablo, Farallon, Grizzly, Mammoth, Miramar, Pacific, Redwood, Redtail, Rincon, Skyline, and Shasta. These names have been registered by a company that is believed to be a shell for Apple. Internally at the company, macOS 16 is codenamed Cheer, but that won‚Äôt be its final name (see all the code names for macOS versions in our complete list of every macOS and Mac OS X release.) On June 1, Gurman¬†reported¬†that the name will be macOS Tahoe, after¬†Lake Tahoe¬†in northern California. Lake Tahoe is renowned for its deep blue water, which Gurman cites as an allusion to the¬†user interface overhaul¬†expected in the new macOS. Will Apple continue with the California-based names? Count on it.Apple Here is a list of the recent macOS names based on places in California: OS X Mavericks (version 10.9) OS X Yosemite (version 10.10) OS X El Capitan (version 10.11) macOS Sierra (version 10.12) macOS High Sierra (version 10.13) macOS Mojave (version 10.14) macOS Catalina (version 10.15) macOS Big Sur (version 11) macOS Monterey (version 12) macOS Ventura (version 13) macOS Sonoma (version 14) macOS Sequoia (version 15) macOS 16: Compatibility Because macOS 16 may feature major interface changes, Apple may decide to make this the first version of macOS that does not run on Intel-based Macs. The signs of this started appearing a couple of years ago and with Sequoia only supporting recent Intel Macs (see: Intel Macs that can run macOS Sequoia for more information). Apple wants to move any users of these Macs over to M-Series Macs and could use this version of macOS as a cutoff point. It‚Äôs unknown if the UI changes depend on hardware found only on M-series Macs. With that in mind, you can check the specifications of your Mac, then take a look at what we expect macOS 16 to be compatible with: MacBook Air (M1 or later) MacBook Pro (M1 or later) iMac (M1 or later) Mac mini (M1 or later) Mac Studio (M1 Max or later) Mac Pro (M2 Ultra or later) There is still a chance that macOS 16 will support a selection of Intel Macs. If it does the following Intel Macs are most likely to be covered: 2019 MacBook Pro 2020 iMac 2019 Mac Pro That means no Intel MacBook Air models and no Intel Mac mini models and only the most recent Intel models of the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. Learn more about which Macs are supported by Apple in our guide to how long Macs and MacBooks last and macOS compatibility: The latest version of macOS your Mac can run. This could be the year Apple decides to make future versions of macOS for M-series Macs only.Foundry macOS 16: New features Here are some of the new features expected in macOS 16. This list will be updated as more features are reported. Major UI change According to a report by Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman, macOS 16 (along with iOS 19 and iPadOS 19) will have a redesigned user interface that is based ‚Äúloosely‚Äù on visionOS, Apple‚Äôs operating system for its Vision Pro headset. Apple wants to make its operating systems more consistent across platforms, and visionOS will be the inspiration for it. Details on how Apple will implement this new design aren‚Äôt available yet, but Apple won‚Äôt simply just port over the visionOS UI to the Mac and be done with it. It will combine the best of both worlds and possibly allow Mac users to do more (and without a cursor). Because of the visionOS‚Äôs touch implementation, it‚Äôs easy to conclude that Apple is working on a touchscreen Mac. Hardware rumors are more prevalent than software ones, and touchscreen capability has not been mentioned about future MacBooks or Apple displays. Are round icons coming to macOS?Apple Apple Intelligence and Siri Apple Intelligence made its debut with macOS 15 Sequoia and Apple is on a continuous development path with these features. However, the Apple Intelligence features promised for Siri in iOS 18/macOS 15 have been delayed and aren‚Äôt expected until later in 2025, maybe 2026. Apple usually introduces Siri updates first on iOS, so this delay means that Siri updates in macOS have been pushed back even further. Will Apple reveal other Apple Intelligence inspired features? Or reliance on another tool to complement ChatGPT integration? Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman wrote in a late May 2025 report that Apple won‚Äôt deliver ‚Äúany AI breakthroughs‚Äù at WWDC. Home app upgrades A lot of what is planned for the iOS 19 update will make its way into macOS 16. While specifics about the Home app have not been reported, several reports of new smart home hardware have been made, so it would follow that Apple will update the Home app. However, the Home app is more often used on the iPad and iPhone, so Apple could release the Mac version of the Home app at a later date. Gaming app MacOS 16 will reportedly include a dedicated gaming app, according to a report from Mark Gurman of Bloomberg. The App will also be available for iPhone, iPad and Apple TV, it is claimed. The Mac app will tap into both the App Store‚Äôs games section and Apple Arcade, and ‚Äúgames downloaded outside of the App Store,‚Äù according to Gurman.¬†It will also offer editorial content about new games and centralize everything currently found in Game Center. Magnifier app and other accessibility features The accessibility feature that first appeared on the iPhone is said to be coming to the Mac in macOS 16, and it‚Äôs Apple that says so. In May 2025 Apple revealed some new Accessibility features coming to macOS later this year. Among them are a Magnifier app which will work with Continuity Camera (which lets you use your iPhone as a webcam). With the Magnifier app, a Mac can use their iPhone camera (or any other USB camera) to view their surroundings and zoom in. Apple also provided details of a new Accessibility Reader coming to Macs later in 2025. This system-wide feature will make text easier to read, by changing colour, font, and spacing. Other new accessibility features include: Braille Access, Background Sounds, and Personal Voice. Read about the accessibility features coming in the next major macOS in our guide.",

This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber‚Äôs The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. [‚Ä¶] Phil‚Äôs appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers ‚Äî remember, developer relations is all under Phil ‚Äî might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn‚Äôt have (they‚Äôre pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple‚Äôs enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt help but suspect that it won‚Äôt come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We‚Äôll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it‚Äôs easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that‚Äôs either not the case, or it doesn‚Äôt stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I‚Äôm not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple‚Äôs leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
