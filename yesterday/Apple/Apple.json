Beyond Siri integrations, HomePod, and few product category additions over the years, the company's investment in the area hasn't been as strong as some of its competitors.That could change as soon as March with the launch of a new smart display that isn't an iPad, doesn't have an App Store, and is voice-first.

In some cases, they've come up with their own \"solutions\" to the problem.Mac mini power buttonThe introduction of the M4 Mac mini was welcomed by critics, with the already small Mac made to be even smaller. Getting to that size meant there had to be a compromise, and that took the form of an awkward power button placement.Rather than at the rear, the button is instead underneath the corner of the Mac mini's enclosure. It's in a position that you have to lift or tilt the Mac mini to access it, which can be awkward for people with larger digits. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Apple just wrapped up its slate of 2024 devices, but it‚Äôs never too early to look ahead. And according to a new report, big things are on the way. As reported by Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman, Apple is looking to launch a new ‚Äúwall-mounted display that can control appliances, handle videoconferencing and use AI to navigate apps.‚Äù The device, which Gurman says could arrive as early as March, is ‚Äúa priority‚Äù for Tim Cook, who is pushing to get it to market after more than three years of development. Gurman describes the device as a square iPad with a 6-inch screen, ‚Äúabout the size of two iPhones side by side, with a thick edge around the display.‚Äù He says it has a camera at the top front, a rechargeable built-in battery, and internal speakers. It will reportedly be available in silver and black. Gurman doesn‚Äôt venture to guess what the device will be called. Of note, the new device won‚Äôt run iPadOS or tvOS. Instead, it has ‚Äúa touch interface that looks like a blend of the Apple Watch operating system and the iPhone‚Äôs recently launched StandBy mode.‚Äù It will also be powered by Siri, which is expected to be the preferred method of interaction, like the Echo Show or Nest Hub. The OS is reportedly built around Apple‚Äôs App Intents, the upcoming Apple Intelligence framework that ‚Äúprovides functionality to deeply integrate your app‚Äôs actions and content with system experiences across platforms, including Siri, Spotlight, widgets, controls and more.‚Äù Furthermore, the device will interact with Apple‚Äôs existing apps and services, including FaceTime, Safari, Apple Music, News+, Notes, Calendar, and Photos. Apple is also reportedly working on a higher-end version with a robotic arm that can spin 360 degrees and tilt up and down. Also this week, it was reported by Ming-Chi Kuo that Apple is working on a smart home camera that could be released in 2026. It‚Äôs likely that the iPad described by Gurman will function as a home hub for cameras and other smart home gadgets and will likely be the start of a push into that category. As it stands, HomePods and Apple TV can work as a home hub, but this new device would be part of a renewed effort to define the Apple smart home.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2518717/apple-quietly-added-inactivity-reboot-in-ios-18-1-to-safeguard-a-lost-or-stolen-iphone.html",
    "description": "Macworld According to security researchers, Apple has quietly added a new feature in iOS 18.1 that makes your iPhone harder to crack. 404 Media reported that iPhones stored by police in evidence were rebooting themselves, and it turns out it‚Äôs all due to a new Inactivity Reboot feature shipping in iOS 18.1. First reported by security researcher Jiska Classen, this new feature reboots your iPhone if it has gone unused for at least four days. This puts your iPhone into its ‚ÄúBefore First Unlock‚Äù state. This is the state your iPhone is in after being restarted, which requires you to enter your PIN or password before you can use Face ID or Touch ID. The devices used by law enforcement and bad actors alike to crack their way into locked iPhones have a much harder time penetrating the device when in this state. The ‚ÄúAfter First Unlock‚Äù state, in which Face ID or Touch ID is active, is easier to crack. This means that if your iPhone is either stolen or confiscated, it can‚Äôt simply be kept plugged in for weeks or months until it can be broken into. Or at least, that doing so will be much harder. While this may be frustrating for law enforcement storing iPhones in evidence, it also seriously raises the bar for thieves and criminals, which is the whole point. If you haven‚Äôt used your iPhone in four days, typing in your passcode is hardly a big inconvenience, but entering the state in which you have to do so is a big annoyance for anyone looking to break into your device.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast‚Äôs latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I‚Äôm pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I‚Äôve also rethought the old stacked ‚ÄúPodcasts‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlayed Podcasts‚Äù sections to better match people‚Äôs needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don‚Äôt follow and therefore won‚Äôt get any more episodes from, or haven‚Äôt posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen‚Äôs structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it‚Äôs more apparent that I‚Äôve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I‚Äôve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast‚Äôs most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That‚Äôs now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I‚Äôve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can‚Äôt even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
