    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/676435/how-to-update-airpods.html",
    "description": "Macworld Every now and then, Apple’s wireless earbuds get a new firmware update—that’s the software that controls all the hardware on the device. Sometimes this is just random bug fixes where Apple doesn’t even tell you what’s fixed. Other times, it enables new features when used in conjunction with Apple’s other products (iPhone, iPad, Macs, even Apple TV). Your AirPods should update their firmware automatically, without intervention, as long as they’re charging and within Bluetooth range of the iPhone, iPad, or Mac to which they’re connected. There’s no way to “force” an update the way you manually download iOS or Mac updates, but there are steps you can take to help trigger it. How to update AirPods on iPhone, iPad, or Mac Make sure that your AirPods are in Bluetooth range of your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Make sure that device is connected to Wi-Fi. Put your AirPods in their charging case and close the lid. Plug in the charging case (plug the USB cable into a power adapter and the charging case). Keep the lid of the charging case closed. Wait at least 30 minutes. Open the lid of the charging case to reconnect your AirPods to your iPhone, iPad, or Mac. Check the firmware version again. How to check the firmware version of your AirPods On iPhone or iPad: With your AirPods nearby and the case open, open Settings on your iPhone or iPad. You’ll see your AirPods listed at the top of Settings. Tap that, and scroll down to the bottom of your AirPods settings to see the Version. On Mac: Open System Settings. Select Bluetooth, then click the (i) next to your connected AirPods. The Version will be listed there, along with other information. Apple lists the latest firmware version for each model of AirPods on the AirPods Firmware support page. How to update AirPods on Android You can’t! AirPods firmware can only be updated with a connected Apple device.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2587085/5-small-but-still-kinda-big-ways-your-iphone-is-changing-with-ios-18-3.html",
    "description": "Macworld With iOS 18.3, Apple is sort of taking a breather before it continues its staged rollout of major Apple Intelligence features. That doesn’t mean there’s nothing there but bug fixes and security patches (though there are those, too). There are plenty of small changes that are coming to your iPhone—here are the five ways your iPhone will be different after you update to iOS 18.3. Apple Intelligence is on by default When Apple introduced Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, you had to choose to enable it. With iOS 18.3, it’s turned on by default. You still need an iPhone, iPad, or Mac that supports it, of course. If you want to disable Apple Intelligence, open Settings, choose Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri, and flip off the toggle. Foundry Notification Summaries are italicized The new Apple Intelligence feature that summarizes notifications has been met with mixed reviews. Sometimes it just gets things wrong, and when you can’t tell it’s an AI summary instead of a real text from Mom, that can lead to disaster. That little tiny “summary” icon on the notification isn’t enough. So in iOS 18.3, Apple is making it more obvious when a notification shows an AI summary. The text will be italicized, while normal notifications will have regular text. Foundry Notification Summaries are disabled for some apps Even if you recognize that the notification text is an AI summary, there are some that can be very problematic if they’re wrong. The Apple Intelligence notification summaries for some news events have been wrong at times, to the point where a person reading them would think the opposite of what happened. Of course, we all know it’s just a notification and just an AI-generated summary at that, and you should always go read the article before passing judgment, right? Just kidding! This is the internet, where you have to immediately post an opinion just from seeing a link to a headline somewhere. To help reduce the very obvious problems this can cause, Apple has disabled Notification Summaries from all apps in the “News \u0026 Entertainment” app category for now. The company plans to re-enable it in the future when the quality of the summaries is more reliable. The Calculator app gets its repeat operation function back Up until iOS 18, you could continually tap the equals sign (=) on the Calculator app and it would repeat the last operation. If you said 10 x 2 and tapped = you would get 20. Tap = again and you get 40. Tap = again and you get 80. And so on. With the new Calculator app and all its fancy features (not to mention an iPad version!) Apple seemingly forgot this popular capability. With iOS 18.3, it’s back! Foundry Visual Intelligence gets new powers If you have an iPhone 16 with a Camera Control button, you can press and hold it for a couple of seconds to launch a special camera interface Apple calls Visual Intelligence. Snap a pic of something and you get all sorts of contextual information. You can get business details, details, and books or albums, ask ChatGPT about the image, search Google for similar images, and more. With the iOS 18.3 update, you get an instant display at the top of the screen to identify animals and plants, without needing to take a pic. And if you show something with an event on it, you can quickly add it to your calendar. You’ll have to wait for iOS 18.4 for the new Siri I know what you’re thinking–all this AI stuff, but when does Siri get good? The answer is: in the next update! Or at least, Apple has said to expect the improved Siri, with personal context and lots of app intents, in the spring timeframe which is when we expect iOS 18.4. Will these new Siri capabilities change people’s perception of Apple’s AI assistant, or will it remain the subject of ridicule for another year? We’ll know more as the next round of betas get underway.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
