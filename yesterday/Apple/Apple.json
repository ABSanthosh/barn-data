    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Apple has been battling the European Commission over the Digital Markets Act since practically the day it was first passed in 2022. The sweeping regulations, most of which went into effect in 2023, have resulted in major changes for Apple, from the wholesale adoption of USB-C charging instead of Lightning to a separate version of iOS for the European Union that is more open and flexible. But the EU has been investigating Apple and other so-called “gatekeepers” over the past year to see if their changes are enough to be in compliance with the law. When Apple comments, it typically says the regulations are misguided or that it believes it is in compliance already, and agrees to “work with regulators.” Now, the European Commission has issued its first major fines under the Digital Markets Act, slapping Apple with a €500M fine (that’s about $570M in U.S. dollars). Meta was also fined €200M. The version of iOS users get on their iPhones in the EU is, some would say, superior to that which we have in the rest of the world. It allows alternate app stores and app side-loading (with restrictions), more user control over default apps, more open payment systems, and other changes. As recently as March, the EU pointed out several ways in which Apple was still out of compliance with the regulations, with specific steps needed to address in order to avoid a fine. Apple has said it will challenge the fine. In a statement emailed to Reuters, the company said: Today’s announcements are yet another example of the European Commission unfairly targeting Apple in a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free. Apple About a year ago, Apple was fined €1.8M (about $2B then) over its past practices that were determined to favor Apple Music over Spotify and other rival streaming services—that was the result of a five-year investigation that predated the Digital Markets Act. The Commission has informed Apple that its contract terms concerning alternative app distribution breach the DMA. Apple has an extensive list of requirements necessary to allow apps to be directly downloaded or for alternate app stores and charges a “Core Technology Fee” for those who choose to distribute and monetize their apps outside its ecosystem. In a press release announcing the fines, the European Commission said: Under the DMA, app developers distributing their apps via Apple’s App Store should be able to inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases. The Commission found that Apple fails to comply with this obligation. …. As part of today’s decision, the Commission has ordered Apple to remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering and to refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future, which includes adopting conduct with an equivalent object or effect. European Commission Apple and Meta have 60 days to comply with the directives or face the potential for additional periodic fines. The European Commission also ended its investigation into Apple’s “choice obligations,” following what it calls a “constructive dialogue with Apple.” This concerns making sure that users in the EU can easily uninstall any software applications, change default settings, and choose their default web browser on iOS. The Commission says that Apple’s changes in these areas are in compliance with the DMA.",

MacPaw CleanMyMac – The most comprehensive Mac cleaner Pros Improved interface and ease of use Wide range of cleaning tools Subscription or one-time purchase Cons Limited malware features Some technical knowledge still needed Price When Reviewed: $39.95/a year for 1 Mac, $119.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price MacPaw (first year, 1 device) $39.95 View Deal MacPaw (one time purchase) $117.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Few cleanup apps are as comprehensive as CleanMyMac from MacPaw, which has been updated to version 5.0 (and dropped the X from its name). Version 5.0 sports a redesigned interface that simplifies things by displaying the results of its scans as a series of tiles that give you a quick summary of each scan.  CleanMyMac’s tools fall into five main categories that focus on different tasks: Cleanup, Protection, Performance, Applications and My Clutter. A new Smart Care feature gives your Mac a quick check-up and summarises the result of its scans for all five categories. The Cleanup tools focus on deleting junk. The Protection tools can scan for malware, detecting and quarantining threats. CleanMyMac isn’t a dedicated antivirus program like those featured in our Best Antivirus for Mac round-up, but it’s a nice addition. The Performance tools help with routine maintenance, such as clearing out DNS cache, or re-indexing Spotlight and Mail to speed up search results. The Applications tools help you delete unwanted applications and left over installation files.  My Clutter can scan either individual folders or your entire Mac drive to locate old files. Version 5 adds the ability to identify duplicate files, or photos that look very similar, so that you can delete them. There are also some new diagnostic tools, including the ability to identify apps that are using a lot of battery power. You can buy CleanMyMac from MacPaw’s own website, or from the Mac App Store, although the version sold on the Mac App Store omits a few features. You can choose from an annual subscription, or you can buy it for a one-time fee. It’s not the cheapest cleanup app, but it provides dozens of different tools for deleting old files and data.  There’s a free version available to download and a free trial version available on MacPaw’s website, but it restricts the app to only remove files up to a maximum of 500MB – and in the middle of deleting files it will demand you pay the license fee for the app. You can download that limited version and scan your Mac to see just now much space you can save before committing to buying the app. MacPaw is currently running a 30% discount for students – submit your university email address and receive a download code here.  You can get CleanMyMac here.

Parallels Toolbox – Everything you could need in one app Pros Full suite of Mac tools including excellent cleaners Fully featured free trial Cons May be more than you require Price When Reviewed: $24.99 per year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Parallels Toolbox Free 14-day Trial Free View Deal Parallels (1 year, 1 Mac) $24.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Parallels Toolbox offers more than 50 tools and among them are some real gems like the Clipboard History and video download tools, but in this round up of Mac Cleaners, we are most interested in the tools to free memory and the drive cleaner, among other utilities. Mac cleaning tools provided in Parallels Toolbox include Clean Drive, Uninstall Apps, Find Duplicates, and Free Memory. The Clean Drive tool can locate unnecessary files that are taking up space on your Mac, and also find duplicate files that you may no longer need. It offers easy notifications and access as to what’s eating drive space (i.e., log files, cache files, trash, browser data, mail cache, mobile apps, iTunes temp files, iOS device backups, and old updates) and offers a nice level of control as to clearing them out. Clean Drive also offers quick access to the macOS Storage pane, which tends to be overlooked, and allows you to adjust your storage preferences on the fly. The Free Memory tool notifies you as to where your Mac’s RAM/Unified Memory is going, which applications are using the majority of it, and allows you to mark the amount of free memory in macOS’ Menu Bar. The Uninstall tool can fully uninstall Mac apps, along with any related files that may be scattered around your Mac’s drive. You can go through a list of installed applications on your Mac, pick and choose what to remove, and reliably strip out both the app and its support files. It can also highlight large files that are taking up a lot of space, such as games that you may not need anymore. You can also run Find Duplicates to dig out any identical files – even ones that have different file names. Parallel’s Toolbox is included free of charge along with Parallels Desktop but you can also purchase it as a standalone product for both Mac and Windows, with an annual subscription fee. There’s also a free 7-day trial that will actually delete files, free memory and do all those other useful things without you buying the app! You can get Parallels Toolbox here.

Cleaner One Pro for Mac – A good cleaner at a good price Pros Quick, stable performance Excellent Dropbox Scanner utility Good value Cons The Menu Bar is a bit awkward Some UI elements could be tightened and improved Price When Reviewed: $19.99 a year for 1 device (usually $24.99) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Trend Micro (1 year, 1 Mac) $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Cleaner One Pro for Mac is easy to download and install. The software requires is available in both free and paid subscription-based tiers. For the free tier, the software offers basic scanning and no user limits while requiring no credit or debit card to be stored with Trend Micro. The Basic tier, requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, offers support for one device, access to additional tools, and easy uninstallation if desired. The Advanced tier requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, and offers support for five devices, macOS and Windows support, quick uninstallation, and access to additional tools.  Cleaner One Pro is designed around an assortment of modules including Smart Scan, which looks over your storage, diagnostics, and applications, Junk Files, Big Files, Disk Map, Startup Manager, Duplicate Files, Similar Photos, App Manager, and File Shredder. The modules performed well during testing, and were able to locate large files and duplicates to be disposed of. The Smart Scan, as expected, goes through a general overview of storage, diagnostics, and applications to suss out garbage files and make recommendations as to what tools to use. The Junk Files module found a variety of unused disk images and installers. The Disk Map module worked as expected, offering a nice layout and concise display of what’s eating up your Mac’s hard drive. The Startup Manager offered an excellent peek under your Mac’s hood, especially in terms of launch agents, the module allowing you to activate or deactivate individual components File Shredder allows you to drop in files and folders to be securely deleting. The Dropbox Scanner tool, which hooked into my Dropbox account, compared files and file sizes, and offered a quick means of cleaning up larger files, which helped clear dozens of gigabytes of space and proved to be pretty unique as a feature. Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and offers an elegant and easy to navigate user interface that lets you prune your Mac down effectively. This useful set of Mac cleaning tools comes at a good price, and if you’re looking for something reliable in this field, it’s worth your consideration. There’s also an iOS version on the iOS App Store.  Read our full Cleaner One Pro for Mac review 4. MacCleaner Pro – Impressive tools at a good price Pros Impressive set of tools Good tutorials Good configuration Cons Occasionally awkward user interface Price When Reviewed: $29.95/a year for 1 Mac, or $74.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Nektony (1 year, 1 Mac) $29.95 View Deal Nektony (one time purchase, 1 Mac) $74.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket MacCleaner Pro from Nektony is divided into a core app and several module apps, namely App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller, Disk Space Analyzer, Duplicate File Finder, Memory Cleaner, and Funter. The core app can perform an overall disk cleaning and help free up storage space by eliminating extraneous files.  The App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller module works well, and allows you to see the app you’re removing as well as its support files. This module has been improved compared to version 3, and now offers you easier access to startup programs and extension files, allowing you to enable, disable, or remove them. A Remaining Files feature allows you to chase down loose files, while an Open With feature lets you assign applications to open certain file types. With Duplicate File Finder it’s easy to specify file types to look for, such as audio and photo files, with an impressive level of precise control. Memory Cleaner module offers an easy interface to show which applications and processes are consuming the most RAM. Funter module finds hidden files within your operating system.  The Fast Cleanup option was able to clear up 11.4GB of drive space, most of these being application cache files, while the Deep Cleanup feature helped reclaim 65.4GB of drive space.  We did have some peculiar instances in which a reminder poped up advising us to clear disk space for a macOS Sonoma (which was already installed). On another occasion when we paused scanning after half an hour we saw a request for full access to the hard drive.  MacCleaner Pro is easy to install, runs well and has a good feature base. You can buy it on an annual or monthly subscription or as a one-time purchase. The free trial version is fully functioning for two days and will actually perform some of the tasks you need to do, rather than ask you to buy the full version. Read our full Nektony MacCleaner Pro review 5. Avast Cleanup Premium – Generous trial Pros Reasonable price Speedy performance 60-day trial Good level of customization for each module Cons Cleanup functions can be somewhat destructive Price When Reviewed: $29.88 a year for 1 Mac (usually $65.99) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Avast (first year, 1 device) $29.88 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Avast Cleanup Premium for Mac provides a range of utilities to clean your Mac and remove unwanted files. Some modules go beyond expectations. However, care and customisation is needed to avoid accidentally deleting important files. Avast Cleanup Premium for Mac is divided into modules: Quick Clean, Clean Clutter, Clean Browser, Find Duplicates, Analyse Photos, Uninstall Apps, Startup Manager, System Monitor, and Statistics. The Quick Clean module is the most generic and helps reclaim hard drive space by cleaning app cache, log files, trash, cookies, and web cache files. The Find Duplicates feature finds and organises duplicates on your system, giving you control over the process. The Analyse Photos module scans local and external photo libraries and volumes, identifying rough copies of old photos and offering to delete them. The Uninstall Apps, Startup Manager, System Monitor, and Statistics modules are unexpected gems. The Startup Manager module easily located 51 startup items that could be toggled on or off. The System Monitor offered a good user interface and layout, monitoring system sensors like fan speed, power usage, and battery condition. However, Avast Cleanup Premium for Mac has some issues. Setting up took an extra day due to a server-side error. The software automatically opts into third-party product offers unless you disable this option in the Privacy tab, which is annoying. But more concerning, is how powerful and broad the modules are: using the generic cleanup function without specifying what you want to clean up can be risky, especially when the browser cleaner removes generic cookies and autofill items, which can be useful later. Be cautious when using these tools, as they can accidentally remove files you might need. Avast’s utilities are effective and stand on their own. There’s something worth trying here. The software, especially with its 60-day free trial, is worth considering. A free version with a scan function is also available. Read our full Avast Cleanup Premium for Mac review 6. CCleaner Pro Pros Fast and effective Good price Dug out malware others missed Cons No quick access to tutorials Duplicate Finder interface isn’t straightforward Price When Reviewed: Free; Pro version: $39.95 a year Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Piriform Software (annually) $39.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Piriform Software’s CCleaner offers some useful tools in a friendly, appealing package. It retails for $39.95/£39.95 for CCleaner Pro, which covers one device for one year. There’s also a free version: CCleaner. CCleaner centers itself around several modules, which consist of Quick Clean, Clean Clutter, Clean Browser, Find Duplicates, Analyze Photos, Uninstall Apps, Manage Startups, System Monitor, and Statistics. Uninstall Apps tool worked well and the Manage Startups tool dug up a chunk of files and and offered an easy way to remove them. The Clean Browser tool was able to locate and remove 2.01GB of cache files and cookies and Find Duplicates found 106.45GB of duplicate files. The Quick Clean tool was able to locate app cache files, log files, trash, cookies, web cache, and duplicate files offered to clear 6.5GB of cache files. System Monitor offered system specs, access to sensors, and information such as fan usage, disk usage, battery cycles and temperature. The scheduling tool worked well, CCleaner offering a good level of customization. There’s a good set of tutorial videos for CCleaner’s various versions, but you have to go looking for them. Piriform should offer quick links to these tutorial videos they’ve already produced and published. There’s an excellent collection of tools to be found in CCleaner. The interface is clean, it runs well, and it doesn’t make the mistake of trying to perform every task under the sun. Read our full CCleaner Pro review 7. Onyx Pros Excellent utility Good customization Reliable bug fixes and updates Cons Scheduling feature needs refinement Intimidating Price When Reviewed: Free Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Titanium Software (Donationware) Free View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Onyx, which presently stands at version 4.7.1, is one of the best utilities on the market, and it’s free! OnyX is Donationware, with users asked to send along whatever they believe the program is worth. It provides easy access to the powerful underlying tools within the macOS operating system. You can run powerful sets of customizable scripts to perform functions such as checking volume structures, getting low-level system specifications, repairing permissions, cleaning up system databases, and sorting out under-the-hood level system details.  it’s easy to access complex system functions such as security, login options, Display Calibrator, Keychain Access and so on.,  Our only criticism would be that the Scheduling feature is a bit vague and seems to only function around specific days, hours, and minutes. And a set of tutorial videos would be useful. Users have complained that support is slow in getting back to them – but this is donationware, so, to be fair, it’s understandable.  Read our full Onyx review 8. Daisy Disk – Nice one off price Pros Quickly scans storage and finds large files Graphical representation File name previews Can check cloud storage Cons Some user-interface quirks Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Software Ambience (One time purchase) $9.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket DaisyDisk incorporates a clean, fun, interesting user interface via which it sets out to help you visualize the data on your Mac and its local, network, and cloud-based volumes, map it out, see which files are taking up the most space, and help you free up gigabytes of drive space. DaisyDisk supports a number of file formats and file systems, as well as network volumes, virtual elements and disk images, and can mount and scan just about anything as long as the volume itself is operational.  It can also mount cloud-based services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Box so you can find ancient files to be deleted. I was able to clear up dozens of gigabytes of space in the process. See our round-up of the best cloud backups for Mac. We did have some difficulties with Google Drive, which refused to allow DaisyDisk access, stating that the app was blocked and “tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access.” This appears to be a conflict between DaisyDisk’s developers and Google and hopefully it will be sorted out soon. DaisyDisk users are also currently unable to add and sort through Apple’s iCloud Drive accounts given Apple’s sandboxing of the environment. You can scan a local copy of your iCloud Drive contents using the “Scan Folder…” button but not the web-based data, which is frustrating. In addition to being able to scan entire volumes at once, you can click the “Select Folder…” button and navigate to a custom folder.  With DaisyDisk it’s entirely up to your own discretion as to which files and folders to delete, with nothing more than a five-second countdown clock and time period in which to cancel the decision. Apple’s Disk Utility app can be accessed from the Menu bar to perform disk repairs on the fly.  Unlike so many apps you don’t have to sign up for a subscription package: the app retails for a one off fee of $9.99/£9.99, which is excellent value.  Read our full Daisy Disk review 9. MacPaw Gemini Pros Capable of finding multiple duplicate types Excellent search customization Handy preferences and options Cons Lack of additional filters makes sorting located duplicates tedious Needs a scheduling feature Price When Reviewed: From $19.95 for 1 Mac, annually Best Prices Today: Retailer Price MacPaw (1 year, 1 Mac) $19.95 View Deal MacPaw (one time purchase, 1 Mac) $44.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Though not strictly a Mac cleaner, like other apps in this round-up, MacPaw’s Gemini 2 can certainly help you get back some disc space. It is a duplicate removal tool that focuses specifically on reducing the thousands of duplicate photos in your Photos library. It also hunts down duplicate files within Apple Music and across the macOS operating system. The app is available through Apple’s App Store and MacPaw’s SetApp application, which grants access to Gemini and other apps for $9.99 (£7.60) a month. It is easy to install and offers a seven-day free trial in exchange for either your credit or debit card information. The app includes scripts for easy scanning of the Photos library and your Music library, as well as custom folders and external volumes that can be chosen from a menu or dragged, dropped, and quickly scanned. Other features include Menu Bar elements, whitelists that can be created that are exempt from being scanned, and a Duplicate Monitor feature that helps compare files and heads off duplicates before they begin to pile up. In testing, Gemini 2 quickly sought out duplicates, offered the option to remove them, and eradicated them from our hard drive. This also applies to music files and other document types, and the Duplicate Monitor warns you about possible duplicates that have been carried over to your hard drive. However, there are some caveats, such as confusion about account registration and permissions after downloading and installing Gemini 2 from the App Store. MacPaw is urging its clients towards SetApp subscriptions, which offer full access to the company’s apps for a given rate per month. While Gemini 2 runs well, a scheduling feature for folder or volume scans would not go amiss. An improved filter for locating duplicate items would be more helpful. Despite some minor hurdles, Gemini 2 is well-written, sharp, helpful, fast, works well with all kinds of duplicates, and lends a good feature set to the macOS operating system without being overbearing. It hones in on its tasks and performs them well enough to earn the trust of users. Read our full MacPaw Gemini review 10. Intego Washing Machine Pros Reclaim drive space and remove duplicate files Good customization, filters, and settings Cons Annoying pop-ups Installation difficult Price When Reviewed: $19.99 for one Mac for first year (usually $49.99) Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Intego (1 year, 1 Mac, 60% off) $19.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Intego’s Washing Machine X9 is a handy cleaning utility for the Mac that focuses on reclaiming disk space via the Reclaim tool, removing duplicate files on your Mac’s hard drive with the Duplicates tool, and organizing folders using the Organize tool. As is standard, the software (compatible with macOS 13 High Sierra or later) requires that you grant it full access to your hard drive though your Mac’s Privacy and Security settings. Less standard was that we had to locate the Intego Washing Machine X9 app in the Applications folder and drag it into Full Disk Access in Privacy and Security settings to get it to function. It is more common that an installer will add an easy icon that can be dragged into the macOS Full Disk Access pane to complete the installation. There’s a good level of customization. Like similar applications, the Reclaim tool can chase after caches, downloads, language files, logs, and trash files to help clean up disk space. The initial run cleared approximately 24GB of drive space from my M2 MacBook Pro’s SSD. The Duplicates tool took about five hours to create an initial index for my 1TB SSD. It offered control over duplicates that can be selected and specific options and naming filters. The Organize feature can help organize messy folders into a Snapshot folder for reorganization later. This tool can work with specific folders such as the ever-messy Desktop folder, your Home folder, and macOS’ Smart Folders, and help pull things into order. This Organize feature does feel like slapping a band-aid on the larger problem of a folder’s disorganization though.The Scheduling option only allows for a specific week or month to be chosen, and it would have been nice to be able to schedule a process for a few minutes from now, as is common with similar software. While it’s nice to be able to reclaim a few dozen gigabytes of drive space and have control over the duplicate files on your Mac, Washing Machine offers nothing groundbreaking. With the current discounts and its attractive user interface it’s worth a look though. Alternatively, Intego’s Washing Machine X9 is bundled with Intego’s larger security suite so you could take advantage of that and get a Mac Cleaner with Intego’s Antivirus solution. The Mac Premium Bundle includes VirusBarrier, NetBarrier, Content Barrier, and Personal Backup solutions. Read our full Intego Washing Machine X9 review 11. Nektony App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller Pros Friendly interface, good performance Cheap option Cons Mediocre update utility Problems with Remaining Files module  Price When Reviewed: $14.95 a year for 1 Mac Best Prices Today: Retailer Price Nektony (1 year, 1 Mac) $14.95 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller simplifies the process of removing unwanted applications, startup programs, extensions, remaining files, and updates. The Applications module indexes all applications and allows users to easily find and remove even the remnants of software. The Startup Programs module provides a convenient list of startup applications, categorised into All Programs, Active, and Disabled, and lets users select which to remove. The Extensions module categorises Mac extensions into Installation Files, Web Browser Extensions, Screen Savers, Settings Panes, Internet Plugins, and Widgets, making it easy to locate and remove specific extensions. Unfortunately, App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller’s Remaining Files and Updater elements are problematic. The Remaining Files module, though useful, offers a generalised ‘Remove’ feature that can remove critical system elements like the App Store, affecting your Mac’s functionality. During testing, it targeted Adobe Creative Cloud applications and files, removing file systems and requiring reinstallation of several Adobe applications. While a generalised cleanup is possible, the Remaining Files module should be used carefully to avoid removing critical elements. The Updates feature missed major updates like ff-Works, Slack, and Microsoft Office.  Read our full Nektony App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller review You may also like to consider:Disk Doctor, $2.99/£2.99 a year.Tuneup for Mac, $65.99/£54.99 a year.

How we test Mac Cleaning software We tested the Mac cleaning software for this article by scanning our test system for junk files, caches, temporary files and more that could be removed. We then evaluated success depending not only on the amount of space freed up, but also whether there were issues related to data loss or performance slowdowns.

    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
