    "description": "The supply chain leaks about Apple's foldable iPhone have been increasing in frequency, and it may be only about a year away. Here's what the rumor mill believes is in the works.Apple's foldable iPhone could debut in 2026.While 2025 could see the release of an ultra-thin iPhone 17 Air or iPhone 17 Slim, the year after may prove to be even more interesting. Multiple sources and reports over the years have said that Apple was working on products with foldable displays, the first of which is expected to be an entirely new iPhone model.Though other smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung, have outright embraced the concept of foldable displays, with the Galaxy Fold and Galaxy Z Flip, Apple has yet to release such a device.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2777378/bluetooth-6-1-is-here-before-bluetooth-6-devices-hit-the-shelves.html",
    "description": "Macworld We don’t have iPhones with Bluetooth 6 yet—in fact, only a couple second-tier Android phones even claim to support it so far. But that’s not stopping the Bluetooth group, which is keeping with its twice-a-year cadence and announcing the Bluetooth 6.1 spec. You’ll recall the Bluetooth 6 spec added an impressive new Channel Sounding capability that would give it centimeter-accurate location and distance tracking similar to Ultra Wideband, in addition to some new features that can improve latency and throughput. The Bluetooth 6.1 update is focused on a new feature called Randomized RPA (Resolvable Private Address). This feature allows for the timing of RPA address changes, which improves privacy. Your Bluetooth device and those it connects to can change address at times that can’t be predicted, which makes it harder for snooping devices to track your activity or location. To improve power efficiency, this address change operation can be offloaded to the Bluetooth controller instead of the device’s CPU, which will save battery life. We expect the first premium phones to support Bluetooth 6 sometime this fall, and that could very well include the iPhone 17. It’s quite possible those will support these new Bluetooth 6.1 features as well, especially given Apple’s enthusiasm for privacy and power efficiency.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2769619/save-up-to-55-on-the-stylish-baseus-picogo-magsafe-power-bank.html",
    "description": "Macworld Picture this: you’re on the go, your boss calls and you have to pick up the phone for a meeting. The meeting keeps getting longer and longer and, suddenly, your phone’s low-battery warning pops up. Instead of scrambling for power cable, you just take out the Baseus Picogo MagSafe portable power bank and magnetically connect it to the back of your phone. Crisis averted! Of course, the scenario may differ. You may be at a concert, you may be running late to meet a friend, or you may be trying to catch an Uber late at night—whatever the situation, a power bank like the Baseus Picogo can solve the problem for you. The Baseus Picogo MagSafe portable chargers are absolutely gorgeous, with a slim build and a sleek design. The aluminum alloy casing makes it easy for heat to dissipate, thus avoiding overheating during charging, plus they feature an AI monitoring chip that checks temps thousands of times every hour. The wear-resistant silicone surface is soft to the touch and leaves no messy fingerprints. This tiny power bank from Baseus is super-thin, so you’ll barely even feel the difference when you have it magnetically attached to the back of your iPhone (or your Android phone with a MagSafe case). Its edges are curved, so they won’t dig into your hand, either, which is such a smart detail. The device is also light enough that it won’t bother you to hold it while using your phone. There are two versions of the Baseus Picogo, and which you choose depends on your charging needs. Both 5,000mAh and 10,000mAh capacity versions are available. The 5,000mAh Picogo is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs 4.6oz, so you’ll barely even feel that you’re holding it. The 10,000mAh version is a bit thicker, measuring 0.5 inches, and weighing 7.8oz. Still, the devices otherwise have the same size, measuring just 2.62 inches in length and 3.93 inches in height. A key difference between these devices is their charging output, for both wired and wireless connections. The 5,000mAh Picogo delivers 7.5W wireless charging, but you can also use a type-C-to-C cable if you want a faster recharge–this can reach up to 20W. Don’t worry, the cable comes in the package. For the 10,000mAh Picogo, you can expect faster 15W Qi2-certified wireless charging and 27W wired charging via the USB-C port. Another thing to consider when making your choice is that the 5,000mAh Picogo typically offers a single recharge for your phone, while the 10,000mAh should deliver two full recharges. Of course, this all depends on your phone’s battery capacity. Since we know price matters, you should know the Baseus Picogo is on sale over at Amazon. The 5,000mAh Picogo costs $26.99 right now, a 55% discount from its MSRP. The 10,000mAh version is a bit more expensive, and and you can get it for $39.99, 20% under its MSRP. These deals are not going to last forever, so you should definitely move fast if you want to get one of these Baseus Picogo MagSafe power banks. The Baseus Picogo 5,000mAh is $26.99Buy now at Amazon The Baseus Picogo 10,000mAh is $39.99Buy now at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
