    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/676595/does-an-apple-watch-work-without-an-iphone.html",
    "description": "Macworld The Apple Watch is one of the most complete experiences you’ll find in the company’s product offerings. Since its introduction in 2015, the electronic timepiece has become one of the dominant players in the wearable technology sector. It is, by far, the most popular watch of any kind in the world. Over different generations Apple has added features such as GPS, LTE, and weatherproofing that make the Apple Watch ever more a standalone device in its own right. But is it possible to untether it from the iPhone entirely? In this article, we explain what exactly an Apple Watch can achieve without the assistance of an iPhone. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm) Read our review Price When Reviewed: $399 Best Prices Today: $367 at Amazon | $369 at Walmart Electronics | $379 at Best Buy Can you use an Apple Watch without an iPhone? Yes and no. When you first get an Apple Watch, it requires an iPhone to set it up. There’s no getting around that. The Watch app on the iPhone does most of the heavy lifting, and without it you just have a pretty bracelet that cost far too much. Without an iPhone you won’t be able to set up the Apple Watch. Apple regards the Apple Watch as a companion device to its smartphone, so much so that you can’t even use a Mac or iPad to help get it up and running. So why did we say “yes and no”, rather than just “no”? Well, although you can’t set up an Apple Watch without an iPhone, you can set up an Apple Watch for someone who doesn’t have an iPhone–a child or another family member–using your iPhone. They will still be able to use many of the features of the Apple Watch. You will need an Apple ID and you’ll need to add them to your Family Sharing Group, and their Apple Watch needs to be connected to the internet to take full advantage–although this doesn’t need to be a cellular connection as the Apple Watch only needs to be able to connect to a Wi-Fi network to send or receive data. The only times they will need to be in range of your iPhone update the software on their Apple Watch and to tweak a few specific settings. Similarly, you can still enjoy plenty of features on your own Apple Watch even if you left your iPhone at home. We’ll run through the things your Apple Watch doesn’t need an iPhone for below. Does Fall Detection/ Crash Detection on Apple Watch work without cellular/iPhone? If you are thinking of purchasing an Apple Watch for an elderly parent because the Fall Detection feature could give you peace of mind, you may be wondering whether it will work without an iPhone nearby, or at least a cellular connection. Similarly, the crash detection feature may appeal. But what if you don’t have a phone nearby, or a WiFi connection, when it happens? These features require Apple Watch Series 8 (or later), Apple Watch SE (2nd generation), and Apple Watch Ultra. Your Apple Watch can contact emergency services if it detects that you have been in a car crash, or fallen over, but it does need to either be on a cellular network, or connected to a Wi-Fi network to place the call. Apple What an Apple Watch can do without an iPhone These are all things that an Apple Watch can do without requiring you to have an iPhone in your pocket. In some cases, your Apple Watch will require a connection to a Wi-Fi network or cellular. Track Activity and Workouts Want to close your rings, but don’t fancy dragging your iPhone out on a run or long walk? The Apple Watch will happily record all of those steps and other health information while out and about. The data will sync with your iPhone when you return home. Use other Health features Even if you have no iPhone, Wi-Fi, or cellular connection, you can still use the following Apple Watch features: Check heart rate (all models) Take an ECG (Apple Watch Series 4 or later) Measure your blood oxygen (Apple Watch Series 6 or later) Track sleep (Apple Watch Series 3 or later) Track medications (Apple Watch Series 4 or later) Track menstrual cycle (Apple Watch Series 1 or later) Use the stopwatch, set alarms and timers Listen to music If you want some pumping tunes while running or just fancy listening to a podcast or album while you potter about in the garden, then you can store plenty of tracks on the Apple Watch itself, all of which you can listen to without the need for an iPhone. Of course, as there is no headphone jack on an Apple Watch, you’ll need a pair of Bluetooth headphones – unless you want the tiny little speaker to ruin your exercise session and relationship with the neighbors. You can also stream music from Apple Music – if you are connected to Wi-Fi or have a cellular connection. We explain how to use Bluetooth headphones with an Apple Watch and how to play music on Apple Watch separately. Listen to podcasts and audiobooks If you have synced podcasts and audiobooks with your Apple Watch you will be able to listen to them even if there is no Wi-Fi or cellular connection. And if you can connect to a Wi-Fi or cellular network then you can stream them too. Read news This is another one you will need a Wi-Fi or cellular connection for, but even without your iPhone nearby you can still check the latest stories on the News app, or track stocks. Make and receive phone calls If you have an Apple Watch Series 3 or later with cellular capabilities or are connected to a Wi-Fi network, you can set up the Watch to act as an extension of your iPhone. With this in place, you’ll then be able to make and receive calls directly on your Watch, even if your iPhone is in a drawer back home. There are additional costs to using the eSIM feature, but you’ll find them far less onerous than the normal plans offered by carriers. For more information read: How to make or answer a phone call on Apple Watch. Send and receive text messages As with phone calls, as long as you are connected to Wi-Fi or cellular data you will be able to send and receive messages on your Apple Watch. Read and send emails and view your calendar The same is true of emails – as long as you are on a Wi-Fi or cellular network you don’t require your iPhone. Look at photos Sync your favorite photos and you can look at them on your Watch whenever you like. Use Maps Another very useful feature that’s available on an Apple Watch is the ability to use the Apple Maps app without an iPhone nearby. Again, this will require a cellular contract or a Wi-Fi connection. With that in place, you’re free to roam without an expensive and heavy iPhone-shaped bulk in your pocket. See how to use Apple Maps on Apple Watch for all you need to know. You can also use the Compass to work out which way is north without needing any network connection. Foundry Use Apple Pay You might not realize it, but once you’ve set up Apple Pay on your Apple Watch, there’s no need to have your iPhone with you when paying for things at the checkout. Just double-press the Side button and hold the Watch over the contactless sensor, and the payment should go through automatically. If you haven’t used this feature yet, then a quick read of how to use Apple Pay on Apple Watch will speed up those moments at the checkout. You may also be able to load up transit cards and ID cards on your Apple Watch. Can you use an Apple Watch with an Android phone? No. If Apple doesn’t want the Watch working with iPads and Macs, then you can be assured that Android phones are well down the list. It’s possible that Apple sees the Watch as a system-seller, in that people will stick with the iPhone just to use the Apple Watch. There’s no great temptation for the company to open up the devices to new platforms any time soon. If you’ve yet to take the plunge on an Apple Watch or need to update your existing model to take advantage of some of the features listed above, be sure to check out best Apple Watch and best Apple Watch deals.",

    "description": "Macworld With a gorgeous ProMotion display, all you need to turn your iPad Pro into a MacBook Pro is the right keyboard, and that’s exactly what the iPad Magic Keyboard case is—and today it’s available for a brand new best price. Amazon is selling the Magic Keyboard for the M4 iPad Pro 11-inch for $250, a savings of $50 off its $299 MSRP. This new Magic Keyboard is sleeker than previous models, and it was created specifically for the new iPad Pro models that were released earlier this year. It’s thinner than other Magic keyboards, and there’s even a function row to allow you to quickly control volume, brightness, or media, just like you would on a laptop. The new trackpad is also larger and comes with haptic feedback. It also supports various Multi-Touch gestures, enabling you to scroll, swipe, or zoom. Another nice touch is that the keys are backlit, making them easier to see when you’re using the tablet in the evening. We know the iPad Pro M4 is rather pricey, but it does deliver a fantastic performance thanks to the new chip and all the other upgrades Apple delivered. It’s so good that we gave it a super-rare 5-star rating. But adding the Magic Keyboard will give you a more MacBook-like experience while also offering the tablet the protection it needs when you travel. So snatch the Apple Magic Keyboard for the M4 iPad Pro for $250 at Amazon, the best price yet. This is the best price we've seen for this new Magic KeyboardBuy it now at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
