    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2770894/why-picking-a-travel-esim-for-your-next-trip-is-a-smart-idea.html",
    "description": "Macworld Keeping up to date with the latest news, social media posts, podcasts, and messaging services while travelling abroad can be tricky. Your mobile provider will most likely want to charge a small fortune for overseas data plans or you’ll have to deal with the hassle of trying to buy a local SIM card when you arrive at your destination. Neither are great ways to start a holiday. Thankfully, there’s a better solution – eSIMs. These allow you to set up your service before you leave home, don’t come with expensive rolling contracts, and can be used in a huge range of locations. That’s why they should be the first thing on your list when planning an international trip – plus the fact that you can get 10% off on your first Ubigi eSIM data plan purchase with the code MACWORLD right now. What is an eSIM? As you may have already guessed from the name, these are software versions of SIM cards that don’t require you to put the actual plastic cards into your devices. This means you can’t lose them and they can be set up to be used in a huge selection of countries. Ubigi They’re compatible with a variety of iPhones, going as far back as the XS, XS Max and XR, as well as plenty of the cellular equipped iPads. In fact, in recent years, US iPhones have become eSIM-only, but you can hold multiple ones on the same handset, which is one of the advantages of not being limited to physical cards. You can get eSIMs from a range of suppliers, with Ubigi in particular being one of the most trusted names in the travel eSIM space. Travel without hassle or expense There’s already plenty of things to think about when on a foreign trip, so you don’t want to be worrying about staying connected on your iPhone. That’s why eSIMs are so useful, as you can prepare everything before you leave. With Ubigi travel eSIMs you can even get them 6 months before you travel, with the peace of mind that they’ll automatically start working when you arrive at your destination. This means that the moment your plane lands or the boat docks, you’ll have an active data connection. The best part is that you can avoid the roaming charges from your normal carriers, which can be expensive, and instead get close to the normal local rates of the country’s network providers. Should you be travelling through multiple locations, then Ubigi will follow you everywhere as it works in over 200 destinations worldwide. You only need to install the eSIM once and then you can use the dedicated app to top up data as your journey unfolds. No worries and no fuss, especially since you can top up via the app even if you run out of data and can’t connect to WiFi. Ubigi Flexible plans that work for you Ubigi travel eSIM data plans come in so many options that you’ll be bound to find one that suits your needs while abroad. Some popular ones include 7-days of unlimited data in Japan, 25GB of data in France for 30 days, unlimited data in the USA for 30 days, and those visiting the UK can get 10GB to use across a month, but note that many destinations have plans ranging from 1GB to unlimited data. At the moment, new customers can also take advantage of a fantastic offer that gives you 10% off any plan with the code MACWORLD.  There’s an old saying that the longest journey begins with but a single step. Just make sure your first one is to sort out a data plan on an eSIM so your travels can start off on the right foot. Save 10% on Ubigi travel eSIMs Use code MACWORLD",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2776151/ecoflow-power-hat-review.html",
    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros Lightweight Foldable Quite robust Cons Low efficiency Our Verdict The Power Hat is a good idea, but the state of solar panel efficiency is such that this hat at least requires ideal weather conditions and an ideal orientation to convert enough solar energy into electricity to charge your iPhone or other device in a short amount of time. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$129 Best Prices Today: EcoFlow Power Hat Retailer Price $129 View Deal EcoFlow $129 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket Wearing a hat when you’re spending time in the sun is ideal to protect your skin and help keep you cool. But why not go a step further and make the hat capable of charging an iPhone? That’s the premise with the EcoFlow Power Hat. It’s a sun hat with edges lined with solar panels. If the conditions are right, it can create solar energy that can be used to charge a mobile device, such as an iPhone. The Power Hat immediately catches the eye. Unlike conventional outdoor clothing in green, brown, or pastel colors, the hat is black to match the black solar panels. The pitch-black color and the creases on the brim had led to the somewhat unforeseen consequences: When trying them on in the office, my co-workers teased me about Hogwarts–I have to admit, the comparison is not too far-fetched. My fellow travellers on the route associated the look with 19th-century fashion. In any case, the hat looks quite unusual. The plastic edges are creased along the photovoltaic elements so that the hat can be folded quite comfortably–a clear advantage over classic summer hats, most of which do not survive the first journey in a bag without visual loss. The edges are made of robust plastic, with the panels on the upper side and a fabric lining at the bottom, presumably to prevent excessive perspiration. The hat weighs just 370 grams, and I didn’t have any discomfort during a five-hour hike with the hat either on my head or hanging my neck with the provided hat strap. Only in strong gusts of wind do the robust plastic brims react to a breeze–the wind almost tore the hat off my head twice if it hadn’t been secured with the strap. Two USB ports for charging cables The plug box on the underside of the brim In size Medium-Large (Large-Extra Large is also available), the brim is 14 centimeters wide, so the hat measures around 47 centimeters in diameter, more than enough to reliably protect your face from the sun’s rays, even on a sunny day in the mountains. The Power Hat has two USB-A and USB-C ports on the underside of the brim. Can the Power Hat charge an iPhone? Solar radiation in Oberstdorf on April 6, 2025Halyna Kubiv I wore the solar hat on a hike in the Allgäu on April 6, 2025, and according to Oberstdorf.de, the solar radiation on that day reached 1,000 watts per square meter around midday. It was very sunny with hardly any clouds in the sky. EcoFlow states a maximum current of 2.4 amperes for the Power Hat. When connected to an iPhone 16 and using the USB-C charging cable (which supports Power Delivery) that is included with the phone, and when wearing the hat and connected to the iPhone, the Solar Hat supplied so little voltage that the iPhone recognized a power source and displayed the charging icon for a short time. However, the iPhone was not charged; the percentage display on the battery did not increase. I measured a current of 0.15 to 0.87 amperes, and the value never exceeded one ampere. The brim of the hat has a fairly steep angle when wearing it, but regardless of its position, only a quarter of the brim received direct sunlight. The rest is either in the shade or at such an unfavorable angle that the respective photovoltaic tile does not receive any energy. Here’s an example of how solar radiation is distributed across the photovoltaic elements. Only the front two get a reasonable amount of energy; the rest are either in the shade or at an unfavorable angle.Halyna Kubiv It was only when I took off the hat and spread it out on the ground that I saw a higher amperage ranging from 1 ampere to 1.38 amperes. In this spread-out state, the hat was connected to the iPhone for around 20 minutes, during which the smartphone was charged by six percentage points, from 43 per cent to 49 per cent. Under such ideal conditions, the iPhone could be charged from zero to 100 percent in over 5 hours. Should you buy the EcoFlow Power Hat? The idea behind the Power Hat is appealing: while you are out, you benefit from solar energy and use it to charge your own devices. However, practice shows that this hat at least requires ideal weather conditions and an ideal orientation in order to convert enough solar energy into electricity. As a sun hat, however, the solar hat from EcoFlow is almost perfect, it is lightweight and the brim is wide enough to protect the face from the sun at most angles. If it were half the price, this would be a clear recommendation to buy, but the combination of a conventional sun hat and a power bank is more affordable.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
