    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/673271/best-mac-cleaner-vs-cleanmymac.html",
    "description": "Macworld If your Mac is slowing down, frequently freezing, regularly running out of RAM or just not behaving like it used to. Are you short of space on your Mac? Have you spotted the immense amount of room taken up by System Data and are now looking for a safe way to delete some of that data. What you need is a Mac cleaner app that will delete the clutter and digital debris from your system and free your RAM from memory hogs. Thankfully, there are a wealth of tools available to rectify that can clean up your Mac and get it working properly again. We’ve picked some of the best Mac cleaning software below so you can find one that suits you. The apps included in the list below all offer free trial versions. Some of these trials will merely show you how much space you can free up, but several are essentially free Mac Cleaners that will allow you to clean your Mac for free, albeit for a limited period. These include the trials for CleanMyMac, DaisyDisk, Parallels ToolBox and MacCleaner Pro featured below.  Updated: October 2024 with Cleaner One Pro and DaisyDisk reviews. PROMOTIONCleanMyMac X | Do more on a faster Mac Use CleanMyMac X to find hidden junk and free up unseen cache files. Locate large old folders, background apps, and heavy memory consumers. Tune your Mac for maximum speed, and keep it malware-free and secure. Make sure you use the Smart Scan weekly to help your computer stay productive all year round. Download Free Edition For more information about why a Mac cleaner app could be useful read: Why your Mac needs a cleaner app. We also discuss Tips for cleaning up your Mac. For more ways to squeeze the most out of your system read our How to speed up a slow Mac guide and How to delete Other on a Mac. We also look at How to delete System storage and How to clear cache on a Mac. Best Mac Cleaner 1. MacCleaner Pro Pros Impressive set of tools Good tutorial system Good level of configuration with the application’s modules Cons Occasionally awkward user interface Price When Reviewed: $74.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase); or $29.95/a year for 1 Mac (usually $14.95 a month) Best Prices Today: Free at Nektony (free 2 day trial)$74.95 at Nektony (one time purchase) MacCleaner Pro from Nektony (version 3.3 at the time of our latest review) is divided into a core app and several module apps, namely App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller, Disk Space Analyzer, Duplicate File Finder, Memory Cleaner, and Funter. The core app can perform an overall disk cleaning and help free up storage space by eliminating extraneous files.  The App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller module works well, and allows you to see the app you’re removing as well as its support files. This module has been improved compared to version 3, and now offers you easier access to startup programs and extension files, allowing you to enable, disable, or remove them. A Remaining Files feature allows you to chase down loose files, while an Open With feature lets you assign applications to open certain file types. With Duplicate File Finder it’s easy to specify file types to look for, such as audio and photo files, with an impressive level of precise control. Memory Cleaner module offers an easy interface to show which applications and processes are consuming the most RAM. Funter module finds hidden files within your operating system.  The Fast Cleanup option was able to clear up 11.4GB of drive space, most of these being application cache files, while the Deep Cleanup feature helped reclaim 65.4GB of drive space.  We did have some peculiar instances in which a reminder poped up advising us to clear disk space for a macOS Sonoma (which was already installed). On another occasion when we paused scanning after half an hour we saw a request for full access to the hard drive.  MacCleaner Pro is easy to install, runs well and has a good feature base. You can buy it on an annual or monthly subscription or as a one-time purchase. The free trial version is fully functioning for two days and will actually perform some of the tasks you need to do, rather than ask you to buy the full version. You can get MacCleaner Pro here. Read our full Nektony MacCleaner Pro review 2. MacPaw CleanMyMac X Pros Excellent cleaning tools for Mac storage Large toolset Easy to use Cons Updater feature missed some app updates Malware Removal is still producing mixed results Price When Reviewed: $89.95 for 1 Mac (one time purchase); or $34.95/a year for 1 Mac (usually £39.95 a year) Best Prices Today: Free at MacPaw (free 7 day trial)$34.95 at MacPaw (one time purchase) CleanMyMac X is a catch-all utility designed to identify and clean out gigabytes upon gigabytes of unused system garbage. It grants you easy access to several handy utilities to clear up disk space, protect user privacy, optimize performance, update applications, uninstall software, and help prevent malware and adware. The modules include Smart Scan, System Junk, Mail Attachments, Trash Bins, Malware Removal, Privacy, Optimization, Maintenance, Uninstaller, Updater, Extensions, Space Lens, Large \u0026 Old Files, and Shredder. Among these you will find tools for file cleanup, malware removal, privacy cleanup, easy access to system extensions, the app uninstaller, and the ability to down multi-GB files you forgot to delete and a quick means of deleting them. Smart Scan is the overarching umbrella feature, hunting down extraneous files that can be deleted to clear drive space, performing a quick malware scan, and executing a speed test to look into optimization functions, such as freeing up RAM or quickly clearing system caches. The Disk Lens and Uninstaller offered a clear view as to which folders were consuming the most drive space and a quick means of removing applications.  I was able to recover more than 30GB of drive space as the program found unused files and disk images galore.  Our main criticism is that the developer overextends themselves by trying to be everything to everyone. Unfortunately, some features aren’t as good as others – particularly the Malware removal module and the Updater function, neither of which work as well as we hoped, even with the antivirus being updated to take advantage of the Moonlock Engine.  CleanMyMac X is easy to download and install, and features a bright, friendly user interface and it’s exceptionally easy to see what’s gobbling up the most space on your Mac’s hard drive. The features are well-integrated. The software costs can be purchased on an annual subscription or a one-time purchase for a 1 Mac license. There’s a free version available to download There is a free trial version available on the Mac App Store and from MacPaw’s website, but it restricts the app to only remove files up to a maximum of 500MB – and in the middle of deleting files it will demand you pay the license fee for the app. You can download that limited version and scan your Mac to see just now much space you can save before committing to buying the app. MacPaw is currently running a 30% discount for students – submit your university email address and receive a download code here.  You can get CleanMyMac X here. Read our full CleanMyMac X review 3. Cleaner One Pro for Mac Pros Quick, stable performance and a handy user interface. The modules work as advertised, and handle duplicate files and cleanup well. Good value for the asking price. Cons Page up and page down keys can’t be used for quick navigation. No free trial to test the software. Certain software elements require a subscription-based account to run. Price When Reviewed: $24.99 a year for 1 device (currently $19.99); or $59.99 a year for 5 devices (currently $29.99) Best Prices Today: $24.99 at Trend Micro Cleaner One Pro for Mac is easy to download and install. The software requires is available in both free and paid subscription-based tiers. For the free tier, the software offers basic scanning and no user limits while requiring no credit or debit card to be stored with Trend Micro. The Basic tier, requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, offers support for one device, access to additional tools, and easy uninstallation if desired. The Advanced tier requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, and offers support for five devices, macOS and Windows support, quick uninstallation, and access to additional tools.  You can purchase from Trend Micro, or via the Mac App Store and an iOS version on the iOS App Store.  Cleaner One Pro is designed around an assortment of modules including Smart Scan, which looks over your storage, diagnostics, and applications, Junk Files, Big Files, Disk Map, Startup Manager, Duplicate Files, Similar Photos, App Manager, and File Shredder. The modules performed well during testing, and were able to locate large files and duplicates to be disposed of. The Junk Files module found a variety of unused disk images and installers. An interface along the Menu Bar tracked memory usage, CPU usage, network usage, and hooked into Dropbox to help put files up on the cloud. There are some elements that require some attention. One annoyance was that you can’t navigate through module windows using the page up and page down keys, only a mouse will suffice. And we encountered a lack of communication from Trend Micro itself for product and technical questions, which was a concern.  Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and offers an elegant and easy to navigate user interface that lets you prune your Mac down effectively. This useful set of Mac cleaning tools comes at a good price, and if you’re looking for something reliable in this field, it’s worth your consideration. You can get Cleaner One Pro here. Read our full Cleaner One Pro for Mac review 4. Daisy Disk Pros Quickly scans storage and finds large files Graphical representation of storage File name previews Can check cloud storage Cons Some user-interface quirks Price When Reviewed: $9.99 Best Prices Today: $9.99 at Software Ambience (One time purchase) DaisyDisk incorporates a clean, fun, interesting user interface via which it sets out to help you visualize the data on your Mac and its local, network, and cloud-based volumes, map it out, see which files are taking up the most space, and help you free up gigabytes of drive space. DaisyDisk supports a number of file formats and file systems, as well as network volumes, virtual elements and disk images, and can mount and scan just about anything as long as the volume itself is operational.  DaisyDisk can also mount cloud-based services such as Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Box. It was simple to add my Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, and Box accounts, and then connect and sift through them to see which ancient files could be readily put out to pasture to clear up space as needed. See our round-up of the best cloud backups for Mac. I was able to clear up dozens of gigabytes of space in the process. We did have some difficulties with Google Drive, which refused to allow DaisyDisk access, stating that the app was blocked and “This app tried to access sensitive info in your Google Account. To keep your account safe, Google blocked this access.” This appears to be a conflict between DaisyDisk’s developers and Google that has yet to be sorted out, and while some workarounds have been proposed online, there seems to be no quick solution to the conflict. DaisyDisk users are also currently unable to add and sort through Apple’s iCloud Drive accounts given Apple’s sandboxing of the environment. You can scan a local copy of your iCloud Drive contents using the “Scan Folder…” button but not the Web-based data, which is frustrating. In addition to being able to scan entire volumes at once, you can click the “Select Folder…” button and navigate to a custom folder.  With DaisyDisk it’s entirely up to your own discretion as to which files and folders to delete, with nothing more than a five-second countdown clock and time period in which to cancel the decision. Apple’s Disk Utility app can be accessed from the Menu bar to perform disk repairs on the fly.  Unlike so many apps you don’t have to sign up for a subscription package: the app retails for $9.99/£9.99, which is excellent value.  You can get Daisy Disk here. Read our full Daisy Disk review 5. Gemini 1.1 Pros Quick, reliable, and capable of finding multiple duplicate types Excellent search customization, including folders and external volumes Handy preferences and options, including whitelist creation Cons Lack of additional filters makes sorting located duplicates more tedious than it should be Could use a scheduling feature Price When Reviewed: From $19.95 for 1 Mac, annually Best Prices Today: Free at MacPaw (free 7 day trial)$19.95 at MacPaw (annually) Though not strictly a Mac cleaner, like other apps in this round-up, MacPaw’s Gemini 2 can certainly help you get back some disc space. It is a duplicate removal tool that focuses specifically on reducing the thousands of duplicate photos in your Photos library. It also hunts down duplicate files within Apple Music and across the macOS operating system. The app is available through Apple’s App Store and MacPaw’s SetApp application, which grants access to Gemini and other apps for $9.99 (£7.60) a month. It is easy to install and offers a seven-day free trial in exchange for either your credit or debit card information. The app includes scripts for easy scanning of the Photos library and your Music library, as well as custom folders and external volumes that can be chosen from a menu or dragged, dropped, and quickly scanned. Other features include Menu Bar elements, whitelists that can be created that are exempt from being scanned, and a Duplicate Monitor feature that helps compare files and heads off duplicates before they begin to pile up. In testing, Gemini 2 quickly sought out duplicates, offered the option to remove them, and eradicated them from our hard drive. This also applies to music files and other document types, and the Duplicate Monitor warns you about possible duplicates that have been carried over to your hard drive. However, there are some caveats, such as confusion about account registration and permissions after downloading and installing Gemini 2 from the App Store. MacPaw is urging its clients towards SetApp subscriptions, which offer full access to the company’s apps for a given rate per month. While Gemini 2 runs well, a scheduling feature for folder or volume scans would not go amiss. An improved filter for located duplicate items would be more helpful. Despite some minor hurdles, Gemini 2 is well-written, sharp, helpful, fast, works well with all kinds of duplicates, and lends a good feature set to the macOS operating system without being overbearing. It hones in on its tasks and performs them well enough to earn the trust of users. You can get MacPaw Gemini 2 from the Mac App Store or from MacPaw here. Read our full Gemini 1.1 review 6. Parallels Toolbox Pros Full suite of Mac tools Fully featured free trial Cons May be more than you require Price When Reviewed: $24.99 per year Best Prices Today: Free at Parallels Toolbox Free 14-day Trial $24.99 at Parallels (annually) Parallels Toolbox is a bunch of tools that can be used to perform various actions on your Mac – such as Download Video, Record Audio, Hide Desktop Files, Resize Image, Clipboard History, Find Duplicates, Free Memory, and even the ability to set alarms. Among all these tools is one that can be used to clean your Mac. Mac cleaning tools provided in Parallels Toolbox that could also be useful when cleaning a Mac include Clean Drive, Uninstall Apps, Find Duplicates, and Free Memory. The Clean Drive tool scans your drive and then lets you choose what to delete. You can delete applications by dragging them to the trash, but this doesn’t always completely delete them. Often files and folders can be left scattered around your system that were related to that now gone app. Parallels’s Uninstall Apps tool will remove apps and their associated files from your Mac. Similarly, you can run Find Duplicates to dig out any identical files – even ones that have different file names. Parallel’s Toolbox costs $24.99/£20.99 a year, but the free 14-day trial will actually delete files, free memory and do all those other useful things without you buying the app! You can get an overview of Toolbox’s various features, and download the seven-day trial, from the company’s website. You can get Parallels Toolbox here. Read our full Parallels Toolbox review 7. Nektony App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller Pros Simple user interface Free (with Pro upgrade) Cons Not as full-featured as alternatives Price When Reviewed: $14.95 a year for 1 Mac (usually $7.95 a month) Best Prices Today: Free at Nektony (free 3 day trial)$14.95 at Nektony (annually) Also from Nektony, is the simple and easy to use App Cleaner \u0026 Installer. This lightweight app is actually bundled with MacCleaner Pro (above), but this version focuses on clearing out the broken links, files, and other gubbins that get left behind when apps are uninstalled. It also, as the name suggests, allows you to uninstall apps cleanly from the get-go, and set which ones launch at start up.   There is a free version that does most of these tasks, but if you pay $9.99/£9.99 for the Pro upgrade you’ll also be able to remove system extensions, executable parts of files, and uninstall apps, plus the ads that adorn the free version disappear. Easy to recommend due to both its price and quality. You can get App Cleaner \u0026 Uninstaller here. 8. Onyx Pros Powerful toolset Versions for older Mac systems readily available Cons UI needs some time to learn Price When Reviewed: Free Best Prices Today: Free at Titanium Software (Donationware) There’s a reason Onyx from Titanium Software has been among the tools of choice for Mac techies for such a long time. It offers a great set of tools and an incredible level of customization. It’s also freeware, so you don’t have to pay a penny, although the developer Titanium Software appreciates donations. Onyx also combines a unique, bare-bones approach to its user interface while offering an incredible level of customization as to what files are affected during a repair. Onyx can repair permissions, rebuild databases, reorganize file structures, check hard disk structures, and restore indexes. It can even repaire Unix-level functions that would otherwise only be accessed through Terminal. The main downside is that it’s not all that simple to use and it’s easy to make errors. Luckily there are handy FAQ links on the Titanium Software website for common issues. There are versions of Onyx for each version of the macOS. You can get Onyx here. Read our full Onyx review 9. CCleaner Pros Impressive customization tools Excellent control over storage Cons User interface is a little clunky Price When Reviewed: $29.95 a year Best Prices Today: $14.99 at Macworld Software Store$29.95 at Piriform Software (annually) CCleaner from Piriform (acquired by Avast, which has subsequently merged with Norton) achieves what it sets out to do: help clean up gigabytes of cache files, internet history files, and locate and purge large files on your Mac, all with an impressive level of control. It’s easy to both analyze a hard drive to determine how much space certain files might be taking up. Options include Uninstall, Startup, Erase Free Space, Large File Finder, and Duplicate File Finder. You can customize which cookies you want to save or purge and chose between Normal file deletion,” which is faster or “Secure file deletion,” which takes longer. Our only nitpick is that the user interface makes it feel very much like a Windows port. In fact, CCleaner has had a similar look and feel for the better part of 20 years. It’s freeware, but there’s an option to pay for a professional version for $29.95/£25.95 a year. In 2017 CCleaner was used to distribute malware. Hackers had inserted malicious code in the legitimate program. This has been rectified. You can get CCleaner here. Read our full CCleaner review 10. Mac Keeper Pros Convenience of having multiple tools in one product Free version lets you access most of the features Cons Paid subscription is expensive Burdened with a bad reputation Price When Reviewed: $62.01 a year for 1 Mac (usually $95.40 a year) Best Prices Today: $62.01 at Clario (annually) We have to start by addressing the fact that MacKeeper doesn’t have the best reputation, although in recent years the company’s new owner – Clario – has tried very hard to rectify that. MacKeeper’s poor reputation wasn’t helped by the fact that it was difficult to uninstall an used scareware tactics to encourage people to upgrade to a paid version. Those issues should now be in the past. The software has received a good grade from AV-Test and has notarization from Apple, among other things, that should give users confidence. In terms of what it can do, MacKeeper offers 11 tools including an antivirus scanner, adware remover, a cleanup feature, a duplicate file finder, and a smart uninstaller. There’s also a memory cleaner, a software update tracker, and a startup item locator. You’ll also find a ID theft guard, a VPN, and an online ad blocker. There’s a free version, that gives you access to most of the tools, as well as a $5 a month for a year subscription. A subscription includes 24-7 tech support through which you can email, chat with, or talk to support staff. You can probably find individual products—and in some cases, more robust products—for each of the features in MacKeeper. But having all these tools under one roof makes for ease and convenience.  You can get MacKeeper here.

The Basic tier, which currently retails for $19.99/£19.99 a year (then $24.99/£24.99 a year) requires a payment method to be stored with Trend Micro, offers support for one device, access to additional tools, and easy uninstallation if desired.

Like similar tools, Cleaner One Pro is designed around an assortment of modules along with its overarching Smart Scan, which looks over your storage, diagnostics, and applications, while the other modules (Junk Files, Big Files, Disk Map, Startup Manager, Duplicate Files, Similar Photos, App Manager, and File Shredder) attend to their own tasks when activated. The modules, in turn, performed well during testing, and were able to locate large files and duplicates that could be disposed of. 6.66GB of duplicate photos were just deleted via the Similar Photos module. 6.66GB of duplicate photos were just deleted via the Similar Photos module.Foundry 6.66GB of duplicate photos were just deleted via the Similar Photos module.Foundry Foundry The Junk Files module found a nice variety of unused disk images and installers I’d forgotten about and didn’t need, and an interface along the Menu Bar tracked memory usage, CPU usage, network usage, and hooked into Dropbox to help put files up on the cloud, which was useful.

Customizing the Smart Scan module and choosing which tests to perform.Foundry Customizing the Smart Scan module and choosing which tests to perform.Foundry Foundry Still, there are some elements that could require some attention. First, and as helpful as it may be, the free version of Cleaner One Pro feels like a living ad for the subscription-based tiers, the interface being slathered in advertising encouraging you to unlock the full feature set. This advertising, of course, disappears once you sign up for the service, but the “More Tools” module leads to a screen offering access to Trend Micro’s antivirus, VPN, decompression, and ad blocking utilities. Yes, this can be argued from both sides and a company has every right to advertise its full set of wares, but this still seems excessive once you click into the “More Tools” window. You can’t navigate through module windows using the page up and page down keys, and are instead limited to the mouse, which seems like an odd feature to leave out. This and the fact that once an activation key has been purchased, it can’t be copied and pasted from the Trend Micro website or your email, and has to be entered in by hand, shows security overlapping ease of use, even if it is for a one-time thing like entering the activation code you just paid for. Finally, a lack of communication from Trend Micro itself for product and technical questions raised my eyebrows a bit, and I’m curious as to whether others have experienced this, or have had quick, speedy communication with the company. Should you buy Cleaner One Pro for Mac? What’s present with Cleaner One Pro is useful, lives up to its description, and an elegant user interface makes it easy to navigate the program, customize settings, quickly view extraneous apps, files, and login items, and prune your Mac down more effectively. It’s also to Cleaner One Pro’s credit that the application doesn’t try to make itself a mega-suite and do everything under the sun, including antiviral scanning and protection or act as a VPN, although Trend Micro readily advertises those products for sale. A free trial for Cleaner One Pro would not go amiss, and if Trend Micro could find a way to keep its customers informed of its offerings while easing up a bit on its in-app advertising, the experience would be that much better. Still, Cleaner One Pro offers a useful set of Mac cleaning tools for a good price, and if you’re looking for something reliable in this field, it’s worth your consideration.",

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
