We also talk about the rumored deal between Apple and Google to have Apple use Gemini in Apple Intelligence—this is probably the best news ever for Apple's AI efforts. If you haven't tried Gemini yet, you should—it's incredible. Apple is being forced to allow developers to get payment for their apps from outside the App Store, which means Apple doesn't get its 30% cut.

    "description": "Macworld In March 2025 Apple updated the Mac Studio for the first time since June 2023. The Mac Studio now comes with either a M4 Max or M3 Ultra chip – yes, those are different chip generations but the M3 Ultra is still the more powerful (and expensive option). In our review of the M4 Max Mac Studio we were impressed, describing it as “a mean machine ideal for the most hectic of production environments.” The Mac Studio is hands down the fastest Mac there is right now (at least until Apple updates the Mac Pro with a M4 Ultra, if it ever does). It will be a while before we start to see big deals on the Mac Studio. However, we have seen some discounts, and you may also see some deals on the M2-generation Mac Studio and used modes may be sold in Apple’s Refurbished Store. If you want to buy a Mac Studio, and get the best deal possible, you’ve come to the right place. We’re looking at where you can buy the Mac Studio at the best price. Best Mac Studio deals You can’t yet save money on the new Mac Studio models in the U.S. B\u0026H, Mac Studio M4 Max, $1,999 B\u0026H, Mac Studio M3 Ultra, $3,999 But there are discounts on the new models in the U.K.: KRCS, Mac Studio M4 Max, £1,994.05 (£104 off, MSRP £2,099) KRCS, Mac Studio M3 Ultra, £3,989.05 (£209 off, MSRP £4,199) Another way to save money on a Mac Studio is to buy one from the Apple Refurbished Store.

The Mac Studio can be configured with a M4 Max chip, as seen in the 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro, or you can choose an M3 Ultra, which is essentially two M3 Max chips and while a generation older, still faster then the M4 Max. The Mac Studio starts at $1,999/£2,099 for the M4 Max model. The Mac Studio with M3 Ultra starts at $3,999/£4,199. There are also various build-to-order options. The most obvious thing missing from the Mac Studio is a display, but if you want to buy Apple’s Studio Display we have a separate article explaining where you can get the best deal on an Apple Studio Display.

    "description": "Macworld Apple released iOS 18.5 on Monday, and iPhone 16e owners will want to pay special attention to the update. According to Apple’s security release notes, a fix was issued in regards to the iPhone 16e’s C1 modem, where “An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to intercept network traffic.” Below is the section from the security notes that describes the issue. Baseband Impact: An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to intercept network traffic Description: This issue was addressed through improved state management. CVE-2025-31214: 秦若涵, 崔志伟, and 崔宝江 The corresponding CVE record in the CVE database is still listed as reserved and will be made public once it has been updated. Considering the speed of which Apple released the patch—the phone has only been out for about three months—it appears to be a serious issue. Along with the C1 fix, iOS 18.5 includes some 30 security patches ranging from AppleJPEG to WebKit. How to install iOS 18.5 Installing iOS 18.5 is done in the Settings app and requires an internet connection. Tap on General \u003e Software Update and follow the prompts. The iPhone will need to restart, so plan your iPhone usage accordingly. Learn more about iOS 18 in our iOS 18 superguide.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
