    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2393967/iphone-17-release-date-specs-features-rumors.html",
    "description": "Macworld It doesn‚Äôt take long for iPhone rumors to circulate. It‚Äôs one of the most iconic and influential tech gadgets of all time, and everyone wants to know what‚Äôs coming next. That Apple is so secretive only heightens the appeal of iPhone rumors and leaks. So it should come as little surprise that iPhone 17 rumors, leaks, and info started to circulate months before the iPhone 16 was even formally announced. Here‚Äôs everything we know so far, but don‚Äôt take any of it as solid info: even when early rumors are accurate, plans can change, and nothing is ever certain until Apple announces it. What was announced at WWDC? Apple didn‚Äôt reveal anything new about the iPhone 17, but we learned that iOS 26 will bring a lot of exciting new features to all iPhone users. A new Liquid Glass design language uses translucent layers and specular highlights to give all the interface elements a glass-like look that adds depth and realism to the user experience ‚Äî a look and feel that will consistent across all Apple devices. Many of the iPhone apps are getting updates as well. The Phone app will feature a Call Screening option for vet incoming calls, and a Hold Assist function to detect hold music and let you know when someone has picked up. Messages will gain the ability to create polls in group texts for quick and easy consensus-taking on dates to meet or places to eat, and the like. Maps will use AI to make navigation more personalized with preferred routes and previously visited places. See our article on how iOS changes everything and what is new in iOS 26 to learn more about these features and many others. iPhone 17 release date: When is the next iPhone coming out? Here‚Äôs something we do know: The new iPhone lineup is almost always announced in September‚Äîusually on a Tuesday in the second week of September, to be specific. So we would expect the iPhone 17 line to be announced on or around September 9, 2025. Here‚Äôs when the most recent models were released: iPhone 15: September 12, 2023 iPhone 14: Sepember 7, 2022 iPhone 13: Sepember 14, 2021 iPhone 12: October 13, 2020 (delayed due to Covid) Historically, preorders for the iPhone begin on the Friday after the announcement, and the phones ship a week later. On occasion, some specific models may ship a couple of weeks later than others due to production issues. So expect pre-orders around September 12 and on sale from September 19. iPhone 17: Price We haven‚Äôt yet heard if the iPhone 17 line will cost the same as the iPhone 16 line. Most rumors suggest the ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù model will be replaced by the new super-slim ‚ÄúAir‚Äù model, which will take over its price in the lineup as well: iPhone 17: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($799) iPhone 17 Pro: 6.27-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,099) iPhone 17 Pro Max: 6.86-inch LTPO display, A19 Pro/12GB ($1,199) iPhone 17 Air: 6.65-inch LTPO display, A19/8GB ($899) This would mean a significant upward shift in overall iPhone pricing, with the Pro model jumping up $100 and a new model replacing the Plus with a price of $100 more than the Pro Max. Now that Apple has introduced the iPhone 16e there may also be an iPhone 17e joining the lineup in September 2025, although we don‚Äôt know if it will be updated in September 2025, or if that model won‚Äôt arrive until spring 2026. The price is likely to be $599 for the iPhone 17e, unless Apple introduces an iPhone 17e in place of the iPhone 15, with a price of $699, in which case the iPhone 16e could remain in the lineup with its $599 price tag. iPhone 17: Colors In April, Majin Bu reported that the iPhone 17 Pro models will come in a new and ‚Äúirresistible‚Äù sky blue color. That would be the second product with that color, following the M4 MacBook Air. The iPhone 16 comes in five colors including Ultramarine, Teal, Pink, White, and Black.¬†The iPhone 16 Pro comes in Desert Titanium, Natural Titanium, White Titanium, and Black Titanium, which are reminiscent of the classic gold and space gray options. There were rumors that the iPhone 16 would also come in purple, so perhaps that‚Äôs in the pipeline for 2025. Leaker Majin Bu posted a later story claiming that Apple is testing new Purple and Green colors for the base iPhone 17, though only one may be selected for the final production run. iPhone 17: New slimmer ‚ÄòiPhone 17 Air‚Äô model Several analysts have reported that the existing Plus model will be replaced by a new ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù model with a larger screen size and a much thinner body. Analyst Jeff Pu was the first to report this change (in May 2024), and in the same month, The Information reported on the Slim model, stating that it would be a new even-higher-end model that sits above ‚ÄúPro Max‚Äù in the lineup and would have a centered rear camera and a smaller Dynamic Island. The much slimmer size will come at the expense of battery capacity, as there just isn‚Äôt room for a battery as thick as you find in other iPhones. Leaker yeux1122 has said the battery capacity is to be around 2,800mAh, which is more than 20% less than the battery in any iPhone 16 model. A report by Mark Gurman of Bloomberg in August 2024 claimed the new model will fit between the standard iPhone and the Pro: ‚Äù¬†If you want something snazzier than a standard iPhone‚Äìbut don‚Äôt really need the performance, screen size, or cameras of a Pro model‚Äìyou can get something that looks much cooler while still having the specifications of a regular iPhone.‚Äù A report from Jeff Pu in November 2024 claims that the iPhone 17 Air/Slim will be around 6mm thick. That‚Äôs thinner than any iPhone so far. The iPhone 16, for context, is 7.8mm thick. The thinnest new iPad Pro is 5.1mm thick. In May, yuex1122 said the phone will be only 5.5mm thick (aside from the camera bump) and weigh just 145 grams, which is According to Korea‚Äôs Sisa Journal in January 2025, the so-called iPhone 17 Air will be 6.25mm thick and cost in the same price range as the iPhone 16 Plus (starting at $899 U.S.). A medium post from analyst Ming-Chi Kuo stated that the ‚Äúthinnest part‚Äù of the new ultra-slim iPhone is just 5.5mm thick, but it‚Äôs difficult to know what that means without more context. The camera bump, according to Weibo leaker Ice Universe, will be 4.0mm thick, bringing the total phone thickness to 9.5mm at the camera. In October 2024 Pu said he expects the phone to have an A19 chip (not A19 Pro), 8GB of RAM, around a 6.6-inch display, an aluminum body, and a single 48MP rear camera. A leaked image in January reportedly showed the case of the new iPhone 17 Air, with a prominent ‚Äúcamera bar‚Äù design. Majin Bu/X Most recently, an episode of the YouTube channel Unboxed Therapy featured a ‚Äúdummy model‚Äù version of the phone from a third-party supplier. It‚Äôs our best look yet at the overall size and thin design. iPhone 17: Cameras All iPhone 17 models have been rumored to feature a 24MP front-facing camera. An October 2024 research note from analyst Jeff Pu added that the iPhone 17 Pro would feature a 48MP telephoto camera along with a new 24MP front camera. According to a later report from Majin Bu, the 48MP telephoto camera will have a zoom of 3.5x (85mm), with an optical ‚Äúcrop zoom‚Äù mode similar to today‚Äôs 48MP wide camera, so you can shoot 12MP 7x (160mm) shots before the digital zoom kicks in. A report from The Information in July 2024 claims that ‚Äúat least one‚Äù model will feature a mechanical aperture, which would be new for iPhones but has been seen in a handful of Android phones so far. Some iPhone 17 models (maybe even all of them) will have a new camera bump, a wide rectangular raised area that stretches across the phone similar in style to Google‚Äôs Pixel line. According to a leaked image of one iPhone 17 aluminum frame (we don‚Äôt know from which model), it will be substantial in size. The Pro models are expected to have a ‚Äúcamera bar‚Äù design like the iPhone 17 Air, only larger and with three cameras in the familiar array. According to leaker Jon Prosser, it should look something like this: Front Page Tech / @Zellozi Months later, Mark Gurman clarified in his newsletter that the camera bump won‚Äôt have a dark interior, but rather the entire area will match the color of the phone. In February 2025, veteran leaker Majin Bu leaked iPhone 17 CAD images that seemed to reveal three different camera designs. The images suggest that there will be not one or two but three different camera module designs on show. The two Pro models will have triple rear lenses embedded in a thick band that runs across the back of the phone, as predicted by Jon Prosser (above). The standard iPhone 17 will stick feature two lenses stacked vertically. And the rumored iPhone 17 Air will offer an iPhone 16e-like single camera lens on the rear in order to reduce costs and keep the chassis slim and light. Sonny Dickson A video posted by Majin Bu in June showed off the iPhone 17 Pro Max, including the new camera array that stretches across the back of the phone. iPhone 17: Rumored specs and features Various rumors suggest that the new iPhones could benefit from the following updates: Design and display The always-on display is supposed to finally be available on the non-Pro models. In addition, some believe that ProMotion will come to the non-Pro models, since the same LPTO technology that enables the always-on display is what makes ProMotion possible, in Apple‚Äôs iPhone implementation. If true, it would be the first time Apple has offered ProMotion on a non-Pro device. Apple is also said to be working with Corning on a new anti-glare and scratch-resistant glass for the iPhone 17 lineup. However, a report in May claimed that Apple had scrapped the new glass due to production issues. Dynamic Island The iPhone 17 Pro Max may have a smaller dynamic island. Rumors have changed back and forth‚ÄîJeff Pu said the dynamic island (or rather, the hardware ‚Äúpill‚Äù that the island surrounds) will be smaller in the iPhone 17 Pro Max. Then Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said it will be the same size as current models. Then leaker Digital Chat Station on Weibo said it will indeed be smaller. Processor We don‚Äôt know much about what chips will power the iPhone 17 line, but we expect the high-end models will get an A19 Pro, while the non-Pro models may get a standard or cut-back version of the A19, or perhaps a more souped up variant of the A18. Charging In June, 91mobiles spotted a new MagSafe charger compliant with the Q1 2.2 standard. That could mean that the iPhone 17 will support 50W charging over MagSafe, a massive boost over the current 25W capabilities in the iPhone 16. RAM Since Apple bumped every iPhone 16 model to 8GB of RAM due to the demands of Apple Intelligence, rumors have suggested Apple will increase the memory in the iPhone 17 Pro models to 12GB. In a report concerning RAM suppliers, Ming-Chi Kuo says that Apple wants the regular iPhone 17 to feature 12GB as well, but supply shortages may be an issue. Wi-Fi When it comes to wireless, the cellular modem is likely to still be supplied by Qualcomm; Apple‚Äôs own efforts to produce a top-tier 5G modem seem to be stalled and likely won‚Äôt be ready in time for next year‚Äôs iPhone 17 line. Wi-Fi 7 support seems likely, too. iPhone history The iPhone 16 range and the iPhone 16e are the current-generation models available from Apple.

It has enough juice to charge a MacBook Air, iPad, or iPhone, so you won‚Äôt have a need to carry anything else.

    "description": "Ten years ago, Apple‚Äôs Phil Schiller surprised Apple enthusiasts and developers by walking out on stage at John Gruber‚Äôs The Talk Show Live WWDC event and giving an open, human, honest interview to a somewhat jaded community. I wrote this in response: Both Apple and Phil Schiller himself took a huge risk in doing this. That they agreed at all is a noteworthy gift to this community of long-time enthusiasts, many of whom have felt under-appreciated as the company has grown. [‚Ä¶] Phil‚Äôs appearance on the show was warm, genuine, informative, and entertaining. It was human. And humanizing the company and its decisions, especially to developers ‚Äî remember, developer relations is all under Phil ‚Äî might be worth the PR risk. This started a ten-year run of interviews by Apple executives on The Talk Show every year at WWDC that proved to be great, surprisingly safe PR for Apple. No executive ever said something they shouldn‚Äôt have (they‚Äôre pros), no sensational or negative news stories ever resulted from them, and Apple‚Äôs enthusiastic fans and developers felt seen, heard, and appreciated. *¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†*¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†* For unspecified reasons, Apple has declined to participate this year, ending what had become a beloved tradition in our community ‚Äî and I can‚Äôt help but suspect that it won‚Äôt come back. (A lot has changed in the meantime.) Maybe Apple has good reasons. Maybe not. We‚Äôll see what their WWDC PR strategy looks like in a couple of weeks. In the absence of any other information, it‚Äôs easy to assume that Apple no longer wants its executives to be interviewed in a human, unscripted, unedited context that may contain hard questions, and that Apple no longer feels it necessary to show their appreciation to our community and developers in this way. I hope that‚Äôs either not the case, or it doesn‚Äôt stay the case for long. This will be the first WWDC I‚Äôm not attending since 2009 (excluding the remote 2020 one, of course). Given my realizations about my relationship with Apple and how they view developers, I‚Äôve decided that it‚Äôs best for me to take a break this year, gain some perspective, and decide what my future relationship should look like. Maybe Apple‚Äôs leaders are doing that, too.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I‚Äôm happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade ‚Äî and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What‚Äôs new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today‚Äôs phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What‚Äôs not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It‚Äôs the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I‚Äôm still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I‚Äôll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What‚Äôs gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today‚Äôs fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I‚Äôll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don‚Äôt automatically download every episode. What‚Äôs next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast‚Äôs core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That‚Äôs why there haven‚Äôt been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn‚Äôt able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I‚Äôve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I‚Äôm more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here‚Äôs to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content.¬†‚Ü©Ô∏é",
