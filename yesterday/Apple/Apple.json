    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2558637/ios-18-3-release-date-beta-features-and-compatibility.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple best test of iOS 18.3 began less than a week after the release of iOS 18.2. It’s not yet clear when we can expect this release to into wide release or what features to expect in it, but it will surely be the first major iOS update of 2025. Apple Intelligence has been the focus of most iOS 18 updates so far, and we’re still waiting on the big Siri overhaul that adds personal context using the data on your phone and scores of new “app intents” that allow Siri to perform actions in apps. Those features are generally expected to come in iOS 18.4, which most believe will be released in March or April. If true, then iOS 18.3 would focus mainly on tweaks and improvements to existing features and will pause the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence features. Update January 7: Apple has released the second beta of iOS 18.3 to developers. iOS 18.3: New features Robot Vacuum support: The Home app gains support for robot vacuums (Roomba et al.). The vacuum has to support HomeKit or Matter, of course. Calculator repeating operations: The calculator app once again allows for repeating operations when you keep pressing the equals button. iOS 18.3: How to install the developer beta You’ll need to be registered as an Apple developer. You don’t need to be in the $99 per year developer program to access the developer beta. A free developer account will do. You can get one via Xcode or the Apple Developer app in iOS. Here’s how to do it via the Apple Developer app: Download the Apple Developer App from the App Store. Open the app. Tap on Account. Sign in using your usual Apple ID. Registered developers can choose to get the Public Beta instead by selecting iOS Public Beta in the Software Update screen. It may take a little time after registering as a developer for the option to appear in Software Updates. iOS 18.3: How to install the public beta The public beta isn’t out yet, but we expect it will arrive in a few short days. If you want to be among the first to test iOS 18.3, you can sign up for the public beta test. The process for installing a beta has changed in iOS 16.4. Here’s how the new process works now: Click Sign Up on the Apple Beta page and register with your Apple ID. Log in to the Beta Software Program. Click Enroll your iOS device. Open the Settings app, tap General, then Software Update. In the Beta Updates section, select the iOS Public Beta. It may take a few moments after registering for the beta option to appear in Software Update.",

    "title": "Apple Back to School 2025: When and what is Apple’s back to uni deal?",
    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/673191/apple-back-school-sale.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple holds a Back to School promotion every year (now known as the Higher Education Offer to avoid confusion because it’s only open to students once they enter higher education, and the institutions and teachers, not school-age children). As part of the deal, Apple offers an incentive with purchases of qualifying Apple products. Apple’s ‘Back to School’ deal runs in various locations around the world during the summer months. The deal usually ends about a month after the first university semester/term begins in that country. The offer is currently running in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and South Korea (it went live on 8 January in that region). It will run until March 13, 2025. See the Terms and Conditions. Australian and New Zealand students can get AirPods 4 with ANC or Apple Pencil’s for free when they purchase certain Macs or iPads (more information below). This is different to 2024 when Apple gave away gift cards in Australia and New Zealand. The deal is the same for students in Brazil who can also claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2025. However, this is the same offer as those students had in 2024. Does it follow therefore that U.S., Canada and U.K students will also get free AirPods and Apple Pencils in the summer of 2025? AirPods were Apple’s student giveaway of choice a few years ago, but in recent times Apple has given away gift cards in those locations. However, in Europe and India, customers got money off the purchase of AirPods in 2024, so we could be moving back to the incentive of free AirPods and Apple Pencil (both of which are popular with students). Apple Higher Education Offer won’t start in the U.S., U.K., Europe and Canada until later in 2025. In 2024 it kicked off in the U.S., Canada and India in June 2024 and in early July in the U.K. and Europe. Read on to find out when Apple’s Higher Education giveaway will start where you live and what the deal is likely to include. We also explain who qualifies and how to take advantage of Apple’s education deal. What is Apple’s Back To School offer? January-March 2025: AirPods or Apple Pencil in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil and other southern hemisphere locations. June-October 2025: To be confirmed. Previously Apple Gift Cards in U.S., U.K, Canada. AirPods in Europe and India. For a long time, Apple gave away a pair of AirPods with qualifying sales of certain Macs and iPads as part of its education promotion, but in 2022 Apple stopped giving away AirPods in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Australia. Instead, Apple offered gift cards with qualifying purchases during the promotional period. Students could get different gift card denominations depending on the products purchased. Not all Apple products are included in the offer. Apple also offers gift cards during its Black Friday shopping event. With Apple switching back to AirPods in the Australian Back to Uni deal for 2025 it is possible that the company will revert back to AirPods later in 2025 when the same promotion is run in the U.S., U.K. and other northern hemisphere locations. Apple doesn’t offer the same deal everywhere though. In parts of Europe and India, for the summer of 2024, the promotion allows shoppers to get discounted AirPods or Apple Pencil with qualifying purchases. There was a similar deal in January 2024 where those based in Brazil could claim free AirPods with a Mac or free Apple Pencil with their iPad purchase in January-March 2024. So Apple has a precedent of offering gift cards to some countries and AirPods and Pencils in others. This isn’t the only education-related saving Apple offers. Apple doesn’t only offer education-related deals during the summer months. All products sold to students via Apple’s Education Store include a discount all year round, so you can always make a saving on Apple products, as long as you qualify. The summertime education-focused deal is in addition to these year-long discounts Apple offers to students and education institutions. We explain everything you need to know about getting a discount, including how much you can save as a student and how to use Apple’s Education Store, in our Guide to shopping in the Apple Education Store. We also have advice about the Best Mac for Students and the Best iPad for Students. You may also like to read our Apple student buying guide.

Spanish details here. Italian details here. In the Netherlands Apple gave away gift cards. Details here. India In 2024 in India the Back to University deal was the same as in Europe: AirPods or Apple Pencil discounts. We expect similar in 2025. Buy an iMac, MacBook Pro, or MacBook Air and get ₹19900 off AirPods 3rd gen, AirPods Pro or AirPods Max. Buy a Mac mini and get ₹12900 off AirPods 2nd gen, AirPods 3rd gen, AirPods Pro or AirPods Max. Buy an 11-inch or 13-inch M4 iPad Pro or an 11-inch or 13-inch M2 iPad Air and get ₹11900 off an Apple Pencil Pro or ₹7900 off an Apple Pencil USB-C. Details here. Which products are part of Apple’s Education offer? Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in January 2025 include: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac, iPad Pro and iPad Air. Qualifying products may differ depending on whether Apple has recently updated them. For example, over Black Friday Apple offers gift cards with select purchases, but its newest products are always left out of the deal. Hence, if Apple has just updated the iPad or Mac you want to buy you may not be able to get the vouchers or other gift alongside your purchase. Qualifying purchases for Apple’s deal in 2024 included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 11- and 13‑inch, iPad Air 11‑ and 13-inch. (In Australia in early 2024 the iPad 10th generation was included, but this wasn’t the case later in 2024). In summer 2023 qualifying purchases included: iMac 24‑inch, MacBook Pro, MacBook Air, Mac mini, iPad Pro 12.9‑inch, iPad Pro 11‑inch, and iPad Air. Students can also take advantage of a reduced subscription to Apple Music with which they get access to Apple TV+ when they buy an Apple product. Read: How to get the student deal for Apple Music and free Apple TV+. How to get Apple’s Back To School deal As long as you are based in an area where Apple is running the deal at the time of your purchase, and are a student in higher education, or about to start higher education, you can qualify for Apple’s Higher Education deal and get gift cards with your purchase. There are more details about who the deal applies to below. Note that if you qualify you are able to get discounts all year round by shopping in the Apple Education Store, so you don’t need to shop during the Back to Uni deal period to get a bargain. You can also get discounts on other products not included in the offer (although there is no education discount for the iPhone). In the U.S. you need to visit Apple’s U.S. Education Store, but logging on from your university network may make the process easier.  In the U.K. you can visit the U.K. Education Store, but you will also need to verify your student or staff status with UNiDAYS. Go to the Apple Education Store for other regions using the links below: Canada Australia New Zealand Brazil South Korea India France Germany When you make your purchase you will be able to request the Apple Gift Card or discount depending on your location. Who can get Apple’s Back to School deal? If you are registered at a higher education facility (that’s post-K12 education: universities and colleges) you will qualify for the free AirPods deal as well as Apple’s usual education discount. Employees of these institutions can also qualify. If you are a parent buying for your student offspring then you can also qualify. Here are Apple’s Ts\u0026Cs for the U.S. Alternatively, if you are an employee of a public or private K-12 institution/school in the U.S. or Canada you are also eligible. Apple’s Education pricing isn’t available to parents with kids at school, but a homeschool teacher can qualify. Even when Apple isn’t running the Back to School Deal students and education institutions can still take advantage of its standard educational pricing on its Educational Pricing page (U.S. here / U.K. here). How much can you save with Apple’s education pricing? Students can save up to $200/£220 on Macs and up to $100/£100 on iPads at any time of the year. More here: How to get an Apple student discount at Apple’s Education Store. Which iPads are included in Apple’s Back to School deal? You can get discounted Educational Pricing on all iPads if you qualify, you just won’t be able to get the freebie unless it is one of the models mentioned below. We anticipate that if Apple updates the 10th gen iPad just before June/July it won’t be included in the deal for northern hemisphere locations. January 2025: Australia/New Zealand/Brazil, etc M4 iPad Pro M4 iPad Air The 10th gen iPad could be a good partner to have at university. Macwelt/Apple/Amazon June/July 2024: U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, India, etc. M4 iPad Pro M4 iPad Air It’s notable that Apple didn’t include the cheaper iPad 10th gen in the 2024 deal (although it did in Australia earlier that year). The iPad mini was also omitted. If you don’t qualify for the education pricing we have a separate guide on where to get the best deals on the iPad. For advice about which iPad to buy read: Which iPad is best for students. Which Macs are included in Apple’s Back to School deal? Not every Apple product you can buy in the Education Store is included in the promotion. Apple doesn’t usually offer incentives to buy the newest Apple products. So, if Apple updates the MacBook Air to an M4 just before the deal starts in June/July 2025 we don’t expect that the MacBook Air will be included. You can take advantage of education pricing for all Macs all year round. January 2025: Australia/New Zealand/Brazil, etc M3 MacBook Air M4 MacBook Pro M4 iMac A MacBook Air is a good choice for students. Foundry June/July 2024: U.S., Canada, U.K., Europe, India, etc. M3 MacBook Air M3 MacBook Pro M3 iMac M2 Mac mini If you don’t qualify for an education discount have a look at these round-ups of the best deals on a new Mac: Best MacBook Pro deals MacBook Air deals Mac mini deals Best iMac deals Best Mac Studio deals We also have this advice about which Mac is best for students.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
