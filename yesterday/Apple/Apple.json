    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "description": "Macworld If you’re looking for a deal on anything Apple sells—an iPad, Apple Watch, AirPods, MacBook, iPhone or anything else—there’s no better time to get one than Black Friday. No matter what you’re looking to buy, you’re going to find a great price—and some are at the lowest we’ve ever seen. The sales start earlier every year, but the best deals are usually seen between Black Friday (November 29) and Cyber Monday (December 2). However, as we head into Black Friday week, we’re already seeing fantastic deals, so you might not want to wait. We’ll be updating this page regularly as more discounts come in. If you want to know what Apple is doing for Black Friday, it’s offering gift cards up to $200/£160 with select purchases. We have the details of that deal and what’s included in our Apple’s 2024 Black Friday Shopping Event article. Apple Black Friday 2024 deals: The best deals on every Apple product Black Friday is a great time to get an Apple product for less, but the discounts come and go very quickly. Stay tuned to this page up to and throughout the Black Friday weekend as we update you with the best prices on new Apple products as they arrive. Many of the best deals we see are on Amazon U.S. or Amazon U.K., but we’ll also be checking resellers such as Best Buy, B\u0026H and Walmart in the U.S. and KRCS, AO, Argos, John Lewis, Currys, Laptops Direct and eBuyer in the U.K. MacBook Air and MacBook Pro deals for Black Friday 2024 Apple released new MacBook Pros with M4 chips in late October 2024. At the same time, it upgraded the RAM in all MacBook Air models from 8GB to 16GB for the same starting prices, effectively a $200/£200 discount. So if you’re shopping make sure the model you’re buying has 16GB of RAM. We don’t recommend buying a model with 8GB of RAM unless it’s much more than $200/£200 cheaper than the 16GB model.

Like the MacBooks, these new Macs now start at 16GB of RAM, an option that was previously an extra $200/£200. So be sure to double-check that you’re buying the updated model with an M4 processor. Older iMacs only offer 8GB of RAM, so the price should match that.

Apple also updated the AirPods Max with a USB-C port in September, but otherwise, it’s the same as the Lightning model. And while the AirPods Pro 2 are a couple of years old, Apple added a new feature in iOS 18,1 that lets it work as a hearing aid. We usually see some tremendous savings on the standard AirPods over Black Friday, but this year beware: you may see a blowout deal on the older models, but unless you’re on a very tight budget, our advice is that even if you see a good deal on the AirPods 3 you should spring for one of the AirPods 4 models on sale even if they cost more. The AirPods 4 without ANC cost $129/£129 and compare very favorably with the AirPods 3 which used to cost $179/£179. AirPods 4 are Apple’s newest earbuds and are already on sale.Petter Ahrnstedt U.S. Amazon, AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C case): $154 ($95 off, MSRP $249) Amazon, AirPods 4: $119 ($10 off, MSRP $129) Amazon, AirPods 4 with ANC: $169 ($10 off, MSRP $179) Amazon, AirPods Max (USB-C): $500 ($49 off, MSRP $549) Amazon, AirPods Max (Lightning): $399 ($150 off; MSRP $549) U.K. Amazon, AirPods (4th gen, 2024, with ANC): £169 (£10 off, RRP £179) Amazon, AirPods (4th gen, 2024, without ANC): £119 (£10 off, RRP £129) Amazon, AirPods Pro 2: £179 (£50 off, RRP £179) There are also savings on older models, but as we mentioned above, we recommend skipping any AirPods 3rd gen deals because the AirPods 4 are much better. Argos, AirPods (3rd gen, Magsafe): £139 (£40 off, RRP was £179 – Clearance) Argos, AirPod Max, Lightning, 2020: £429 (£70 off, RRP was £499 – Clearance) Apple Watch deals for Black Friday 2024 Grab yourself an Apple Watch deal for Black Friday.Mike Sawh Apple launched the Apple Watch Series 10 with a slightly larger screen in September 2024 as well as a new black color for the Apple Watch Ultra.

    "description": "Macworld iPhone data recovery apps are the kind of tool you hope you never need, but you’ll certainly be glad to find one when it’s needed. iPhones have become more and more advanced, with new cameras and more storage meaning they’re chock full of precious memories and moments. They’ve also become more durable, with water and dust resistance and toughened, ‘Ceramic Shield’ glass, but they’re not indestructible. If you’ve ever dropped your phone, or plugged it in for a simple restore process and found that your backups are corrupted, you’ll want to reach for the best iPhone data recovery software. We’ve rounded up our picks of the best options available right now, but as with all things data recovery, there’s never any absolute certainty that your files can be restored. With that in mind, we’d recommend ensuring you have an iCloud backup where possible, and maybe one on your computer, too. See: How to back up your iPhone. PROMOTIONBlack Friday Special: 50% Off EaseUS MobiSaver EaseUS MobiSaver could be your lifesaver as it recovers iPhone data from iOS devices, iTunes, and iCloud in simple 3 steps. Any type of files are supported to be restored like photos, videos, contacts, messages, notes, calendars, Voicemail, Safari bookmark, voice memos, call history, WhatsApp, Viber, Kik, LINE, apps’ data \u0026 attachments. Now 25% OFF Exclusive Code: CRAZYBF Shop and Save 50% What to look for when choosing a data recovery app As you’ll see, data recovery software tends to be expensive: it can afford to be because the people who need it are often desperate. However, before you spend lots of money have a look to see if a free trial is available, at least then you can establish if anything can be recovered before spending your money. Just note that the free trial is likely to be missing key features and very unlikely to recover anything for you without demanding payment. Our sense is also, unfortunately, that this is a market with a high percentage of scams. The reason we’ve only included six products below is that all the others we tried seemed, well, a bit dodgy. And many of the dodgier denizens of this market are fond of inserting themselves into comment threads and forum posts, so be careful about using software you’ve heard about unless you’ve had a recommendation from a) someone who has actually tried it and b) definitely isn’t a fake bot account. We also have a Mac data recovery apps article. If you are looking for a way to recover deleted text messages read: How to get back deleted text messages on your iPhone. Best iPhone recovery apps Note: These are Mac apps that can uncover lost files on your iPhone (and other places), not apps that run on the iPhone. Dr. Fone Pros A la carte pricing Simple interface Platform agnostic Cons Pricey with all features included Pop-ups make it feel cheap Crashes Price When Reviewed: Data Recovery from $59.95 per year (usually $68.95); Full Toolkit $99.95 a year (usually $139.95); Perpetual license $115.95 (usually $162.95). Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Wondershare Dr. Fone from Wondershare is a comprehensive data recovery app that offers a wide range of features, including the ability to remove Apple ID and locks, spoof GPS location for games like Pokemon Go, transfer WhatsApp data to other devices, copy data to a new phone, erase data, or recover passwords. The interface is simple but impressive, with app icons on the sidebar for easy navigation. The “Toolbox” menu provides options to remove Apple ID and locks, spoof GPS location for games like Pokemon Go, and transfer WhatsApp data to other devices. However, users must plug their phone in, unlock it, and ensure their computer is trustworthy before performing any actions. Dr. Fone is effective at recovering deleted files and data. In our trials it was able to recover WhatsApp images from chats dating back years.  The package is currently available for $99.95/£78.86 a year or $115.95/£91.48 on the perpetual plan, with tax added at the point of sale and a 24-month warranty. However, users can save money by purchasing data recovery access for $59.95/£47.30 per year or $69.95/£55.19 as a one-off fee, which works for up to five devices. Dr. Fone is an impressive software with an array of extras that may not be needed. It is an all-in-one toolbox that is impressive and expensive, but its value lies in the individual features it offers. While the app may not be perfect for every user, it is a valuable tool for those looking to recover lost files or deleted photos. Read our full Dr. Fone review EaseUS MobiSaver Pros Impressively stable Mac app Great recovery potential The free option could be ideal Cons Expensive Price When Reviewed: $59.95 per month; $79.95 per year; $99.95 lifetime membership Best Prices Today: $59.95 at Easeus (monthly) EaseUS Mobisaver is a recovery tool that can recover contacts, media, app history, and more, even when using backups rather than the actual device. It is used in repair shops worldwide (the Windows version is cheaper, of course). The app comes in at $59.95/£55.70 per month or $79.95/£74.29 per year, while a lifetime membership is $99.95/£92.87. EaseUS Mobisaver has a unique look and feel, with a bluish/purple hue and slick animations while it’s scanning data. It took around 35 minutes to scan a phone, which was faster than expected.  Mobisaver can recover a wide range of content types, from messages, WhatsApp, Safari Bookmarks, deleted Reminders, or Calendar appointments. The Free version allows for a smaller number of items to be recovered at once, while the Professional version removes these limits. Both versions can also recover data from iTunes or iCloud backups. However, if you need to quickly recover something, you will need to be prepared for a long wait. In our tests, EaseUS Mobisaver finished its initial scan, then took more time to scan and showed 100% completion while still running, making it difficult to predict its duration.  Despite its price and slow performance, EaseUS Mobisaver is a great recovery app tailored more to businesses than everyday consumers. Read our full EaseUS MobiSaver for Mac review Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone Pros Affordable for most users Reliable recovery Cons Looks dated Price When Reviewed: $59.99 (price cut to $39.99) Best Prices Today: $39.99 at Stellar Info Stellar Data Recovery is a user-friendly iPhone data recovery tool that offers plenty of recovery potential though, including a user-friendly price tag. The app is regularly on sale for $39.99/£39.99 a year, with additional features geared towards enterprise device management included in its Toolkit options. With a license that allows users to use Stellar with a trio of iPhones, users can pay $40/£40 for a year and have their entire family covered. Stellar has been in the recovery game for years, but compared to alternatives it has a dated-looking interface. The app’s gray color makes it feel like an app from a decade ago, but it does provide a nice scanning animation as it digs through your phone’s data. The app is faster than some options we’ve tested, thanks to a basic scan that can find some data, acting as a sort of ‘triage’. After that, a Deep Scan is needed to find further data, which can be slower. The app is lightweight and reliable, even on iOS 18.1 beta devices. It performs well with WhatsApp attachments, deleted contacts, and Notes, but you need to pay to recover anything other than Safari Bookmarks. Stellar also recovers from iTunes and iCloud backups, so if your device is dearly departed, your data may not be. Although the aesthetics may be a small pain point for some users, Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone offers an impressive suite of recovery options at a solid price point. Read our full Stellar Data Recovery for iPhone review Disk Drill Pro Pros Slick UI Very thorough recovery Free option may suffice for many Cons Pro version is expensive Price When Reviewed: Basic: Free; Pro: $89; Enterprise: $499 (pay extra for lifetime upgrades) Best Prices Today: $89 at CleverFiles Disk Drill from CleverFiles is a user-friendly app that prioritizes data recovery, allowing users to quickly sift through deleted files within minutes of installation. The free plan is suitable for those recovering under 500MB of data, while the Pro version costs $89/£70.56 with an additional option to add future updates for around $15/£15. Enterprise users can purchase a bundle of user licenses. Disk Drill offers additional features beyond data recovery, such as identifying duplicate files, detecting data hoarding, and backing up files to prevent accidental deletion. Its sidebar displays all potential drive locations for recovery, including local, NAS, RAIDs, and other devices. It even factors in Time Machine data for quick data access. In testing, Disk Drill was able to recover a large number of old WhatsApp messages and contact information from an iPhone, although it took around an hour to scan. It also has a duplicate finder that runs on local storage and cloud-based options like Dropbox or Google Drive. Data Protection stores a copy of a deleted file for future reference. Disk Drill can create a backup macOS boot drive or a disk image of your entire hard drive, ideal for older Macs with mechanical drives that could fail. However, the only complaint with Disk Drill is its occasional issues when a phone locks itself, which may be a bug. While Disk Drill may be expensive for one-time users, it is a reliable safety net for regular data recovery from devices or for enterprise users. We also looked at Disk Drill Pro for Mac. Read our full Disk Drill Pro review FoneLab Pros Can also fix iOS errors. Can save to a number of file formats. Price When Reviewed: $69.95 (price cut to $55.96) Best Prices Today: $55.96 at FoneLab FoneLab is easy to use on macOS, offering a simple way to recover a whole host of data. Scanning is free across iOS, iTunes backups (if you’re still using those), and iCloud data, but recovery is limited to three instances on the free plan. FoneLab’s premium version ($70 for a lifetime license for 1 Mac and 6 mobile devices) will allow a user to recover data from any of the above. It also covers messaging services like Messenger and WhatsApp, as well as Viber, Kik, Line, and WeChat.  It’s perhaps not quite as full-featured as options like Disk Drill, but it is an affordable option that can cover a family’s devices for a relatively affordable fee. Once you boot up the Mac version of FoneLab for the first time, it is transparent about what you can gain from the premium version. You simply plug in your phone, enter your passcode, and hit ‘Scan’. Scanning is faster than some rivals, but analyzing that data takes a little longer.  It’s nice to look at, with a clear sidebar of filters and a main window that displays previews so you can pick what to recover. Within around 45 minutes I could see a whole host of images I thought were lost to time, including deleted product shots from old reviews and duplicate pet photos. It can restore from iCloud backups, too, which is handy if your device is lost or stolen. Rather than offer a multitude of features, FoneLab is focused on doing the recovery part well. The iOS System Recovery tool could be helpful if you’ve inadvertently bricked your phone, while the option to back up and restore your phone locally is handy, but also something offered by Apple’s own toolkit. WhatsApp transfer is useful for anyone fed up of the lengthy process of switching between phones and having to wait for your data from the messaging app to come with you.   This is a solid recovery option, while it lacks the bells and whistles you’ll find elsewhere, FoneLab is a relatively affordable option that feels ideal for families with multiple devices. Read our full FoneLab review FonePaw Pros Preview window so you can choose what you recover. Cons Can be a bit slow. Price When Reviewed: $66.47 per year Best Prices Today: $76.97 at FonePaw Another option with an easy-to-use interface, FonePaw offers a really great preview window that helps surface all of your content across photos, videos, notes, chat apps, and plenty more. That makes it easier to recover – pick what you need, and hit the button. It’s also a little cheaper than some options on this list for an annual license, but it’s still not cheap and there’s no recovery without paying. There is, however, a monthly payment option if you really just want to spend the absolute minimum to recover something. Some users have noted that it takes a long time to scan through a device, though. Also it’s practically a clone of FoneLab (above).

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
