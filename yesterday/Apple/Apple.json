    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2528856/airpods-pro-2-lowest-price-ever.html",
    "description": "Macworld There’s no question that AirPods Pro 2 are the best earbuds Apple makes, and they keep getting better with awesome new capabilities such as the Hearing Aid and Hearing Protection features added in iOS 18.1. They’re frequently on sale, and we always say they’re worth paying a little extra for if you can afford it. But the latest sale on Amazon’s U.S. store is so good you don’t really have a decision to make. It’s not uncommon to find these earbuds on sale for less than $200, but the AirPods Pro 2 (USB-C) are currently $154, which is the lowest price we’ve ever seen. They’re actually less expensive than the AirPods 4 with ANC right now and bring a ton of additional features, including the aforementioned hearing aid capabilities. Yes, the unquestionably superior product costs the same. While you’re grabbing this deal, you might want to pick up a set of Comply foam ear tips as well. They greatly improve the fit and comfort of AirPods Pro 2 and I never use mine without them. In our review of AirPods Pro 2, we praised the audio quality and features, with 2X noise cancellation and Precision Find My. And they’ve only gotten better since then with a steady stream of updates—and we suspect even more are on the way as Apple Intelligence continues to grow. So go grab a pair for this insanely low price and get yourself a pair of earbuds that keep on giving. Buy AirPods Pro 2 for $95 off at Amazon",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2533217/iphone-17-air-design-revealed-5-6mm-aluminum-case-single-camera-more.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple’s iPhone 17 lineup is widely expected to include a new iPhone with some radical new design goals. The most important of which is a thickness of 6mm or less, about 25 percent thinner than the iPhone 16. Most have taken to calling this phone the “iPhone 17 Air,” though analysts have referred to it as the iPhone 17 Slim. According to a new report in usually-reliable The Information that cites “multiple sources,” Apple is going to have to make a few compromises in order to meet its goals of producing the thinnest iPhone of all time. At less than 6mm, it will be even thinner than the iPhone 6, which currently holds the iPhone thinness record at 6.9mm. First, it will be made of aluminum rather than titanium/steel. In fact, the entire iPhone 17 lineup is said to be switching to aluminum frames and bodies, rather than steel frames and aluminum. Frankly, it’s a good move—the advantages of titanium are overblown for an iPhone, and most iPhone 15 Pro or 16 Pro owners wouldn’t even realize it was titanium if they weren’t told. The iPhone 17 Air will only have one speaker, in the earpiece, because there won’t be room for another one on the bottom. It will use Apple’s own 5G modem, which is apparently “slightly less reliable” than Qualcomm’s latest modem and doesn’t support high-speed mmWave. It will have only a single rear camera, housed in a “large, centered camera bump.” So far, they haven’t been able to fit a SIM tray in the device, which means it could be eSIM-only, which would prohibit sales in China. Apple seems to be willing to make significant compromises to slim down this particular iPhone 17 variant. For those who want a more full-featured iPhone with a little more heft to it, there will still be the standard iPhone 17 and the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max to choose from. Speaking of the iPhone 17 Pro, the Information’s report also claims the Pro models will switch to a part-aluminum, part-glass design, with the top half made of aluminum and the bottom made of glass. The phones will also reportedly feature a “rectangular camera bump made of aluminum” as opposed to the square glass bump on the last several iPhones. The whole thing sounds similar to the Google Pixel, which originally had a half-glass, half-aluminum design but has adopted a unique “camera bar” design in recent years.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
