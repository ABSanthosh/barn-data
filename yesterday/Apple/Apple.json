A class action lawsuit sprung up hoping to reimburse consumers for allegedly paying more money for Apple products thanks to this price fixing \"scheme.\"As always, these lawsuits take time, and led to Apple and Amazon issuing a discovery order against the plaintiff in September 2023. According to a report from Reuters, the law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro failed to disclose that the plaintiff didn't want to go through the discovery process and wanted out of the suit.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air. In this guide we track the steepest discounts for the newest MacBook models every week, so be sure to bookmark it and check back often if you're shopping for a new Apple notebook.Related Roundup: Apple DealsThis article, \"Deals: Get the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99 ($19 Off) and 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99 ($149 Off)\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

    "description": "Macworld Are you ready for it? And by “it,” we mean the very first discount for the fantastic Beats Powerbeats Pro 2. These buds only launched a few months ago, and this is the first time they’ve gone on sale. It’s not some measly discount either, but an absolutely amazing $50 off, taking the Powerbeats down from $250 to a shade under $200. How do we know they’re fantastic? Well, we reviewed them and gave them a four-star rating and our Editors’ Choice award. We found these earbuds to be light and small with a secure fit on your ear, delivering fantastic sound and impressive battery life. “These are now our hands-down favorite earbuds for exercising and athletics,” the review reads—even better than AirPods Pro. These are the perfect earbuds for exercising because the built-in earhooks mean you won’t worry about them falling off. Plus active noise cancelling will help you focus completely on the task at hand, while transparency mode will keep you safe while jogging on busy roads. Best of all, these buds come with a heart-rate monitor on board that will send your bpm to your iPhone. This is an impressive pair of earbuds even at full price. But this $50 discount to bring the price under $200 at Amazon makes them a must-buy, so go grab this deal while you still can.

    "description": "Macworld At a glanceExpert's Rating Pros USB4 provides good performance Competitive price Rugged design for outdoor use Cons Lacks full Thunderbolt support Larger than many portable drives Our Verdict The Extreme Pro With USB4 isn’t the fastest SSD around, but it’s more than fast enough for most non-professional users, and a lot more affordable than high-end Thunderbolt drives. It’s sturdily built too, making it a good choice for outdoor use and bad weather. Price When Reviewed This value will show the geolocated pricing text for product undefined Best Pricing Today Price When Reviewed$280 for 2TB, $430 for 4TB Best Prices Today: SanDisk Extreme Pro SSD with USB4 Retailer Price Sandisk $279.99 View Deal $429.99 View Deal $429.99 View Deal Price comparison from over 24,000 stores worldwide Product Price Price comparison from Backmarket About 10 years ago, SanDisk was taken over by Western Digital, but the two companies recently decided to part company again, with SanDisk focusing on solid-state drives and memory products while WD sticks with its traditional range of hard drives. And, to celebrate its independence, SanDisk has been launching a flurry of new products in recent months, particularly focusing on portable storage and backup. We recently reviewed its Extreme Portable SSD, which was an affordable entry-level drive that used a USB-C interface with support for USB 3.2 (Gen 2). That was followed by the Extreme Pro Portable SSD, which stepped up to the faster USB 3.2 (Gen 2×2). However, Macs don’t support USB 3.2 (Gen 2×2) so that wasn’t necessarily a good option for Mac users. SanDisk wasn’t finished, though, as it has just released yet another portable drive called the Extreme Pro With USB4, which – you guessed it – now adopts the even faster USB4. And yes, USB standards are a confusing mess these days, so you do need to pay close attention to the technical specifications when buying drives from SanDisk or any other manufacturer. Read: Thunderbolt 5 vs Thunderbolt 4 and 3 vs USB4 for more about the different standards. As you might expect, the Extreme Pro With USB4 is faster than its predecessors – in fact, USB4 is actually based on Thunderbolt 4 and SanDisk even recommends using the drive with a Mac or PC that has Thunderbolt 4 in order to get the best performance, which makes it a good option for Mac users who need a fast, portable backup drive. Available with either 2TB or 4TB of storage, the Extreme Pro With USB4 looks very similar to its predecessors, with the same rounded corners, orange trim and a handy cut-out section in one corner that can be used with a lanyard to attach it to a belt or backpack when you’re travelling. There’s a USB-C cable included in the box, but there’s no lanyard so you’ll need to provide that for yourself. However, closer inspection reveals that the Extreme Pro With USB4 is quite a bit larger than other SanDisk drives that we’ve tested in the past, measuring 11.9mm thick, 58.7mm wide, and 140mm long. It’s almost as large as the iPhone 16e – and, at 172g, it’s actually heavier than the 16e – but it’s still small enough to slip into a pocket or bag, and its sturdy design makes it a good option for travelling and for people who need to work outdoors. The main body of the drive is made out of forged aluminium, which is then wrapped in a silicon sleeve for added protection. SanDisk says that it can survive being dropped from a height of 2m, and it’s rated IP65 for water and dust resistance (which means that it can survive heavy rain, but not total immersion in water). And, to back it up, SanDisk provides a five-year warranty as well. But, of course, the main attraction is the use of USB4 to provide high performance for storing your important files and Time Machine backups. SanDisk quotes a maximum write performance for the Extreme Pro With USB4 of up to 3700MB/s, and read performance up to 3800MB/s although, as mentioned earlier, it does recommend using the drive with a Mac or PC that has Thunderbolt 4 for best results. That’s perfect for Mac users of course, and when we tested the drive with the BlackMagic Disk Speed Test using a MacBook Pro with Thunderbolt 4 we got very strong performance of 3400MB/s for both read and write performance. And, just out of curiosity, we also tested the drive with an M4 Mac mini that has Thunderbolt 5, and were surprised to see that the write performance jumped quite drastically to 4400MB/s. That write performance stayed consistent even after several repeated tests with BlackMagic, although the drive’s read performance with the Mac mini was unchanged at 3400MB/s. Should You Buy The Extreme Pro With USB4? Professional users who need top performance for working with large video or graphics files might prefer to pay more for a solid-state drive with full support for Thunderbolt. However, the Extreme Pro With USB4 is far more affordable than most Thunderbolt drives and still provides impressive performance that will be more than adequate for most people who just need a fast, sturdy portable drive for their Time Machine backups.

    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
