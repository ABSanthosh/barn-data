    "description": "Macworld From its introduction in iOS 18.1, Apple Intelligence has been an opt-in feature. Users had to decide to enable it, with Apple even going so far as to put people on a waiting list before they could use it. With iOS 18.3 and macOS 15.3, Apple’s AI features become a standard default part of the experience for all compatible iPhones (iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, iPhone 16), iPads, and Macs (all Macs with M1 or later processors). According to the developer documentation, Apple Intelligence will be enabled by default: For users new or upgrading to iOS 18.3, Apple Intelligence will be enabled automatically during iPhone onboarding. Users will have access to Apple Intelligence features after setting up their devices. To disable Apple Intelligence, users will need to navigate to the Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri Settings pane and turn off the Apple Intelligence toggle. This will disable Apple Intelligence features on their device. Obviously, this will only be true in the regions and languages for which Apple Intelligence is available. It makes some sense; These are distinguishing features of these devices and, unlike some Siri requests and responses, Apple Intelligence features are either processed entirely on the device or via Private Cloud Compute where everything is encrypted and never saved. Still, Apple Intelligence is clearly labeled as “Beta” and it feels premature to make any beta features opt-out rather than opt-in. To disable Apple Intelligence, open Settings, select Apple Intelligence \u0026 Siri, and flip the toggle switch to turn it off.",

    "description": "Macworld Even if you’re not planning to buy one of the new iPhones, your existing iPhone (XR and later) can now get a bunch of new features following the release of iOS 18.  Among the new features in iOS 18 are a redesigned Photos app, new ways to customize your Home screen and wallpaper, new Messages reactions, privacy-related features and dozens of other smaller changes. There are also be some AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence available on some iPhones (find out if they’ll be on your iPhone below). This free software update brings interface tweaks, bug fixes, and new features. It is like getting a new iPhone without paying a penny. In this article, we discuss everything you need to know about iOS 18, including which iPhones will be able to run iOS 18, the new features – and the new features still to come because they weren’t ready in time for the launch of iOS 18. We’ll also discuss any problems and fixes, what’s new in the latest update, and what’s coming in the next update to iOS 18. As for what’s coming in iOS 19 when it arrives later in 2025, read: iOS 19 Guide: Release date and rumors. We also have information about the beta program including the latest version of the public and developer betas. Update January 21: The release candidate for iOS 18.3 is out now, with the wide release expected next week. Latest version and what’s new… iOS 18: Latest version iOS 18.2.1: January 6, 2025 iOS 18.2: December 11, 2024 iOS 18 arrived on Monday, September 16. macOS Sequoia, watchOS and iPadOS 18 launched at the same time. The latest version is iOS 18.2.1 which is a small update that includes “important bug fixes,” according to Apple’s release notes. Apple doesn’t share any details of the bugs in question and there are no known widespread bugs in iOS 18.2. iOS 18.2 arrived on December 11 and includes a number of Apple Intelligence features but that’s not all. Read about Why iOS 18.2 is a must-have update even if your phone doesn’t support Apple Intelligence, and How to get Apple Intelligence on your iPhone. Prior to iOS 18.2, iOS 18.1.1 included fixes for two security vulnerabilities that have actually been used in attacks on Intel-based Macs. In notes accompanying the update, Apple writes: “Apple is aware of a report that this issue may have been actively exploited on Intel-based Mac systems.” The fixed issues include a flaw in JavaScriptCore framework and a flaw in WebKit. iOS 18.1 arrived on October 28, and brings the first set of Apple Intelligence features to iPhone 16 models and iPhone 15 Pro and Max. There will be more Apple Intelligence features released in iOS 18.2 and iOS 18.3. If you want to know more about the staggered release of Apple Intelligence features, read: Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout—here’s what you’ll get, and when. What’s new in iOS 18.3? iOS 18.3 is a relatively minor release, with bug fixes, security updates, and a few tweaks to Apple Intelligence notification summaries. Visual intelligence – Add an event to Calendar from a poster or flyer, identify plants and animals Notification summaries – You can enable or disable summaries for an app from the lock screen (swipe left, choose Options), and notification summaries have italicized text. Notification summaries have been disabled for News \u0026 Entertainment apps for now. Calculator app – The “repeat operation” capability when you keep pressing the equals (=) key has been restored. What’s new in iOS 18.2? The main thrust of iOS 18.2 is new Apple Intelligence features, especially those centered around images. There are updates to Writing Tools, ChatGPT integration with Siri, Image Playground, Genmoji, and Visual Intelligence for iPhone 16 phones. You can expect the following: Writing Tools updates – more options. Genmoji – new emoji you can create. See: How to create your own custom emoji with Genmoji. Image Playground – ability to generate images based on text prompts. Image Wand – uses Apple’s image generation tools to create an image and add as context to a note. ChatGPT integration – use ChatGPT with Siri. See: How to use ChatGPT on the iPhone. Default Apps – new section in Settings. Visual Intelligence – get information using the Camera Control button. AE/AF Lock – new toggle to lock exposure and focus via the Camera Control button. Find My – share the location of something with a trusted person. Mail – New auto-categories (primary, transactions, updates and promotions) to help manage your Inbox. Volume limits – set volume limits for iPhone speaker. Camera Control – Improvements. News+ – Sudoku puzzles. AirTag – Item location sharing For more information about the Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.2 read: How Apple Intelligence levels up with iOS 18.2 and macOS 15.2. What’s new in iOS 18.1? iOS 18.1 brings a selection of Apple Intelligence features to iPhones that are compatible with Apple Intelligence (that’s the iPhone 15 Pro, 15 Max, and the entire iPhone 16 range). New features include: Writing Tools – Rewrite, proofread, and summarize text. Siri – New look. Type to Siri so you don’t have to speak to your iPhone. Conversational context so Siri remembers what you had already asked and maintains the context. Photos – Improvements to search. Clean Up to remove things from photos. Memory movies. Notifications – Notification summaries. Reduce interruptions Focus. Mail – Smart reply. Priority messages. Phone – Record phone calls. Notes – Transcriptions of audio recordings or phone calls. Read: How to record and transcribe voice calls on your iPhone Camera – Camera Control button can be used to switch to TrueDepth camera. Spatial photo capture for 16 Pro and Max. AirPods – Hearing Test and Hearing Air features for AirPods Pro 2. There were also bug fixes and security updates in iOS 18.1. What’s coming… iOS 18: Latest beta iOS 18.3 release candidate, January 21. Apple’s beta testing program for developers and public testers has been running since June/July and continues beyond the launch of iOS 18 to the general public. There is also a separate iOS 18 Sequoia 15.2 beta that includes some as yet unavailable Apple Intelligence features. If you want to run the developer beta, you need to be a registered Apple software developer, which has both free and paid ($99/£79) versions. We explain How to join Apple’s beta program separately. Developer betas can be risky though, so we recommend signing up for the Public Beta instead, which should be more stable. Beware though: whether a public beta or a developer beta, any beta software is not as stable as the final version and the iOS and your apps may not work properly. Read Should you install the iOS 18 beta? for advice. Once registered, when you go to Settings \u003e General \u003e Software Update on your Mac, you’ll see a new tab for Beta Updates, which will list the version of the beta you’re running: choose either iOS 18 Developer Beta or iOS 18 Public Beta. If you need help installing the developer or public betas read our How to get the iOS beta article. If you then want to uninstall it, we have a guide for that: How to remove the iOS beta. iOS 18 features still to launch The following promised features aren’t yet in beta: Advanced Siri features like on-screen awareness, personal context, and actions within apps Should you install iOS 18?… iOS 18: Should I install iOS 18 on my iPhone? As long as your iPhone can run it, we recommend updating to iOS 18. The new features–all of which we discuss below–look enticing enough, and, so far, the only problem (see above) will not affect many people. We address how How iOS 17 and iOS 18 compare separately. Also take a look at: All the little details and hidden features in iOS 18 you won’t want to miss. However, we do recommend you wait a week or more so that any issues with the early release can be addressed: despite the beta program, there are often issues once the software update gets installed on mass-market iPhones. It’s also wise not to be one of the first downloaders because the download will likely take a lot longer if you try soon after it becomes available. iOS 18: Problems and bugs Messages bug: A Messages bug that could cause crashes and may even result in the loss of valuable data was reported. It seemed to be connected to an Apple Watch feature that lets users share their watch face over Messages (or Mail). Obviously, those are quite a niche set of circumstances and the best way to avoid it appears to be to not reply to watch faces in a thread. We have more information here: Link-sharing bug in iOS 18 Messages can cause iPhone crashes, data loss. Apple fixed this bug in iOS 18.0.1. Unresponsive touch screen: iPhone 16 Pro owners have complained of display ‘dead spots’, with taps and swipes are being ignored. It is thought that this is related to the Camera Control button. Apple addressed this bug in iOS 18.0.1. Camera freezes in macro mode: This was addressed in iOS 18.0.1. Photos redesign: Probably the most hated feature of iOS 18 is the redesigned Photos app. So we’ve written this: How to fix the Photos app and make it less annoying. Inaccurate news notifications: There have been some fake news notifications generated by Apple’s AI. Read: Apple vows to ‘clarify’ AI summaries after spate of fake news alerts. There are concerns that macOS Sequoia’s iPhone mirroring feature could expose personal data at work. Servco Security has highlighted the problem to Apple who claims to be working on a fix. If you have any problems with iOS 18 you may be able to downgrade. Read: How to downgrade an iPhone from iOS 18 to iOS 17. iOS 18: How to install Installing iOS 18 and any subsequent updates is a breeze. Just open the Settings app on your iPhone and go to General \u003e Software Update; iOS will check for any available updates and guide you through the process of installing them. You simply have to follow the instructions, which we explain in our iOS updating guide. And it’s easier still if you’ve turned on Automatic Updates, which you can do from the same screen. A little work preparing your iPhone before installing the update can help avoid problems. We advise you follow these steps: Back up your iPhone: Back up before installing the new version and you will always be able to recover your iPhone with the older version of iOS running on it should things go wrong. Read: How to downgrade an iPhone. Make space on your iPhone: If your iPhone doesn’t have a lot of available space internally we recommend having a bit of a tidy-up so you can reclaim some iPhone storage. Simple ways to do this could include deleting apps you don’t use, deleting old Notes, Messages, and duplicated photos. Update your iPhone to the latest version: Don’t skip an update and go straight to iOS 18. If you haven’t installed iOS 17.6.1 yet do so now. iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones get iOS 18? The following iPhones get support for iOS 18, the same lineup of supported devices as iOS 17. iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, Pro, Pro Max  iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, Pro, Pro Max  iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, Pro, Pro Max iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, Pro Max  iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max iPhone XR iPhone SE (2nd gen or later) Read: iOS 18 compatibility: Which iPhones support iOS 18 and iOS compatibility checker Some of the new features will not be supported on the older phones, because they lack the hardware necessary (a powerful enough Neural Engine or GPU to run AI stuff, or enough RAM). This is typical of new iOS releases. In 2022, for example, the iPhone 8 and iPhone X missed out on a bunch of cool stuff due to their older processor. It is no surprise, therefore, that the hardware requirements are steep for the AI-related features aka ‘Apple Intelligence’—iPhone 15 Pro or later. Like iOS 17, iOS 18 does not support iPhone 8 or the iPhone X which came out in 2017, but since those phones are able to run iOS 16, they will continue to get support through security updates for at least another year. With the release of iOS 18 though, Apple will stop supporting iOS 15, which will mean that iPhone 7, 7 Plus, iPhone 6S, 6S Plus, and iPhone SE (1st generation) will no longer get support. Generally, Apple has provided software updates for the past two versions of iOS. See: How long does Apple support iPhones. iOS 18 guide iOS 18 features: What’s new in iOS 18 There were many new features in iOS 17 including a new app called Journal, Live Voicemail, and a new way to use Stickers, among dozens of other smaller changes. Rumors suggested that iOS 18 would be “one of the biggest iOS updates — if not the biggest — in the company’s history.” As expected, in iOS 28 Apple will include some major new AI features, dubbed Apple Intelligence, although these features will only be available on iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max and newer iPhones. Not all the new features were available at launch. The first Apple Intelligence AI features were introduced in iOS 18.1 and others are arriving with subsequent updates. Features, such as the new categories in Mail, will come “later this year”. Read: Features missing when iOS 18 launched. Customization There will be a more customizable Home Screen, Lock Screen, and Control Center in iOS 18. Several reports had claimed that Apple would allow greater personalization of the Home screen, including allowing users to place icons anywhere on the grid, allowing spaces between them. Prior to iOS 18 icons can be reordered or put into folders, but always fill the screen from left to right and top to bottom. In iOS 18 users are able to arrange apps and widgets anywhere on the Home Screen, including right above the dock or framing a wallpaper. It will even be possible to change the lock screen icons or remove them. In addition, App icons and widgets can have a dark or tinted effect to blend in. Read: iOS 18: How to change the color of the app icons on your home screen and How to put app icons, widgets, and folders anywhere you want as well as iOS 18: How to make your app icons large and label-free. This “put icons wherever you want” feature is something we’ve wanted from Apple for many years, and has been a staple of many Android phones seemingly forever. The Control Centre is getting a redesign to give easier access to a user’s most-utilized controls. Users will also be able to add controls from supported third-party apps into Control Center. Is it enough? Read: Apple is finally letting you have it your way–kinda and You can finally customize your iPhone like Android–here’s everything you can do. Apple Photos New features in Photos will help users find their photos and keep big libraries organized. It’s the biggest redesign of Photos ever and is intended to help users find photos fast. It will be simplified but still familiar, according to Apple and will include a new Unified View, new Collections, and customization features. Users will be able to filter out clutter to narrow down to specific types of content. It will be possible to browse by topics, time, people, memories, trips, Recent Days and People and Pets. A new carousel view will present highlights that update each day – featuring favorite people, pets, and places. Not everyone likes these changes. If you don’t look at: How to fix the Photos app and make it less annoying. Apple Messages Messages will gain new ways to express yourself. Expect improvements to text formatting and fun new text effects. Tapbacks are getting redesigned and will let you tap back with any emoji or sticker. You’ll also be able to amplify and animate letters, word, phrases, and emoji, and add formatting like bold, underline, italics, and strikethrough. You will also be able to schedule a message to send later. Messages will also support RCS for more reliable group messaging with those who do not have an Apple device. Read about how your conversations with Android users will look in iOS 18 and RCS on iPhone with iOS 18: Every question answered. Apple is also making it possible to send Messages via Satellite so you can text when off the grid from Messages app. iMessages sent over satellite are encrypted. Apple Mail Mail will help you manage incoming email better with new on-device categorization. As email arrives it will be sorted into Primary (personal and time-sensitive), Transactions (confirmations and receipts), Updates (news and social notifications), and Promotions (marketing and coupons). A new Digest will pull together all relevant emails from a business, so for example, it could bring all flight information together. The Mail Categorization features will be available later this year. Safari A new Highlights feature is designed to make it easier to discover information on the web. A redesigned Reader experience will use machine learning to surface key information on a webpage so that users can review a summary to get the gist of an article. A table of contents will be included for longer articles Apple says users will also be able to quickly see the location of a restaurant, hotel, or landmark; or listen to an artist’s track right from an article about the song or album. You will also be able to snap away annoying ads. Apple Wallet and Apple Pay There will be new ways to pay with Apple Pay. Users can send and receive Apple Cash by holding two iPhones together: Tap to Cash will let you share cash without exchanging email or number. Tickets in Apple Wallet including key event information like an event guide with info about the venue, and recommended Apple Music playlists Apple iPhone mirroring on the Mac iPhone Mirroring will grant users access to their iPhone via their Mac. It will be possible to see notifications from the iPhone on the Mac, and drag and drop files between the devices. Read: How iPhone Mirroring lets you access your iPhone on your Mac in macOS Sequoia. Other app updates: Journal – New features to help you keep track of goals, Insights view, calendar, writing streak, and actually search Maps – New topographic maps with trails (US national parks only) Game Mode – Will minimize background activity for the best frame rates Notes app – formulas and equations entered while typing will be solved Calendar – incorporates tasks from Reminders and a new monthly view Health app – Medical ID redesigned Emergency SOS Live Video Home app – guest access Accessibility – Eye Tracking iCloud – Apple is adding a “Keep Downloaded” option that prevents the file from being moved to iCloud and keeps the file on the device. Read about the new Keep Downloaded option. Apple didn’t discuss everything at WWDC. There were a number of features that didn’t make the WWDC keynote. Also see: Unannounced iOS 18 tweak lets you see the time even when your iPhone is dead. Privacy features iOS 18 will improve privacy. You will be able to control who can see your apps, which contacts you share with that app, and which accessories apps can connect to. You can also control whether others can view your apps on your iPhone by locking an app so it won’t open without Face ID or a passcode. A new locked hidden apps folder is also coming with iOS 18. Developers will have a way to seamlessly connect third-party accessories with iPhones without letting an app see all the other devices on a user’s network. Apple Apple Intelligence  Apple’s new artificial intelligence system is coming in a series of updates to iPhone, Mac, and iPad with iOS 18, macOS Sequoia, and iPadOS 18. Apple Intelligence will only be supported by iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, and the iPhone 16 range though. (Here’s why you’ll need to upgrade your iPhone to get Apple Intelligence, also read: Here’s why newer iPhones and Vision Pro can’t run Apple Intelligence). The hardware requirements are steep—iPhone 15 Pro or later. iPads will need at least an M1 chip or later as will Macs. Apple Intelligence features will mostly be processed on the device, which is different from other platforms where AI processing is done in the cloud. But Apple Intelligence will be able to determine if cloud processing is needed and will use it when appropriate. Apple Intelligence features include the following: Writing – Apple Intelligence will help users enhance their writing and communications. Writing Tools are built in systemwide that will offer to rewrite, proofread, and summarize text in writing focused apps such as Mail, Notes, Pages, and third-party apps. Images – New image capabilities will also come to M-series Macs. In Image Playground users will be able to create images in three styles: Animation, Illustration, or Sketch. Photos – A new Memories in Photos feature will create a video from photos and videos based on a description provided by the user. Apple Intelligence will pick out the photos and videos, develop a storyline based on the photos, and arrange them into a movie. In addition, a new Clean Up tool will identify and remove unwanted objects from the background of a photo. Read: Apple Intelligence FAQ: What it is, what it does, and when you’ll get it and Apple Intelligence is a gradual rollout—here’s what you’ll get, and when. Siri Siri is also getting some AI updates and ChatGPT is to be integrated into Siri (as of iOS 18.2). Because some queries will be handled off-device Apple is introducing Private Cloud Compute so that when data is sent to server-based models for processing it is not stored or made accessible to Apple. One of the simplest changes to Siri is that it will be easier to type to Siri rather than having to speak to the on-device assistant. Apple may have finally twigged that people don’t always want to talk to their phones. The new Siri is said to be more “conversational” and natural, with features that “help users in their day-to-day lives.” A new smart responses framework will help Siri take into account your own personal details in its replies: like people, companies, calendar events, locations, dates, and more. Later this year, Siri is said to get cross-device media control. So you can talk to Siri on one of your devices to control media playback on another. In an update scheduled for early 2025, Siri is said to gain the ability to control nearly any app, with hundreds of possible commands. This feature will start off with single commands for Apple’s own apps and grow to include third-party apps and commands with multiple steps. In addition, Siri will be able to react to and take actions based on what is on your screen. This is said to go into beta for developers in January, with a rollout to users in iOS 18.4 in the spring. New accessibility features Apple is planning several new accessibility features for iOS 18, including Adaptive Voice Shortcuts, which will let users turn on or off specific accessibility features using a custom phrase, and Live Speech, which lets users type what they want to say and have it read out loud on phone calls or video meetings, will get the ability to add saved phrases to categories. Features that arrived or are arriving later Some iOS 18 features won’t be a part of the initial release. Rather, they will be released later in 2024 or in 2025 as part of an iOS 18 point release (iOS 18.2 or iOS 18.4, for example). Here are some of the more significant features coming in later iOS 18 updates: Mail app features – Auto-categorizing of mail, mail digests, and summaries in your inbox. (Arrived in iOS 18.2) Home support for robot vacuums – The Home app won’t be able to start or stop your Roomba until 2025. (Coming in iOS 18.3). Drag and Drop between iPhone and Mac – You’ll be able to see and control your iPhone on your Mac when iOS 18 and macOS 15 are released, but drag-and-drop support between your Mac and iPhone will come in an update. ChatGPT integration – The ability to call upon ChatGPT when using Apple’s AI tools arrived in iOS 18.2. Advanced Siri features – Siri features like its ability to see and react to what is on your display, semantic indexing (where Siri knows and uses information from across Messages, Mail, Contacts, and more), and advanced control over apps is all coming in 2025. (Coming in 2025). Vehicle Motion Cues in iOS 18 will help reduce motion sickness. Third-party NFC transactions – Apple will allow third-party NFC transactions beginning with iOS 18.1–by request. In addition, all of the Apple Intelligence features will initially support only American English, and may be limited to only some regions. Additional languages and regions are coming later, the U.K., Australia and Canada gained supposed at the end of 2024, other regions will gain support through 2025 and beyond. Next version of iOS We know that the next version of iOS after Apple finishes development of iOS 18 will be iOS 19. But what next in terms of software? Expect even more Apple Intelligence features to come in the late 2025 update to iOS and expect that iOS, iPadOS and macOS will be closer than ever. Over the past several years, the release of the new version of iOS has been fairly consistent, usually falling on the Monday following Apple’s iPhone launch event: iOS 18: Monday, September 16, 2024 iOS 17: Monday, September 18, 2023 iOS 16: Monday, September 12, 2022  iOS 15: Monday, September 20, 2021  iOS 14: Wednesday, September 16, 2020 iOS 13: Thursday, September 19, 2019 iOS 12: Monday, September 17, 2018",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
