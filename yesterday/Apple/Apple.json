While on the election trail, Trump said Cook complained to him about European Union actions, specifically the $15 billion that was put in escrow to deal with Ireland tax issues.It does not appear that Trump did anything about the fine during his time as president. The funds to pay the fine were put in escrow in 2018, and there is not a statement on record from him about it from that time. Continue Reading on AppleInsider | Discuss on our Forums",

These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00.

All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available.

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2544544/desktop-mac-macbook-pro-m4-thunderbolt-cloud.html",
    "description": "Macworld Back in the day, I had one computer. It was a laptop bought for me by my employer, and at work, I’d attach it to an external display and use it at my desk. At the end of the day, I’d close it up, put it in my backpack, and take it home. For the last 10 years, I’ve worked at a desk at home, with a desktop Mac as my primary computer. But over the last year or so, I’ve been using my MacBook Air a lot more, whether I’m traveling or spending the winter in a heated room rather than my unheated garage. So what’s better, the single-Mac life or being a Mac vagabond? As someone who’s been there, and back, and there again, I can tell you that it’s never been easier to live the two-Mac lifestyle–but it’s also never been a better time to just give the desktop up and learn to love a Mac laptop. The bad old days In the days of PowerPC and Intel laptops, living this life was rough. Just running a Mac laptop in lid-closed mode, attached to an external display, was fraught with bugs. Today, most Macs are laptops, but for a good many years, the laptop was an oddball and the desktop was the “real” Mac. As a result, laptop bugs abounded, especially if you wanted to do something as outlandish as plug your laptop into an external display and close the lid. All Macs now let you use an iPad as a second display. But there was a time when simply running any external display on a MacBook was an adventure in troubleshooting.Willis Lai/IDG What I’m saying is, there was a lot of unplugging and replugging, opening the lid and closing the lid, and the like, in order to cajole the computer into properly displaying on that external screen. Things got better over time, but it was never perfect. Worse, though, were the sleep issues. When the Mac went to sleep while attached to an external display, sometimes it wouldn’t come back without help–or with a forced reboot. On many, many days, I’d unplug my laptop, pop it into my backpack, take an hourlong ride on a bus back home, and remove the laptop–only to find the inside of my backpack blazing hot because my MacBook hadn’t gone to sleep after all. Keeping in sync Still, the plan when I started working for myself, in my garage, was to use my beloved MacBook Air and plug it into a big display. That plan didn’t survive the release of the 5K iMac, and so began my years-long sojourn as a person who used a desktop at my desk, but a laptop everywhere else. I hadn’t lived like this for years, and things really had gotten much better for multiple Mac users in the intervening time. The existence of cloud services such as iCloud and Dropbox has really made things so much easier. These days I keep most of my working files in Dropbox, but I also sync my Desktop and Documents folders via iCloud. The iCloud part is sometimes a bit wonky, but it’s so nice to be able to put a folder on my Desktop in my office and then open my laptop and see that the same file is on the Desktop there, too. (And, of course, all those files are also accessible on my iPhone and iPad. Nice!) When I recently had to wipe my Mac Studio’s hard drive, I did so with no fear of losing data. Not only do I back up daily via Time Machine and make a clone using Carbon Copy Cloner, but all my vital files are in Dropbox or iCloud. It just wasn’t a worry. While the cloud makes life as a user of many Macs easier, it unfortunately also highlights all the ways in which it’s still hard. While some Mac apps have embraced the cloud as a way to sync settings–BBEdit has let you do it via Dropbox or iCloud for quite a while now–others only do it in a limited fashion. For example, I can sync my Keyboard Maestro macros and my Hazel automations via the cloud, but only after delving into their settings and enabling some specific cloud-sync features. And that’s the apps that acknowledge the existence of the cloud. Other apps… just don’t. Once I set Keyboard Maestro to sync using iCloud, I discovered that all my podcast-related automations crashed hard against Audio Hijack’s inability to sync either its sessions or its scripts across devices. (It’s even worse: while you can import and export Audio Hijack sessions, I could only move scripts by diving into my local Application Support folder and copying a property list file to the other computer.) My Stream Deck settings also don’t sync, though at least they can be imported and exported. At least Shortcuts sync via iCloud–more or less. (There are occasional reliability issues, but I’ve found that it mostly works.) Plenty of system-level stuff is also just not consistent. I use the app SwiftBar to put ambient data in my menu bar, mostly from a bunch of Python scripts. SwiftBar is happy to use a bunch of plug-ins from Dropbox or iCloud, which is great! But keeping the version of Python on both systems in sync, at compatible paths, with compatible modules installed, is an ongoing challenge. I recently got a Hazel sync working again via its settings-sync features, only to discover that my scripts were failing because the connected Python script was in an unsynced directory, and therefore my fixes on one computer never moved to the other one. An M4 Max MacBook Pro offers workstation-like performance in a portable and light package.Foundry The big picture is that my files are in the cloud, and that’s awesome. The details, though, are frustrating. Every time I go several days without using either computer, I find I’m spending time getting things back up to current while also waiting for Apple’s push notification server to alert me about everything that’s already been dealt with on other devices. So I decided maybe it was time to stop the madness. Things got better The release of the M4 Macs this fall really made me consider my options. While I decided that an M4 Pro Mac mini wouldn’t be enough of an upgrade over my M1 Max Mac studio, I started to wonder: What about an M4 Max MacBook Pro? After all, Apple’s newest laptops would be a quantum leap in performance over my formerly amazing desktop Mac. (Gone are the days when using a laptop requires a serious drop in performance.) And if I commit to the laptop lifestyle, I don’t need to worry about syncing all those miscellaneous directories and app settings because everywhere I go, I’ll be using the same Mac! Still: The fear of the bad old days. But being a laptop user in the era of Apple silicon is so much better than it was in the Intel years. Desktop Macs are awesome, but they’re also outliers. The vast majority of Macs in use are laptops. And in this era, Mac hardware and macOS itself are almost entirely focused on the laptop experience. My personal experience backs this up. I’d guess that in the last year, I’ve spent more time using my MacBook Air running in lid-closed mode attached to a Studio Display than I’ve used it as an actual laptop. And the experience has been great. I’ve noticed almost none of the weirdnesses that used to plague me. I am still blown away by the fact that when you plug in an external display, it just… turns on. There’s no weird blinking and flashing as everything resets and composes itself like there used to be. It really does just work. Peripherals have come a long way, too. Thunderbolt and USB-C docks make it much easier to create docking stations for laptops. In the bedroom I use as an office in the winter, I’ve got a Studio display with a USB-C dock attached to one of its ports, allowing me to chain off a microphone, keyboard, trackpad, and Stream Deck. Connecting to this setup requires a single Thunderbolt cable, which provides power and streams out data. It’s fantastic. Off I go After much fretting, I decided that I needed to admit to myself that the right decision was for me to become a one-Mac person again. And that means that a laptop is the right decision for me. Later this month, my M4 Max MacBook Pro will arrive, and I’ll begin the migration. Sure, I’ll probably need to invest in some more docks and cables in order to convert my Mac Studio desk into a MacBook Pro-friendly model. But I’ll also be down to a single computer that I can use anywhere, including when I travel. (I don’t love the extra weight the MacBook Pro has over the MacBook Air, but I’m willing to shoulder the burden–literally. And my daughter will finally be able to replace her Intel Air with something better.) Ten years as a desktop Mac user was a lot of fun. I had an iMac, iMac Pro, and Mac Studio, and I enjoyed them all. But like almost everyone else, I’ve found the pull of the laptop too strong to avoid. Even when sitting at a desk staring at a big monitor, the MacBook Pro seems like the right choice.",

    "description": "Macworld Always knowing where your keys are or where your checked-in bag is when you’re at the airport is pretty fantastic, and the tiny Apple AirTag is super useful. Well, if you need a handful of AirTags right now, you can get a four-pack for $73 at Amazon, a savings of $43 off Apple’s $29 price for a single AirTag or just $18.25 per tracker. These tiny devices look great, and they’re super easy to set up with your iPhone or iPad. Once they’re connected to your devices, you can easily use the Find My app to pinpoint their exact location. During those hectic mornings when you can’t find your keys, you can just launch the app on your phone and make the AirTag play a sound so they’re easier to locate, cutting down minutes of panic searching the house. Even when the AirTag is out of range, the device will simply ping off of nearby Apple devices, helping you locate it as precisely as possible. If you lose something with an AirTag, you can just set it to Lost Mode from the app, and anyone who finds it can contact you. In our review of the AirTag, we appreciated the small design, the fact that it has a removable battery, and its tremendous versatility with the Find My network. No matter who you’re getting them for, there are tons of good uses for AirTags, and getting four of them for $73 is a total steal. Get 4 AirTags for just $18.25 eachBuy now at Amazon",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
