    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/672537/when-is-apples-next-event.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple doesn’t participate in big industry-wide events such as CES or E3. The most valuable company in the world holds its own events, thank you very much. Several times a year, Apple invites the press and industry professionals to Apple Park to hear all about its latest products and services. Apple calls these ‘events,’ and streams them live online to millions of watchers. UPDATE: Apple is expected to update the MacBook Air, iPad and iPad Air soon. Our best guess is that it will do so by press release and that the product will be in shops after Apple’s Back to School promotion ends in Australia on March 13. This could point to a product launch around March 4 or 5, but not an event. So far in 2025 Apple hasn’t held any events, however, it did launch a new iPhone via press release on February 19. Read all about the iPhone 16e here. In 2024, Apple held three events: one on Tuesday, May 7, at which it launched new iPads, a keynote to kick off WWDC on June 10, where the features coming in the new operating systems iOS 18 and macOS Sequoia were revealed, and an event on September 9 at which Apple unveiled the new iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10 and the new AirPods 4. In October 2024 there was no event, but Apple did announce new products (iMac, Mac mini and MacBook Pro) via press release. In 2023 there were three such events: WWDC in June, an iPhone event in September, and Apple’s second fall event on October 30 (or after midnight on October 31 if you weren’t in the U.S.). Similarly, in 2022 Apple held three events: a spring event on March 8, WWDC on June 6, and the iPhone 14 launch on September 7. In other years Apple has held four events though and it may do so in 2025. Read on to find out what events and new Apple product launches the company has in store for 2025. When is Apple’s next event? June 9, WWDC Keynote (estimated) Spring event in March is possible, but unlikely. There is a slim chance that Apple will hold an event to celebrate the launch of the M4 MacBook Air and new iPad and iPad Air, but, given Apple’s recent preference to launch new products via press release (as it did with the iPhone 16e and the M4 MacBook Pro, Mac mini and iMac), we anticipate that the next event won’t take place until WWDC in June. The WWDC keynote is likely to take place on June 9. Because Apple is currently running a student-focused deal in Australia where it is giving away Apple Pencils with iPad Air, and AirPods with MacBook Air, it is likely that those new products won’t launch until after March 13. If the new products won’t go on sale until after March 13 that could point to Apple starting pre-orders on Friday March 7, with the new products on sale on March 14. On that basis a March 4 or 5 launch is conceivable. This would also allow Apple to get it on sale in time for the end of its second quarter on March 28. What time will the next Apple event start? Apple keynotes usually start at 10 am PT, but if Apple doesn’t hold an event and instead just issues a press release that usually happens around 8 am PT, 11 am ET and 4 pm GMT/BST. When Apple holds a keynote to announce a new product it usually starts at the following times in the countries where most of our readers live: U.S.: at 10 am (PST/PDT), 11 am (MST/MDT), noon (CST/CDT), 1 pm (EST/EDT) Canada: as above, and 2 pm (AST/ADT) U.K.: at 6 pm (GMT/BST) Europe: at 7pm (CET/CEST), 8 pm (EET/EEST) India: at 10.30 pm (IST) Australia: Next day at 1 am (AWST/AWDT), 2.30 am (ACST/ACDT), 3 am (AEST/AEDT) New Zealand: Next day at 5 am (NZST/NZDT) Timings may be slightly different if Apple holds the event during the period of a couple of weeks when the clocks have changed in the U.S. but not elsewhere (in 2025 that’s between March 9 and March 30). Sometimes Apple holds events at different times, for example, in October 2023 the event was held in late afternoon in San Francisco, which meant it was midnight in the U.K. How long does an Apple event last? Apple keynotes usually last between one and two hours and feature CEO Tim Cook along with various other Apple executives. WWDC and the September event tend to be longer keynotes; the spring and late-fall events can be slightly shorter. The September 2024 event was 1 hour 38 minutes. When does Apple usually hold events? Apple holds three or four live or live-streamed events throughout the year. During these events, the company unveils its latest products and plans during a keynote address. They are usually held during similar times of the year: March/April: Spring event (in 2024 this was held in May) June: WWDC (Worldwide Developers Conference) September: Fall event (aka iPhone and Apple Watch launch event) October/November: Late-fall event(s) This event calendar is by no means set in stone, though, with the spring and October events being less regular. Some years, Apple doesn’t hold a spring event at all, as was the case in 2023. The summer and September events are more predictable, with software coming at WWDC in June and iPhones and Apple Watches in September. The October event often sees Apple launch new Macs, but this is another one that changes from year to year. Apple launched the new iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods Pro in September 2022.Apple What Apple events will take place in 2025? Here are the events we expect to see in 2025, and what could launch. Spring event 2025 Here are the dates of the past seven Apple spring events, as you can see, it’s not a regular occurrence, but a Spring event is held slightly more often than not. In 2025 we aren’t expecting a spring event because Apple has already launched the iPhone 16e. 2024: Tuesday May 7 2023: No event 2022: Tuesday March 8 2021: Tuesday April 20 2020: No event 2019: Monday March 25 2018: Tuesday March 27 2017: No event 2016: Monday March 21 2015: Monday March 9 2014: No event 2013: No event 2012: Wednesday March 7 As for what could be coming, there are rumors that Apple could launch an 11th gen iPad, a M3 iPad Air and a HomePod with a screen. It is also probable that an M4 MacBook Air may also arrive in the spring so we could see this launch at a spring event perhaps around March 18. For more information about Apple’s spring events read: Apple Spring event: Date, time, product launch rumors. WWDC keynote 2025 June 9 (estimated) WWDC 2024 took place from June 10-14 with the Apple’s keynote kicking the conference off at 10am on June 10, 2024. Expect similar timings for 2025. Apple uses WWDC each year to unveil details of the latest versions of its operating systems, so in 2025 we’ll get a preview of iOS 19, iPadOS 19, macOS 16, watchOS 12, and tvOS 19, and an update to Apple’s realityOS. Apple sometimes announces new hardware at WWDC, usually the high end models targeted at power users, so we could see new Macs. In fact, we may still be waiting for the following: M4 Mac Studio M4 Ultra Mac Pro M4 Pro 32-inch iMac Pro Following the keynote on the Monday, developer events and sessions will run throughout the week. Dates for WWDC: WWDC 2024: June 10-14 WWDC 2023: June 5-9 WWDC 2022: June 6-10 WWDC 2021: June 7-11 WWDC 2020: June 22-26 WWDC 2019: June 3-7 WWDC 2018: June 4-8 WWDC 2017: June 5-9 We are certain to get a preview of the new software, but what about hardware? Any of the Macs that don’t launch in October 2024 are likely to have been announced by June 2024, but if not, this is where we will see them. You can read more about WWDC date, times and everything you need to know in a separate article. September iPhone event 2025 Apple always holds an event in September, and almost always uses this to announce a new iPhone and Apple Watch. (The only exception in recent memory was in 2020, as a result of Covid-related production issues. That year the iPhone was announced in October, but there was still a September event.) In 2025 we expect that Apple will unveil the iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, a new Apple Watch Ultra and Apple Watch SE. We may also see the M5 arrive in the iPad Pro. Here are the past few Apple September event dates: 2024: Monday, September 9 2023: Tuesday, September 12 2022: Tuesday, September 13 2022: Wednesday, September 7 2021: Tuesday, September 14 2020: Tuesday, September 15 2019: Tuesday, September 10 2018: Wednesday, September 12 2017: Tuesday, September 12 For more information about Apple’s September events read: Apple’s September iPhone event: Date, time, and what will launch. October event 2025 There was no October event in 2024, with Apple making product announcements via press release. Despite the lack of event in 2024 though, Apple has a president of updating certain Macs in the October time frame, so this may be when we see new Macs running M5 chips. In the past, Apple has held a second fall event on the following dates: 2024: No event 2023: Monday, October 30 2022: No event 2021: Monday, October 18 2020: Tuesday, October 13 and Tuesday, November 10 2019: No event 2018: Tuesday, October 30 2017: No event 2016: Thursday, October 27 2015: No event 2014: Thursday, October 16 2013: Tuesday, October 22 2012: Tuesday, October 23 2011: Tuesday, October 4 Apple may update certain Macs to M5 chips at this event, including the M5 MacBook Pro.

    "description": "Today we're tracking a pair of deals, one on the Apple Pencil 2 and one on the 2020 M1 MacBook Air. These sales include the current best price online for the Apple Pencil 2, and an all-time low price on the MacBook Air. Note: MacRumors is an affiliate partner with some of these vendors. When you click a link and make a purchase, we may receive a small payment, which helps us keep the site running. Apple Pencil 2 Firstly, Woot has the Apple Pencil 2 for $109.99, down from $129.00. This sale isn't the lowest price we've ever tracked on this accessory, as it's been down to $99.00 in previous sales earlier this year, but it's still a solid second-best deal if you're looking to purchase an Apple Pencil 2 this week. $19 OFFApple Pencil 2 for $109.99 The Apple Pencil 2 is compatible with the new iPad mini 6, but not the new 10.2-inch iPad. For that tablet, only the original Apple Pencil is supported. MacBook Air Amazon today has the 512GB M1 MacBook Air for $1,099.99, down from $1,249.00. This is a match of the all-time low price on this model of the 2020 MacBook Air, and it's available in Space Gray and Silver. You'll see this sale price reflected on the checkout screen, once an automatic coupon is applied to your order. While the Gold option won't be available until around October 1, you can still purchase a Gold MacBook Air today at this discounted price ahead of the delayed shipping date. $149 OFFM1 MacBook Air (512GB) for $1,099.99 The 256GB model is on sale as well, available for $849.99, down from $999.00. All three colors are discounted for this model, but none are in stock today. This is still the lowest price we've ever tracked for the 256GB MacBook Air, so if you're willing to wait a few weeks, it's worth locking in this price while it's available. You can find even more discounts on other MacBooks by visiting our Best Deals guide for MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
