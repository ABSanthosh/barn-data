    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2564441/why-the-apple-watch-needs-a-reboot.html",
    "description": "Macworld Apple unveiled the Apple Watch ten years ago last September, prompting the rumour mill to speculate about an anniversary watch—just like the iPhone X once was. The Apple Watch X was supposed to feature a new magnetic wristband system that could free up more space in the case for the battery and other modules. Several months ago, there was speculation about an estimate of blood pressure, which Apple is said to have finally succeeded in doing. Just a few years ago, the blogosphere was buzzing about blood glucose measurement, but hopes for this feature to arrive has shifted to the late 2020s, if then. What Apple presented in September was without question a solid update: the Apple Watch Series 10 has retained the best of the Apple Watch Ultra, with larger battery sacrificed for even less weight and even slimmer dimensions. But even for me as an Apple Watch enthusiast, there was a strange aftertaste: like when you’re looking forward to cold sparkling water on a hot day and are served lukewarm, stale soda instead. In short, it was somewhat disappointing. And it’s not just me. The latest sales figures for Apple’s wearables division show this. The Apple Watch makes up a large part of Apple’s balance sheet, as can be seen from the reliable spikes every first quarter when the accounts for the Apple Watch presented in September roll in. The Apple Watch reached its peak with Series 7, introduced at the end of 2021. Since then, not even the new Apple Watch Ultra has been able to generate noticeable growth. Of course, the coronavirus pandemic played into the Apple Watch’s hands. Above all, Apple introduced the hand-washing reminder just one version earlier. Blood oxygen saturation could also be monitored with the Apple Watch since the Series 6. Since then, however, Apple’s smartwatch has offered few arguments for switching to it, apart from the new Ultra. Apple Watch Series 10 (42mm) Read our review Price When Reviewed: $399 Best Prices Today: $349 at Amazon | $349 at Best Buy | $349 at Walmart Electronics The main line around the Series 8, 9 and 10 only brought evolutionary improvements: Series 8 brought a temperature sensor for the first time and an improved accelerometer that could detect car accidents, Series 9 was eclipsed by the new Ultra despite the new one-handed operation , Series 10 had inherited the water temperature sensor from the Ultra. Apple Watch is no longer unique – or is it? If you look around the market, Apple Watch doesn’t offer any unique features. Withings \u0026 Co. also have comprehensive health monitoring and provide comparable vital signs. Garmin also offers outdoor maps and tracks your own hikes, like the Ultra. The Samsung Galaxy Watch has a blood pressure estimate on board, albeit with huge compromises, more on this later. Somewhat absurd, but a unique selling point of the Apple Watch is the huge range of wristbands from third-party manufacturers. With my test samples alone, I could wear a “new” Apple Watch every day, with a matching colour or material for every top or dress. The connection to the iPhone and the overall package of features can also convince customers. But these are arguments that only emerge after the purchase, not before. Apple Watch Ultra 2 Read our review Price When Reviewed: $799 (base) Best Prices Today: $799 at Apple | $799.99 at Target | $849.55 at Amazon This impression of stagnation is probably due to Apple’s philosophy regarding health. On the one hand, the company has the ambition to positively influence the lives of humanity, or at least the part of it that can afford an Apple Watch. On the other hand, this means that the new health functions will only be released if they are also beneficial from a medical perspective. Apple doesn’t want to release features like the blood pressure feature on Samsung’s Galaxy Watch, where the user has to calibrate the watch’s blood pressure data at regular intervals using a conventional cuff. The Galaxy Watch has also not been included in the European Society of Hypertension’s database of validated devices. Research takes time, and Apple’s ambitions are high. This is precisely why the new blood pressure estimation function has been delayed by at least a year. But Apple must finally introduce something fundamentally new in the health sector. Both the Apple Watch and its users can cope with the new start. This article originally appeared on our sister publication Macwelt and was translated and localized from German.",

    "link": "https://www.macworld.com/article/2561523/what-to-expect-from-apple-in-2025.html",
    "description": "Macworld Here it comes, barreling down on us full steam: 2025. Somehow we’ve already burned through a quarter of this century. It’s been a good twenty-five years for Apple, to be sure, and from all the early indications it seems like the next year will continue the trend, insofar as such things can be predicted with any certainty. While there are plenty of rumors about what Apple might do in the next 12 months, the simple truth is that the company only has so much time and so much money. (To be fair, it is a lot of money.) Not everything can be a priority, and not everything that gets talked about will actually happen. Even amongst the things that do happen, some will always stand out in terms of their impact on the company and its customers. Looking ahead to 2025, I’m thinking of a few that are most likely to have ramifications that move the needle—even if, in some cases, it may take a little time for the true effects to be felt. Home, at your command In 2024, Apple released the Vision Pro, a device that was decidedly cutting edge, but carried such a high price tag as to be out of the reach of all but the wealthiest Apple users—and for a company that tends to charge a premium for its products, that’s saying something. Perhaps the rumored smart home device Apple may release will take its UI cues from CarPlay or another existing Apple device.Apple The newest Apple product line rumored for 2025 seems of a decidedly different bent. The company’s rumored to be working on a “home command center” that has variously been likened to a stationary iPad or a HomePod with a screen. Such a device would provide a central way to control smart home tech, as well as display ambient information like the weather or news headlines. There are plenty of questions about the nature of this device. My general rule of thumb is that Apple’s products are almost always simpler and less radical than you might hope. They’re the kind of things that, in hindsight, look obvious, given the technology the company has already put out. Apple rarely reinvents wheels, and something like the Vision Pro is the exception, rather than the rule. So in this case, look to things like StandBy mode on the iPhone, tvOS, or CarPlay as examples of templates for this kind of device—and don’t be surprised if the tech it uses is an offshoot of one of those. Whatever this home command center is, will still likely end up being a niche product like the Vision Pro, but even so, it will at least be one that the average user may be able to afford. Depth charge The iPhone remains Apple’s cash crop, but even as it continues to account for the largest chunk of the company’s revenue Apple has struggled to figure out how to expand the line. The Pro and Pro Max have been significant hits, yes, but the attempts at broadening the lower end—the mini and Plus phones—have fallen more flat. If you’ve always thought the iPhone was too thick, 2025 may be your year.Chris Martin / Foundry Third time’s the charm: if you can’t change the length or width, maybe depth is where it’s at. This year Apple reportedly intends to introduce a thinner iPhone, possibly called the iPhone 17 Air or Slim. That thinness is likely to come at a cost—in part literally. While it may be less than the $999 starting price of the Pro line, it’s probably going to be more expensive than the base $799 iPhone—which would seem to position it around the same $899 price point as the current Plus. And such a slim design could mean some trade-offs in capability, including a simpler camera and perhaps lower battery life. As always, the big question is the story Apple intends to tell about this device. Why does it exist? Are people crying out for a thinner iPhone? Will the tradeoffs be worth it? Or is the company simply trying to cash in on the cachet of having a fancy new exterior? We’ll find out next fall. The call is coming from inside the phone One of the biggest Apple success stories of the past decade is the shift to building its own processors. It’s allowed the company to not just elicit great performance from its products, but also great energy efficiency. By having control over the lowest level of the hardware, Apple can tie it all together in a package that was simply impossible to do with third-party chips. If cellular modems gets you excited, you’ll be thrilled with the upcoming iPhone SE.Willis Lai/IDG It also speaks to a major part of Apple’s philosophy: that if something is important to your bottom line, you do it yourself. And so 2025 is reportedly going to see the next step along that path as Apple brings another key technology in-house: cellular modems. The company bought Intel’s modem business way back in 2019, and rumors have sprung eternal that it would incorporate its own cellular radios into its products ever since. But reports have also suggested that the engineering has proved more complicated than expected, hence continued deals with rival Qualcomm to use their modems. The time, however, may finally arrive in the form of an unassuming product: the fourth-generation iPhone SE. The low-cost iPhone, expected to be announced in the spring, may be the first to feature an Apple-built modem. That’s a canny move, since the SE isn’t subject to nearly the same scrutiny as Apple’s flagship phone models, and probably doesn’t ship in the same number of units. It gives Apple time to deal with unexpected problems without necessarily tanking its biggest product launch of the year. And even if its modem performance in the SE doesn’t match up to the iPhone 16 line, well, SE customers are likely to be a less performance-conscious market than those buying the latest and greatest phones. Eventually those modems will probably make it into other Apple products, including iPads and Apple Watches and maybe, for the first time, Mac laptops. But it all starts with the little iPhone SE that could. The rest Of course, 2025 will bring the usual other assortment of Apple news. We’ll see the last tranche of previously announced Apple Intelligence features, a likely revamp to the base-level iPad, and the debut of the M5 processor line. More recently we’ve also seen rumors of an updated HomePod mini and a revised Apple TV. But the biggest questions that remain for me are about the future of Apple’s software platforms. Will the impact of Europe’s Digital Markets Act continue to spread around the world, forcing Apple to change some of its longstanding business practices? Will we see the next step in the evolution of the Vision hardware, showing us Apple’s plan to push the line forward and bring it to more customers? And what will Apple focus on in its platform updates this year—will AI still be the name of the game or will that bubble burst? 2025 promises to be an exciting year for Apple and the tech industry, so buckle in: it’s going to be a bumpy ride.",

    "title": "Ten years of Overcast: A new foundation",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2024/07/16/overcast-rewrite",
    "description": "Today, on the tenth anniversary of Overcast 1.0, I’m happy to launch a complete rewrite and redesign of most of the iOS app, built to carry Overcast into the next decade — and hopefully beyond. Like podcasts better than blog posts? Listen to ATP #596 for more! What’s new Much faster, more responsive, more reliable, and more accessible. Modern design, optimized for easily-reached controls on today’s phone sizes. Improvements throughout, such as undoing large seeks, new playlist-priority options, easier navigation, and more. What’s not Most features. Overcast is still Overcast! The audio engine. It’s the best part of Overcast, and still leads the industry in sound quality, silence skipping, and volume normalization. (More soon!) The business. I’m still a one-person operation, with no funding or external ownership, serving only my customers. My principles. I always want to make the best podcast app, and I’ll never disrespect your time, attention, or privacy. What’s gone Streaming. Most big podcasts now use dynamic ad insertion, which causes bugs and problems for streaming playback.1 Downloading episodes completely before they begin playback is much more reliable. Tapping a non-downloaded episode will now open the playback screen, download it, then start playback. It works similarly to the way streaming did before, but playback begins after the download completes, not after a portion of it is buffered. On today’s fast networks, this usually only takes a few extra seconds. And in the near future, I’ll be adding smarter options and more control over selective downloading of episodes to further improve the experience for people who don’t automatically download every episode. What’s next The last few missing features from the old app, such as Shortcuts support, storage management, and OPML. These are absent now, but will return soon. More options for downloading and deleting episodes. Upgrading the Apple Watch app to the new, faster sync engine. (The Watch app is currently unchanged from the previous one.) And, of course, more features, including some of your most-requested features over the last decade. Getting this rewrite out the door was a monumental task. Thank you for your patience as I work through this list! Why? Most of Overcast’s core code was 10 years old, which made it cumbersome or impossible to easily move with the times, adopt new iOS functionality, or add new features, especially as one person. That’s why there haven’t been many new features or changes in years. You saw it, and I saw it. I wasn’t able to serve my customers as well as I wanted. For Overcast to have a future, it needed a modern foundation for its second decade. I’ve spent the past 18 months rebuilding most of the app with Swift, SwiftUI, Blackbird, and modern Swift concurrency. Now, development is rapidly accelerating. I’m more responsive, iterating more quickly, and ultimately making the app much better. Thank you all so much for the first decade of Overcast. Here’s to the next one. Dynamic ad insertion (DAI) splices ads into each download, and no two downloads are guaranteed to have the same number or duration of ads. So, for example, if the first half of an episode downloads, then the download fails, and it downloads the second half with another request, the combined audio may jump forward or back at the halfway mark, losing or repeating content. ↩︎",

    "title": "The Overcast Redesign: Part One",
    "link": "https://marco.org/2022/03/25/overcast-redesign-2022",
    "description": "Overcast’s latest update (2022.2) brings the largest redesign in its nearly-eight-year history, plus many of the most frequently requested features and lots of under-the-hood improvements. I’m pretty proud of this one. For this first and largest phase of the redesign, I focused on the home screen, playlist screen, typography, and spacing. (I plan to revamp the now-playing and individual-podcast screens in a later update.) The home screen is radically different: Home screen, before (left) and after (right). Playlists now have strong visual identities for nicer and easier navigation. Each playlist has a customizable color, and a custom icon can be selected from over 3,000 SF Symbols to match modern iOS design and the other icons within Overcast. And playlists can be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. Recently played and newly published episodes can now be displayed on the home screen for quick access, much like the widget and CarPlay experience. Podcasts can now be pinned to the top of the home-screen list. Pinned podcasts can also be manually reordered with drag-and-drop. I’ve also rethought the old stacked “Podcasts” and “Played Podcasts” sections to better match people’s needs and expectations. Now, the toggle atop the podcast list switches between three modes: podcasts with current episodes, all followed podcasts, and inactive podcasts (those that you don’t follow and therefore won’t get any more episodes from, or haven’t posted a new episode in a long time). The playlist screen’s structure remains mostly the same, while refining the design for the modern era: Playlist screen, before (left) and after (right). Here, it’s more apparent that I’ve replaced the system San Francisco font with an alternate variant, San Francisco Rounded, to increase legibility and better match the personality of the app. I’ve also added highly demanded features: By far, Overcast’s most-requested feature is a Mark as Played feature. That’s now available as a checkmark button on episode rows, as well as a left-side swipe action. The second-most-requested feature is a way to view all starred episodes. Special playlists for Starred, Downloaded, and In Progress can now be created. The light and dark themes now each have a customizable tint color from the modern iOS UI-color palette, including these favorites from beta testers: And throughout the app, I’ve made tons of tweaks and bug fixes, including: Notifications and background downloads are now much more reliable. Episode downloads can now be individually deleted or re-downloaded. Links can now be opened in Safari. (under Nitpicky Details) Performance is now significantly better with very large playlists and collections. Fixed bugs with episode-duration detection, CarPlay lists, Mac-app sharing, and much more. So much is better in this update that I can’t even remember it all. Thank you so much to everyone who helped me beta-test this massive update. As always, Overcast is free in the App Store. Go get it!",
