At AL Marketing, we specialise in retail and destination marketing, and we know first-hand how powerful seasonal campaigns can be in creating memorable customer experiences and strengthening brand loyalty. Why Easter Matters for Shopping Centres 1️⃣ Springboard for Spring Sales – Easter signals the start of spring shopping, making it a natural time for consumers to refresh wardrobes, home décor, and seasonal gifting. Promotions, discounts, and in-store experiences encourage customers to browse, stay longer, and spend more. 2️⃣ Family Footfall Driver – With schools on a break, parents are actively looking for places to take their children. Hosting Easter egg hunts, craft workshops, and themed entertainment ensures that families choose your shopping centre as their go-to destination, leading to increased dwell time and secondary spending. 3️⃣ Community Engagement \u0026 PR Opportunities – Easter campaigns offer a fantastic chance to connect with the local community. From charity initiatives like Easter egg donations to engaging social media competitions, these activities not only create goodwill but also generate positive press coverage and organic online engagement. 4️⃣ Social Media \u0026 Digital Buzz – Easter-themed content performs exceptionally well across digital platforms. From playful April Fools’ stunts (like our award-winning Bug Bistro campaign for The Harvey Centre) to influencer collaborations and Instagrammable in-centre displays, Easter provides fresh opportunities to boost online reach and engagement. 5️⃣ Footfall Conversion into Long-Term Loyalty – A well-executed Easter campaign doesn’t just deliver short-term gains—it helps build long-term relationships. Customers who enjoy their experience during Easter are more likely to return throughout the year, driving repeat visits and fostering loyalty. How AL Marketing Delivers Standout Easter Campaigns We understand that every shopping centre has unique goals and audiences, which is why our approach is tailored to each location. Whether it’s large-scale immersive experiences, influencer-led social media activations, or high-impact PR campaigns, we know how to maximise the potential of seasonal events like Easter to drive real results.",
