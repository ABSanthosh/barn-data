  "text": "Posted by Matthew McCullough – Vice President, Product Management, Android Developer We just dropped an I/O Edition of The Android Show, where we unpacked exciting new experiences coming to the Android ecosystem: a fresh and dynamic look and feel, smarts across your devices, and enhanced safety and security features. Join Sameer Samat, President of Android Ecosystem, and the Android team to learn about exciting new development in the episode below, and read about all of the updates for users. Tune into Google I/O next week – including the Developer Keynote as well as the full Android track of sessions – where we’re covering these topics in more detail and how you can get started. Start building with Material 3 Expressive The world of UX design is constantly evolving, and you deserve the tools to create truly engaging and impactful experiences. That’s why Material Design’s latest evolution, Material 3 Expressive, provides new ways to make your product more engaging, easy to use, and desirable. Learn more, and try out the new Material 3 Expressive: an expansion pack designed to enhance your app’s appeal by harnessing emotional UX, making it more engaging, intuitive, and desirable for users. It comes with new components, motion-physics system, type styles, colors, shapes and more. Material 3 Expressive will be coming to Android 16 later this year; check out the Google I/O talk next week where we’ll dive into this in more detail. A fluid design built for your watch's round display Wear OS 6, arriving later this year, brings Material 3 Expressive design to Google’s smartwatch platform. New design language puts the round watch display at the heart of the experience, and is embraced in every single component and motion of the System, from buttons to notifications. You'll be able to try new visual design and upgrade existing app experiences to a new level. Next week, tune in to the What’s New in Android session to learn more. Plus some goodies in Android 16... We also unpacked some of the latest features coming to users in Android 16, which we’ve been previewing with you for the last few months. If you haven’t already, you can try out the latest Beta of Android 16. A few new features that Android 16 adds which developers should pay attention to are Live updates, professional media and camera features, desktop windowing for tablets, major accessibility enhancements and much more: Live Updates allow your app to show time-sensitive progress updates. Use the new ProgressStyle template for an improved experience around navigation, deliveries, and rideshares. Professional media and camera features include hybrid auto exposure, precise color temperature and tint adjustments, night mode scene detection, and support for the new Advanced Professional Video format. Watch the What’s New in Android session and the Live updates talk to learn more. Tune in next week to Google I/O This was just a preview of some Android-related news, so remember to tune in next week to Google I/O, where we’ll be diving into a range of Android developer topics in a lot more detail. You can check out What’s New in Android and the full Android track of sessions to start planning your time. We can’t wait to see you next week, whether you’re joining in person or virtually from anywhere around the world!",
