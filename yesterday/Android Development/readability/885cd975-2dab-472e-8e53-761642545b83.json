  "text": "Posted by Robbie McLachlan, Developer Marketing Earlier this year #WeArePlay went on a virtual tour of Australia and the U.S. to spotlight the stories of app and game founders. Today, we’re rounding up our tour across the world with the last stop for 2024: Japan. From an app that uses AI to promote early health intervention to one that’s turning litter picking into a social movement, meet the 49 apps and games founders building growing businesses on Google Play. Let’s take a quick road trip across Japan by reading some of my favorite stories. Fujio, founder of Pirika Tokoyo, Tokyo Fujio’s app is turning litter collection into a global movement When Fujio was a child, his love for environmental books ignited his passion for protecting nature. Later, while traveling through different countries, he was shocked to find litter everywhere, even in remote jungles. This experience inspired him to create Pirika – named after the Ainu word for “beautiful” – a social platform that encourages people to pick up litter, document it with photos, and geotag locations to track problem areas. With over over 360 million pieces of trash collected globally, Pirika is fostering a nationwide movement towards cleaner communities. Fujio plans on expanding the app’s reach worldwide, mobilizing communities to fight pollution collectively. CHARROOM, founder of CHARROOM Osaka, Kinki Self-taught game developer and illustrator CHARROOM turned her passion for mini-games into a full-time career. Her latest project, Sushi Food Cart, combines two of her favorite things: sushi and cats. In this fun cooking game, players manage a sushi food cart, preparing and serving sushi to customers quickly and accurately. The game features quirky cat characters, time-management challenges, and colorful art. As players progress, they unlock new recipes, upgrades, and meet new cat characters. For Char, creating apps is her ‘ikigai’—her purpose in life. She’s currently working on a new restaurant game to continue spreading her playful approach to gaming. Kota and Yoshinori, co-founders founders of Ubie Tokyo, Tokyo Kota and Yoshinori’s app uses AI to help people research their health concerns and connect with medical specialists When entrepreneur Kota decided to create a healthcare app, he partnered with his high school friend and roommate, Dr. Yoshinori. Combining Kota’s tech expertise with Yoshinori’s medical knowledge, they developed Ubie, an AI-powered symptom checker that allows people to research their symptoms and connect with medical specialists. The app promotes early detection and intervention by offering them tailored information on potential health concerns and guidance on finding care. Ubie's goal is not just limited to symptom checking; the founders plan to expand its services to include tracking treatments and managing day-to-day healthcare needs alongside transforming Ubie into a global brand. Takuji and Shohei, co-founders of IzumiArtisan Osaka, Kinki Takuji has always been passionate about travel and music, but when he learned programming 15 years ago, he discovered a new creative outlet. Together with his brother, Shohei, he launched IzumiArtisan from their parents' house in Osaka. The duo specializes in creating escape room games, heavily influenced by the detective stories Takuji loves. Their popular game, Rime, is filled with mysterious puzzles and plot twists and has been translated into 18 languages, capturing a global audience. The brothers are now working on a new title inspired by the American Underground Railroad. Discover more #WeArePlay stories from Japan, and stories from across the globe.
