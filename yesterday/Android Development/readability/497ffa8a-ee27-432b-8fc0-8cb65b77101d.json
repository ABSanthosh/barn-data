  "text": "Posted by Tatiana van Maaren – Global T\u0026S Partnerships Lead, Privacy \u0026 Security, and Roxanna Aliabadi Walker – Product Manager At Google Play, we're dedicated to building user trust, especially when it comes to sensitive permissions and your data. We understand that managing files and media permissions can be confusing, and users often worry about which files apps can access. Since these files often contain sensitive information like family photos or financial documents, it's crucial that users feel in control. That’s why we're working to provide clearer choices, so users can confidently grant permissions without sacrificing app functionality or their privacy. Below are a set of best practices to consider for improving user trust in the sharing of broad access files, ultimately leading to a more successful and sustainable app ecosystem. Prioritize user privacy with data minimization Building user trust starts with requesting only the permissions essential for your app's core functions. We understand that photos and videos are sensitive data, and broad access increases security risks. That's why Google Play now restricts READ_MEDIA_IMAGES and READ_MEDIA_VIDEO permissions, allowing developers to request them only when absolutely necessary, typically for apps like photo/video managers and galleries. Leverage privacy-friendly solutions Instead of requesting broad storage access, we encourage developers to use the Android Photo Picker, introduced in Android 13. This tool offers a privacy-centric way for users to select specific media files without granting access to their entire library. Android photo picker provides an intuitive interface, including access to cloud-backed photos and videos, and allows for customization to fit your app's needs. In addition, this system picker is backported to Android 4.4, ensuring a consistent experience for all users. By eliminating runtime permissions, Android photo picker simplifies the user experience and builds trust through transparency. Build trust through transparent data practices We understand that some developers have historically used custom photo pickers for tailored user experiences. However, regardless of whether you use a custom or system picker, transparency with users is crucial. Users want to know why your app needs access to their photos and videos. Developers should strive to provide clear and concise explanations within their apps, ideally at the point where the permission is requested. Take the following in consideration while crafting your permission request mechanisms as possible best practices guidelines: When requesting media access, provide clear explanations within your app. Specifically, tell users which media your app needs (e.g., all photos, profile pictures, sharing videos) and explain the functionality that relies on it (e.g., 'To choose a profile picture,' 'To share videos with friends'). Clearly outline how user data will be used and protected in your privacy policies. Explain whether data is stored locally, transmitted to a server, or shared with third parties. Reassure users that their data will be handled responsibly and securely. Learn how Snap has embraced the Android System Picker to prioritize user privacy and streamline their media selection experience. Here's what they have to say about their implementation: “One of our goals is to provide a seamless and intuitive communication experience while ensuring Snapchatters have control over their content. The new flow of the Android Photo Picker is the perfect balance of providing user control of the content they want to share while ensuring fast communication with friends on Snapchat.” – Marc Brown, Product Manager Get started Start building a more trustworthy app experience.
