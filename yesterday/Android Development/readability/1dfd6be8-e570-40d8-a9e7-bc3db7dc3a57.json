  "text": "News Read this post in other languages: All JetBrains AI tools – including our improved AI Assistant and new coding agent Junie – are now available within our IDEs under a single subscription and come with a free tier. Ever since we started, more than 25 years ago, our aim has been to make developers more productive and to bring more joy to software development through smarter, more efficient tools. And now that AI is pretty much everywhere in our daily lives, that mission is all the more important. AI is totally revolutionizing software development and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The breakneck speed at which AI-based development tools are being implemented in our industry has led to a wave of innovation that nobody would have thought possible until very recently. Now, we developers, are the ones stepping up to overcome the biggest challenges facing the world today – and that’s exactly how it should be! This new normal is a huge opportunity and one that JetBrains intends to make the absolute most of. We will do everything we can to make it right for you regardless of your desired level of autonomy – no matter how much or how little AI you want to use in your projects. With AI taking care of basic coding tasks, you’ll be able to let your creativity run wild and stay focused on the bigger picture, beyond code. Our approach to AI is to leverage the very best innovations – whether developed internally or sourced from our partners – ensuring developers have access to reliable, cutting-edge tools. “JetBrains and Anthropic share a commitment to transforming how developers work. Developers rely on Claude’s state-of-the-art performance in solving complex, real-world coding tasks. We’re excited to see how Junie, powered by Claude, will help the global developer community create innovative things within the trusted JetBrains IDEs that customers love.” Mike Krieger, Chief Product Officer, Anthropic “As JetBrains’ first AI partner, we’ve witnessed firsthand their ongoing commitment to enhancing developer productivity and innovation. Junie is set to unlock exciting new possibilities for developers globally, and we look forward to our ongoing partnership as JetBrains continues to redefine the developer experience.” Nicolai Skabo, Head of EMEA, OpenAI “Google partnership with JetBrains spans many joint initiatives over the years, including our recent collaboration to build the global infrastructure for JetBrains AI – spanning three continents, leveraging Google Cloud’s AI Hypercomputer and global network backbone. Witnessing JetBrains AI’s rapid evolution, innovation, and scale has been amazing. We’re excited to continue collaborating to ensure 11.4M of developers around the world benefit from the low latency, responsiveness, and high reliability of JetBrains AI.” Nirav Mehta, Sr. Director of Product Management, Google Cloud  With the integration of our AI tools into JetBrains IDEs, we have taken another major step toward redefining what it means to be a developer in the AI era. All JetBrains AI tools under a single subscription with a free tier Now, all of our JetBrains AI tools – including AI Assistant and our powerful coding agent Junie – are available under a single subscription. This makes access to the products easier and ensures a consistent experience across your favorite IDEs. To make in-IDE AI features available to everyone, starting with the 2025.1 versions, we’re including a JetBrains AI free tier with all of our IDE licenses. The AI Free tier gives you unlimited code completion and access to local AI models, as well as credit-based use of cloud-based AI assistance and our coding agent, Junie. The AI Pro and AI Ultimate tiers provide increased usage quotas for demanding workflows. On top of all that, the All Products Pack and dotUltimate subscriptions will now come with AI Pro included. Regardless of the tier you choose, your data stays yours. JetBrains AI features are built with a strong focus on privacy, security, and transparency – so you can work confidently, knowing your code and context remain protected. Get started with AI in IDEs today. Junie is now available to all users of JetBrains IDEs We created our powerful AI coding agent, Junie, to redefine the way you code by giving you a willing virtual collaborator right in the IDE. JetBrains Junie is now publicly available to all our IDE users. Since we announced Junie in January 2025, we have seen strong demand for our Early Access Program. Participants have used Junie for a range of things, from fully delegating routine tasks to it to collaborating with it to achieve more complex ones together. With the combined power of JetBrains IDEs, coupled with Anthropic’s Claude and Open AI LLMs, Junie is already able to solve problems that would otherwise require hours of work. In this latest release, Junie has been improved to perform even more complex tasks and offer even finer control for a genuine human-in-the-loop approach. Junie is now a full-fledged pair programmer that can answer questions, propose a plan to the user, and follow development guidelines. As well as bringing greater productivity, Junie is designed to raise the bar for code quality. So, in addition to helping you get more done faster, Junie will also help enhance the standard of your code. This means you can use the time saved to review more complex issues, staying focused on the big picture without being distracted by mundane tasks. Junie is already compatible with IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, PyCharm Pro, WebStorm, and GoLand. PhpStorm, RustRover, and RubyMine will also soon be supported. Learn more about Junie by JetBrains. A smarter and more powerful AI Assistant in JetBrains IDEs In addition to the public launch of Junie, we’ve also released a new version of JetBrains AI Assistant. The latest update includes major improvements designed to accelerate coding workflows and reduce repetitive tasks, supporting developers throughout the entire development process. Thanks to your valuable feedback, we’ve been able to enhance AI Assistant to make it even more intuitive and powerful, bringing to life many of your most anticipated features. Now, AI Assistant comes with expanded model options, including support for the latest cloud models like Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, and latest OpenAI models, as well as improved local model integration for enhanced privacy and control. The new version delivers improved code completion and greater context awareness for more accurate suggestions that are tailored to your project. What’s more, our new edit mode enables seamless multi-file edits directly from the chat interface, making it easier to apply complex changes, refactor code, and streamline maintenance while keeping full control of your project. AI Assistant has also been updated to provide you with smarter support across the entire workflow, from code generation and testing to documentation and debugging, ensuring a smoother and more efficient experience.
