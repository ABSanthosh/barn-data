  "text": "Posted by Dan Brown – Product Manager, Google Play Google Play empowers you to manage and distribute your innovative and trusted apps and games to billions of users around the world across the entire breadth of Android devices, and historically, all Android devices have managed memory in 4 KB pages. As device manufacturers equip devices with more RAM to optimize performance, many will adopt larger page sizes like 16 KB. Android 15 introduces support for the increased page size, ensuring your app can run on these evolving devices and benefit from the associated performance gains. Starting November 1st, 2025, all new apps and updates to existing apps submitted to Google Play and targeting Android 15+ devices must support 16 KB page sizes. This is a key technical requirement to ensure your users can benefit from the performance enhancements on newer devices and prepares your apps for the platform's future direction of improved performance on newer hardware. Without recompiling to support 16 KB pages, your app might not function correctly on these devices when they become more widely available in future Android releases. We’ve seen that 16 KB can help with: Faster app launches: See improvements ranging from 3% to 30% for various apps. Improved battery usage: Experience an average gain of 4.5%. Quicker camera starts: Launch the camera 4.5% to 6.6% faster. Speedier system boot-ups: Boot Android devices approximately 8% faster. We recommend checking your apps early especially for dependencies that might not yet be 16 KB compatible. Many popular SDK providers, like React Native and Flutter, already offer compatible versions. For game developers, several leading game engines, such as Unity, support 16 KB, with support for Unreal Engine coming soon. Reaching 16 KB compatibility A substantial number of apps are already compatible, so your app may already work seamlessly with this requirement. For most of those that need to make adjustments, we expect the changes to be minimal. Apps with no native code should be compatible without any changes at all. Apps using libraries or SDKs that contain native code may need to update these to a compatible version. Apps with native code may need to recompile with a more recent toolchain and check for any code with incompatible low level memory management. Our December blog post, Get your apps ready for 16 KB page size devices, provides a more detailed technical explanation and guidance on how to prepare your apps. Check your app's compatibility now It's easy to see if your app bundle already supports 16 KB memory page sizes. Visit the app bundle explorer page in Play Console to check your app's build compliance and get guidance on where your app may need updating. Beyond the app bundle explorer, make sure to also test your app in a 16 KB environment. This will help you ensure users don’t experience any issues and that your app delivers its best performance. For more information, check out the full documentation. Thank you for your continued support in bringing delightful, fast, and high-performance experiences to users across the breadth of devices Play supports. We look forward to seeing the enhanced experiences you'll deliver with 16 KB support.",
