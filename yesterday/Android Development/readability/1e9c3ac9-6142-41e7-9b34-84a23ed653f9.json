  "text": "Posted by Daniel Trócoli – Google Play Partnerships We're thrilled to announce the return of Google Play's Indie Games Fund (IGF) in Latin America for its fourth consecutive year! This year, we're once again committing $2 million to empower another 10 indie game studios across the region. With this latest round of funding, our total investment in Latin American indie games will reach an impressive $8 million USD. Since its inception, the IGF has been a cornerstone of our commitment to fostering growth for developers of all sizes on Google Play. We've seen firsthand the transformative impact this support has had, enabling studios to expand their teams, refine their creations, and reach new audiences globally. What's in store for the Indie Games Fund in 2025? Just like in previous years, selected small game studios based in Latin America will receive a share of the $2 million fund, along with support from the Google Play team. As Vish Game Studio, a previously selected studio, shared: \"The IGF was a pivotal moment for our studio, boosting us to the next level and helping us form lasting connections.\" We believe in fostering these kinds of pivotal moments for all our selected studios. The program is open to indie game developers who have already launched a game, whether it's on Google Play, another mobile platform, PC, or console. Each selected recipient will receive between $150,000 and $200,000 to help them elevate their game and realize their full potential. Check out all eligibility criteria and apply now! Applications will close at 12:00 PM BRT on July 31, 2025. To give your application the best chance, remember that priority will be given to applications received by 12:00 PM BRT on July 15, 2025.",
