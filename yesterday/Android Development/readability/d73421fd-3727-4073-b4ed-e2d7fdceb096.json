JetBrains is excited to once again be part of this event, and we invite you to visit our booth to explore how our tools can enhance your game development workflow. At our booth, you’ll have the opportunity to see our game development solutions in action. Our team will be showcasing live demos tailored to different technologies. Whether you’re working with Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot, or your own custom tools, we’ll help you discover ways to improve your productivity. Don’t miss the chance to test your knowledge of Rider shortcuts. It’s a fun way to see how well you know the tool and pick up a few new tricks along the way. You can also take part in our poll wall, where we’re asking one big question: Which game engine is the most popular? Share your opinion, cast your vote, and grab a special pin as a token of appreciation. Beyond demos and challenges, we welcome discussions on game development, workflows, and potential collaborations. Whether you have specific questions about JetBrains products or just want to chat about industry trends, our team is happy to connect. Find us in West Hall, Level 2, booth #WL2-1. We look forward to seeing you in San Francisco! See you there! Subscribe to JetBrains Blog updates",
