  "text": "Posted by JJ Zou – Product Manager, and Scott Lin – Product Manager At Google Play, we're committed to empowering you with the tools and resources you need to build successful and secure apps that users can rely on. That's why we're introducing a new way to recognize VPN apps that go above and beyond to protect their users: a \"Verified\" badge for consumer-facing VPN apps. This new badge is designed to highlight apps that prioritize user privacy and safety, help users make more informed choices about the VPN apps they use, and build confidence in the apps they ultimately download. This badge complements existing features such as the Google Play Store banner for VPNs and Data Safety section declaration in the Play Store. Build user trust with more transparency Earning the VPN badge isn't just about checking a box— it's proof that your VPN app invests in app safety. This badge signifies that your app has gone above and beyond, adhering to the Play safety and security guidelines and successfully completed a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation. The VPN badge helps your app stand out in a crowded marketplace. Once awarded, the badge is prominently displayed on your app’s details page and in search results. Additionally, we have built new surfaces to showcase verified VPN applications. Demonstrating commitment to security and safety We're excited to share insights from some of our partners who have already earned the VPN badge and are leading the way in building a safe and trusted Google Play ecosystem. Learn how partners like NordVPN, hide.me, and Aloha are using the badge and implementing best practices for user security: NordVPN “We’re excited that the new ‘Verified’ badge will help users easily identify VPNs that meet high standards for security and privacy. In a market where trust is key, this badge not only provides reassurance to customers, but also highlights the integrity of developers committed to delivering secure and reliable products.” hide.me “Privacy and user safety are fundamental to our VPN's architecture. The MASA program has been valuable in validating our security practices and maintaining high standards. This accreditation provides independent verification of our commitment to protecting user privacy.” Aloha Browser “The certification process is well-organized and accessible to any company. If your product is developed with security as a core focus, passing the required audits should not pose any difficulty. We regularly conduct third-party audits and have been active participants in the MASA program since its inception. Additionally, it fosters discipline in your development practices, knowing that regular re-certification is required. Ultimately, it’s the end user who benefits the most—a secure and satisfied user is the ultimate goal for every app developer.” Getting your App Badge-Ready To take advantage of this opportunity to enhance your app's profile and attract more users, learn more about the specific criteria and start the validation process today. To be considered for the \"Verified\" badge, your VPN app needs to: Complete a Mobile Application Security Assessment (MASA) Level 2 validation Have an Organization developer account type Meet target API level requirements for Google Play apps Have at least 10,000 installs and 250 reviews Be published on Google Play for at least 90 days Submit a Data Safety section declaration, opting into: Independent security review, under ‘Additional badges’ Encryption in transit Note: This list is not exhaustive and doesn't fully represent all the criteria used to display the badge. While other factors contribute to the evaluation, fulfilling these requirements significantly increases your chances of seeing your VPN app “Verified.” Join us in our mission to create a safer and more transparent Google Play ecosystem. We're here to support you with the tools and resources you need to build trusted apps.",
