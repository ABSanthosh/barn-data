I will present it to you.We will also continue our series about dispatchers. Before that, I would like to show something tasty for all Kotlin developers, including those who do not use coroutines ‚Äî how to sort elements by multiple keys.Enjoy!Sorting elements by multiple keysDo you sometimes need to sort elements by more than one key? Like when you have users and you want to sort them by surname, and by name if equal surnames. Or to sort posts first by day, then by popularity, etc. That can be achieved with functions sortedWith and compareBy.compareBy creates a comparator, an object that decides what is an order, that can be stored separately. Many classes define some number of universal comparators. Comparators can be connected together with functions like thenBy.Coroutines races gameDo you like games? I do üéÆ but even more I like coroutines, so I created a game that test you coroutines understanding. However, I must warn you, it is not easy. On KotlinConf I gave some people a challenge ‚Äî readh 10th level on the Adventure mode to get a book. Some people spent over 4 hours playing it to achieve this level! Are you going to be better than that?Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶Here is a link to play this game.If you want to read more about this game, click here.Coroutines races gameUsing IO dispatcher for blocking callsOne of the most misunderstood dispatchers is Dispatchers.IO, which should be used for blocking operations like:Operations on files.Network/Database operations that use blocking API.Calls of library functions that explicitly block threads.We typically use Dispatchers.IO by wrapping blocking operations with withContext(Dispatchers.IO). withContext is a suspending function that suspends the current coroutine and starts a new one with a different context. This way, such a wrapper function can be safely used from any thread.Beware that suspended API calls do not need to be called from Dispatchers.IO, as it is the library‚Äôs responsibility not to block callers.More about it, and how to check and verify if a function is safe to be called without changing dispatcher on the Coroutines Master workshop.Apparently IO dispatcher is not always enough for blocking calls. I will explain that in the next issue.Hope you liked it.If you did, give it a clap üëèMarcin MoskalaKt. Academy",
