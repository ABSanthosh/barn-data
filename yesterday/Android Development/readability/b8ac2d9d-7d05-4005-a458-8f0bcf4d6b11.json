  "text": "Posted by Robbie McLachlan – Developer Marketing In a year filled with iconic sports moments—from the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris to the UEFA Euro Cup in Germany—our celebration of app and game businesses continues with nine new #WeArePlay stories. These founders are building sports apps and games that unite players, fans, and communities—from immersive sports simulations to apps that motivate runners with rewards like vouchers and free gifts. Let’s take a look at some of my favourites. Immerse yourself into your favourite sport with Hao, Yukun, and Mingming's simulator games Hao, Yukun and Mingming, co-founders of Feamber GamesChengdu, China Hao always dreamed of creating video games. After studying computer science, he joined a gaming company where he met Yukun and Mingming. Their shared passion for game design and long conversations about graphics, movie scenes, and nostalgic childhood games inspired them to start Feamber Games. Specializing in realistic 3D sports simulations like pool and archery, they’ve added competitive elements to enhance the experience. Recently, they’ve expanded into immersive games that let players build business empires and manage hotels. Now, the trio is focused on growing their global audience. Anna’s boxing fitness app is a knockout, with tailored training and on-demand classes Anna, founder of BoxxLondon, UK Anna discovered her love for boxing at 11, staying dedicated to non-contact training throughout adulthood. After a career in accounting and becoming a mother, she struggled to attend classes, inspiring her to create Boxx – an app that brings boxing training to any location. Collaborating with fitness instructors, she developed personalized sessions, hybrid workouts, expert-led on-demand classes, and progress tracking. With hands-free guided audio and community features coming soon, Anna is regularly reviewing feedback to find innovative approaches to improve boxers’ experiences. Get active and track your progress with Yi Hern, Dana, and Pearl's running app Yi Hern, co-founder of JomRunCyberjaya, Malaysia After creating a successful augmented reality game, childhood friends Yi Hern, Dana, and Pearl decided to inspire people to stay active. Combining Yi Hern's engineering skills, Dana's visual arts expertise, and Pearl's scientific background, they developed JomRun – Let’s Run. The app allows runners to track their progress, earn rewards like vouchers and free gifts, and easily join marathons. With teams in Malaysia and Singapore, and plans to introduce new features, the trio is gearing up to expand across Southeast Asia. Ohjun and Jaeho’s volleyball game get high scores from players worldwide Ohjun and Jaeho, co-founders of SUNCYANSeoul, South Korea Ohjun and Jaeho, childhood friends from an online game development community, combined their love for game building and volleyball to create The Spike - Volleyball Story. After a successful test release on Google Play, the game gained popularity in South Korea, inspiring them to improve it and reach a global audience. They added new features like story and tournament modes, plus a complete UX overhaul, all to recreate the excitement of real-life volleyball. Now, they’re focused on creating even more thrilling sports games. How useful did you find this blog post? ★ ★ ★ ★ ★",
