Download the report. Introducing Metro Zac Sweers introduces Metro, a compile-time dependency injection framework inspired by Dagger, Anvil, and Kotlin-Inject, aiming to unify their best features into a cohesive solution implemented as a compiler plugin. Routines to Coroutines: How Kotlin Revolutionized Asynchronous Programming Ninad Bhase explains how Kotlin’s coroutines enhance asynchronous programming by introducing suspendable functions and non-blocking operations, enabling concurrent execution that overcomes the blocking limitations of traditional subroutines. Sponsored Advertise to more than 80k Android developers! We reach out to more than 80k Android developers around the world, every week, through our email newsletter and social media channels. Advertise your Android development related service or product! Generics in Kotlin Anthony provides an overview of generics in Kotlin, explaining their role in creating flexible and type-safe code, and delving into concepts such as type parameters, variance (including invariant, covariant, and contravariant types), and best practices for their use.
