    "link": "https://fragmentedpodcast.com/",
    "description": "In this episode of our podcast, we explore the diverse landscape of Java versions within the Android ecosystem. Our guest is Michael Bailey, a seasoned Java expert who has been a frequent presence on our show since the early days of our podcast. We kick off with a solid foundation, discussing the differences between JDK and JRE, as well as the distinctions between the available Java JDKs. We also guide listeners through Android Studio settings, exploring how to select a suitable JDK, its utilization, and how it relates to JAVA_VERSION on one's home path/terminal.As we dig deeper, we start to unpack some of the crucial Android app settings. From compileOptions to sourceCompatibility/targetCompatibility, we shed light on why these versions are important. We also demystify the compileSdk vs minSdk vs targetSdk, and how they interconnect. Drawing from Kaushiks's recent experience in building a new app, we provide real-life examples that can better clarify these topics for our listeners.We conclude the episode by providing some valuable resources for further understanding and exploration. This episode is designed to be a comprehensive guide to understanding and navigating the intricacies of Java versions in Android development.LinksMichaely Fragmented Episode 9 (Google IO Special)Fragmented Episode 10 (core java)Fragmented Episode 78 (testing strategies)OpenJDK on GitHubFooJayCompile Options ReferenceSDK extensions@Yogurtearl explanationJpackageFind Michael Online@yogurtearl on TwitterDonn's Git CourseNeed to learn Git?

    "link": "https://fragmentedpodcast.com/",
    "description": "In this edition of Fragmented, we're thrilled to host Ishan Khanna, a software engineer at Tinder who possesses great enthusiasm for feature flags and A/B testing. Donn discusses why he invited Ishan on the show, highlighting Ishan's passion for feature flagging and A/B testing. The conversation kicks off with an insightful story from Ishan about feature flagging at Booking.com, leading to a discussion on the difference between A/B Testing and Feature Flags, when and why to introduce feature flagging, and how to measure its effectiveness. The show also focuses on the benefits and risks of feature flagging, along with ways to manage potential complexities in the codebase.We then delve deeper into the topic of feature flagging, covering how to get started, what to look for in a tool, and the role of testing. Discussion points include the best practices for rollout percentages, considerations for multi-platform implementation, and the specifics of targeting in feature flagging. The conversation wraps up with an exploration of available tools for those looking to introduce feature flagging or A/B testing frameworks into their operations, examining when it might be necessary to build a bespoke solution.The episode offers a wealth of resources for listeners, including links to an array of feature flagging and A/B testing tools, such as Firebase Remote Config, Optimizely, and LaunchDarkly. For more insight into the topics discussed, Ishan recommends his Droidcon Berlin talk on 'Customer Driven Development' and Stuart Frisby’s talk on A/B Testing. To reach out to Ishan, listeners can contact him via Twitter, LinkedIn, or his website.LinksHere are the links mentioned in the document, in markdown format:Firebase Remote ConfigOptimizelyLaunchDarklyAWS AppConfig for Feature FlagsVWOUnleash - Open Source Feature FlagsPosthog Feature Flags and A/B TestingIshan's Droidcon Berlin TalkStuart Frisby's Talk on A/B TestingErindoesthingsContact IshanIshan on Twitter - @droidchefIshan on LinkedInIshan's WebsiteDonn's Git CourseNeed to learn Git?
