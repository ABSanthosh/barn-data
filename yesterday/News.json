This autumn, however, there is a new draw: a Nintendo museum.The new attraction, which opens on Wednesday, is best described as a chapel of video game nostalgia. Upstairs, Nintendoâs many video game consoles, from 1983âs Famicom through 1996âs Nintendo 64 to 2017âs Switch, are displayed reverently alongside their most famous games. On the back wall, visitors can also peer at toys, playing cards and other artefacts from the Japanese companyâs pre-video-game history, stretching back to its founding as a hanafuda playing card manufacturer in 1889. Downstairs, there are interactive exhibits with comically gigantic controllers and floor-projected playing cards. Continue reading...",

    "description": "The event, which is celebrating its anniversary, has grown into a global phenomenon â and made us feel a whole lot betterTwenty years ago, on a windy, autumnal Saturday morning, 13 runners showed up to a park in south-west London for an event called the Bushy Park Time Trial. A 5km course was plotted and the organiser, Paul Sinton-Hewitt, a computer programmer who grew up in South Africa, bought washers from a hardware store to hand out as finish tokens. The times were tapped up on a laptop afterwards in a local CaffÃ¨ Nero.This Saturday, the weather hadnât much improved â overcast, with the sun straining to peek through â and the venue was the same: picturesque Bushy Park with its resident red deer squaring up, ready to rut. But pretty much everything else about the impromptu get-together has evolved. Since 2008, it has been known as Parkrun and there are now 2,500 weekly events â all 5km, all free â in 22 countries, everywhere from the slopes of Mount Etna to 25 UK prisons to the Falkland Islands. In a typical week, around 350,000 people will take part. Runnerâs World hails it a âglobal phenomenonâ. Continue reading...",

Itâs also tens of thousands of ordinary members. The Â£39 a year they pay to belong might not entitle them to any real say on the partyâs policies, but it does give them the right to help select its candidates and, even better, its leader.Quite how many individual blades make up the Tory grassroots these days, we wonât know until we learn the result of the membership ballot, which starts on 31 October. In 2019, when Johnson was elected leader, it came in at 159,000. And in 2022, when Liz Truss got the nod, it had actually risen to 172,000. But that was considerably down on the 254,000 who got to choose between Davids Cameron and Davis back in 2005 and way off the 2.8 million members that the party claimed to have at its postwar peak in the mid-1950s.

We will update our averages once a week, or more if there is major news.As the Guardianâs Sam Levine writes today:With her highest national polling average since July, Harris is now leading in five of seven key swing states. Nationally, the Guardianâs tracker shows Harris with 49.3% of the vote, compared with 46% for Trump. The election is a month away, and already an estimated 1.4 million Americans have voted as of midday on Friday.The race is still extremely close. The simplest path to collecting the 270 electoral votes needed to win is still the blue wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. While Harris leads Trump in all three according to the Guardianâs analysis (Pennsylvania by 1.2 points, Michigan by 0.1 points and Wisconsin by 2.2 points), those advantages are quite slim.
