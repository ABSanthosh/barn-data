    "description": "Interview with Matthew McCullough and J. Eason: Explain your role as its evolved with Android over the years. How does your perspective with the Dev tools team compare to other teams and how you interact with Developers? What is the teams perspective on AI in regards to being part of the users experience and the dev experience? What is Studio Bot? What about how devs/companies may be wary of using Studio Bot, like how Apple and Samsung have banned devs from using ChatGPT? Cynical developers might be resistant to this. What's your take on that? What is developer reaction to the AI integration inside of Android Studio? Have you felt a change in interest or engagement with developers and partners as a whole in relation to larger form factors? What has been added to the OS, apis etc that devs can use to build better apps for foldable devices? - What kinds of features are devs NOT integrating for large screens, and they should! Can you comment on what \"Modern Android\" means to the team and how are you prioritizing new features and capabilities with \"fixing\" issues? What are your favorites Android 14 features? Google Is Spared a Search-Engine Switch by a Major Partner. Google Pixel owners are seemingly more likely to switch brands, and it's not hard to see why. Google's Smartphone Loyalty Problem. Gboard for Android preps an easier way to 'Resize'. JR's tip of the week: AppSales. @MishaalRahman: Android 14 prepares to let you save an 'app pair' that launches side-by-side in split-screen mode! @MishaalRahman: Hands-on: I finally got this fully working, so here's a full demo of Android 14's new partial screen recording feature. @MishaalRahman: If you connect a physical keyboard to a large screen device running Android 14, under Settings \u003e System \u003e Keyboard \u003e Physical keyboard, the \"keyboard shortcuts\" menu will now show a MUCH more comprehensive list of available keyboard shortcuts, as shown below! @MishaalRahman: This feature is indeed live in Android 14 Beta 2! User Nick Cipriani shared this image from their Pixel. Oddly, they received this message while playing audio from their Bluetooth speaker and not headphones. @Nail_Sadykov: Looks like Android 14 will finally let you use system navigation while you're dragging \u0026 drop items. That is, you can take a photo or text from one app, open another app and drop it there. QUICK preview of the OnePlus Pad and Pixel 7a.

It’s really good, but here’s a reason why it’s not so great. We have both reviewers of the phone - Kris Carlon and David Imel to talk about the Pixel 4 and the Pixel 4 XL!

The Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is Xiaomi’s latest flagship, packing a 93.4 percent screen-to-body ratio and up to 10GB of RAM. Night Sight on the Google Pixel 3 is the answer to low-light cameras, and it’s a really, really good answer. Google will start charging for Google Play services in the EU, and OEMs will pay a lot, as it turns out. Want to make an Android phone? That’ll be two years of updates, please. The Google Pixel 3 might have some memory management issues. Suddenly 4GB of RAM doesn’t seem like a good idea.

The Android Authority podcast is the weekly podcast where we look at all the top stories from the past seven days and drill down into the details. But in this episode, we are doing something different. This is a different kind of podcast episode which we are calling a featured story. A featured story is where we take a deep dive into one topic. This will be a bonus episode that we’ll do an undetermined number of times, but probably at least once per month. Perhaps it will be interviews with industry leaders.

Stay tuned for a brand new show format coming soon, we want to get you, our faithful listeners, readers and viewers more involved in the show, and we think we have a solution.

Phones, laptops, smart cars, drones and so much more. We all agree that AI is the wave of the future, or at least the goal of the manufacturers and products we experienced at the show. Amazon's Alexa was the name we witnessed more than any other, support for the service was everywhere.  This episode breaks into two segments, with the crew coming to you from the closing moments on the show floor, then join Josh and Jonathan as they discuss the future of the podcast. We have great things coming to the Android Authority Podcast, we can't wait to tell you more. Thank you so much for joining us on this adventure. We hope you enjoyed CES 2017, we certainly did.   The Android Authority Podcast - discussing topics in Android every week.",

In this episode, it's all about the Google Pixel event where we were treated to announcements of the new Google products for 2016. Before getting into the actual devices and announcements, this week's check-in is largely a talk about Craig David, a favorite recording of artist of Josh and Nirave, who performed at the UK Google event (basically, Josh's FOMO was real). From there, however, the guys get into the big discussions - Google Wifi kicks off the event talk as Feist gives his thoughts on what could be a good solution for in-home connectivity. Google Home comes up next, and the general thoughts were that Home poses an interesting new direction for Google's robust and somewhat scary Learning Matrix. Speaking of the Learning Matrix, a tweet from a happy listener makes the guys ponder if Google's design direction for their products simply masks the fact that Google's services - like Google Assistant - are a bit too smart and somewhat terrifying. And finally the guys get into a big discussion regarding the Google Pixel phones and why they might be a little divisive for fans of Google's previous hardware endeavors - basically, it comes down to Pixel vs Nexus.

    "description": "Coming live from E3 2016 in Los Angeles, Josh is joined by Jonathan Feist and heads of VRSource Android Grush and John Velasco (for his first ever podcast!) to talk video games and VR from the trade show floor. Well, not really, because they couldn't record among the different game vendors and displays but instead had to sit in the South Hall Lobby as the final day of the show winded down. With VR taking the spotlight at this year's E3, this episode of the podcast becomes basically a VRSource podcast, but the antics are about as #AAPodcast as it can get. John Velasco fits right into the talks as he recounts experiences with the Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive, and Playstation VR! The rest of the guys also share the fun they had escaping from the real world and embracing all kinds of reality! Head over to VRSource for all the best news on all kinds of reality - and keep it here for the Android Authority Podcast, discussing topics in Android every week.",

The gist of the panels focused on storytelling, the application of VR for more than just the entertainment business, and the future of the next big thing in content creation. In this podcast, however, the three were joined by a native Texan now hailing from Louisiana, writer John Dye. Many of you fans of Android Authority have probably read John's writing on the website and enjoyed his way with words.

Talk about the Samsung Galaxy S7 and LG G5 lead to a spirited discussion on the Launcher situation on Android. Check in to see how these five feel about the idea of removing the app drawer and so much more on this 90 minute special episode.  Our regular hosts will have plenty to say about MWC next week, but for now, enjoy the party atmosphere from the show, and be sure to watch the YouTube version for even more fun. Don't forget to check out the written companion at androidauthority.com.

    "description": "The full panel gets together this week to mull over what was a pretty slow week in Android news - Joe had just put out a great review of Android Marshmallow, so that serves as our platform for the majority of the episode. Jonathan Feist, Andrew Grush, Nirave Gondhia, Joe Hindy, and host Joshua Vergara talk video games, homescreen setups, and even cars for a minute because the Marshmallow conversation just naturally veers in that direction. We know that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but you guys should know by now that the digressions come hard and fast for the AA Podcast crew! But in light of a slow Android news week, we had to talk about the week's biggest news - the return of Windows Mobile. Though Nokia as a company is, for the most part, fully absorbed into Microsoft and virtually unrecognizable, the new Lumia devices did actually get us a little excited for a platform that simply doesn't get a lot of play compared to Android and iOS. Will we dive into the Lumias and do a few off-platform reviews? Only time will tell, but until then we have this conversation about the new announcements.

    "description": "Google recently announced two new Nexus devices, is there anything more to say? Of course there is. Josh leads the entire panel through some talk about school road mayhem, a slight point of contention for Joe and Nirave. Andrew and Jonathan were a little more relaxed about it. Conversation shifts to tablets and TabTimes, ever so briefly, before we dive into the new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. We make the obvious comparisons to other devices like the Moto X Pure and ponder why LG announced the V10 right in the mix. Although not an after thought, Google also announced the Pixel C, a large productivity tablet with keyboard cover, not exactly a game changer, or is it? Join us for this and more, and we hope you have as much fun as we did. (Even though Josh calls it episode #33 in his intro, no worries, it's still the next show.) Enjoy AA Podcast #034.

    "description": "What starts off as a collection of selfie stick belittling, turns into Andrew Grush, Joe Hindy and Nirave Gondhia following along as Jonathan Feist pretends to lead the show. We talk about Blackberry and their new Priv, previously known as Venice, which leads to ribbing Josh while he's not there to defend himself. Google has two new devices coming this week, the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P.  We wanted to say little more on the subject, saving our thoughts for next week, but our discussion on the current leak culture took us right back to the Nexus devices. Will you be purchasing a new Nexus device, or at least holding off another purchase until you see what Google has to offer? Huawei was a recurring topic throughout the show, we all had mostly great things to say about them and their products, leaving us highly anticipating the Nexus 6P, which is also built by Huawei. I hope you have as much fun listening as we did recording. The Android Authority Podcast - discussing topics in Android every week. .",

They think of what the new Android M iteration might be called (and, true to form, Joe comes up with a left-field answer) and then get into what features they would want from the next iteration of Google's mobile operating system. A talk about the newly reviewed LG G4 rounds out the conversation, including a much needed discussion about how we view good battery life.

    "description": "That's right, we've changed the name of our podcast to just FDP. We saw that you guys like the hashtag #FDP and we wanted to keep it, too! And among other reasons, \"Friday Debate\" just didn't make as much sense anymore. So, we are now the FDP - where P stands for Podcast. This week, we have a really special episode with some very special friends. Josh was in NYC for the LG G4 launch event and the couple days were eventual, to say the least - the event itself was at the top of One World Trade Center with stunning views of Manhattan and this podcast was recorded ON A BOAT. A trek to a ship floating off the shores of the Hudson River eventually brought Josh and his guests to what would be the backdrop for this week's FDP. Josh is joined by Michael Fisher (@captain2phones) of Pocketnow, Florence Ion (@ohthatflo) of Greenbot, and Dom Esposito (@macmixing) of 9to5Google and YouTube.com/dom! They talk about Project Fi to warm up and then get into the LG G4 itself, with plenty of fun tangents along the way. And be forewarned, the environment does mean a lot of background noise including helicopters and a creaking boat. But it's still a really fun listen so fire up your podcast app or head to YouTube to enjoy some bonus behind the scenes footage! The Android Authority FDP - where P stands for Podcast!",

For those who don't know, Project Fi is a new wireless service (basically a MVNO) by Google that focuses on the ability to move from mobile networks and Wi-Fi hotspots on the fly, as well as some simpler pricing for talk, text, and data. The functionality to switch among networks is only found on the Nexus 6, currently, however, but the gang talks about future possibilities. Project Fi is certainly an anticipated move from Google, but are we really happy with the details that have thus far come to light? Find out on the FDP!

    "description": "This week we welcome another guest to the podcast, writer Nirave Gondhia as we take on a topic that was picked by you, our fans. A poll posted on Google+ yielded our topic for this week - the question of whether flagship devices still make sense with a growing midrange market. Phones coming in a lower price point are gradually bringing high-end experiences, with perhaps just a few holes left in their evolution. So, we ponder the question of how midrange devices fare against the current crop of flagships from the likes of Samsung, HTC, and future phones from the likes of LG and Sony. We run the gamut and veer off course a few times, but that's just how it goes on the FDP. Follow our poll on Google+ once again this week and let us know which topic you want us to talk about next! Thank you for your participation and we look forward to seeing your responses! The Friday Debate Podcast by Android Authority - discussing topics in Android every week.",

Jokes aside, we have Lanh filling in for Andrew this week as we talk about the age-old battle between specifications and user experience. With phones like the Moto E coming along with all of these high profile releases from Samsung and HTC, we talk about whether the general usage experience really needs high end specifications. We also ponder how raw specs drive perception of a phone. And finally, we touch upon the Uh Oh program that was just recently announced by HTC in which users can get a brand new phone when their current One M9 fails or gets damaged.

    "description": "Live from our AirBnB'd house just a few blocks away from the craziness of the Las Vegas Strip, Android Authority brings you the pilot episode of its brand new podcast, The Friday Debate. Join host Joshua Vergara, guest YouTubers Lanh Nguyen and Kevin Nether, and lead editor Andrew Grush as we talk about our favorite items from the Consumer Electronics Show of 2015.  We jump across the show floor memories with mentions going out to the LG G Flex 2, Sony's Android Bravia TVs, and the Panasonic CM1! (Please note that while this special pilot episode was recorded live, this will only be done when applicable to live events. Most of the Friday Debate episodes will be recorded via online conference calls.) Those who read Android Authority online are likely familiar with the Friday Debate - a weekly feature that pits our writers and/or YouTubers against a specific topic. While you can read our opinions on the website in block form, you can also now listen to them in podcast form with The Friday Debate Podcast! Join host Joshua Vergara and a panel of guests as they beat the proverbial dead horse on a specific topic in the world of Android! Coming to you every single week. Follow us on social media!
