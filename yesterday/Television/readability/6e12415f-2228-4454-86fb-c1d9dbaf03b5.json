  "text": "Former U.S. Army military police major Jack Reacher (Alan Ritchson) will be coming back for another edge-of-your-seat season of Reacher. After shoving the head of security and all-things-evil, Shane Langston (Robert Patrick), out of a moving aircraft for killing members of his unit in Season 2, Reacher is all set for more vigilante justice. News of the muscular hero’s return came almost immediately following the finale of Season 2 when Ritchson took to Twitter/X to announce it. One can only imagine who will be on the receiving end of Reacher’s fist, but what we do know is that he makes Reacher look like a Lilliputian. (Screenshot/Prime Video) The Amazon Prime Video action crime streaming TV series was a big hit after it debuted on February 4, 2022, where Reacher finds himself in the town of Margrave, Georgia. With the help of two police officers, Roscoe Conklin and Oscar Finlay, Reacher sets out to investigate local corruption. (Shane Mahood/Amazon Prime Video) After wowing audiences with an action-packed first season, it seemed only logical for more stories to be written for what is sure to be a long-running fan favorite. Has Reacher Been Renewed for Season 3? Yes! Before the second season even began airing on Prime Video, the wise streamer renewed Reacher for Season 3. Where Did Reacher Season 2 Leave Off? Reacher Reacher 2 Episode 8 ended with several body counts, starting with members of Reacher’s defunct MP Special Investigations Unit. (Shane Mahood/Amazon Prime Video) He eventually reunites with surviving members, including Frances Neagley (Maria Sten), to investigate who is behind the murders and why. Reacher even gets an assist from elbow patch-wearing Oscar Finley (Malcolm Goodwin) in a surprise cameo. Sorry, all you Roscoe fans, but Reacher hooks up with someone else this trip, squad mate Karla Dixon (Serinda Swan). At the conclusion of the final episode, and after some members survive very harrowing moments of torture, the team is able to retrieve the bombs, take care of the bad guys, and go back to their normal lives. Season 2 depicts events from Lee Child’s 11th book in the popular series Bad Luck and Trouble. (Courtesy of Amazon Prime Video) When Will Reacher Season 3 Be Released? Reacher Season 3 will premiere on Thursday, February 20, 2025, with three episodes. New episodes will drop every Thursday thereafter. Reacher was the first Prime Video series to top the Neilsen charts, proving the action hero’s move from the pages of the novels to the big screen to be a wise decision. (Keri Anderson/Amazon Prime Video) Reacher Season 3 Plot (Spoilers) According to Ritchson, season three is based on Persuader, which is Child’s seventh book in the Jack Reacher franchise, and this time, the titular character drifts into the pine tree state of Maine. As for the plot, Reacher witnesses a brutal kidnapping attempt and decides to take the law into his own hands by going undercover to rescue an informant held hostage by a haunting foe from his past. Apparently, a key investigation went south years ago, and Reacher has one last shot at redemption, or will it really be an act of vengeance? (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) Unfortunately, a cop dies, and viewers will learn more about Reacher’s past, raising the question of whether He has lost his sense of right and wrong. Fans of the books are already expressing their excitement over the adaptation of this particular novel while noting how different it will be from the team element. While we obviously take Richter at his word, we also have the official synopsis now, too. In the third season of the action-packed series, Reacher hurtles into the dark heart of a vast criminal enterprise when trying to rescue an undercover DEA informant whose time is running out. There, he finds a world of secrecy and violence — and confronts some unfinished business from his own past. Who Will Be in the Reacher Season 3 Cast? We have the million-dollar bet on this one: Alan Richtson will return as Jack Reacher. If there is one thing fans of the series understand about Reacher, it is that the guy hardly wears the same clothes twice, let alone keeps the same woman or works with the same people. (Shane Mahood/Amazon Prime Video) Nevertheless, it has been confirmed that Neagley, Reacher’s favorite sidekick who served with him in the army, will make another kick-butt appearance in season three. It’s probably fair to assume that the pair will likely connect with at least one or two good guys as they tackle bringing justice in a new town. Furthermore, showrunner Nick Santora told The Hollywood Reporter to expect Reacher to join forces with good people for the cause and then say his goodbyes before going his way and finding more trouble, no doubt. SNL alum Anthony Michael Hall will play Zachary Beck, a successful businessman who Reacher suspects is involved in a criminal operation. Also added is Sonya Cassidy, who has been cast in the role of Susan Duffy, a DEA agent from Boston with a sarcastic sense of humor. Brian Tee, coming off his starring role in the Prime Video series Expats, has been cast as Quinn. Physically imposing and intimidating, Quinn was a Lieutenant Colonel in the Army whom Reacher investigated ten years ago when he sold military secrets to hostile nations. (VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images) Johnny Berchtold has been cast as Richard Beck. A sensitive and artistic college student, Richard lost his mother when he was young and is the only son of businessman Zachary Beck (Anthony Michael Hall). Five years ago, he was the victim of a traumatic kidnapping that left him mutilated. Roberto Montesinos has been cast as Guillermo Villanueva. A DEA agent on the verge of retirement, Villanueva is the mentor and father figure of Agent Susan Duffy (Sonya Cassidy). Paunchy has bad knees and a good sense of humor, and he really loves and cares about Duffy, even though they bust each other’s chops all the time. (VALERIE MACON/AFP via Getty Images) Daniel David Stewart has been cast as Steven Elliot. A clean-cut rookie DEA agent, Elliot is a lovable guy who’s fresh-faced, new to the job, and still learning. How Many Episodes Will Be in Reacher Season 3? The eight-episode season will be released weekly. The first three episodes will premiere on February 20, and subsequent episodes will be released every Thursday through March 27, 2025. Is There a Trailer for Reacher Season 3? The first 44-second teaser for Reacher Season 3 was released today. Get your first look now! We’ll keep an eye out for a full trailer, too. Where Can I Watch Reacher Season 3? Reacher became one of Amazon Prime Video’s biggest hits since its debut in 2022. Former Smallville actor Alan Ritchson seized the role of Jack Reacher and made it his own in the streaming series after Tom Cruise’s controversial portrayal in two films, which were released in 2012 and 2016, respectively. Currently, seasons one and two are available for streaming exclusively on Prime Video, which is included as part of an Amazon Prime membership. (Brooke Palmer/Prime Video) If you are wondering whether a Prime membership is worth your while, you can always use the streaming service on a free trial. Customers can watch Prime Video on a good selection of compatible devices, such as directly from the web, via the Prime Video app on a smartphone, set-top box, game console, tablet, or select smart TVs.
