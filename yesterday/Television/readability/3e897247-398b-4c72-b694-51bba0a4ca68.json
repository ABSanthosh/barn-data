  "text": "The serial killers have become more deranged on The Hunting Party.  It seems cold blooded to kill your bride, but Mark Marsden, aka The Widower, killed his last three wives on their wedding night. The spoilers for The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 7 hint that Bex and the team must decipher Mark’s new pattern when he runs off with a new fiance. (David Astorga/NBC) Additionally, Bex convinces Hassani that it’s better to work with Oliver as the three of them search for information about Silo 12 after Oliver confides in her. Finally, after the cliffhanger at the end of The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 6, we expect the series to address Shane’s family drama again. Hopefully, we’ll learn how he’s connected to Dr. Dulles and whether Sarah is actually related to the doctor. The Latest Serial Killer Has Issues With Love and Marriage Mark Marsden would appear charming and romantic if he weren’t a serial killer. He’s involved in the wedding planning, and that’s every girl’s dream. Although seeing the bride before in her dress is bad luck, there’s that. (David Astorga/NBC) He was charming enough, so it wasn’t until multiple wives died on the wedding night that he was deemed a serial killer. That just seems more savage and calculating than the usual murderers, killing the love of your life on your wedding day. The team must decipher why “The Widower” murdered these women. It’s likely he had relationship issues and was dumped when he was younger. Therefore, he eliminates these women before they discover his flaws and break up with him. The problem was that he was safe away from other victims in the Pit until a few weeks ago, and now he can wreak havoc on female victims again. He finds another one early on, as seen in the spoiler photos and the weekly promo. Will she become another victim, or did he turn over a new leaf? This case includes a classic ride of romance and intrigue, leaving you guessing. This Case Affects Shane the Most Shane often comments about how he heard different things about various serial killers. He seems sensitive to what the victims experience at these serial killers’ hands. However, he looks more upset than usual in these photos, leading us to wonder if he knew this killer or the treatment methods firsthand. Shane doesn’t talk much about his experience in the Pit, mainly because of security clearance, but it’s apparent that it affected him. We’ve discussed extensively how the Pit’s methods often help the killers find new targets rather than curing them. (James Dittiger/NBC) That leads us to ponder what kind of treatment would desensitize a killer from murdering his brides. Did the treatment actually help Mark Marsden develop healthy feelings, or is his next bride still a sitting duck? While every serial killer case has a twist, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat until the end! Shane’s Family Drama Is Also At the Forefront We expect drama after Sarah Dulles announces to the senior living staff that Shane is not Dr. Dulles’s son. It’s currently a case of what he said versus what she said, and the staff knows Shane better, so it’s difficult to discern who they will believe. (David Astorga/NBC) Dr. Dulles could possibly have two families, and neither Shane nor Sarah knew they were related. It’s also possible that Shane pretended he was related to Dr. Dulles to gain more information about the Pit. I think this is unlikely since Dr. Dulles has such an emotional reaction to Shane, even with his Alzheimer’s disease. The spoiler photos suggest that Shane and Sarah meet at his favorite bar, so perhaps they compare stories about Dr. Dulles. Neither looks upset, so that’s a good sign. Hopefully, they can agree on something that focuses on Dr. Dulles’s health. Hassani, Bex, and Oliver Must Learn To Work Together to Solve the Silo 12 Mystery (David Astorga/NBC) Bex has her work cut out for her. She must try to get Hassani and Oliver to play nice since they would otherwise continue sniping at each other. However, as Patrick Sabongui teased, they don’t have to like each other to work together for a common goal. Since the spoiler photos suggest that the trio get access to Silo 12, Bex must have been successful in least convincing each of the men to trust her, if not each other. Exploring Silo 12 will open a new can of worms since Oliver suggested it was connected to the Pit, giving the Armed Security Force easy access to get the prisoners in and out. (David Astorga/NBC) What kind of secrets will Oliver, Bex, and Hassani find? Will it bring them any closure or only more questions? Have you been enjoying this season, The Hunting Party Fanatics? What are you excited to see on “Mark Marsden”? How do you think this case affects Shane? Will Hassani, Bex, and Oliver be able to research the Silos together without killing one another? We would love to hear your thoughts, so please share them below. The Hunting Party airs at 10/9c on Mondays on NBC and Peacock the next day.
