  "text": "One hostage down, one to go. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-17-25 promise an end to the Woman in White’s reign of terror — at least partially. Also, in case anyone is worried, Tate will make it to the Horton Cabin in time to have his romantic evening with Holly. (Screenshot/Peacock) Third Time’s The Charm for Ava Ava is a ridiculous character, for the most part, but this Woman in White storyline is even sillier, so I’ll take her finally getting free. Kristen and EJ both decided not to help her. Kristen listened to her mother’s nonsense about how little Rachel would go to jail or Bayview for helping with the kidnapping, while EJ listened to other nonsense about how the only way not to get caught holding Rafe hostage was to leave Ava tied up. Steve and Brady have been looking, and neither of them will be swayed by the Woman in White’s arguments. I’m not sure how I feel about this. Ava, as written right now, is an okay partner for Brady, but it’s hard to get past the fact that she raped Steve, killed Shawn Sr, messed with John, and did other terrible things over the years. (Screenshot/Peacock) On the other hand, there aren’t words for how aggravating the trope is of people coming into the Blake House and deciding not to help Ava. So yay for that ending! Unfortunately, though, Rafe won’t be so lucky, as Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-17-25 say that he has to deal with his new “guard.” Hopefully, he outwits the Woman in White quickly and gets back to Salem to begin to undo the mess his doppelganger is making. (Peacock/Screenshot) EJ’s Pitch To Paulina Shouldn’t Work, But Will It? Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-17-25 have EJ approaching Paulina, most likely about getting his old job back. This plan is so transparent it might as well be a window, but we all know that Ron Carlivarti loves making characters stupid when it fits the plot. Of course, there’s a possibility that Paulina will only pretend to go along with EJ’s plan so that she can help trap him, but I wouldn’t bet on it. Paulina was apparently convinced there was something to the accusations against Jada because “Rafe” said he trusted his anonymous source, so why would she realize that EJ is playing her now? (Peacock/Screenshot) Could Belle realize what’s going on? She’s not going to take kindly to Paulina taking her job away minutes after she gave it to her, but Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-17-25 are confusing about whether she knows what EJ is up to. One spoiler says that Belle and EJ will discuss the boundaries of their relationship, while another says that Belle will “set a trap” for EJ. Setting a trap sounds an awful lot like stopping him from continuing with this fake Rafe nonsense, but it doesn’t fit with the relationship spoiler. On the other hand, Belle is supposed to have a strange encounter with “Rafe” at the police station, so maybe she’ll start to put two and two together, especially if Shawn repeats Jada’s assertion that Rafe seems like a different person all of a sudden. (Screenshot/Peacock) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 2-17-25 Suggest It Might Be Too Late Even If Rafe Does Escape Jada, believing that Rafe stabbed her in the back, is getting closer and closer with Shawn. Shawn and Belle are divorced, “Rafe” kicked Jada to the curb, and Shawn is the only cop 100% on her side — where else could this go? By the time Rafe frees himself from captivity and gets back to Salem, Jada will likely be involved with Shawn, or at least in love with him. Besides, Rafe will have a lot of work to do to convince Jada that the guy who left her at the altar and accused her of being a dirty cop was not him. Still, the fact that Jada and Shawn are getting close is good news. If we’re moving toward the twisted love triangle part of the story, then Rafe must be escaping soon. Thank goodness! (Screenshot/Peacock) The Next Step In The Baby Storyline Tate is shocked to learn that Johnny and Chanel might be interested in adopting his baby. I’m comfortable stating he’s the only one, but I don’t want to talk for you all. Is anyone surprised by this? It seemed that Days of Our Lives telegraphed this possibility when Tate and Sophia ran into Johnny and Chanel the other day, especially since the conversation sparked Chanel’s interest in having a baby. This new conversation follows Kayla telling Chanel she doesn’t think it’s a good idea for her to get pregnant right now. (Screenshot/Peacock) Of course, it’s not a done deal. Amy Choi could disapprove of Johnny and Chanel and probably will. Why would Ms. Uber-Religious want a DIMERA raising her grandchild? I would have liked Chanel to get some advice from her half-sister, Lani, before giving up on the idea of pregnancy. Lani had the twins after her miscarriage, and when she was pregnant, she practically lived in Kayla’s exam room because she was so scared of losing her babies. She’d be the perfect person to advise Chanel about her next steps. (Screenshot/Peacock) As I mentioned earlier, Tate and Holly will have their romantic evening at the Horton Cabin. I hope Doug III disappears before Tate gets there — we don’t need another round of jealousy (especially since Julie is the latest person to give terrible advice about people who are in a relationship with someone else.) Sarah and Xander will also have some alone time, hopefully without Philip’s nonsense interfering. Kristen has an idea for EJ. I’m not sure I want to know what that means.
