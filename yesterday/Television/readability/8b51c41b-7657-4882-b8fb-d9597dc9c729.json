  "text": "Consider our Modern Family revival dreams a bit dashed. Julie Bowen is set to star in and executive-produce Taste, a new sitcom that is now in development at NBC. As first reported by our sister site Deadline and confirmed by TVLine, Taste would star Bowen as the “traditionalist” editor of a legacy food magazine based out of the Bay Area, who finds her professional world turned upside down when the publication’s new, Silicon Valley tech-mogul owner forces a young, buzzy TikTok chef into a leadership position. Justin Shanes (Superstore, The Late Late Show With James Corden) and Nedaa Sweiss (The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon) will pen the pilot and executive-produce. Rachael Field and Gail Simmons will also serve as EPs. Bowen is a six-time Emmy Award nominee and two-time winner for her 11-season run as Modern Family‘s Claire Dunphy. Her TV credits also include Boston Legal, Ed, Lost, Weeds, Peacock’s recent Hysteria! and voice work on DuckTales, Family Guy and Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure.",
