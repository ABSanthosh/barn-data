  "text": "Romance, mystery, and intrigue continue on the next When Calls the Heart. When Nathan went undercover last time, many fans were disappointed Elizabeth barely interacted with him. She’ll get her chance in When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 7. The spoilers indicate that while Nathan and Elizabeth are out on a date, they must quickly go undercover at a glamorous and lavish party. The stakes are high since they run into Toddy Davis and his wife, but the operation will likely be entertaining. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) We can’t wait to see what kind of dancing and party there will be, as the roaring 20s have been a blast so far. This will likely be the main story, although other spoilers indicate that Lucas and Edie grow closer while playing cards. We may also see more romance between Bill and Georgie since Melissa Gilbert is scheduled to reappear. Finally, Rosemary holds auditions for a play. This seems right up her alley since she loves acting and is so creative. Nathan and Elizabeth’s Romantic Date Doesn’t Go as Planned in When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 7 From the weekly promo and spoiler photos, it appears Nathan plans to treat Elizabeth to dinner and a movie date, but they run into Toddy Davis and his wife Trudy (Courtney Richter). Therefore, the couple joins them at an elaborate and lavish celebration and goes undercover to dig for more information about the gold coin. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) Since they planned a casual but fun night out on the town, part of the adventure will be how quickly they transformed into those elaborate clothes. We saw Nathan in this black tux in When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 5, but Elizabeth rarely dresses this glamorous, so it’s a treat. Luckily, Elizabeth plays along with Nathan’s code name, Danny DeMarco, and he quickly fills her in on the case. It had to be somewhat appealing and thrilling to portray his Bond girl and help solve the case since Elizabeth is so used to being the good girl. This episode allows them to portray personas they would never be, have fun solving a mystery, and sing and dance the night away. The Undercover Investigation Should Bring Intrigue, Entertainment, and Romance Nathan and Elizabeth’s relationship may be scrutinized during this investigation. The promo reminds me of multiple Timeless episodes, including when Wyatt and Lucy convinced Bonnie and Clyde they were in love and the elaborate party in Hollywoodland in Timeless Season 2 Episode 3. This time, Trudy Davis seems on to them, asking questions about how Danny DeMarco met his dame, Diane. She even suggests they sing a duet to symbolize their love story. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) We’ve heard Nathan and Elizabeth sing a duet, so that will be a treat for Kevin McGarry and Erin Krakow fans. Both the Davises and Nathan and Elizabeth may continue this cat-and-mouse game as they question and taunt the other couple. Perhaps they will have more luck when Elizabeth gets Trudy alone and learns some of their true intentions. This should be an entertaining installment with more Charleston moves, duets, and classic James Bond detective sleuthing. Other Couples Also Grow Closer on Another Romance-Centric Episode We haven’t seen Edie Martell in a few weeks, but the ice between her and Lucas has thawed since their last interaction. Seeing couples only every few weeks makes it difficult for us to invest in them. While I think Lucas and Edie have potential, we need to see them interact more to build that connection. Cards seem strange, too, unless they want a low-key activity with less pressure so they can talk without formality. There hasn’t been much written about Bill and George, except that Melissa Gilbert appears as Georgie again. Hopefully, she and Bill will work on the train mystery in Hope Valley while Elizabeth and Nathan are undercover. We’d love to see them discuss their relationship more. Bill hasn’t looked this happy in ages. Rosemary Holds Auditions for a Play Rosemary has been more active within the community and with the children during When Calls the Heart Season 12. She taught school for Elizabeth and helped them express their thoughts to the governor. She would be ideal for creating a community theatre and getting everyone involved. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) Rosemary loved acting herself, and she’s talented at designing clothes. Recently, we even saw how well she created a persona for Nathan the first time he went undercover. This would be the perfect use of her time. I’m eager to see if she uses a classic story or writes her own play and which of the Hope Valley locals will participate. Over to you, Hearties. What are you excited to see in “Dance the Night Away”? Will Nathan and Elizabeth succeed in their undercover mission?Are you looking forward to seeing more of Lucas and Edie? We would love to hear your thoughts, so let us know in the comments below.
