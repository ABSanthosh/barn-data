  "text": "President Donald Trump will sit down for an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier during the Fox Super Bowl LIX Pregame show on Sunday, Feb. 9 at 3 pm ET. Additional segments from the interview will air during Special Report With Bret Baier on Monday, Feb. 10 at 6 pm ET and will be available on FOXNews.com. The interview will be pre-taped at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Fla. Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * Season 2 of Hulu’s The Artful Dodger has added Aussie actors Luke Bracey (Little Fires Everywhere), Jeremy Sims (Mr Inbetween) and Zac Burgess (Cruel Intentions the series) as Inspector Henry Boxer, the new authority in town with eyes for a Lady; Uncle Dickie, the Governor’s charming and disreputable older brother; and Dickie’s handsome aide Phineas Golden. * O-T Fagbenle (The Handmaid’s Tale) and Sian Clifford (Fleabag) have joined Peacock’s upcoming comedy The Miniature Wife as series regulars, while Ronny Chieng (The Daily Show) will appear in a recurring role. * WWE and Tubi have announced the launch of WWE EVOLVE, which will showcase rising prospects as they wrestle with the dream of making it to NXT and, perhaps, one day SmackDown and Raw. The series will premiere Wednesday, March 5, at 8/7c, with a new episode dropping each week. * A new STARZ and BET+ bundle has been launched through Prime Video. U.S. Customers can access the offering on Prime Video for $15.99/month, an approximate 30% savings. Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
