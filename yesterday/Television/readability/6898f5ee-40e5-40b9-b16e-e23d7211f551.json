  "text": "The Hunting Party began with a bang and left audiences with many questions, mainly about who initiated a prison break of the world’s most dangerous criminals. While the government wants everyone to think it was an accidental gas leak, Bex and her team have their doubts. Spoilers for The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 2 tease that Bex’s alliances are tested during an intense manhunt for Clayton Jessup. ( David Astorga/NBC) This episode also reveals more details about Bex’s past and why she chose this type of career, including the case she witnessed as a teenager. Additionally, Jennifer Morales (Sara Garcia) appears for the first time, so we look forward to seeing how she interacts with the others. Bex Questions Her Alliances When Hunting the Latest Deranged Killer ( David Astorga/NBC) Bex doesn’t know who to trust after Oliver reveals that he thought the prison break wasn’t accidental in the cliffhanger of The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 1. Therefore, Bex questions everyone as they hunt for the killer of the week, Clayton Jessup, who is obsessed with murdering happy families and is looking for his next target. Since Bex profiles the killers, she’ll likely discern what personality disorder Jessup has or if he suffered any childhood trauma that motivates him to harm only happy families. As someone who studied psychology, a serial killer that only kills happy families intrigues me. Perhaps Clayton Jessup longed for a happy and loving family but never had one. The motivation sounds more complex than some violent killers. So far, the team generally finds their best clues whenever the killer goes off-track with their usual methods, so this one will likely be similar. Either that, or he’ll escalate something even more dangerous. ( David Astorga/NBC) Each episode continues to be titled after the killer of the week and focuses mainly on that while also dealing with Bex’s past. It’s been frustrating for Bex because she wants to solve the cases, but Jacob and Shane only share limited information about the Pit and the prisoners with her. It feels like everyone has a secret, which is another theory we’ll discuss a bit later. Sara Garcia Debuts as Jennifer Morales ( David Astorga/NBC) I’m unsure why Sara Garcia didn’t appear in the premiere. In this episode, she first appears as Intel officer Jennifer Morales. We’re excited to see Garcia back on screen. After starring in Hallmark’s Ride, she’s proven adept at handling layered emotional performances. While this is a different role, seeing her and Melissa Roxburgh together will be fantastic. From the spoiler photos, it looks like Officer Morales gathers more research on base with Oliver while Bex, Shane, and Jacob do the fieldwork. Hopefully, we’ll see her interact with Bex more, too, since both women seem intelligent, feisty, and have a painful past. Procedurals only work when interpersonal relationships thrive, and not only romantic ones. Team dynamics and friendships are often the most essential parts of a series. ( David Astorga/NBC) Bex Faces a Painful Past in The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 2 Additional spoilers tease that flashbacks of Bex’s past reveal why she chose this career. Earlier, Bex told Shane she acted like “Nancy Drew” as a teenager and discovered her best friend’s father was a serial killer. Naturally, that traumatized her, so they’ll likely expand more on that since it motivated Bex to become an FBI agent. Hopefully, we’ll see some flashbacks and Bex opening up about that night. She looks pretty distant, but it will tell more about who she trusts and confides in. So far, she’s confided the most in Shane since he seems the easiest to talk to. Will that continue? ( David Astorga/NBC) With all the prisoners disappearing, Bex may also worry about her friend’s father striking again since there was no exact prisoner list at the Pit. Can she trust any of the men to inform her honestly about his whereabouts? The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 2 Hints at More Mysteries While The Hunting Party is a procedural, it brings viewers back with its’ many unanswered questions, beginning with the Pit’s existence. Who created it, why were they doing these experiments, and where did they find these therapists to treat these hardened criminals? ( David Astorga/NBC) Beyond that, we have questions about how much Jacob, Shane, and Oliver knew about the Pit and even the prison break. It seems like every character has buried secrets that could affect their career and relationships, which makes this series even more enjoyable. Bex has already formed relationships with all three men but doesn’t fully trust them because she’s been burned before and doesn’t let people in easily. Besides Bex’s early cases, the series still has not revealed why Bex was sidelined by the FBI. That’s a mystery in itself. Over to you, TV Fanatics. Do you plan to watch more of The Hunting Party Season 1? Who do you think Bex can trust? What will we learn about her detective skills as a teenager? Are you excited to see Sara Garcia as a TV series regular again? We’re excited to hear your opinions, so please share your thoughts with us below. The Hunting Party airs on Mondays at 10/9c on NBC and on Peacock the following day. Watch The Hunting Party Online",
