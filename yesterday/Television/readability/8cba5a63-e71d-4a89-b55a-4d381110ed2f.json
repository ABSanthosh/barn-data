  "text": "At the end of The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 4, Bex and Hassani learned some more secrets that will likely change team dynamics. If Bex was confused about where her loyalties lay before, now she’s even more torn, and this week’s serial killer only makes that worse. Spoilers for The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 5 tease that the team races to stop Roy Barber, known as the Couples Killer, who is obsessed with his victims and love. (David Astorga/NBC) Naturally, they uncover something new and sinister about him, so they must adapt their plan to catch this menacing killer. That may include Bex and one of the guys posing as a couple to lure him into a trap. Additionally, Bex is reeling from what she learned at Oliver’s storage locker. She had no idea he communicated with Sam, so she must process that and discern how it affects her relationship with Oliver. The Serial Killer on The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 5 is Obsessed With Couples Roy Barber is obsessed with killing couples. That’s different. I’m excited to learn his story and why he’s fixated on killing only couples and destroying love. (David Astorga/NBC) He’s like an evil Cupid, which is ironic since Valentine’s Day just passed. Since many of these killers’ motives are rooted in the past, I suspect that maybe he was jilted by a past lover, and she paired up with a friend of his. That would enrage anyone, but especially someone with psychological issues. It would motivate him to eliminate happy couples. Unlike the last several killers, we’re unsure which treatments at the Pit would trigger Roy Barber to find new victims. The Team Needs A Different Way to Lure the Couples Killer The team discovers that Roy Barber has a new sinister scheme, and they need to crack it and find him before more victims get hurt. This serial killer even looks menacing as he tries to enter a date’s house during the promo. This makes us wonder if the team will have Bex pretend to date him or if they’ll prepare an undercover mission. It would be better if Bex had backup since something usually happens when she’s alone with these monsters. While the team wants to trigger him, having someone nearby to stop or interrogate him would be helpful. Since he’s obsessed with couples, Bex and one of the guys will likely pose as a couple to gather information and lure him into a trap. This is a popular trope and has been used often. Rollins and Carisi utilized this move on Law \u0026 Order: SVU before they dated, as did Wyatt and Lucy on Timeless. (David Astorga/NBC) This Case Could Be A Deciding Factor in the Love Triangle Melissa Roxburgh has hinted that Bex will be in a love triangle with Oliver and Shane throughout The Hunting Party Season 1. It’s difficult to discern who she goes on a fake date with by these spoiler photos. Oliver often gazes at her longingly, and seeing him back in the field would be interesting. Since they were partners in the cabin five years ago, we have not seen how they interact in high-risk situations. Then, there’s Shane. While he’s not in dressy clothes, it appears the trio has garment bags on the plane so that he can prepare quickly. Bex feels safe with him because she knows what to expect. However, she hasn’t heard his secret about who his father is yet, so will that affect their evolving relationship? (David Astorga/NBC) She may understand since he was comforting and understanding when he heard about her past. Bex looks gorgeous in that black dress, no matter who goes with her. Hopefully, we’ll see some lighthearted date scenes that mesh with the graphic serial killer scenes. Bex Must Decide Her Relationship With Oliver Since Bex adopted Sam several years ago, she’s raised her as a single mom. She had no idea Sam had any contact with Oliver until she found a graduation photo of Sam and birthday cards her daughter sent him. It’s almost like Sam wanted that fantasy family of two parents raising her that Nick Wechsler teased that Oliver wished he could have had in another world. From Bex’s near-death vision on The Hunting Party Season 1 Episode 4, perhaps she yearns for that, too. While she used that to get close enough to Oliver to plug in the tracking device, she still feels for Oliver, too. (David Astorga/NBC) Bex seems so torn because while he murdered a man, they have a history that she can’t ignore. It makes it more difficult if her daughter wants a relationship with her, something she never considered. Will Bex decide to keep things strictly professional, or will they give their relationship another try? Some of the looks in these photos are so angsty. Over to you, The Hunting Party Fanatics. What do you want to see in “Roy Barber”? Who are you rooting for in this love triangle? We would love to hear your thoughts, so please share them with us below. The Hunting Party airs at 10/9c on Mondays on NBC and Peacock the next day. Watch The Hunting Party Online",
