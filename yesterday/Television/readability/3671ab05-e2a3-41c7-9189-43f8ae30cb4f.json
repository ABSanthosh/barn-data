Prime Video is delivering the gift of discounted streaming ahead of its annual Prime Day savings event. For a limited time, the streamer is offering two months of its BET Plus add-on for just 99¢/month. Here’s everything you need to know for claiming the deal. Courtesy of BET+BET Plus on Prime VideoOn Sale 91% off Get 2 Months of BET Plus for $1/Month on Prime Video The best active deal for streaming BET Plus is Amazon‘s 99¢/month offer over on Prime Video. This deal is good until Friday, July 11 — so you’ll want to act fast. The Prime Video deal is the best way to watch BET Plus for free-ish since you can watch two full months for just 99¢/month, after which your plan will automatically renew at its regular $10.99/month price. You can, however, cancel before the third billing cycle begins to avoid paying full price. Keep in mind, the BET Plus channel price is added to your $14.99/month Prime membership — sign up below! (Plus, your Prime Video membership will unlock plenty of other streaming discounts you can check out here.) How to Sign Up for BET Plus on Prime Video If you decide to capitalize on the limited-time deal, Prime Video subscribers can easily add BET Plus by visiting the streamer’s Amazon page. If you don’t yet have a Prime Video account, you’ll need to sign up for the service which costs $14.99/month. Here are step-by-step instructions for signing up for Prime Video with the BET Plus add-on: Go to the Prime Video + BET Plus page Click “Get Started” Enter payment information Start streaming BET Plus on Prime Video for 99¢/month! Does BET Plus Have a Free Trial? Prime Video typically offers a seven-day BET Plus free trial when you sign up for the channel, but that offer looks to be on hold while the aforementioned deal is active. So, the sweetest deal going on now is the Prime Video’s limited-time offer that gets you two months of BET Plus for just $2. And keep in mind, you can cancel any time to avoid being billed the regular price of $10.99/month. With this current deal, we recommend skipping the BET Plus free trial for now. What to Watch on BET Plus BET Plus offers a library of original content including Divorced Sistas, Lil Kev, Diarra From Detroit (which has been renewed for Season 2), All the Queen’s Men, The Black Hamptons, Caught Up, Kingdom Business, The Ms. Pat Show, Zatima and more. You can also stream other Tyler Perry titles including Assisted Living, House of Payne and Sistas. For less than $1/month, there’s plenty to enjoy on the platform.",
