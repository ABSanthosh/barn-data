  "text": "We’re still a few weeks out from the triumphant return of the second half of 9-1-1 Season 8, and not much is known about what will happen when the show returns. Since the end of 9-1-1 Season 8 Episode 8, we have been left with a tantalizing trailer that shows Athena on the hunt for a possible serial killer and Maddie seemingly in their crosshairs. The two-parter looks to be a tense affair, the kind 9-1-1 is known for, and it will surely have people talking. But outside of that nugget, what else we should expect from the rest of the action-packed season is unclear. (Disney/Justin Stephens) One thing that MAY be on the horizon is Eddie Diaz moving back to Texas. The surprising reveal came when Buck unexpectedly showed up at Eddie’s and caught him looking at homes online. This caused the somewhat flustered man to confide in his best friend that he was looking to move closer to his son, Christopher, who had been away from Los Angeles for quite some time. Considering this is 9-1-1, there’s all the chance in the world that Eddie never makes that move. Perhaps this is just a bit of a red herring to set off something else for Eddie and Buck. (Fox) There was a clear set-up for Buck to struggle in the aftermath of Eddie’s decision emblazoned in his downcast eyes and crestfallen face when he realized there could soon be a reality in which Eddie Diaz was no longer living in the same city as him. But what if Eddie DOES go to Texas? What does that look like for him? What does that look like for the 118? And what does that look like for 9-1-1? We’ve seen the 118 down a member on more than one occasion. Chimney spent a large portion of 9-1-1 Season 5 on the road looking for Maddie, while Eddie spent significant time working at dispatch during the latter part of the same season. So, Eddie not being at the 118 day in and day out wouldn’t be something the audience hadn’t seen before. However, Eddie living in a different state and not having in-person interactions with anyone in his core group of found family would be an adjustment. (Disney/Ray Mickshaw) Coming out of 9-1-1 Season 7 Episode 10, Eddie’s storyline seemed poised to be all about figuring himself out and why he’s made some of the decisions he’s made, alongside he and his son having some tough conversations and working on their father-son relationship. That’s what we should have seen at the beginning of this season, but outside of 9-1-1 Season 8 Episode 6, which saw Eddie finally opening up about his fears and current state of mind, they’ve dropped the ball a bit on Eddie’s story. Throughout the season, Christopher went from barely acknowledging his dad’s existence over a video call in the way only a kid can do during 9-1-1 Season 8 Episode 1 to being on much better terms during another video call during the midseason finale. We missed all of that development, but the series has the chance to rectify that if they move forward with sending Eddie to Texas. Not only would that allow Eddie to work on his relationship with Christopher in person and show the pair talking about all the events that led them to their current situation, but it would also help Eddie as he continues on a journey of self-discovery. When I chatted with Ryan Guzman after 9-1-1 Season 8 Episode 6 about Christopher coming home and what it would take for Eddie to get to a place where he was ready to bring him home, he replied, “He has to be solid within himself. (Fox) “When he goes to Christopher, he has to be mindful of what happened but also not play the card of saying, ‘Woe is me’ or ‘I’m so sorry that this happened.’ It’s ownership. And that’s, I think, the next step of maturity for Eddie. “It’s just ownership of what happened without beating himself down. And showcasing to his son like, ‘This happens in life. You will fall. And as you fall, you are going to have to sometimes pick yourself up or lean on your community.’ And he’s your community. “So, I think it would be a beautiful opportunity to reconnect with his son and show him that he’s a human being.” Eddie’s going to Texas would be him putting in the work and showing his son that he’s taking accountability for his actions while also being there for him and working on their relationship. (Disney/Ray Mickshaw) Eddie’s decision to allow Christopher to go with his grandparents has been a hotly contested debate, but at this point, it’s happened. He’s been there for months, and Eddie did what he thought was best for his son, but it’s gone on long enough. It may seem like a rash decision to up and move, but he’s doing it because that’s his baby. That’s the most important person in his life, and it’s time to have those uncomfortable conversations face-to-face and rebuild that relationship. It’s hard to do that over video calls. Aside from moving closer to his son, returning to his hometown should also provide Eddie with the opportunity to work through the issues he’s had with his parents and his childhood. When you become an adult, the things that happened to you when you were younger don’t just magically disappear, even if you have a greater perspective in adulthood. Eddie has many emotions surrounding his upbringing, and moving to Los Angeles with Christopher was a fresh start for both of them. They took advantage of it and excelled together. (Disney/Mike Taing) They’ve created their own little village without his parents’ help. Eddie didn’t “bring Christopher down with him;” he lifted Christopher up. Eddie Diaz is a good father, but he made a mistake, one he’s acknowledged. Will his parents be willing to acknowledge the mistakes and assumptions they’ve made over the years? Will they be willing to meet Eddie halfway if he expresses his frustrations with his upbringing and what he’s been through? IF that’s something he even wants at this point in his life, it could be a pivotal moment in Eddie’s character arc to explore those feelings. Eddie and his father, Ramon, have started to bridge some of that distance between themselves, but we haven’t seen much between Eddie and his mother. So, it would be interesting to see him and his parents together again and what that relationship could look like now. Again, that’s if Eddie wants to do so. Being home can also bring things into focus. (Disney/Ray Mickshaw) You never know where you’re going until you know where you’ve been or something like that. Eddie’s still figuring himself out and the things he wants, and perhaps being back in old places will help him discover or even re-discover pieces of himself as he continues on a journey of self-reflection and truly looks himself in the mirror. Shaving the mustache and removing the mask was the first step to really embracing himself, letting himself find pockets of joy, and feeling worthy of that. Texas could be an essential moment for Eddie to reconcile with his past as he continues to move on with his future, which brings me to Los Angeles. No matter whether or not Eddie moves away, there’s no doubt in my mind that he will eventually return to Los Angeles. (Disney/Christopher Willard) There was a specific reason why the reveal of Eddie considering moving was set up so that Buck would find out inadvertently and be conflicted about it. Eddie moving to Texas would be about Eddie first and foremost, but of course, Buck would feel some way about it. Their journeys are linked in various ways, and naturally, Eddie’s absence in Buck’s life would elicit a reaction. Bucks stepped up to help Eddie when he first learned about the potential move, but he showed trepidation. While he may be outwardly supportive of Eddie’s decision, there will undoubtedly be some internal debate about what that could mean for them. Leaving Los Angeles means leaving the 118 and Buck. Over the years, the two have cultivated a relationship and a family dynamic that’s become extremely important to them. We’ve seen Eddie outside of the 118, and they can find a way to fill his spot (hello, Ravi!), but his potentially giving up his spot will be a change for a team that has just been reunited with the return of Bobby from his stint over at Hotshots. Just like Hen had her moments adjusting to Chimney’s absence while he was away from the job and the city, the same could be said for Buck. (Disney/Christopher Willard) He’ll likely struggle in the aftermath of losing his work partner and one of his closest confidants. We all know Buck’s history and his fears of abandonment, which will likely bring forth a lot of deep-rooted feelings. Where will that leave the Buckley-Diaz family? There’s the potential for some really fascinating storytelling as the two navigate this new dimension of their relationship: distance. Outside of Buck, Eddie’s absence from Los Angeles would have a ripple effect that would be an intriguing place to take 9-1-1 at this stage of the game.  Having the 9-1-1 we’re used to while setting up this new world in El Paso for Eddie, even if only short-term, would bring something different to the long-running series. Eddie confronting his past has been years in the making, and considering how much his storyline has been neglected at the beginning of 9-1-1 Season 8, they owe it to Eddie and, frankly, to the audience to give this storyline the time and care it deserves. (Disney/Chris Willard) No one is saying Eddie has to be there for the remainder of the season; in fact, I may revolt if that were to happen, but if they commit to it, they need to commit. Eddie Diaz is an underutilized character, at times, who deserves this exploration, and now is the time. Put him at the front of his own story. I’m sure you all have many thoughts about this, so do let me know your thoughts about Eddie potentially moving back to Texas. Will the show go there? Let me know how you feel about the possible development in the comments so we can discuss it!9-1-1 returns to ABC on March 6 at 8/7c. Watch 9-1-1 Online",
