  "text": "Miracles happen, and 20 years after The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement premiered, Disney ordered Princess Diaries 3. Anne Hathaway announced the project in early October, saying she would return to Genova. I was a diehard fan of the original 2001 film and its 2004 sequel, which launched Anne Hathaway’s acting career. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) Typically, I dislike reboots and revivals that occur years later. Still, this one has the potential to be nostalgic for long-time fans and inspire a new generation to appreciate Anne Hathaway and Julie Andrews’ talents. The original film featured Hathaway’s Mia Thermopolis, who learns she’s the heir apparent to the Genovian throne. She learned how to become a princess, and Andrews’ Queen Clarisse learned how to become a loving grandmother and a regal queen. The Princess Diaries navigated Mia’s awkward teen years with the help of her grandmother, her driver Joseph, and her friends Lily and Michael Moscovitz. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) The sequel continued Mia’s journey from princess to queen under her grandmother’s guidance while she experienced the drama of falling in love and royal scandals. Let’s discuss how the previous films ended, what we know about The Princess Diaries 3, and our ideal movie plot. How Did The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement End? The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement picked up five years after the original film. Soon after Mia arrives in Genova to celebrate her 21st birthday, she learns she must marry within a month, or she won’t be crowned queen when Queen Clarisse relinquishes the throne. As the queen and Mia try to find her a proper suitor, Mia falls for Nicholas Devereaux (Chris Pine). However, Nicholas’s swarming uncle schemes for him to take the crown instead, and Mia experiences heartbreak. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) Nicholas falls in love with Mia, and Mia makes a speech, convincing parliament to allow her to rule as an unmarried woman until she gets married. Watch Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement Online What Has Anne Hathaway Teased About The Princess Diaries 3? On October 5, 2024, Hathaway posted the official announcement of the third Princess Diaries film. Hathaway will produce and star in The Princess Diaries 3, with production beginning next year. She’s been overwhelmed by the fans’ excitement about this franchise. She understands the wait has been frustrating but maintains that all interested parties wanted to wait until they found the perfect script. Is Julie Andrews On Board for The Princess Diaries 3? Julie Andrews‘s reaction has varied. She was enthusiastic shortly after the first two films were released, but now she was wary that too much time had passed and that they should leave it be. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) However, in most of her interviews, she maintained that she would love to work with Anne Hathaway again. Hathaway is determined to get Andrews back for the third film, and we love what she told Entertainment Tonight back in 2022. “If there’s any way to get Julie Andrews involved, I think we would make it work. We would go to where she was, put a green screen behind her, and just make it happen.” she shared. That is the spirit she learned from Andrews. Who Is Directing The Princess Diaries 3? Disney Studios hired Adele Lim, who has worked on Crazy Rich Asians and Raya and the Last Dragon, to direct The Princess Diaries 3. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) Lim was excited to carry on Garry Marshall’s legacy in this franchise. “As a die-hard fan of the original Princess Diaries, I’m beyond excited to be a part of bringing the third iteration of this beloved franchise to life. We look forward to celebrating its core tenants of female power, joy and mentorship with audiences worldwide,” Lim stated. Both Actors Who Played Mia’s Love Interests Wish to Return Both Robert Schwartzman (Michael Moscovitz) and Chris Pine (Nicholas Devereaux) would love to return for the third film. Schwartzman didn’t appear in the 2004 sequel because he was touring with his band, Rooney, and they wrote in the script that Michael was touring with his band. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) Since the idea of a third Princess Diaries film has been in the works for years, Schwartzman told Variety in 2022 that he would love to be involved. “Of course, if the producers and the studio felt that that story is going to live on with the same actors,” Schwartzman said. “How cool is it to just be able to have been a part of a movie that really had an impact and still is out in the world?” Chris Pine was equally enthusiastic. Earlier this year, he told Entertainment Tonight, “Yeah, I’m here! I’m here for it. Give me give me a phone call or an email.” Flora Greeson, who wrote the script for The High Note, wrote the script for the third film. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) The plot for The Princess Diaries 3 hasn’t been revealed yet, but Meg Cabot, the author of The Princess Diaries novels, has confirmed it won’t be a prequel. The author kept most teasers secretive, saying there were many differences between the books and the movies, and they were both excellent. For those that don’t know, Princess Mia ended up with Michael in the books, while she dated Nicholas Devereaux in The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement, a character not in the books. Both love interests have massive fan bases, so seeing which one Mia ends up with will be interesting. Another Enticing Plot for The Princess Diaries 3 Since The Princess Diaries 3 will premiere nearly 25 years after the original, ideally, Mia will be married and settled with one of her love interests. I’m rooting for Michael. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) Most audiences won’t want to see a middle-aged queen in a love triangle who is still unmarried. Therefore, repeating the plot from the original film with Mia’s teenage daughter would work better. Hear me out. It worked when Netflix rebooted the rom-com She’s All That and brought back the sequel 20 years later, having Rachael Leigh Cook’s daughter make over a nerd in He’s All That instead. There is no reason it can’t work as well with Mia teaching her teenage daughter the proper ways to be a Royal princess. Teenage Mia was heartwarming and hilarious, so if they cast the right person, they could highlight similar ironic moments. Ideally, Julie Andrews and Hector Elizondo will join the cast, too, since Queen Clarisse and Joseph were important mentors and would guide her daughter. (Disney Plus/ Screenshot) While reboots and revivals have taken over Hollywood, this could combine nostalgia and modern elements for new and old fans. I can’t wait! What about you, TV Fanatics?
