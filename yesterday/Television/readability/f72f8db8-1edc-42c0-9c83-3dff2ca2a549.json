  "text": "Late-night TV and Hot Ones legend Conan O’Brien has presided over his fair share of awards shows, including two turns as host of the Emmys — but how did his act go over at the 97th Academy Awards? After acting nominees Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande opened Sunday’s Oscars ceremony with a medley of songs from Wicked, O’Brien emerged from the body of Demi Moore, Substance style, and took center stage to deliver a series of jokes that poked fun at Best Picture nominees such as The Brutalist and Conclave, as well as Emilia Pérez star Karla Sofia Gascón’s social media scandal. Among the highlights from his monologue: * “It’s Hollywood’s biggest night… which starts at four in the afternoon,” O’Brien began. “Netflix leads all studios with an impressive 18 — count them, 18 price increases! I think they can beat that next year.” * “Wicked is nominated tonight in 10 categories. It’s the perfect movie for anyone who has ever finished watching The Wizard of Oz and thought, ‘Sure, but where all the minor characters go to college?” * “I loved The Brutalist, I really did. I didn’t want it to end, and luckily, it didn’t.” * “I’m a Catholic boy, love Conclave…. If you haven’t seen Conclave, it’s logline is, ‘A movie about the Catholic Church, but don’t worry…..'” That’s it, that’s the joke. O’Brien then noted that “this is actually Ralph Fiennes’ third time being nominated. If he doesn’t win tonight, we all get to call him Ralph.” * “Little fact for you, Anora uses the F word 479 times. That’s three more than the record set by Karla Sofía Gascón’s publicist,” O’Brien joked. And he didn’t stop there, singling out Gascón and requesting, “If you are going to tweet about the Oscars, remember, my name is Jimmy Kimmel.” O’Brien also took a moment to address the recent wildfires that ravaged Los Angeles, not far from the Dolby Theatre at Ovation Hollywood where Sunday’s ceremony was held. “Any award show can seem self indulgent and superfluous,” he acknowledged, “but what I want to do is have us all remember why we gather here tonight. Yes, we will honor many beautiful and talented A-list stars, but the Oscars also shine a light on an incredible community of people you will never see — crafts people, artisans, technicians, costumers…. There are too many hard working men and women behind the camera who have devoted their lives to making film. Many people we celebrate tonight are not famous, they’re not wealthy, but they are devoted to a craft that can, in moments, bring us all a little closer together. “Now, for almost a century, we have paused every spring to elevate and celebrate an art form that has the power, at its very best, to unite us. So yes, even in the face of terrible wildfires and divisive politics, the work — which is what this is about — the work continues,” he said. “Next year, and for years to come, through trauma and joy, this seemingly absurd ritual is going to be here. I will not, I’m leaving Hollywood to run a bed and breakfast in Orlando, and I’d like to see you there. But the magic, the madness, the grandeur and the joy of film, worldwide, is going to be with us forever.” The Oscars’ Most Memorable Moments Full video of O’Brien’s Oscars monologue — which also included cameos by John Lithgow and Adam Sandler — will be added as soon as it is made available.
