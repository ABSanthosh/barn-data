We thoroughly enjoyed the crossover event, but there’s something about checking back in with our favorite characters from the one show following various near-death encounters. So, what’s about to go down? Let’s dive in! (Peter Gordon/NBC) Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 12, titled “Relief Cut,” sounds like a busy hour that will set up the most significant arcs for the back half of the season. The synopsis begins, “Herrmann investigates the rise in missing fire hydrants and teams up with Kylie to track them down.” (Peter Gordon/NBC) Fire hydrants can be the difference between life and death in a fire, so it’s disconcerting that someone is likely messing with them. Fire Hydrants Are MIA on Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 12 Why else would they go missing? Chicago Fire has featured its fair share of shocking plots during its 13-year existence, but we can’t wait to see how they handle this one. There’s no telling why fire hydrants are disappearing, but Herrmann and Kylie are a solid one-two punch that will probably solve this case by the end of the episode. (Peter Gordon/NBC) They may have to turn to Severide, whom we’re sure has some contacts or ideas for leads they can follow. As we said, this is an important storyline, so we hope it’s handled well. Also coming up on what’s sure to be a fiery installment, “Kidd’s cousin comes to town, revealing surprising family history.” Kidd was caught up in the throes of danger during the One Chicago crossover, and we genuinely thought there was a chance she wouldn’t make it out alive. (Peter Gordon/NBC) Her team-up with Chicago P.D.’s Ruzek was brilliant because it showcased a completely different side of her personality. That’s what we love the most about the crossovers. Bringing these personalities from different series together to find out how they work together is part of the fun. Kidd has been a great addition to the Chicago Fire family, so it’s time we learned more about her extended family members. The series has done a remarkable job of fleshing out her character throughout her impressive arc, but there’s still so much more to tell, as evidenced by the emphasis on her past. Are We Getting Some Stellaride Goodness? (Peter Gordon/NBC) There’s a lot to mine from such a brilliant character, but what will this mysterious cousin bring to the table? It sounds like the individual will have a revelation or two, but we don’t know what those may be. Chicago Fire is like a rollercoaster sometimes, but there’s every reason to believe this storyline will have far-reaching ripple effects. We should also get some great Kidd and Severide scenes because they’ve carved out this beautiful bond in recent seasons and lean on each other during the most trying times. The third and final storyline of the episode focuses on Violet and Novak as they “treat the victim of a birthday cake smash gone awry.” (Peter Gordon/NBC) We hear about this kind of thing going wrong all the time, so it’s another opportunity for Chicago Fire to tackle a storyline that viewers probably have preconceptions about. A crime may have been committed if a victim is involved, indicating a character crossover with Chicago P.D. Despite getting the first three-show crossover in five years last month, characters appear across all three shows regularly, proving that it’s one big connected universe. That said, the promo is Severide-heavy, showcasing the firefighting hero at Molly’s. Chicago Fire Has Some Interesting Storylines Coming Up The official promo for the upcoming episode also features scenes from Chicago Med and Chicago P.D., showcasing how the characters are holding up after the crossover’s high-stakes events. Our Chicago P.D. Season 12 Episode 12 spoilers tease Torres going undercover as KevKi joins forces to crack a dangerous case. We’d have much rathered a promo for each of the three shows, but a three-in-one probably felt necessary to NBC in the wake of the crossover. Chicago Fire Season 13 has been a banner season, showcasing that the series still has a lot of life despite some big casting shakeups in recent years. Most long-running shows hit major snags creatively, but Chicago Fire is soldiering on with conviction. (Peter Gordon/NBC) There are many questions about how the season will wrap up, but we’re sure there will be some big swings to leave fans questioning what will happen over the summer. The One Chicago universe loves cliffhangers, but at least they give us plenty to ponder! There’s so much to dissect with this franchise, and we love every minute of it. What are your thoughts on the latest spoilers, Chicago Fire Fanatics? What’s your take on Stella’s blast from the past? What could this mysterious family member reveal? Pull up a seat, and let’s theorize in the comments section. Watch Chicago Fire Online",
