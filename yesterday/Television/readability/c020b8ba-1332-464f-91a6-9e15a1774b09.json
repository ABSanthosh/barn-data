  "text": "Kenya Moore Apologizes for Photo Prank That Led to RHOA Exit: ‘I Didn’t Have to Take It That Far’ — WatchKenya Moore is coming clean. In an interview that aired Thursday on Tamron Hall, the longtime Real Housewives of Atlanta star apologized for the prank that led to her abrupt exit from the Bravo reality series earlier this year. “I believe the photos were very distasteful, and I elevated the situation,” Moore admitted to host Tamron Hall. “I am sorry for what I’ve done. I didn’t have to take it that far.” But she did take it that far, she said, because she felt her child was being threatened. (Moore gave birth to a daughter, Brooklyn, in 2018.) “I’ve never had a child and been in a situation like this before,” she noted while fighting back tears. “So that’s why I escalated it, to the point where I was protecting not only myself but my child.” The photos Moore referred to were sexually explicit images of her new RHOA castmate Brittany Eady, which Moore reportedly reproduced and put on display at a grand opening party for her hair salon. (The party was filmed for RHOA’s upcoming Season 16.) “The network is still reviewing the content Kenya displayed during filming,” a Bravo source told Entertainment Tonight at the time. Bravo suspended Moore while investigating the incident, and the network ultimately decided she wouldn’t return to the show in June. Moore had been a Real Housewives of Atlanta cast member since Season 5, with a brief demotion to “guest” status in Season 11. She also joined the Season 1 cast of the Peacock crossover event Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip along with fellow Real Housewives legends Teresa Giudice, Luann de Lesseps, Kyle Richards and more. Watch a clip from Kenya’s interview below, and hit the comments to share your thoughts on her departure.",
