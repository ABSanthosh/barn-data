  "text": "In true Fire Country fashion, the series can’t let any character be happy for too long. Unfortunately for Bode, he has been smiling more and more, and it looks like the writers have caught on. In the “My Team” promo, Bode seems to still be recovering from the civilian he couldn’t save in “I’m the One Who Just Goes Away.” By the end, it looks like Bode’s old drug addiction comes back into play. Any Fire Country fans who have forgotten that Bode once struggled with drug use would easily be forgiven. With only a handful of references, the series has never gone that far into Bode’s drug addiction. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) However, if you’ve kept up with the recent Fire Country reviews, then you know the show has been backtracking by using already-established details to help flesh out a lot of the characters. Bode gets plenty of grief for being too one-dimensional at times, but this might be a bridge too far. No one wants to see Edgewater’s hometown hero spiral down that black hole. Bode Has Reached That Point in His Story Where He’s Going to Have to Face All Things He’s Been Running from Since Fire Country Season 1 I’ll be the first to admit that I was not the biggest Bode fan, especially in Fire Country Season 1. It wasn’t just the character but how the story framed itself around him. Bode always ” followed his instincts” by constantly breaking the rules, and he was treated like a hero because things always magically worked out in the end. However, the series has really ramped up the writing to the point that Bode has become as complex and layered as a character can be. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Bode’s only real struggle is how he processes grief and whether he’s learning the right lessons from the tragedies he has experienced. On Fire Country Season 3 Episode 12, Bode and Jake could not save an avalanche victim, and the “My Team” promo suggests that Bode is having a tough time with that loss. While what he could be going through would be completely understandable, that’s not the message the civilian, Rafael, was trying to leave Bode with. Rafael knew he wouldn’t make it and accepted that outcome because he understood it was out of his control. He spent his last moments enjoying the beautiful night sky. At the very least, it would be an excellent time for another character to suggest Bode talk to a counselor or psychologist. It’s been long overdue because he definitely didn’t see one after Riley died. This is why it is so frustrating that we hear Uncle Luke in the promo telling Bode, “Pick your poison. Otherwise, this job will eat you up alive.” (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Uncle Luke Is Back in Town Despite All the Fuss That Was Made Over His New Job in Japan The official synopsis for Fire Country Season 3 Episode 13 reads, “Station 42 responds to a fire in the dugout before the annual county clash baseball rivalry game. “Meanwhile, Vince’s ex-girlfriend (Constance Zimmer) returns.” That’s at least one possible reason Michael Trucco’s (The Fall of the House of Usher) Luke is making another appearance. He is the type to take a friendly county baseball rivalry far too seriously. Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t he supposed to be in Japan? I’m having trouble believing he would fly the twelve hours back after the big deal he made in Fire Country Season 3 Episode 10. Has he not left yet? Sharon and Vince wasted no time moving Walter in with them, but Luke was nowhere in sight this whole time. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Hopefully, he didn’t fly all the way back just to give Bode seemingly terrible life advice. To be fair, there has yet to be a single man in that family who wouldn’t benefit from hours of therapy. And it looks like Luke and Bode won’t be the only Leone men in the hot seat for once as a blast from Vince’s past blows through town. For All of Fire Country’s Improvements, It Still Falls Short When It Comes to Guest and Side Characters With how charming and kind Billy Burke‘s Vince Leone is, it’s a wonder he doesn’t have former flames constantly knocking down his door. If nothing else, it would help break up the drama-heavy arc he’s going through with his father developing Dementia. This is definitely the time to bring in some scorned-lover hilarity. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Besides, aren’t you dying to see how Sharon reacts to one of Vince’s past loves? Especially after she had that emotional fling with Liam. Remember the guy who showed up in Edgewater on Fire Country Season 2 Episode 2 looking for her? The one who “bonded” with Sharon during the campaign fire. Whatever happened to him, anyway? For that matter, is Diego just never returning home again? How come Freddy never visits? And what about Gen? Is she permanently gone? Despite all the improvements Fire Country has made, the show still has a habit of abandoning ideas and characters when they no longer serve a purpose. However, this might be more in the new direction if Vince’s ex is also the woman he kissed. Remember when Sharon confronted Walter about it on Fire Country Season 1 Episode 20? Either way, Constance Zimmer is a scene-stealer in her own right and likely to stir up drama one way or the other. (Courtesy of CBS) Constance Zimmer Is Bringing Her Decades in the TV Industry as a Scene-Stealer Over to Fire Country I don’t know where to start regarding Constance Zimmer’s prolific career in television. She has a chameleon-like presence and charisma that allows her to easily fit into any show or genre. Most might remember her as the movie executive Dana Gordon from the wildly popular HBO series Entourage. That job is essentially what rose her to prominence. From there, she took guest roles on other incredible shows like Grey’s Anatomy and The Newsroom alongside Jeff Daniels. Zimmer has rubbed elbows with her fair share of talent and will bring all of that experience to Fire Country. Although, like Jared Padalecki‘s Camden Casey, I have a feeling she’ll be here for more than one episode. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) As great as Vince is, I doubt Zimmer’s character, Renee, trekked all the way to Edgewater just to see the Cal Fire Captain’s handsome face. Her visit will likely tie into whatever she does for work, and considering Vince’s taste in women, it’s possible Renee (Constance Zimmer) also works with the fire department in some fashion. Between Bode backsliding, fires in a baseball field dugout, and former flames rolling through town, “My Team” is already packed to the brim. Hopefully, they leave room to continue exploring Audrey and Bode’s budding romance. Plus, we will likely get more into Walter’s condition with Luke back in town.
