  "text": "It’s been a long, bumpy ride, but there is some hope for Days of Our Lives’ future. Lead actresses Susan Seaforth Hayes (Julie) and Deidre Hall (Marlena) recently confirmed in an interview that the ridiculous Body \u0026 Soul storyline will end by the time the new writers take over, if not before. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 11-18-24 suggest that we’re at the beginning of the end of this stupid story, but sadly, we’re not done yet. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 11-18-24 Say That Almost Everyone Gets Sick At The Body \u0026 Soul Premiere This silly meta storyline has been sickening the audience for weeks, and now it’s the actors’ and crew members’ turn. In all seriousness, this sounds like a replay of the poisoned biscuit nonsense. Why do these things always have to happen to Chanel? She’s such a positive, big-hearted person, so can everyone please stop trying to poison her and ruin her career? These types of storylines also tend to result in people losing their inhibitions and hooking up with the person they really want to be with (see Eric and Nicole during the poisoned biscuit story) or telling secrets they’ve been trying to keep to themselves. Does anyone else think that whatever’s causing the illness will also cause Johnny’s hookup with Joy to come out? That secret has to come to the surface somehow, and if the illness is caused by everyone being high, that would be the perfect (yet very predictable) way to do it. (Peacock/Screenshot) But Wait… Johnny’s Supposed To Reach His Breaking Point With This Secret Further Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 11-18-24 suggest that this one-night stand story isn’t over yet, as Johnny’s guilt is supposed to grow until he gets close to his breaking point. Thus, it’s not likely that the secret comes out yet unless Johnny and Joy are overheard arguing about it on the Body \u0026 Soul set. The story is at that point where Johnny keeps telling Joy he wants to tell Chanel, while Joy wants him to keep quiet so that Chanel won’t hate her forever. Talking about it where other people can hear (like the Body \u0026 Soul set) is stupid. I will never understand why Salem residents always insist on doing this. (Peacock/Screenshot) Is Joy Doing Drugs? One possibility is that the poisoning is an accident because someone’s personal drugs got into the actors’ food. Many soap opera stars over the years have had drug problems behind the scenes, so former head writer Ron Carlivarti might have decided to incorporate that into the Body \u0026 Soul storyline There is a strangely worded spoiler that says, “Joy is doing lines with Alex.” That could mean that she is running lines with Alex. However, “doing lines” sounds like the two of them snorting cocaine or speed. I hope not. Days of Our Lives does not do addiction stories well, and any drug storyline right now would likely be connected to this stupid poisoning story. But with Joy supposedly being a troublemaker and Body \u0026 Soul having poisoning drama, I wouldn’t be surprised if the spoiler means exactly what it says. (Peacock/Screenshot) Javi Won’t Listen To Gabi About Leo, Not That This Relationship Will Last Love in the air… sort of. Gabi had already warned Javi about Leo, and he refused to listen. Now, Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 11-18-24 suggest that the two will get closer, aggravating Gabi more. Unfortunately, this is Salem, so the new couple will be happy for about five seconds. (Peacock/Screenshot) Further Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 11-18-24 say that Javi accused Leo of betraying him. I’d love to know what that means. Javi must tell Leo a secret that somehow gets out. Leo is known as a gossip columnist, though he supposedly gave that up to become the head writer for Body \u0026 Soul. It’s interesting how Javi “loves a bad boy” when Gabi warns him against Leo, but the second said bad boy MIGHT have told his secret, he’s ready to be done with the relationship. In Salem, it doesn’t seem to manage what age you are. Everyone reverts to acting like a teenager as soon as something goes wrong in their relationship. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 11-18-24 Suggest JJ and Gabi Will Again Get Close I’m not sure how I feel about a JJ/Gabi hookup. I didn’t like them together the last time, especially after JJ “cheated” with Lani in an encounter that would have been labeled non-consensual had the person who was so drunk they couldn’t remember anything been female. Gabi kept accusing him of having “blackout sex” with her rival, which made no sense since, again, people who are that drunk cannot consent. Plus, as JJ pointed out the other day, Gabi used an app to control Julie’s pacemaker and threaten her health in order to get revenge on her back in the day. Still, that was literally a different Gabi — a different actress, a different time of life. Gabi was supposed to be in revenge-seeking mode then. So far, she seems to be avoiding behavior that would get her labeled as the next generation’s Sami Brady. She didn’t go off on Jada for “stealing” Rafe’s job, so maybe she is serious enough about changing to be worthy of JJ. (Peacock/Screenshot) Cat Has An Idea About How To Trap Clyde Um… yay? I’m sorry, but the only thing that has interested me about this Cat storyline is JJ trying to talk some sense into Chad. I can see from a mile away where this is going. Chad and Cat will fall for each other for real while working together to defeat Clyde. I don’t ship these two. They have no chemistry, and Cat pretended to be Chad’s dead wife to scam him instead of telling anyone that a guy in maximum security prison was threatening to hurt her mother if she didn’t participate in the con. (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 11-18-24 Promise An Awkward Encounter Between Philip And Stephanie This should be interesting! Philip and Stephanie were a couple years ago. They weren’t very memorable, at least not to me; the only thing that sticks in my mind is that Stephanie was kidnapped while dating Philip. Years later, new actors have taken over both roles, and I’m curious about their chemistry. Philip had reconciled with Chloe before the last time he left town but now seems to have broken up with her for no good reason (supposedly, Vivian warned him, and he listened—what?). However, no matter what chemistry these two have now, Stephanie is drifting toward Alex again, so the best they can do is have a love triangle. (Peacock/Screenshot) Sarah Tries To Walk After Finishing Her Treatment Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 11-18-24 say that Sarah will try to take her first steps. Realistically, even if this magical serum works, she should need physical therapy to be able to walk again after being in a wheelchair for months. Then again, there’s no such thing as an experimental serum you inject into your spine to reverse paralysis, so we can’t demand too much reality. I’m looking forward to Sarah learning to walk again, even though I don’t like the ableist message that people in wheelchairs can’t be good parents.
