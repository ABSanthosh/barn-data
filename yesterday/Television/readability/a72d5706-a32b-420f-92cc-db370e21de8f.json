  "text": "Patience isn’t satisfied with just kidnapping Isaac during Ghosts‘ Season 4 premiere. Opening with a flashback to 1692, the episode reveals that Patience was asked to leave her community when she was alive. She was too severe and joyless even for the Puritans, wanting to execute a young girl for talking to a doll — surely a sign of witchcraft, she argues — and she hasn’t lost any of that scary stringency in the present. She’s also developed a disturbing habit of exclaiming her own name. Isaac tries to save his hide by appealing to Patience, pretending to be happy to be reunited. “Who wouldn’t enjoy staring at that gorgeous, porcelain skin?” he says, to which Patience replies, “‘Tis from the bloodletting that killed me.” But he’s lonely and misses his friends, Isaac laments. Meanwhile, Sam and the ghosts note that Isaac is missing, but assume at first that he’s just recovering from the drama of his ill-fated wedding. They ask a lovelorn Nigel, who’s still living in the house, if he’s seen Isaac. Then while questioning Nancy and the basement ghosts, they discover the truth. Nancy insists that they didn’t know Patience was going to pull Isaac into the dirt; they just thought she wanted to talk. As Sam and the ghosts discuss the situation, Patience reaches out and grabs Sas into her cave. She’s brought Isaac a friend, just like he wanted, so they can spend eternity together. (Thor, worried that Patience is coming for him next, keeps looking over his shoulder.) Isaac views his current predicament as punishment for letting down everyone in his life, before and after his death. He tells Sas that if they get out of this, he’s going to become a better person. But not just yet, because, for the moment, he describes Patience as having gone mad, and he and Sas mock Patience’s behavior. When she overhears, she remarks that it’s her own fault for thinking that they actually liked her. Surprisingly, she lets them go and returns to her one true friend, the dirt. Back at the mansion with the others, Sas reminds Isaac of his vow to be better and how the two of them abandoned Patience when she needed friends, just like they did 130 years ago. Having deciphered that Patience’s lair is under the property’s dripping fountain, Sam suggests that they right a wrong. Trevor then comes up with the idea that they form a ghost chain to reach Patience and bring her to the B\u0026B. By episode’s end, Patience is sharing a room with Alberta, much to the latter’s dismay. Ghosts fans, what did you think of Patience? Grade the season opener, then hit the comments!",
