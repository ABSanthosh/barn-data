  "text": "You guys, it’s finally happening. Buffy the Vampire Slayer is poised to return to TV screens 22 years after its well-watched and acclaimed series finale. While we’ve heard that the show could return countless times over the years, none of those takes had Sarah Michelle Gellar attached. (Hulu/Screenshot) Deadline reports that the iconic actress is expected to headline a revival series at Hulu. The project is very much in its infancy, but Sarah’s readiness to pick up the stake and slay vampires again is a big leap forward because she was M.I.A. from a planned reboot a few years ago. (Hulu/Screenshot) The beloved actress famously decided to walk away from Buffy the Vampire Slayer after its seventh season. Who Will Return For Buffy the Vampire Slayer 2.0? Chloé Zhao will direct the revamp pilot, which was penned by Nora and Lilla Zuckerman (Poker Face). The news came out of the left field and leaves us with many questions about what the series will be about and, more importantly, which other franchise alums could return. Buffy the Vampire Slayer was known for tackling storylines other series shied away from. Its storyline followed a young woman tasked with keeping the town of Sunnydale safe from the growing threat of the undead. (Hulu/Screenshot) But Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 7 Episode 22 took that burden away from her when her BFF, Willow (Alyson Hannigan), used magic to draw power from a mystical scythe to allow every girl in the world that could be a slayer to become one. Granted, it was a desperate effort from the Scooby Gang to save Sunnydale — and the rest of the world — from the First Evil. The world has changed a lot since Buffy the Vampire Slayer was last on the air, but we couldn’t think of a better home for the next chapter than Hulu. Will The Series Adapt the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Comic Books? (Hulu/Screenshot) The original series has been available to stream on the platform for years, so having another chapter available for fans is something many never thought possible. Buffy the Vampire Slayer also spawned a spinoff, Angel, headlined by David Boreanaz. Having David and Sarah sharing the screen again would be electric. Of course, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel continued in comic book form, and the creators stated that their events are considered canon. That probably won’t ring true when Buffy returns to take a bite out of the streaming world because many viewers haven’t read the comic books. (Hulu/Screenshot) Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon has no involvement in the update, which isn’t too surprising considering that many of the show’s stars came forward with misconduct allegations in 2021. A new Buffy the Vampire Slayer series featuring Sarah at the helm wasn’t on our bingo card for 2025, but now that it seems to be moving forward, the fan base will be very excited. Understandably, there will be some reservations because reboots rarely recapture the magic of the original, and this new series could go wrong in so many ways. All we can do is hope for the best. (Hulu/Screenshot) What are your thoughts on Sarah agreeing to reprise this iconic role? Are you skeptical that the show will work in today’s world? Hit the comments below.
