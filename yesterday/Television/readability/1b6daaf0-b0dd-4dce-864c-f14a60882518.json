  "text": "If you’re anything like me, you’re DYING to know how Voight will respond to Chapman’s return. Who would’ve imagined that Sarah Bues’ familiar character returning would somehow trump the iconic Shawn Hatosy’s portrayal of shady Reid? But our girl Chapman left us (and Voight hanging), so she and Reid in the same episode? Yeah, Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 15 cannot be missed. (Lori Allen/NBC) Chicago PD’s Big Guns Wears Heels and Takes No Sh*t Words cannot describe how much I’ve missed Nina Chapman. After she sauntered out of her life and hopped a plane to Phonix after a shocking admission on Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 4, I’ve been counting down the seconds until her return. She turned our lives upside down, but none more than Voight, when she admitted to him that she had feelings for him and that there was nothing he could do about it. Chapman is such a Boss Babe, so naturally, even her copping-to-catching feelings for Voight would be one of her most badass moments. Sara Bues took some time off for maternity leave, but now she’s reclaiming her role, and the timing could not be better. Reid is Back and On that BS, Baby! (Lori Allen/NBC) It’s been a minute since we’ve had to deal with Reid, but we know he’s been waiting in the wings to screw with Voight and Intelligence. Voight may have met his match with this man, but the problem is that he’s been this threat we hear about but hardly see on the fringes of the series while the team is focusing on other things. We know that Reid has Voight under his thumb, and it’s not where Voight loves to be. From the synopsis, it sounds like Reid is stirring up more trouble when Reid starts a Violence Reduction initiative in a neighborhood where many gangs are fighting over territory. On the surface, it may not seem like much, but we’ve learned that there’s always a catch when it comes to Reid. Chapman’s Return Marks Voight’s Greatest Ally Assisting with Reid (Lori Allen/NBC) Say whatever you’d like about Chapman, but that queen always has Voight’s back. She’ll walk through the fiery pits of hell to do it, and she’s incredibly protective of him, which means that the second she learns about this Reid situation, the Big Guy himself won’t keep her away. Interestingly, the promo alludes to the fact that Voight may confide in her about Reid for the first time. I wonder if the two have even spoken much in the months since she departed. On a personal front, this girl needs to know the deal and if Voight will finally allow himself to get a little loving. But aside from that, Chapman has strongly asserted herself as Voight’s equal and partner. She does not want the kids who work underneath him, whom he oversees and pulls rank on when the situation calls for it. ( Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) In the promo, we hear her asking Voight if Reid has dirt on him, and he confirms that to be the truth. When it comes to Nina Chapman, she doesn’t need to know much more—she’ll have Voight and Intelligence’s back through and through, and she should have the connections to Reid on a deeper level. Voght and Reid Standoff’s Standoff Intensifies We’ve had more of a cold war between Voight and Reid up until this point. We know Reid is shady and is waging his own political battles regarding Voight and everything else he’s doing these days. (Lori Allen/NBC) But Voight hasn’t crossed direct paths with Reid too much. Fortunately, that’ll change when he comes into contact with him again during Chicago PD Season 12 Episode 15. Reid’s motivations for this new initiative may be unsavory, which could pose a problem for Voight in more ways than one. The stills suggest that Intelligence may score another big, action-packed case that takes them for a ride. It could be gang-related, with Reid’s initiative coming into play as a full-blown gang war takes off in a certain area. Voight No Longer Plays Nice with Reid (Lori Allen/NBC) The stills show that Voight and Reid cross paths wherever Reid is making his pitch about his latest initiative. But we also see them speaking to each other in the promo in a more intimate setting, perhaps Voight’s offices. And Voight cuts to the chase when he asks Reid who else he owns. The time for niceties may have disappeared, and the gloves are coming off. (Elizabeth Sisson/NBC) I can’t wait! Plus, a Voight and Chapman team-up against someone like Reid is my kind of television. But is it yours? Let us know in the comments below, Chicago PD Fanatics. Are you excited about Chapman’s return? Will they address the last thing she said to Voight? How long before Voight takes Reid down? Let’s hear your thoughts and theories. Watch Chicago PD Online",
