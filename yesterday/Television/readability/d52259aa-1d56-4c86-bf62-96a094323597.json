  "text": "The following contains spoilers from the April 4 episode of CBS‘ Fire Country. CBS’ Fire Country this week ignited a heated mother/son feud when Sharon (played by Diane Farr) — thanks to a tip from Jake’s (Jordan Calloway) lawyer girlfriend Violet — struck a deal with Big Bad Oxalta, to cover the remediation of the soil and water at the Three Rock well. Sharon also (somehow!) negotiated Manny’s (Kevin Alejandro) full release from fire camp, though the water poisoning victim in turn signed an NDA to not publicly rat out Oxalta. Gabriela (Stephanie Arcila) of course is thrilled to have her father 100% free and back in her life. Bode (Max Thieriot), however, had harsh words for his mom, whose settlement with Oxalta in theory allows the deep-pocketed chemical company to conduct its shady practices elsewhere. (As part of his protest, Bode asked Aunt Mickey to return his latest payday from her father Wes, though as he noted to Sharon, at least the illegal weed farmer isn’t out killing people.) During Fire Country star and co-creator Thieriot’s visit to our NYC video studio this week, TVLine asked if the Bode/Sharon feud will have legs, or will all be forgiven soon as the next episode arrives. “That [friction] will be something that goes on for a minute,” he confirmed. What’s more, “The Oxalta thing is going to part of the drama through at least the end of [Episode] 18 (airing April 18),” he previewed. “It’s a pretty beefy storyline that also brings in some other drama we have not seen yet.” Where do you stand on the settlement that Sharon and seemingly zero lawyers for Cal Fire negotiated? Given the incendiary data that Violet surreptitiously slipped her, was Sharon right to let Oxalta essentially skate in trade for them cleaning up the Three Rock mess?
