  "text": "Prime Video has a favor to ask: Save the date for Another Simple Favor. The sequel to A Simple Favor starring Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick will premiere Thursday, May 1 on the streamer, Amazon announced on Tuesday. The film will also have its world premiere on opening night of the South by Southwest film and TV festival on Friday, March 7. Prime Video announced last year that it had formally ordered a sequel to 2018’s A Simple Favor, with both Lively and Kendrick returning to star in the follow-up. Also returning: the original film’s director, Paul Feig, as well as OG co-stars Henry Golding, Andrew Rannells, Bashir Salahuddin, Joshua Satine, Ian Ho and Kelly McCormack. In the sequel, Kendrick’s Stephanie Smothers and Lively’s Emily Nelson head to Italy for the latter’s extravagant wedding to a rich Italian businessman. “Along with the glamorous guests, expect murder and betrayal to RSVP for a wedding with more twists and turns than the road from the Marina Grande to the Capri town square,” per the pic’s official description. A Simple Favor became something of a sleeper hit when it was released in 2018, grossing nearly $100 million worldwide. In recent months, though, Lively’s name has been all over the headlines thanks to an ugly legal battle between her and her It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni, with Lively accusing Baldoni of sexual harassment and Baldoni accusing Lively of sabotaging his career.",
