  "text": "Chris Wallace Leaving CNN After Three Years as Host and AnchorA veteran TV journalist is leaving the cable news game: Chris Wallace is exiting CNN after spending three years there as a host and anchor, TVLine has confirmed. Wallace told The Daily Beast (who first reported the news) that he’s looking to move to an independent platform via streaming or podcasting, since that’s “where the action seems to be” these days. “This is the first time in 55 years I‘ve been between jobs,” he added. “I am actually excited and liberated by that.” Wallace joined CNN in 2021, hosting the interview show Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace? and anchoring The Chris Wallace Show. He also offered political analysis and commentary during the network’s other news shows, including coverage of last week’s presidential election. Starting his TV career as a teenager by working as an assistant to legendary newsman Walter Cronkite in 1964, Wallace later served as White House correspondent at NBC News as well as anchoring weekend editions of the NBC Nightly News and hosting Meet the Press in the 1980s. Wallace moved to ABC in 1989, hosting Nightline and Primetime Live. He joined Fox News in 2003, remaining there for nearly two decades as the host of Fox News Sunday. In 2016, he became the first Fox News journalist to moderate a presidential debate, with Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton squaring off. He hosted another presidential debate in 2020, between Trump and Joe Biden. “Chris Wallace is one of the most respected political journalists in the news business with a unique track record across radio, print, broadcast television, cable television and streaming,” CNN CEO and chairman Mark Thompson said in a statement. “We want to thank him for the dedication and wisdom he’s brought to all his work at CNN and to wish him the very best for the future.”",
