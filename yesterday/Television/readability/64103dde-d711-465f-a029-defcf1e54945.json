  "text": "La La Anthony, whose TV credits over the past decade alone include Power, BMF and The Chi, is ready to be a lot less serious, as the star of a comedy. Our sister site Deadline reports that as but one part of a first-look deal that reality-TV vet/actress Kim Kardashian has signed with 20th Television, Anthony will headline Group Chat, a comedy based on Anthony’s best-selling The Love Playbook: Rules for Love, Sex, and Happiness (“the everywoman guide to dating, finding love, building healthy relationships, and staying true to yourself along the way”). Kenya Barris, creator of black-ish, will develop the series for Hulu and executive-produce alongside both Kardashian and Anthony, as well as Adam Kassan. UPDATE: Hulu has given Group Chat a pilot order, Deadline reported Wednesday. The potential series reportedly is about “five fly, successful women in their 40s who have conquered L.A. and seemingly have it all. But behind their picture perfect lives is a secret group chat where the real drama unfolds. In their world, the truth is messier, more unfiltered, and juicier than anyone could imagine.” In a joint statement regarding Kardashian’s first-look deal, Karey Burke, President of 20th Television, and Craig Erwich, President of Disney Television Group, said, “Kim is a multi-hyphenate in every sense of the word, who has her finger on the pulse of the zeitgeist while simultaneously helping to define it. Her success in television with our teams — from The Kardashians to American Horror Story: Delicate — coupled with her ability to capture the imaginations of millions, puts her in the unique position to develop and produce stories that will undoubtedly pierce the culture.”",
