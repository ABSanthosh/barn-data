  "text": "When Disney+’s Daredevil: Born Again debuts Tuesday, March 4, with its first two episodes (of nine), the second episode will be presented “In Loving Memory of Kamar de los Reyes,” as noted on an opening title card. De los Reyes — who was well known for his run as One Life to Live’s Antonio Vega, and other TV roles including Sleepy Hollow antagonist Jobe and All American‘s Coach Montes — passed away on Christmas Eve 2023, after a brief battle with cancer. Daredevil: Born Again had started production in March 2023, paused for the dual Hollywood strikes coupled with a creative overhaul, and resumed in January 2024. Kamar de los Reyes as Hector Ayala / White Tiger Courtesy of Giovanni Rufino In Daredevil: Born Again, de los Reyes can be seen in multiple episodes as Hector Ayala, a martial arts master who draws powers from magical Jade Tiger amulets and suits up as a vigilante known as White Tiger. When Hector is found at what looks like a murder scene and promptly lands in prison, Matt Murdock (played by Charlie Cox) boldly decides to take on the case, landing the lawyer squarely in the crosshairs of longtime adversary/new-ish NYC mayor Wilson Fisk (Vincent D’Onofrio) and his anti-vigilante agenda. “That story is so poignant for Matt Murdock and his world,” Daredevil: Born Again headliner Cox told Empire Magazine, “because he’s having to defend someone who does what he does without revealing to the world that coincidence.” When a trailer for Daredevil: Born Again debuted at last October’s New York Comic Con, de los Reyes’ widow, actress Sherri Saum (The Fosters) — whom he met on the set of OLTL, where she played Keri Reynolds — shared it on social media, remarking, “This is awesome. This is the project @kamardelosreyes was working on when he fell ill, but he finished it and he was so proud of it. So badass.” Saum went on to thank Daredevil: Born Again and the franchise’s fans “eternally” for “loving him and giving him such support. “It’s bittersweet,” she acknowledged, “but I cannot wait to see [it].” Sherri Saum with Caylen, John and Michael at the ‘Daredevil: Born Again’ New York premiere event on Feb. 24 (Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for Disney) And see it, she did. Saum was on hand for this week’s Daredevil: Born Again‘s New York premiere event, which she attended with her and de los Reyes’ twin sons, John and Michael, and de los Reyes’ son Caylen. Beyond his upcoming Daredevil: Born Again run, de los Reyes will also be seen in Sterling K. Brown’s upcoming Hulu drama, Washington Black.",
