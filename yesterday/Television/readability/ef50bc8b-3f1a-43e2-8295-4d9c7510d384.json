  "text": "January begins the very best time of the year for TV. All of the shows that hid in fear of the juggernaut that is the NFL come out to play, and this January, we are inundated with many new shows and returns. As it turns out, 2025 begins with a wealth of riches you do not want to miss. Thursday, January 2 Lockerbie: The Search for Truth (Peacock) (Peacock) For those of us who were alive for the Lockerbie terrorist attack, it’s a piece of history we’ll never forget. For those of you who have no recollection or any understanding of the tragedy that unfolded, your immersion in this horrifying tale of political unrest that claimed the lives of 270 people who were on the plane and on the ground Although the story received worldwide coverage at the time, we didn’t have 24-hour internet providing access to news and developments from around the world. Lockerbie: The Search for Truth reveals things that we had never known, painting a picture of the effects of terrorism, government ineptness, and one man’s quest to find the root cause of his daughter’s murder on Pan Am Flight 103 that is both heroic and mesmerizing. Friday, January 3 The Way Home (Hallmark Channel), 9/8c (Hallmark Media/Photographer: Christos Kalohoridis) Look, we get it. People were a little freaked out when Hallmark Media announced The Way Home was moving to Hallmark+. Hopefully, that corrected mistake won’t leave a sour taste in your mouth because you are going to love the new season. There is so much up in the air right now. How long had Colton been time-traveling? Is Casey Goodwin Alice’s daughter, and how does that happen? Will Kat be tempted by Thomas in the past or will she commit to Elliot in the future? How will Del take Jacob’s return, and how will he assimilate back into his original timeline And even better, this season takes us back to Del and Colton’s youth, when they met and fell in love. What secrets will the ’70s hold? This is The Way Home. We know they will have more surprises around every corner. Sunday, January 5 Mayfair Witches (Skip Bolen/AMC) When Mayfair Witches Season 1 premiered in 2023, the series squandered some of the best parts of the source material, but all of the promotional material for Season 2 so far has been exciting, leading us to believe the show could be turning a corner. Mayfair Witches has been off the air for almost two years, so there’s every reason to think the series will address some of the issues that plagued the freshman run. When Mayfair Witches Season 2 picks up, Rowan (Alexandra Daddario) is trying to come to terms with the events that almost left her for dead. However, she’s got a new danger in her life in the form of her son, Lasher, which sends her into a bit of a tailspin as she comes to terms with her past and what this new arrival means for her family’s future. Ben Feldman (Superstore) is along for a ride as a face from Rowan’s past, so we can’t wait to see how he fits into that universe. When Calls the Heart (Hallmark Channel) 9/8c When Calls the Heart returns for Season 12, the January return seems appropriate since this season focuses on new beginnings and opportunities. Nathan and Elizabeth must deal with Superintendant Hargrave’s news and move on, while Nathan must also train a new Mountie cadet who admires Jack and Bill. Lucas, Lee, and Rosemary struggle to find a compromise about Lee’s location while creating the National Park. We’re finally back to enriching character arcs and romance. Monday, January 6 Brilliant Minds (NBC) (Rafy/ NBC) It seems like Brilliant Minds just started, and it’s quickly now time for the two-part season finale of the NBC fan favorite. The Brilliant Minds Season 1 finale features high-stakes action and relationship drama as Ericka is in danger and Oliver learns someone lied to him. These episodes are not to be missed, and let’s all pray for a Season 2 renewal! The Curious Case of Natalia Grace (ID), 9/8c (ID/Screenshot) Yes, they actually managed to squeeze three seasons out of this poor girl’s life, leaving each of the first two seasons on stunning cliffhangers. Reality TV, man, amiright? The Final Chapter shows Natalia in another awful situation, this time with a family that people call a cult. But would they really welcome cameras into their home if that was the situation? How much of this is real and how much is scripted for the cameras? We may never know, but we expect this last chapter will still have people drawn to it like moths to a flame. Tuesday, Jan 7 Will Trent (ABC), 8/7c (Disney/Daniel Delgado Jr.) Will Trent is finally back, and the season premiere is filled with action-packed drama. We can’t wait to see Faith leading a case and see how the team dynamics have changed since Will left for months. What prompts his return, and how will it affect his relationships? We haven’t even scratched the surface of Gina Rodriguez’s new role as the new ADA. Times are changing. Doc (Fox) 9/8c (FOX) Doc isn’t a new idea, but it’s new to the US. This medical drama comes with a lot of welcome emotional baggage that includes a pre-fabricated love triangle and some of the messiest work relationships we’ve ever seen. But get on board with Molly Parker‘s unconventional and hard-to-take Dr. Amy Larsen as she struggles to make the two ends of her life meet after a car accident takes away the last eight years of her memories. Amy had been through significant periods in those eight years that fundamentally changed the fabric of her being. She is not the person she was, and how she reacts to how people know her eight years later is fascinating to watch. She’s also got the man she thought was the love of her life and a new man who accepted her with all of her considerable flaws in the wings, trying to figure out where they stand and where her heart lies. Standing with Parker as she brings this intriguing tale to life are Omar Metwally, Jon-Michael Ecker, and Scott Wolf making this one of the best ensembles right out of the gate. The Rookie (ABC), 10/9c (Disney/Mike Taing) FINALLY, The Rookie is back. It’s taken forever to return, and we can’t wait to dive into this action-packed premiere. Oscar and Jason coming after Nolan and Bailey is small potatoes when we have more pressing questions and concerns, like how and why they wrote out Thorsen, the latest Chenford obstacles, and the exciting new addition of two rookies changing things up! My friends, it has been far too long since we last rode along with this group, and we cannot wait to cruise along again. Wednesday, January 8 Chicago Fire (NBC), 9/8c (NBC/Peter Gordon) Chicago Fire Season 13 Episode 8 ended on a cliffhanger when Cruz discovered the troubling messages he’d received during the hour pointed to a convict wanting to take him down in an act of vengeance. Another cliffhanger of sorts came by way of Carver’s reveal that he and Tori finally broke up, just as Violet broke off a date with her new (and hot) guy to be by Lizzie’s side when needed. Hey, it’s a cliffhanger to us, you know? We also got to see the more human side of Pascal, which went a long way, making him seem like a permanent character instead of someone who hoped to bring down 51 from the inside, like so many others before him. What comes next? We don’t know, but the season so far hasn’t let us down. Chicago PD (NBC), 10/9c (Lori Allen/NBC) We’re not exactly pouring one out for Gloria, but as agitating as she was, her presence has opened up quite a can of worms for Intelligence. Is Reid a friend or foe? When he’s angling to have Voight under his thumb, it feels more like the latter, and that’s not a place Voight likes to be. Hopefully, this means the hardest-working man in the biz these days, Shawn Hatosy, will get to really dig into this role. In the upcoming premiere, we have to wonder if Intelligence faces some roadblocks during a kidnapping investigation because of this recent pickle on their end. But that’s all the more reason to get a Kiana Cook-centric episode as she turns to her family for help. This delightful new addition has us stoked, so can wait to dig into her family life! Thursday, January 9 American Primeval (Netflix) (Matt Kennedy/NETFLIX) Taylor Kitch and Betty Gilpin star in this western drama written by Mark L. Smith (The Revenant) and produced and directed by Peter Berg (Friday Night Lights). It’s a six-episode series about the American frontier and those who fight their way across it to find a better life. Hint: Not all of those on the journey are as innocuous as they may seem. Kitch and Gilpin are always worth watching and don’t disappoint here, and their travels ensure plenty of familiar and talented faces will either help or hinder them along the way. On Call (Prime Video) (Elizabeth Morris/Amazon MGM Studios) This Dick Wolf-produced drama is penned by his son, Elliot, and Tim Walsh, who has executive-produced series such as High Town, Shooter, and Chicago PD. On Call stars Troian Bellisario (Pretty Little Liars), Brandon Larracuente (The Good Doctor, Bloodline) as officers who grab calls and arrive on crime scenes while they’re still in progress or shortly thereafter. Other stars include Eriq La Salle (ER), Rich Ting (Tulsa King), Mac Brandt (SEAL Team), Lori Loughlin (When Calls the Heart), and Robert Bailey Jr. (For All Mankind, The Night Shift). This drama comes in at about 30 minutes per episode, giving it a warp-speed storytelling style that keeps you on the edge of your seat anticipating what’s next. There’s not a lot of wasted time, and it still doesn’t skimp on character development. All episodes drop today, so make yourself comfortable for the four-hour immersive experience. You won’t regret it. The Pitt (Max) (MAX/Warrick Page) As if On-Call doesn’t do enough to firmly plant us in our seats, Max responds with The Pitt, a weekly (thank God) drop starring Noah Wyle as an ER doctor, which is produced by John Wells. Does that sound a little too much like ER? Well, it’s not. At all. This isn’t a show about doctors and nurses working their shifts as much as it is about one shift and all of the pain, sorrow, and joy that comes with it. On other medical dramas, we have cursory brushes with the patient experience. Here, the patient experience is just as relevant as those working the shift. It gives you a new perspective on how agonizing it must be for these professionals to be with people during the very worst times of their lives. The staff can be saviors, but sometimes, all they can do is provide solace to people who need it the most. Although this series takes place in Pittsburgh, don’t expect any Pittsburgh accents (Not.A.Single.One) or too much airtime for the sports teams that breathe life into this town where I live, although there is one, and it is memorable. This could take place in any city. As one season equals one shift, you won’t see people out and about as they are tied to the ER and their patients for the entirety of that shift. But, damn. It’s good. Really good. The Traitors (Peacock) If other streamers are in drama mode, Peacock thumbs their nose at traditional scripts for reality stars ready for some trickery. It’s going to be a big day for TV! Friday, January 10 Goosebumps: The Vanishing (Hulu/Disney+) (Disney/Francisco Roman) We don’t know much about the second season, but like the first, it features a proven funny man at its core — David Schwimmer. Schwimmer plays a scientist and father whose brother died decades earlier. His only request to his kids with regard to their new home? Stay out of the basement. We know that means, we are soooo exploring that basement! If you’ve been a lifelong fan of the Goosebumps franchise, you might recall the 1996 series doing a two-part episode titled “Stay Out of the Basement.” While The Vanishing seems to have some of the same themes, the story seems different. Either way, we have this down as one show we don’t want to miss, and since all eight episodes drop today, we know what we’ll be doing far into Friday night. Sunday, January 12 Rogue Heroes (MGM+) (BBC/Screenshot) Rogue Heroes Season 1 was a blast. Now, it’s back. Should they make war look fun? No. But what the hell is the alternative? If you missed the first season, it’s about the beginning of the SAS and the incredibly brave and badass men who juiced it up to the success it was. In the second season, facing the threat of disbandment, SAS Rogue Heroes will see the unit trying to once again prove their significance. However, a surprise ally is found in the uptight and formal brother of David Stirling-William. Will the fiery Paddy Mayne finally conform to following rules in order to protect the future of the unit, or will his dislike for authority be too significant an obstacle? Monday, January 13 The Curious Case Of… (ID/Screenshot) Was The Curious Case of Natalia Grace lightening in a bottle, or can other curious cases be effective in a one-episode anthology format? Whether you’re ready or not, ID is prepared to drop new cases in our laps weekly, beginning with Bam Margera. His sobriety was upended in a push-me-pull-me situation between a passionate attorney and YouTuber interested in conservatorships and a tech entrepreneur using VR technology to treat Magera’s addiction. Other cases include a 13-year-old girl who vanished and returned years later, a doomsday cat cult (what?), and an identity-switching man who continually evades justice by taking on new ones. There’s even an episode dedicated to the woman whose crusade against masturbation set her on a collision course with Mormon mommy vlogger Ruby Franke. Uh, yeah. We’re definitely going to be checking this out. Thursday, January 16 Found (NBC) 10/9c (Matt Miller/NBC)) What else needs to be said? Found has become must-see TV on the very night that made the phrase famous. Found Season 2 Episode 8 set up the remainder of the season beautifully, promising an epic showdown between Gabi and Sir and plenty more emotional arcs from the team. Friday, January 17 Severance (Apple TV+) (Apple TV+) Does a show like Severance have the staying power to retain viewers three years after its last episode aired? Frankly, I’m not so sure. From strike delays to showrunner disputes, it’s been quite messy behind the scenes, and only time will tell if any of that uncertainly bleeds into the storytelling. I bet many of you are still itching to find out. Monday, January 20 9-1-1: Lone Star (FOX) 8/7c (Kevin Estrada/FOX) The end draws near. Will you be tuning in to see how it all plays out? It feels like we just got 9-1-1: Lone Star back, and now we’re gearing up to say goodbye, for good this time. And make no mistake, Lone Star is going out with a bang… or in this case, an asteroid. Everything is bigger in Texas including the final episodes of this series, and there’s still so much to wrap up before it all concludes. Tarlos adopting Jonah, for starters. Tommy’s cancer battle. And will we ever get any more information about Grace?! That’s the only way you’ll know if your heart will be breaking that its over or happy to know the characters you love found a soft place to land is if you watch it all unfold with us. Rescue HI-Surf (Fox) 9/8c (Zach Dougan/FOX) I’ve watched every available episode, but it’s still not a show that I can’t imagine life without. Whether that works against Rescue HI-Surf during the time of year that TV really takes off is hard to determine, but I think it may struggle against the swell of incoming new and returning shows. Other than the daring rescues, the only continuing plots involve Em and her future. Will she be captain? Will she really get back together with Will? Surely, there needs to be more to a show for it to stick around long-term. Tuesday, January 22 Prime Target (Apple TV+) (Courtesy of Apple TV+) The general consensus is that Apple TV+ can do no wrong (no matter how underwhelmed we were by Disclaimer)… this time, they’re delivering a conspiracy thriller about a mathematician on the verge of a significant breakthrough, but he’s up against some unknown enemy hellbent on destroying him. Nevertheless, he finds an unlikely ally in an NSA agent who joins him in unraveling something bigger and sinister involving the government. It’s Apple TV+. So, of course, there is limited promotion, not a trailer in sight, and a couple of images that tell us NOTHING. But it has Leo Woodall and Quintessa Swindell, and it sounds good. Thursday, January 23 The Night Agent (Netflix) (Courtesy of Netflix © 2024) It’s been a long wait for the sophomore season of The Night Agent, but the third is already filming, if that puts a little salve on the wound. Gabriel Basso returns as Peter Sutherland, whose cushy White House basement job answering a phone that never rings pulled him into a worldwide conspiracy. Will the series be as fun now that he knows the ropes? It might seem like handfuls of other similar shows, but he’s got a winning demeanor that keeps us rooting for him to take down the baddies. We expect it will be another success story. Sunday, January 26 Watson 10/9c CBS (Colin Bentley/CBS) Yes, it’s so damn easy to toss around comparisons to Gregory House, but this time (no, really), we may have a guy who can step into his medical problem-solving shoes. Watson isn’t Sherlock, but he’s a damn good investigator. He can piece together clues and isn’t afraid to lift the door to diagnoses and procedures others wouldn’t touch. Watson is a charming guy who wins people over to his side of things with minimal effort. While they’re protesting, he solves medical mysteries, which increases his foothold to keep pushing the envelope to save patients’ lives. We’ve seen Morris Chestnut pull that off as a surgeon on The Resident when he didn’t have good intentions. Now, we can see how much further he can go with good intentions. Monday, January 27 NCIS (CBS) (Photo: Robert Voets/CBS) Who is “babe”? That’s what we all want to know after NCIS Season 22 Episode 9. Who was Torres referring to when he said it? Yes, when a show has been on the air for 22 seasons, it’s not the procedural cases that bring us back, but the interpersonal relationships between the characters. And there is plenty to look forward to in that regard when NCIS returns! The Bachelor (ABC) 8/7c (Disney) The Bachelor is poised to drop season 29 (!) in the new year, but the buzz around the season has been tepid at best, as the promotional campaign is seemingly still getting warmed up.  Fresh off his fifth-place finish during Jenn Tran’s season, Grant Ellis is the new single man looking to find the love of his life while traveling the world and undoubtedly dealing with a lot of drama.  Grant came across as a very sincere and genuine guy, if not a bit reserved when he was a contestant, but it’s a whole different ballgame when you’re the one handing out the roses.  There’s rarely ever a “boring” season of the reality TV dating show, so we’ll certainly be seated to see the fights, tears, and what will surely be touted as the most SHOCKING finale in Bachelor Nation history.  NCIS: Origins (CBS) (Erik Voake/CBS) Despite some hemming and hawing over how the actors don’t perfectly capture the characters we followed on NCIS for decades or why some stories seem to have been slightly altered from the memories we’ve been shown before (hello, memories are just that!), NCIS: Origins hit its stride at midseason. While NCIS began as a procedural, NCIS: Origins perfectly weaves together the various elements of characters we’ve loved, the pasts we thought we knew, and the cases that impacted them. If this show ran year-round, we would never get tired of it. Tuesday, January 28 Paradise (Hulu) (Courtesy of Disney) We’re living in paradise with a long-awaited return to television, an epic reunion, and a star-studded cast. Sterling K. Brown reunites with Dan Fogelman for his first television role since This Is Us concluded, and it’s a political conspiracy thriller that promises to have us on the edge of our seats. A secret service agent is at the center of a conspiracy when he’s accused of killing the president, but nothing is as it seems. Is he the fall guy? What more is at stake? James Marsden stars as the president, and Sarah Shahi is deeply involved in the conspiracy that Julianne Nicholson investigates. We’re counting down the seconds. Thursday, January 30 Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage (CBS) 8/7c (CBS/Sonja Flemming) This relationship that should never have happened returns with more emotional storytelling we’ve already come to expect of it. Episode after episode, it delivers so much heart with its comedic and dramatic overtones that we’re ruing the day that this first of their marriages will come to an end. Matlock (CBS) 9/8c As Matty gets closer to her new coworkers, the very ones she once hoped to bury because of their culpability in her daughter’s death, the story gets stronger. Life isn’t as black and white as a mother’s pain in the wake of a child’s death, and we expect that Matty will have as hard of a time taking that in as she will be coming to terms with what her investigation means to herself and others. Friday, January 31 Fire Country (CBS) 9/8c (Eric Milner/CBS) When we reviewed Fire Country Season 3 Episode 8, we marveled at the fact we’re three seasons into a show about firefighters, and the closest we’ve come to losing anyone was to cancer. Now, with Gabriela’s already poor attitude taking a southward turn and Manny’s inability to follow orders from a former direct report makes us wonder if, by the time the third season is done, this team will be shaken to its core. What are you looking forward to this month? Can you believe it’s 2025 already?? Hit the comments and tell us what’s lighting your fire in January!",
