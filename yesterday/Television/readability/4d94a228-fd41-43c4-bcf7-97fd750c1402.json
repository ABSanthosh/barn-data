  "text": "After two-plus years as Max, Warner Bros. Discovery’s streaming service will return to its HBO Max name starting Wednesday, July 9, sources tell TVLine. The name change was first announced back in May during WBD’s Upfront presentation. “With the course we are on and strong momentum we are enjoying, we believe HBO Max far better represents our current consumer proposition,” HBO CEO Casey Bloys explained. “And it clearly states our implicit promise to deliver content that is recognized as unique and, to steal a line we always said at HBO, worth paying for.” David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said in a statement, “The powerful growth we have seen in our global streaming service is built around the quality of our programming. Today, we are bringing back HBO, the brand that represents the highest quality in media, to further accelerate that growth in the years ahead.” Streaming chief JB Perrette added that amid the rebrand, HBO Max “will continue to focus on what makes us unique — not everything for everyone in a household, but something distinct and great for adults and families.” Max plans currently start at $9.99/month, and there has been no mention on whether the change will affect prices.
