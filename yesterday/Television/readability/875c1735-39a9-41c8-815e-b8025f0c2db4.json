  "text": "Ahead of Season 7, The Rookie showrunner Alexi Hawley assured TVLine that fresh drama was headed Detective Nyla Harper’s way. Well, as you may have surmised coming out of the latest episode, which left Nyla temporarily paralyzed, “We are at that point,” cast member Mekia Cox declares. “Very much so.” And Cox was very much ready for it. Excited, even. “It’s been a little while since I’ve been” able to get in on the action, literally, the actress notes. “I was pregnant [in Season 4], and then I was recovering from pregnancy…. There wasn’t a ton I could do in terms of some of the stunts.” But in the Jan. 28 episode, in which Nyla got jumped whilst investigating a serial killer’s potential hideout, “They allowed me to do [some stunts] this time and it was fun,” Cox reports. “She gets knocked around, man. She gets tossed around.” Harper also got stuck with a paralytic, leading her to collapse to the squalid floor, while the unseen killer scurried away. She laid there helpless, until partner Detective Angela Diaz found her. Being in such a state “is new for her, she’s never had that feeling before,” Cox notes. “She hasn’t been scared like this in a while, so it provides for some good drama.” It also “pisses her off,” Cox put it more bluntly. As such, Nyla will be like a dog with a bone when it comes to doing the legwork to identify and find — or vice versa — the man who attacked her, and who is also responsible for many dead bodies found wrapped in plastic. “You know how she is — when she is determined, there is no stopping her,” Cox previews with a wink. “That’s what you guys are about to encounter.” In the next new episode, titled “Til Death” and airing this Tuesday at 10/9c, a vending machine operator named Glasser lands on Mid-Wilshire Division’s radar. And as played by Fringe alum Seth Gabel, the guy is gonna keep Nyla guessing. “Seth is a sweetheart, but apparently, he was telling me, he plays these roles a lot? These kind-of-creepy types?” shares Cox. “I really loved his approach to his character, who has a little bit of a sweet edge to him, as well. He thinks he has game, and it’s fun to get to see that, and then to get to see a switch toward the end of the episode.” The end result, to unspool over the coming weeks, is “definitely one of the darker [storylines ever] for Nyla,” Cox affirms. “There’s not a lot of levity in these next couple of episodes!” she reiterates, with a laugh. “But that’s what you come for. You come for the drama.” Want scoop on The Rookie, or for any other TV show? Shoot an email to InsideLine@tvline.com, and your question may be answered via Matt’s Inside Line!",
