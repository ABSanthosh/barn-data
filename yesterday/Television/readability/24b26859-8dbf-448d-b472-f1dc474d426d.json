While medical dramas are a dime a dozen, Brilliant Minds differed because the series focused on the characters’ quirky personality traits and how those skills helped solve unique medical cases. Brilliant Minds’ cases were based on Oliver Sacks’ actual cases, which dealt with the brain. He believed in helping his patients adapt to their situation, even if there wasn’t a cure, which is not explored in medical dramas. (Rafy/NBC) While the medical cases were massively popular, the relationships were also hugely popular. Dr. Wolf and Dr. Pierce’s long-standing friendship remained the heart of the series, especially as it included flashbacks of the early years. The relationship between Dr. Wolf and Dr. Nichols was one of the best parts of Brilliant Minds since healthy gay relationships between adult males are rarely seen on television. They began as rivals and grew to respect and care for each other despite their differences. We haven’t even started on our praise about the interns, who became a family who supported one another. Dr. Wolf also grew fond of them and changed his mindset about his team. Let’s dive into why Brilliant Minds needs a second season. (Rafy/NBC) That Cliffhanger Set Up Brilliant Minds’ Most Intriguing Medical Mystery The cliffhanger at the end of Brilliant Minds Season 1 Episode 13 demanded a second season. Casting Mandy Patinkin as Noah Wolf was brilliant, and so was bringing him back so late in the season. Naturally, Oliver was crushed to discover his entire life was a lie, but he’s a doctor first. He’ll likely be intrigued to learn why Noah needs his help, no matter how he feels about his dad. That sets up plenty of connective tissue for a potential second season. Oliver must help his father adapt to his condition, whatever it is. He’ll have to bury the hatchet with his mother so they can help Noah together. This will be a massive undertaking for Oliver and his interns, but it would be the most interesting case since it’s personal to him. (Rafy/NBC) It would provide family drama and unique perspectives, and we’re here for it. Oliver Wolf and Josh Nichols Deserve Some Happiness Oliver and Josh deserve some happiness. Oliver was finally in his first happy and healthy relationship when his father returned. Josh admitted he was falling in love with Oliver, but Oliver hesitated to return the sentiment after his life fell apart. He realized he didn’t know the truth about himself and wondered how anyone could truly love him. That hurt Josh since he longed for Oliver to confide in him more, and he had just bared his soul. (Rafy/NBC) Things worsened when Oliver stood Josh up at the gala, where he was honored to meet his long-lost father. We understood that Oliver should have answered Josh’s call. That betrayal will take some time to mend, but Brilliant Minds Executive Producer Michael Grassi promised the two would find a way to connect again in a potential second season. We’re not expecting an easy fix. Viewers would prefer to watch the men reconcile and slowly work their way back. (Rafy/ NBC’) It may even be enjoyable if Oliver consults Josh about how to help his father since they often have different ideas. Dr. Pierce’s Life Blew Up, and She Needs Closure Dr. Carol Pierce struggled with her personal life. Deciding to treat Morris’s mistress, Alison, came back and bit her in several ways. Alison had issues and wanted Carol to suffer, too, so she threw her and Morris’s relationship in her face. When that wasn’t enough, she tried to kill herself, filling Carol with more guilt. Carol finally realized that Alison got caught in the crosshairs of her and Morris’s marital issues, which was unfair to her. It seemed like the two women formed an uneasy truce, but who reported Carol to the medical board? Only Alison and Morris knew she treated his mistress. (Rafy/ NBC) Could he have sought revenge for Carol asking for a divorce and demanding her freedom? I felt for Carol. She had it rough lately and always helped Muriel, yet Muriel put Carol on leave without hearing her side. That will put even more tension between Dr. Wolf and his mother. That’s the price of working with family. All of the Interns Struggled in Season 1, and We Want to Watch Their Growth The Brilliant Minds interns became vital to the series as they accepted their conditions and each other. Each of them had issues, from Dana’s anxiety to Van’s Mirror-Touch Synesthesia. Only in later episodes did we learn that Jacob feared he may have the aftereffects of a closed-head injury or that Erica may have PTSD. (Rafy/NBC) They appeared strong and didn’t want to be seen as weak. They thrived at being there for their friends but struggled at getting assistance. These would be exciting arcs to address in a potential second season, especially since Ericka stole some of Dana’s anxiety medication. Viewers want to see how Ericka continues to cope and how this will affect her friendship with Dana. So many choices these interns make affect the entire group. We haven’t even addressed the love triangle because while it’s essential, the interns’ more important bond is as a “found family”. How Brilliant Minds Differs From Other Shows Brilliant Minds is based on the larger-than-life neurologist Oliver Sacks, who believed in getting to the level of his patients and helping them adapt to their conditions. (Rafy/NBC) NBC found the perfect counterpart in Oliver Wolf (Zachary Quinto) as they taught both doctors and patients the necessity of adaptation. Not many shows cover neurodivergence as a strength, but Brilliant Minds often used Dr. Wolf’s color blindness and Van’s Mirror-Touch Synesthesia to reach and help patients. It’s their superpower. Dana’s anxiety often helped her relate to patients and put them at ease. Making the doctors appear more “human” than know-it-all worked for the series and set them apart. (Rafy/NBC) While the series initially averaged around 3 million viewers per episode, it improved to just under 5 million with live +7 delayed viewing. Hopefully, that boost will help with its renewal chances. Check out how the rest of NBC’s shows stack up for renewal. Over to you, Brilliant Minds Fanatics.
