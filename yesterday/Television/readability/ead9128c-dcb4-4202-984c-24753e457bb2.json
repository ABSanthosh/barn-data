  "text": "It was a comedy series all along. Disney+’s latest live-action Marvel series, Agatha All Along, plans to compete as a comedy series — and not a limited series — at the Golden Globes and other upcoming awards shows, our sister site Variety reports. Given that FX’s Shōgun had to indicate that it had more seasons planned in order to switch from the 2024 Emmys’ limited series race to drama (where it wound up dominating), Agatha‘s choice to compete as a comedy series would seem to point to a similar, renewal-type announcement in the weeks ahead. Submissions for the awards season’s leadoff hitter, the Golden Globes (to be held Jan. 5, 2025), are due today. Agatha would not be Disney+’s first Marvel series to “pick a side” when competing for kudos. The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, for example, competed as a drama series, while Hawkeye vied as a comedy. Many others, though, including Agatha‘s sire, WandaVision, plus Moon Knight and Ms. Marvel, entered the limited series race. The Emmys define a limited series as a program “that tells a complete, non-recurring story. The story arc must be completely resolved within its season, with no on-going storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons.” The Globes and SAG Awards similarly dictate that a limited series “must tell a complete, non-recurring story” and “not have a continuing storyline and/or main characters in subsequent seasons,” while, of note, SAG says a comedy series “must be primarily comedic and marketed/ advertised as such.” Who from Agatha All Along would you like to see conjure some nominations at the Globes et al?",
