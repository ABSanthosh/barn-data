  "text": "The popular fantasy romance book series From Blood and Ash is getting the small-screen treatment. Sony Pictures Television is developing author Jennifer L. Armentrout’s novels into a TV series, our sister site Deadline reports. No writer or network is attached yet. The books follow Poppy, who was “chosen from birth to usher in a new era” and whose “life has never been her own,” reads the official synopsis. “The life of the Maiden is solitary. Never to be touched. Never to be looked upon. Never to be spoken to. Never to experience pleasure. Waiting for the day of her Ascension, she would rather be with the guards, fighting back the evil that took her family, than preparing to be found worthy by the gods. But the choice has never been hers.” “When Hawke, a golden-eyed guard honor bound to ensure her Ascension, enters her life, destiny and duty become tangled with desire and need. He incites her anger, makes her question everything she believes in, and tempts her with the forbidden,” the description continues. “As the shadow of those cursed draws closer, the line between what is forbidden and what is right becomes blurred. Poppy is not only on the verge of losing her heart and being found unworthy by the gods, but also her life when every blood-soaked thread that holds her world together begins to unravel.” Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * The Kelly Clarkson Show has been renewed for Season 7 by NBC Owned Television Stations group, taking the daytime talker through the 2025-2026 season. * Kristen Bell will return to host the 31st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards, streaming live on Netflix on Sunday, Feb. 23, 2025 at 8 pm ET/5 pm PT. * Deal or No Deal Island After Show With Boston Rob, hosted by Season 1 islander “Boston” Rob Mariano, will debut Wednesday, Jan. 8. on Peacock, NBC’s YouTube channel and NBC.com.
