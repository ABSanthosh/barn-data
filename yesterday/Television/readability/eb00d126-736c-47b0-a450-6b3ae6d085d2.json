The premium cabler celebrated the upcoming premiere on Monday with our most extensive look at The White Lotus Season 3.  (HBO/Screenshot) The official trailer picks up with countless new faces touching down in Thailand and settling into the lucrative White Lotus resort for what they think will give some time for reflection and relaxation.  If the first two seasons of The White Lotus are any indication, things will take a hard left turn. (HBO/Screenshot) Every character will be scrutinized as they come to terms with what’s holding them back in life.  Off the bat, Jason Isaacs is poised to have the most interesting storyline. His character arrives at the resort with a lot of baggage and a wife played by the incomparable Parker Posey.  HBO is staying mum on many details about the characters, including their names. We’re surprised the official trailer provided so much insight into what’s to come when the eight-episode season airs next month.  Jason Isaacs Excels With Complicated Characters We see Jason’s character learn that his life as he knows it is over, and he questions whether his decisions thus far have left him in a predicament that he can’t break free from.  Financial issues are rough, but it must be difficult for him to be at this exclusive resort with such a big secret. Given the few glimpses we see of Parker Posey’s character, she doesn’t sound interested in downsizing her life in any way, shape, or form.  What sticks with me about this family is that they all look so miserable. (HBO/Screenshot) A vacation of this caliber should lead to happy moments. Still, I quickly got the impression that Jason’s character would take extreme measures to leave Thailand in a better financial position.  Could he be a part of why the hotel’s crime rate is spiraling out of control?  With another murder on the horizon, there’s every reason to believe that the White Lotus, in general, will be going through a bit of a PR crisis, given that it will be the third resort plagued by deaths under mysterious circumstances in so many years.  Staff members declare that everything they do must protect The White Lotus, which suggests that things look bad for the luxury vacation company.  The beauty of the sprawling trailer is that it throws enough at the audience to keep them questioning where things are going. (HBO/Screenshot) It’s hard to get a read on who could be ripe for the picking when the Grim Reaper comes knocking.  The biggest issue from the trailer is that there are so many characters, which could indicate we won’t be delving into everyone as much as we did in the first two seasons.  The White Lotus excels as a character study about who these people are and how they can change when their vacation ends, but we hope this doesn’t turn into a case of too many cooks in the kitchen.  Walton Goggins Has A Compelling Role in The White Lotus Season 3 Walton Goggins is coming off a critically acclaimed run on Prime Video’s Fallout adaptation, and his character has much explaining to do after the official trailer.  The good news is that we know he’s only in Thailand to track down someone with a link to his past. The person he’s tracking is seemingly a guest at the hotel, which makes his mission all the more easy.  (HBO/Screenshot) But his relationship with a much younger woman, played by Aimee Lou Wood, promises to ruffle many feathers. Something tells me their bond will implode when she learns the truth about the trip.  This brings us to the loveable Belinda. Yes, Natasha Rothwell is back as a series regular and a guest in the hotel this season, which we’re sure will change things.  She was underutilized in the first season and didn’t get the best ending, so hopefully, the significant number of characters won’t leave her out in the cold again.  There’s no telling where in the timeline The White Lotus Season 3 is set. The hope is that we learn more about Tanya’s death after The White Lotus Season 2 and that Belinda could somehow be a part of the reason for Greg’s downfall.  (HBO/Screenshot) We need a little payoff because he should not get away with what he did to Tanya.  What are your thoughts on the first look at The White Lotus Season 3? Is the cast too big for an eight-episode mystery? Pull up a sun lounger, and let me know what you think in the comments section.  Watch The White Lotus Online",
