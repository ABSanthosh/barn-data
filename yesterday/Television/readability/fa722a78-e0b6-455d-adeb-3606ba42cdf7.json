  "text": "When Calls the Heart has taken notes and continues incorporating character-rich stories, romance, and modern mysteries into this season. The spoilers for When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 3 tease a mystery surrounding an old coin, and Rosemary and Elizabeth snoop to discover what Lee has been hiding. This one will be a treat for Rosemary fans. Elsewhere, Earl Wyatt returns to town, intriguing Allie, who soon finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Jeff Weddell) Besides that, Lucas meets with Edie Martell again, so there’s hope for the National Park and his love life. Overall, this looks like another promising episode. Rosemary and Bill Team Up Again to Solve the Coin Mystery in Hope Valley (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Ricardo Hubbs) There’s an air of mystery in Hope Valley. The series includes recurring characters like Ned finding a double-headed eagle coin. This coin fascinates everyone, so much so that Bill learns it was part of an unsolved train robbery. The coin is gorgeous and possibly worth a lot, so Bill wants Rosemary’s help solving another case. This one could get messy. Bill and Rosemary have such a fun, natural connection since they share investigative instincts, and nothing stops Rosemary from gathering the truth. Where did the coin appear from, since Ned wouldn’t steal it naturally? However, he’s excited about it, so they should begin by interviewing him about what he knows about the coin. We love seeing Ned and Florence utilized more. Rosemary Suspects Lee Has a Secret (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Ricardo Hubbs) Since Lee returned, he’s been acting odd and secretive, and Rosemary hates secrets being kept from her. He’s meeting Mike secretly, and the men seem to be up to something. Are they also attempting to solve the coin mystery, or is Lee planning something special for Rosemary? It’s possible he planned something to commemorate his homecoming. However, Lee is the mayor, so if there were a robbery, he’d also want to stop it. It would be amusing if he and Mike tried to stop it while Rosemary and Bill were, too. (@2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Ricardo Hubbs) Lee must work extra hard to keep it a surprise since Rosemary and Elizabeth have started following him around and snooping. From the weekly promo, it almost sounds like Nathan is involved, too, from the note he gives Elizabeth. Rosemary sounds like she’s following mystery clues to an old-fashioned scavenger hunt. Will this be a game, or does Lee have a secret? Even though Rosemary is an investigative reporter, she does not blend into the scenery well. She’s hilarious and relentless when she wants answers.  Lucas and Edie Martell Meet Again and Hopefully Come to Terms (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Jeff Weddell) The new spoiler photos hint that Edie Martell (Miranda MacDougall) and Lucas (Chris McNally) meet again. They should negotiate a fair share of land so that Lucas can create his National Park and the ranchers have plenty of pasture. I prefer Edwin not to attend this meeting since I think they’ll negotiate better terms without him, as I suspect both Edie and Lucas are passionate about helping others. We don’t know much, but past press has hinted that Edie and Lucas may become unlikely friends and later love interests. At least, she seems intelligent and on his wavelength. Earl Wyatt Returns and Intrigues Allie (@2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Ricardo Hubbs) When Calls the Heart enjoys bringing back old characters, and this time, Earl Wyatt returns. He hasn’t been on-screen since When Calls the Heart Season 4, and as the sneak peek suggests, he used to tease Opal when they were younger. He tries to apologize and swear that he’s changed. It’s difficult to tell in that small scene, but Allie seemed smitten and anxious for her friend to introduce the two of them. It’s amusing that as soon as Allie has grown up, she finds herself in the middle of a love triangle since her dad was only recently in one. Oliver seems to like her. He’s a bit shy but has sent some smoldering looks her way. We still don’t know Oliver’s story, so he may have a secret that could change things. They seem carefree and sweet, though, and we don’t know enough about an older Earl Wyatt yet. But Allie looked interested. Henry’s New Business Showcases His Evolution We’ve discussed how much Henry Gowen has evolved over the series. Many factors contributed to that, none more so than his remorse over the mines. He wanted to prove that he’s changed, and that’s been most apparent when he interacts with the community, especially the children. He has so much wisdom to share with others, and the series does a fantastic job of highlighting what can be learned outside the classroom. (©2024 Hallmark Media/Photographer: Ricardo Hubbs) Henry has grown so proud of some of the children, and we’re excited to see him and Joseph work together and instill values and business skills in the younger generation. It’s an excellent way for multi-generations to interact. Over to you, Hearties. What do you hope happens in “All That Glitters?” Are you excited about another mystery? Are you looking forward to seeing Earl Wyatt again? Let us know in the comments below. When Calls the Heart airs on The Hallmark Channel on Sundays at 9/8c and on Hallmark + the following day.
