  "text": "Two unwanted Salem pregnancies mean a lot of drama. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-10-25 promise to spend lots of time on these accidental babies-to-be (doesn’t anyone ever have a planned pregnancy on this show?) If that sounds uninteresting, don’t panic. The Johnny Dimera spoiler many of us have been waiting for is also finally here! (Screenshot/Peacock) Theresa’s Surprise Entry Means There Are Way Too Many Controlling Women Involved In Tate’s Baby Drama Move over, Amy Choi — Theresa is back in town. She is supposed to be in jail for forging that letter that made it appear that Alex was the Kiriakis heir, but jail sentences are notoriously short in Salem. Either she got out early, or her backstory will be retconned to say she just moved back to California rather than going to jail. And yes, she’s played by Emily O’Brien again, so if you don’t like O’Brien’s version of Theresa, you won’t be happy with this development. I don’t care about the casting choice as much as I do that this story is probably going to be annoying as hell. We already have Amy Choi trying to impose her impossibly high standards on potential adoptive parents. Paulina witnessed that, so she’ll be going into Mama Bear mode any minute now. We really don’t need Theresa in the mix here! (Screenshot/Peacock) Theresa is Tate’s mother, so she deserves to be in this story. Still, her presence means there are three women battling it out over what Sophia and Tate should do with their baby. That’s a little much. This story is already annoying. Amy Choi should not be trying to force her daughter to give up the idea of college or any type of future besides motherhood, especially since Sophia will be 18 before the baby is born. (Peacock/Screenshot) I’d rather a story about Sophia suing for emancipation so she can make her own decisions, but we’re clearly not getting that. Instead, we’re getting the adults battling over a decision that should be Sophia and Tate’s, and if that isn’t bad enough, Tate and Holly keep fighting because every failed adoption attempt means Holly can’t forget that her boyfriend is having a baby with her ex-BFF. I know, I know. This is the type of drama soaps are known for. But Holly sounds so selfish when she whines that Chanel and Johnny’s inability to adopt the baby means that she and Tate aren’t free of it. These two are headed for a split for the sake of drama, and it can’t come soon enough. (Screenshot/Peacock) Holly and Doug Face A New Obstacle — Trask Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-10-25 suggest that Holly will have her hands full with a different problem: Doug’s inability to reclaim the necklace he stole. The other half of Holly and Tate’s fight this past week was over Holly’s defense of Doug. She thinks he is a decent guy who made a mistake because he was in a bad spot, while Tate thinks he’s a thief and can’t stop himself from making obnoxious comments about it. SInce Tate insisted Holly tell him the whole truth and now knows that the necklace Doug stole was Julie’s, Holly and Doug have to race against time to get the jewelry back and return it to Julie before Tate tells her who took it. (Peacock/Screenshot) Of course, Tate is temporarily sidelined by Theresa’s inserting herself into the baby situation — and into the search for John — but that won’t last forever. The first rule of soaps is that you can’t stop a secret from coming out in the most devastating way possible, so there is no way Holly and Doug win this one. That said, couldn’t the writers come up with a less ridiculous obstacle than Melinda Trask? Trask used to be a highly moral, if obnoxious, district attorney, but her ethical code went out the window when the writers had her help kidnap Nicole’s baby to give to her friend Sloan Buying a stolen necklace and refusing to return it would be out of character for the original Trask, but this babynapper is capable of anything. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 3-10-25 don’t say exactly what’ll happen at her meeting with Doug and Holly, but the two are supposed to try to figure out later how to get the necklace back, so obviously she isn’t cooperative. (Screenshot/Peacock) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 3-10-25 Promise More Drama In The Other Accidental Pregnancy Story Joy will get her pregnancy test results, and they’re most likely positive. There’d be little point to this story if she wasn’t. So far, the story has centered around Stephanie overhearing that Joy might be pregnant. This “dilemma” she’s facing about whether or not to tell Alex is annoying. Kayla was 100% right when she told Stephanie that doing so would be a HIPAA violation that could cause the hospital to be sued when it’s already facing bankruptcy. (Screenshot/Peacock) Of course, Sarah shouldn’t have been calling about test results in an area open to the public, so she’s partially to blame. Still, it is absolutely not Stephanie’s place to say anything. It’s up to Joy what to say about her pregnancy. She hasn’t even decided if she wants to carry to term yet. Joy could decide to quietly terminate the pregnancy so that Alex doesn’t ever have to know they made a baby together. We can debate all day whether that would be right, but regardless of whether anyone agrees with it, it’s still her choice — and none of Stephanie’s business. Stephanie is equating the decision to tell or not to Alex not telling her that Chad called when Kayla was supposedly dying. That was a completely different situation. This one is analogous to if Justin or Maggie were ill and Alex didn’t tell Stephanie that. (Screenshot/Peacock) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 3-10-25 Promise Johnny Will Learn An Explosive Truth About The Past! I’ve been waiting for this since the 60th anniversary preview video dropped in November. Johnny will learn that he is the product of rape. It’s well past time for Days of Our Lives to acknowledge that Sami and EJ’s “reconciliation” was a criminal act against Sami. She was with Lucas and EJ refused to save Lucas’ life unless Sami slept with him. That’s not the basis for “true love,” no matter how much Days of Our Lives has tried to sell it that way over the years. It’s the basis for a Law \u0026 Order: SVU story. (Screenshot/Peacock) It’ll be hard for me to resist comparing this story to when JJ learned that Jack had raped Kayla. I always thought Casey Moss should have been nominated for an Emmy that year after the way he depicted JJ’s pain turning to out-of-control rage at learning the father he idolized was a rapist. Johnny really should talk to JJ at some point since the two men have similar personalities as well as both having this shocking experience of learning their beloved father once raped someone they love. Maybe that will happen in the future, though I doubt it. JJ always seems to be on the edge of things, like the writers forgot he comes from one of Salem’s core families. That being said, this story is Johnny’s, regardless of how similar it is to JJ’s, and I have no doubt Carson Boatman will rock these emotional scenes. Bring them on! (Screenshot/Peacock) Shawn is going to tell JJ that he slept with Jada while Arnold was taking over Rafe’s life. Um, okay. I’m always glad for JJ to get screentime, but why does he need this information? The Woman In White will again attack Ava while Kristen worries about where she has disappeared to. Later, Ava and Brady argue. This story is going in circles. Let’s get on with it. Ugh, Belle. She’s going to sleep with EJ again after confronting him about his bad behavior. This story needs to end ASAP! Not much movement in Marlena’s search for John yet. The only spoiler about it says that she will tell Belle her plans (hopefully without walking in on Belle and EJ again.)
