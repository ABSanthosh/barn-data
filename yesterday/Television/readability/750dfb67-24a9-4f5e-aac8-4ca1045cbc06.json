  "text": "Eight months after longtime Days of Our Lives star Drake Hogestyn died following a battle with pancreatic cancer, the Peacock soap has revealed the fate of his beloved character John Black, a role he played regularly since 1986. In the loving arms of his wife, Dr. Marlena Evans, John took his last breath at the end of the June 2 episode, after suffering devastating internal injuries during a lab explosion. The iconic character went out as he lived — a hero. Sensing the fans’ devastation on Monday, Marlena’s portrayer Deidre Hall posted this simple-but-powerful message to fans on Instagram: “I know. I know. Hardest day ever.” Marlena Evans says goodbye to husband John Black on Days of Our Lives’ June 2 episode Hogestyn, who died on Sept. 28, 2024, made his final on-screen appearance during Days‘ Sept. 9, 2024 episode, allowing John one last chance to bestow some wisdom upon grandson Tate. That episode was reportedly filmed on Feb. 16, 2024. John left Salem shortly thereafter as part of a top-secret ISA mission to Estonia, never to be heard from again. Steve and Marlena investigated his mysterious disappearance, leading to another near-fatal reunion with criminal mastermind Orpheus, but their search was ultimately unsuccessful. While Steve shifted his attention towards helping Bo with another life-threatening matter, the ISA tracked down John with the intention of bringing him back to Salem. Shown only from behind, John eventually “returned” to town in May, helping Steve steal an experimental drug that could potentially cure Bo, who was dying of sepsis. But an explosion at the lab put John in the hospital, where his family gathered to say goodbye. The tragic gathering welcomed back several familiar faces, including grandson Will, daughter Carrie and son Paul. Days executive producer Ken Corday previously explained to Soap Opera Digest that John’s demise was actually discussed with Hogestyn prior to his real-life death. Corday said he “wanted to make sure Drake signed off” on his character’s final storyline, “and he was totally in favor of it.” “We were rolling the dice, because it’s difficult to tell a story of someone’s death or a character’s death while the actor is still alive,” Corday continued. “I made the choice to [say], ‘OK, let’s tell the story.’ He hadn’t been on [the show] in nine months. We needed a reason [for John’s absence].” “For nearly four decades, Marlena Evans and I have loved the same man,” Hall said in a statement following his passing. “Marlena’s John is an iconic hero, unfailingly rescuing her from all matter of villains. My acting partner was incredibly professional from the moment he entered the studio; flawless in his preparation and ready for any eventuality in any scene. … Drake is dearly loved by everyone who ever knew him and he will be missed beyond measure. We will continue, as he always encouraged us, to swing for the fences.” New episodes of Days of Our Lives stream weekdays on Peacock.
