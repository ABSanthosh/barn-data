What Is The Wild Robot About? Based on Peter Brown’s 2016 bestseller, the DreamWorks film follows a robot named Roz (voiced by The Black Panther’s Lupita Nyong’o) who is “shipwrecked on an uninhabited island and must adapt to the harsh surroundings,” according to the official synopsis. “Gradually, Roz starts building relationships with the animals on the island, including a clever fox (The Last of Us’ Pedro Pascal), and becomes the adoptive parent of an orphaned gosling named Brightbill (Heartstopper’s Kit Connor).” The voice cast also includes Bill Nighy (Love Actually), Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once), Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows), Ving Rhames (Pulp Fiction), Mark Hamill (Star Wars) and Catherine O’Hara (Schitt’s Creek). Plus, the film features two original songs from country music singer Maren Morris.
