Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage just scored a full-season order from CBS, which means that the latest spinoff will be on our screens all the way through May. CBS hasn’t told us yet exactly how many episodes they’ve green-lit, but their enthusiasm for the show is great news. (Warner Brothers Entertainment/Troy Harvey) Georgie And Mandy’s Success Wasn’t Guaranteed, But It’s a Huge Hit CBS took a risk with Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage that I wasn’t sure would pay off. Although both The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon were smash hits for the network, it wasn’t clear how much Sheldon Cooper had to do with that. Young Sheldon was developed as a prequel about the socially awkward genius. It detailed his childhood in Texas, and his interactions with the family that loved him but didn’t understand him were a huge part of why that show worked so well. Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage, however, was the first show in the franchise to not feature Sheldon at all, as Sheldon had gone off to CalTech in the Young Sheldon finale. I loved Sheldon, so I wasn’t sure how interesting a show that didn’t feature him would be. And if everyone else felt the way I did, Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage would be the first Big Bang Theory spinoff to flop, as people would turn it off quickly. But I was wrong, and despite a rough start to the premiere, the show is funny, heartfelt, and well worth watching. It’s also been a phenomenal success, with 10.6 million viewers watching the premiere across platforms and the series’ ratings for online views being up 72% from Young Sheldon’s final season premiere. (Warner Brothers Entertainment/Troy Harvey) CBS’ Enthusiastic Response Is Good News For The Future of Georgie And Mandy’s First Marriage Most of Young Sheldon Season 7 was a backdoor pilot to Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage. That was annoying, but it paid off because it got everyone super excited about the spinoff. The only thing missing so far is some news about what happened to Meemaw’s boyfriend, Dale, but now that we have a full-season order, I’m hopeful they’ll address that. Still, ratings success isn’t always a guarantee that networks will keep shows on the air. CBS canceled several of its most popular shows in 2024, breaking a lot of people’s hearts by canceling Blue Bloods. (CBS/Robert Voets) However, Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage got an enthusiastic response from CBS that makes me feel it’s safe for a long time to come: With the resounding success of The Big Bang Theory and Young Sheldon, we were instantly on board when Chuck, Steven and Steve brought us the idea to further explore this world through Georgie and Mandy’s First Marriage. The enthusiastic audience reception has demonstrated the enormous appeal of these characters and we can’t wait to see all of the hilarious fun this season will undoubtedly deliver. – Amy Reisenbach, CBS President .This type of enthusiasm from CBS could mean it gets an early renewal like Matlock did, now that it’s gotten over the first hurdle and received a full-season order. The full season order also means that the series will have plenty of time to establish and explore the family dynamics on Georgie and Mandy’s First Marriage. We know that the couple will ultimately divorce, but with a full season — and hopefully many more — the writers won’t have to rush through the story of how their marriage implodes and can continue planting seeds for Georgie and Mandy’s ultimate breakup while delivering heartfelt, stellar comedy. (Warner Brothers Entertainment/Troy Harvey) How do you feel about the full-season renewal for Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage? Are you one of the 10 million people who watched the premiere? Do you think this show has what it takes to last for a long time? Hit the comments and let us know your thoughts! Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage airs on CBS on Thursdays at 8/7c.
