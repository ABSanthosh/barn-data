  "text": "Some of TV’s most unforgettable characters are the ones who know how to manipulate those around them. Whether through charm, deception, or psychological games, they pull the strings and stay a step ahead, making everyone else dance to their tune. These characters blur the line between hero and villain, creating their own reality and bending others to their will. (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Manipulation isn’t just a tactic; it’s their weapon and what makes them so compelling. Their ability to deceive, control, and outwit keeps us hooked — no matter how twisted their methods may be. Here are 19 TV characters we think are true masters of manipulation. Logan Roy — Succession (Macall Polay/HBO) Logan Roy from Succession is the epitome of corporate manipulation. He uses his ruthless tactics to control his family and media empire. Every conversation and every decision is a calculated move to maintain his power, even if it means playing his children against each other. Logan’s ability to manipulate allies and enemies with a combination of fear, charm, and sheer force of will makes him a formidable player in business and family drama. His cold, calculating nature leaves everyone around him questioning their own loyalties — especially when survival is at stake. Watch Succession Online Livia Soprano — The Sopranos (HBO/Screenshot) Livia Soprano from The Sopranos is a master of emotional manipulation, using guilt, passive-aggressive behavior, and cunning to control those around her. As the matriarch of the Soprano family, she manipulates her son, Tony, and the rest of her family with ease, often sowing chaos to maintain power. Livia’s ability to twist situations and play on others’ weaknesses makes her a formidable force in a world of crime and family drama. Her manipulations are subtle but run deep, leaving a lasting impact on everyone she encounters. Watch The Sopranos Online Nandor — What We Do in the Shadows (Russ Martin/FX) Nandor the Relentless from What We Do in the Shadows may not be the sharpest manipulator, but his ancient vampire charm and outdated sense of authority make him a surprisingly effective schemer. As the leader of his vampire household, Nandor attempts to command respect, though his manipulations often fall short due to his cluelessness and ego. Despite his incompetence, Nandor’s overconfidence and attempts to control those around him — especially his fellow vampires — show that he can still be a master manipulator in his own delightfully awkward way. His mishandling of power often leads to hilarious consequences, but it’s always rooted in his need for control. Watch What We Do in the Shadows Online Wendy Byrde — Ozark (Netflix/Screenshot) Wendy Byrde is the queen of manipulation. She takes a calm, calculated approach to navigating the criminal world and family dynamics. From managing the cartel’s operations to controlling her family’s future, Wendy expertly pulls the strings to get what she wants — often at any cost. While her husband, Marty, focuses on numbers, Wendy uses her sharp mind and persuasive skills to manipulate everyone from ruthless criminals to local politicians. Her ability to remain composed in high-pressure situations and make ruthless decisions makes her one of the most powerful characters in Ozark. Watch Ozark Online Oswald Cobb — The Penguin   (Photograph by Macall Polay/HBO) Oswald Cobb, a.k.a. The Penguin, is a master of manipulation in the criminal underworld of Gotham.

Every move he makes is calculated to ensure his rise, proving that manipulation is the key to survival and success in Gotham’s underworld. Watch The Penguin Online Garak — Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (Paramount Television/Screenshot) Garak is a master of manipulation, blending charm, mystery, and political intrigue in his pursuit of power. As a former Cardassian operative turned shopkeeper, he’s an expert at playing both sides, using his wit and persuasive skills to manipulate those around him.

His manipulative abilities are often shrouded in ambiguity, making him one of Deep Space Nine’s most fascinating and unpredictable characters. Watch Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Online Vic Mackey — The Shield (FX/Screenshot) Vic Mackey from The Shield is the epitome of a morally complex manipulator. As the leader of the Strike Team, he uses his power and influence to navigate the fine line between law enforcement and criminality. Vic is a master of manipulation. He often uses his position to exploit the system for his own gain while keeping his team under his control. He’s skilled at bending the truth, making deals, and pulling strings behind the scenes while maintaining his image as a hero. His manipulative nature isn’t just about survival — it’s about ensuring his dominance, no matter the cost. Watch The Shield Online Cersei Lannister — Game of Thrones (Helen Sloan/HBO) Cersei Lannister’s manipulation is as deadly as the poison she’s willing to use to secure her family’s power.

A true master of bending others to his will, he’ll stop at nothing to maintain control — even if it means manipulating his own family and former colleagues. With chilling calmness, Harkness keeps his true intentions hidden, always staying one step ahead in the dangerous game he’s playing. Watch Slow Horses Online Monroe Fuches — Barry (Courtesy of HBO) Monroe Fuches is the ultimate manipulator, playing both mentor and villain in Barry. As the man who pulled Barry into the world of crime, Fuches constantly manipulates the hitman-turned-actor, using guilt, threats, and subtle persuasion to control him. Though he claims to care about Barry, Fuches’s true motivations are driven by his own self-interest, making him one of the show’s most complex manipulators. His ability to weave webs of deceit and guilt keeps Barry tethered to his past, making Fuches a constant force in his life — whether Barry likes it or not. Watch Barry Online Serena Joy — The Handmaid’s Tale (Courtesy of Hulu) Serena Joy’s manipulation is a quiet but powerful force in the dystopian world of Gilead on The Handmaid’s Tale.

Frank’s ability to manipulate both allies and enemies- often with devastating results- makes him one of the most compelling and terrifying characters ever to grace the screen. Watch House of Cards Online Don Draper — Mad Men (Tina Rowden/AMC) Don Draper from Mad Men is a master of manipulation, using charm and calculated deception to shape not only advertising campaigns but the lives of those around him.

Whether she’s charming Charles, plotting Tim’s murder out of petty jealousy, or hiding behind the facade of innocence, Jan’s psychological games keep everyone guessing. Beneath her calm exterior lies a woman willing to go to any length — no matter how extreme — to maintain control over those around her. Watch Only Murders in the Building Online Chuck Bass — Gossip Girl (THE CW/Giovanni Rufino) Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl is the ultimate schemer, using wealth, charm, and sharp wit to manipulate everyone in his orbit. Chuck uses his power and status to control the people around him, especially regarding love and family, whether in the business world or his tangled relationships. He knows exactly how to play the game, twisting situations to his advantage and keeping his true feelings hidden behind layers of arrogance and bravado. With Chuck, manipulation isn’t just about getting what he wants — it’s about ensuring he always stays one step ahead. Watch Gossip Girl Online Kevin “Kilgrave” Thompson — Jessica Jones (Netflix/Screenshot) Kevin “Kilgrave” Thompson is the embodiment of terrifying manipulation, with the ability to control anyone with a single command. His power to bend people to his will makes him one of the most dangerous characters in the Jessica Jones universe. Kilgrave’s charm is just as deadly as his powers — he uses his manipulative abilities to manipulate and torture his victims, always finding new ways to torment Jessica and those around her. His lack of empathy and total disregard for others only enhance his ability to manipulate, making him a true master of psychological control. Watch Jessica Jones Online Wednesday Addams — Wednesday This is a still of Jenna Ortega as Wednesday for Netflix. (MATTHIAS CLAMER/NETFLIX) Wednesday Addams from Wednesday is the queen of quiet manipulation.

Whether she’s navigating the world of Nevermore Academy or solving dark mysteries, Wednesday bends people to her will with calculated moves and a complete lack of fear. Her manipulations are more intellectual than emotional, using wit and observation to stay two steps ahead of her rivals — and it’s always done with that signature deadpan expression.
