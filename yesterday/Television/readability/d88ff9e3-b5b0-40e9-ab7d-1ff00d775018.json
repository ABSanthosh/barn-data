  "text": "Since joining The Real Housewives of Orange County in 2007, Tamra Judge has been one of Bravo’s most polarizing faces. She’s brought so much to the show, but people seem to think she’s the most toxic reality TV star. Sure, Tamra has brought a lot of off-screen drama to help the show maintain its status as one of the most popular entries in the venerable Real Housewives franchise. (Bravo/Screenshot) In the past, Tamra hasn’t cared about being dragged over the coals because if it makes for good TV, she’s on board. Tamra had a rough go of it during The Real Housewives of Orange County Season 18 as she kicked off the season by teaming up with Alexis Bellino to take down Shannon Beador. (Sami Drasin/Bravo) These shows swing in roundabouts, and it’s Tamra’s turn for the hot seat when Season 19 debuts because Alexis will be a distant memory and Gretchen Rossi will be back to take Tamra to task for her actions. With filming in its infancy, Tamra has taken to social media to announce that she’s had a great run on the show, but she’s peacing out. Details about what went down are under wraps, but it’s evident that she’s being called out for her heinous actions, of which there are many. Tamra Judge’s Exit From The Real Houswives of Orange County Could Ruin the Show The 57-year-old has mastered the art of using her co-stars’ personal lives to craft compelling storylines for the show. (Bravo/Screenshot) She may be a Real Housewives veteran, but she’d be a great producer because she knows how to maintain a good storyline and keep the drama flowing. But the sad part of all this drama is that Tamra isn’t having a great year. There are continued rumors that her marriage to her husband, Eddie Judge, is on the rocks. Plus, her good friend, Teddi Mellencamp, is going through a horrible time. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum has kept fans up to speed with her progress after surgery to remove multiple brain tumors. (Bravo/Screenshot) Understandably, it’s not a good time for Tamra to be filming The Real Housewives of Orange County. If anything, it would be nice if the rest of her RHOC co-stars showed Tamra the grace she never showed them, to reiterate that even in these trying times, the people you think are against you are with you. There’s no denying that Tamra has been horrid to her co-stars throughout the years, but would the series still be on the air without her? Tamra May As Well Be a Producer Those types of shows thrive on cast dynamics being blown to smithereens by rumors and everything in between, and I don’t think the rest of the cast has clocked in with their recent storylines. (Bravo/Screenshot) Many of them have been driven by Tamra’s pot-stirring, so if she really has walked away from the show, will it be able to pick up the pieces in the aftermath? While Andy Cohen hasn’t confirmed the news, he’s at least addressed it, meaning there’s likely a conversation about her future with the series. I don’t particularly like Tamra, but I fully recognize that the show needs someone like her to keep the drama flowing. Admittedly, I love reality TV drama, so maybe I’m not the best character judge, but I know what to expect with a Real Housewives entry. (Bravo/Screenshot) Over to you, TV Fanatics! What’s your take on Tamra seemingly walking away from those Bravo paychecks? Do you think the show needs someone like her to keep it fresh and exciting? Hit the comments below.
