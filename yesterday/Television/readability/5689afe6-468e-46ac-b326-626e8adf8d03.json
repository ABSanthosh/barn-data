  "text": "God of War has a new boss: Ronald D. Moore (Outlander, Battlestar Galactica) will take over as showrunner for Prime Video’s series adaptation of the popular video game, our sister site Variety reports. Moore replaces Rafe Judkins, who departed the project last week as showrunner, along with executive producers Hawk Ostby and Mark Fergus. Per Variety, Amazon and co-producer Sony Pictures Television opted to go in a different creative direction. God of War was first ordered to series in December 2022. Per its official description, the drama “follows Kratos, the God of War, who, after exiling himself from his blood-soaked past in ancient Greece, hangs up his weapons forever in the Norse realm of Midgard. When his beloved wife dies, Kratos sets off on a dangerous journey with his estranged son to spread her ashes from the highest peak — his wife’s final wish. Kratos soon realizes the journey is an epic quest in disguise, one which will test the bonds between father and son, and force Kratos to battle new Gods and monsters for the fate of the world.” Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * John-Paul Lavoisier will return to Days of Our Lives as Philip Kiriakis beginning with the Oct. 25 episode, Soaps.com reports. The actor has appeared in 80 episodes between 2015-2023. * Stephen Amell (Arrow), Minnie Driver (The Serpent Queen) and Hamza Haq (Transplant) are set to star in the crime drama Underbelly, created by Graeme Stewart (Saving Hope), for Canadian steamer Crave, our sister site Deadline reports. The series, which does not yet have a Stateside outlet, is set in the 1000 Islands region between Canada and the U.S., and follows Officer Henry Roland (Amell), who finds evidence linking a case of missing illegal substances to his childhood best friend (Haq). Driver co-stars as the matriarch of a ruthless British crime family. * Hulu has released a trailer for It’s All Country, a country music docuseries hosted by Luke Bryan and premiering with all six episodes on Friday, Nov. 15: Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
