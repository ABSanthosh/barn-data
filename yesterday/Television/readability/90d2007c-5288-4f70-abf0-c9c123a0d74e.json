  "text": "When it comes to a show like Elsbeth, audiences have come to love the unexpected plots and unique characters that keep the series fresh and interesting.  So, it didn’t come as much of a surprise when Michael Emerson made quite the splash on the show. The actor is no stranger to a television set and certainly knows how to embody every character he takes on.  Still, this TV Fanatic can’t help but notice that the man seems to thrive in roles of the more antagonist nature, with Elsbeth being his most recent villainous venture.  (Michael Parmelee/CBS) It’s unlikely the character will see much of a redemption arc, what with being a murderer and all, but you never know when the main character will be portrayed by your real-life wife.  It’s proof that even in the most extreme cases (and the most entertaining), Michael Emerson always plays a perfect villain. A Classic Tale Of A Very Likable Beauty And The Bone-Chilling Beast  (Michael Parmelee/CBS) What was likely the most unexpected and thrilling surprise of Elsbeth Season 2 was first finding out that an alum from the hit Paramount+ show Evil would be joining the series.  Then, like a gift with purchase, the news that Michael Emerson and Carrie Preston were married spread like wildfire through the Elsbeth fandom.  I, myself, was flabbergasted and elated by the news. Of course, these two powerhouses of talent and incredibly entertaining actors would be linked through matrimony. However, the most interesting thing about their coupling is how they tend to take on roles that are staunchly opposite from one another.  Preston seems to gravitate to light-hearted and always-smiling characters that viewers love to root for such as her roles in True Blood, Claws, and where her current character originated from, The Good Wife.  Then there is Emerson. My god, the man can slip into just about any antagonistic role, and he has.  There Is No Role Too Evil Or Chaotic That Emerson Can’t Bring His Trademark Cold, Dead Stare To  (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Despite a career in the entertainment industry spanning four decades, the actor is most well-known for his rather dark roles.  Sure, he gave as good as he got on Evil as Leland Townsend, but that’s hardly the biggest notch in the actor’s belt.  Many fans of the ABC whirlwind series that took the world by storm, Lost, likely remember Michael Emerson from his days as Ben Linus, the main antagonist from Lost Season 2.  The man has been instilling fear and dread into the hearts of viewers for years. To really drive this point home, Emerson even voiced the Joker in Batman: The Dark Knight Returns.  He may be typecast, but it’s hard to argue with the fact that Emerson’s voice alone is enough to get the job done even without his trademark cold, dead stare.  Elsbeth Has Only Scratched The Surface Of What Michael Emerson Will Likely Bring To The Hit Show  (Courtesy of CBS) Still, despite the success the actor has seen, it has to get old playing the bad guy every single time, despite funktionslust. He has to be itching for a regular role where he has a conversation with another character that isn’t seeping with sarcasm and cynicism.  His wife, Carrie Preston, certainly hopes so. Around the end of Elsbeth Season 1, Preston mentioned in an interview with TVLine that she hoped for Emerson to join the show in the following season.  She also expressed hope that her loving husband would get the chance to play against the type of character he is normally cast as. Well, one out of two isn’t bad.  It’s not that Michael Emerson doesn’t have the chops to take on a more congenial role. It’s that he’s so good at portraying iconic villains that stay with the viewer long after an episode airs.  However, when it comes to shows like Elsbeth, predictability gets thrown out the window with every passing scene. So, for all we know, maybe there will be some kind of redeeming quality to Emerson’s Judge Milton.  (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Granted, hopes aren’t high for that, especially considering how things were left in Elsbeth Season 2 Episode 8, right before the winter break.  Things will definitely get worse before they get better, but maybe the Elsbeth writers will toss the titular character a fireman or two to pass the time during the upcoming madness.  What’s been your favorite character that Emerson has portrayed?  Do you think there is any chance the writers will work on something redeeming for Emerson’s Judge Milton?  Drop a comment below to let me know what you think, and join me again when I bring you more fun questions and opinions about Elsbeth!  Watch Elsbeth Online",
