  "text": "One of the best things about Angela Bassett? She never has to do the thing, yet she always does. And we thank her for that. The 9-1-1 star dropped by Good Morning America on Monday to promote Mission Impossible: The Final Reckoning, during which the co-hosts asked for her thoughts on Peter Krause’s recent departure from the show. While Bassett has already weighed in with her personal thoughts on the matter, she’s now realizing how many people outside of the show are still feeling the effects by Bobby’s death. She recalled being approached by a fan at the airport during her recent trip to London for the Mission Impossible premiere. “Coming through security, I got a tap on my shoulder,” she said, “and I hear, ‘Bring Bobby back. Bring Bobby back!'” (For the record, I will neither confirm nor deny my whereabouts on the date of this incident.) OK, here’s where the fun part starts: When Lara Spencer mentioned that fellow co-host Robin Roberts had hoped Bobby’s death was merely a dream sequence, Bassett was faced with two options: either offer consolation and confirmation of the character’s passing, or do… this. “I know, I know. I mean, listen, it was closed,” she said, referring to the casket at Bobby’s funeral. “So, yeah. He could be up to… things.” Bassett appeared to be joking about the possibility of her on-screen husband still being alive, but let’s be real — this fragile fandom has held on to far less for far longer. As for what the future holds for Athena Grant, Bassett said the powers that be are “being very vague” about her character’s next steps. “I said, OK, I’m going through therapy, I’m processing it, so I’ll wait,” Bassett told the GMA co-hosts. That answer may not sit well with nervous fans, especially given the way things ended for Athena in Season 8. After insisting that she didn’t want to sell the home she and Bobby built together, she pulled a 180 in last week’s finale, putting it on the market after all. So, yeah, we’d all like to know where Athena’s going from here. Is she downsizing in the same city? Moving somewhere else entirely? Should we be bracing ourselves for another major departure? See, this is what happens when 9-1-1 cast members gives vague answers — we spiral! Did you enjoy reading into Bassett’s GMA appearance as much as we did? And what do you actually predict the future could hold for Athena in Season 9? Drop a comment with your thoughts below. 9-1-1 Twists: Who’s Leaving? Who’s Back? And Who’s Totally Taking Over as Captain?",
