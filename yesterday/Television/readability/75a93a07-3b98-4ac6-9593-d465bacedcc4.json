  "text": "On Landman, Jacob Lofland’s Cooper has quickly become a character audiences are rooting for — a young man determined to carve out a place for himself in a harsh and dangerous world. Landman Season 1 Episode 5, “Where Is Home,” pushed Cooper to his limits yet again as he navigated a budding relationship with Ariana, endured another beating at the hands of her cousins, and faced an awkward reunion with his mother, Angela. Jacob Lofland shared his thoughts on Cooper’s journey so far, what drives the character forward, and what we can expect from the rest of the season. (Unique Nicole / AFP) Where’s Cooper’s Head At? Heading into Episode 5, Cooper’s life is a whirlwind of challenges. Jacob shared, “I don’t know if he knows where his head’s at ever, really. He’s still got this one goal in mind, and that is to make his way as high as he can in this business… and to one day own his own [company].” Despite the chaos, Cooper remains focused on proving himself. “He knows he has to do every aspect [of the job],” Jacob added. “He’s trying to figure it out, but at the end of [Episode 5], there’s definitely going to have to be some path change from there.” (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Helping Ariana — And Himself A big part of the episode focuses on Cooper stepping in to help Ariana with her house and bills despite the risks involved with her family. When asked why Cooper is so willing to put himself out there, Jacob explained, “I think it’s almost like a trauma bonding type thing. It’s helping both of them not to be alone. At the end of the day, he’s got a big heart, and he’s a nice guy just trying to do what he can.” One standout moment from the episode is the lawn-mowing scene, which Jacob described as a chance to explore Cooper’s vulnerabilities. “We’ve seen Cooper trying to be this blue-collar working man, but now we get to sit down and see that he’s really just a kid,” Jacob said. “He doesn’t really know what he’s stepping into… It’s kind of a fun little lost moment where she takes the lead. It’s a fun dynamic.” (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Tensions With Ariana’s Family The tension with Ariana’s cousins reaches a boiling point in this episode, culminating in another brutal beating for Cooper. Jacob laughed when asked about the repeated violence, “It’s become a running thing for Cooper. He’s always on the ground.” Filming those intense scenes, however, comes with its own challenges. Jacob credited the stunt team for their seamless work. “We have one of the best stunt teams around. I had a great double, but they always let me try things first. It’s physically tough, but when you’ve got the right people, it flows and works great.” As for Cooper’s warning to Manuel — “This is the third and the last time” — Jacob admitted he couldn’t say too much. “It’ll tie itself back together. I’m not going to say it might not be at the hands of Cooper, but it works itself out,” he laughed. (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Family Drama and “Home” The episode also brings Cooper back into the orbit of his estranged mother, Angela, for an awkward family dinner that does little to repair their fractured relationship. The tension is palpable as Angela puts on a show of normalcy with rented furniture and a carefully prepared meal, but it’s clear that Cooper isn’t buying it. Jacob reflected on the dynamic, “I don’t think Cooper really wanted to be there to begin with… I don’t think it did much in the moment. Not for Cooper.” The episode also contrasts Cooper’s feelings about his biological family and his growing connection with Ariana. Cooper seems to feel more at home helping her than he does with his own family, a sentiment Jacob agrees with. (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) “That’s been a really good question… I think as the series progresses, those questions will be answered,” he said, pointing out that while the characters’ backstories aren’t fully revealed yet, there’s hope for clarity later on. The episode’s title, “Where Is Home,” captures Cooper’s ongoing struggle. He doesn’t have a home. It’s not in that little box where he waits for the job to start again. It’s not with Ariana, although he’s making it sort of homey. And it’s also not at home with Angela and Tommy. When asked how long it might take Cooper to find his place, Jacob admitted, “We can only hope soon… Taylor and Christian will definitely lead us on an entertaining path.” (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) What’s Next for Cooper? Jacob teased that the back half of the season will be full of twists and surprises. “Entertaining, super suspenseful, and… cliffhangers,” he said with a grin. “It’s Taylor Sheridan’s world,” he laughed. “You know you’re going to have some cliffhangers in there!” And as for Cooper? Jacob believes his character’s blind determination will keep him going. “He’s trying to prove it to himself and his dad and all these people around him,” he said. “He wants it to be seen that he’s done it on his own.” Whether Cooper can find his home or just keep surviving remains to be seen. One thing is clear — Jacob Lofland’s performance has us rooting for him every step of the way. New episodes of Landman drop Sundays on Paramount+. Watch Landman Online",
