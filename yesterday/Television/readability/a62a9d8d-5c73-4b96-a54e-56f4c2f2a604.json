  "text": "Critic's Rating: 3.75 / 5.03.75 Landman Season 1 Episode 7 split the emotion between Angela and Ainsley’s asinine hijinks and Cooper’s decision to lay his head on Ariana’s pillow, as much of a home as he’s had in a very long time. The gulf between those plotlines was jarring, with true life and future decisions juxtaposed with temporary choices that even the most forgiving couldn’t help but laugh at. But that’s the Landman way. It’s a tough world, and living in it requires a certain je ne sais quoi that can only be found here and within the Taylor Sheridan universe. (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) With just three episodes left in its first season, Landman continues to be the show everyone’s talking about: the most successful Paramount+ series ever. What do all the naysayers have to say about that? This episode, “All Roads Lead to a Hole,” delivered all the humor, heart, and high-stakes drama we’ve come to expect. Between the sharp one-liners and the intense character moments, this one could be the next attraction at DisneyWorld. Let’s break it down. Angela’s Wild Thoughts on Marriage and Her Unexpected New Hobby (Ryan Green/Paramount+) Angela’s advice to Ainsley during their row class  —  essentially that life’s goal is to find a man who will provide everything  —  was peak Angela. But then, as if to prove she’s not completely selfish, she spontaneously decided to liven up the day for a group of retirement home residents. Did anyone else laugh out loud at her party-planning skills? Board games, liquor store runs, and wild hats  —  Angela knows how to turn “waiting to die” into a reason to live. And if you think she might have been too much, then watch Man on the Inside to see Ted Dansen do the same. But here’s the kicker: could Angela have found her true calling? Ainsley’s comment that Angela might have a knack for this kind of thing really hit home. What do you think? Will we see Angela dive deeper into the retirement home world, or is this a one-off adventure? Could she discover a purpose far beyond her desire to kick back and let the world cater to her? Tommy and the Gangsters: A Risky Deal (Lauren ìLoî Smith/Paramount+.) Tommy never shies away from taking the road less traveled and asking Boss to pull his marauding bunch of gangsters onto the cartel-controlled rig perfectly in character. Watching these guys stand their ground against cartel threats was nerve-wracking, but let’s be honest  —  did anyone expect the gangsters not to have Tommy’s back? Guns were drawn, threats flying, and somehow, it all worked out. Do you think this plan will hold up, or is Tommy just kicking a bigger hornet’s nest down the line? Monty’s Self-Serving Tactics (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Monty continues to be the guy who looks out for number one, no matter what. His refusal to involve banks in his latest deal shocked Tommy and, honestly, me too. Monty makes moves that Tommy has to live with every day. One decision always has consequences beyond the decision-maker. Monty’s explanation about fossil fuel funding restrictions made sense, but it also made me wonder: What will another Trump presidency mean for guys like Monty? Will his ties to Elon Musk and electric vehicles change anything in the current climate, or are schemes like Monty’s too far removed from political influence? From what I can tell, they need politics to survive, so I’m curious to hear your thoughts. Angela and Tommy: Bickering Soulmates (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) If Angela and Tommy aren’t the most entertaining couple on TV right now, who is? Their constant back-and-forth, from snoring complaints to over-the-top threats (“Get a mask like Top Gun Maverick or else!”), is TV perfection. But beneath the barbs is a relationship that somehow works. Their love might be messy, but it’s real  —  and hilarious. Once upon a time, Beth and Rip on Yellowstone had a similar dynamic, and we made them the couple to beat. But are you rooting for Tommy and Angela, or are they just too much? Ainsley’s Not-So-Innocent Night (Lauren ìLoî Smith/Paramount+) Ainsley’s night at the kegger was full of cringe-worthy moments, but as much as I hate seeing it played out, many real-life young women are standing in the same shoes. Who are we to turn a blind eye to the realities of the lost “dating” mores in 2024? But good lord, does she go too far in sharing the details with her dad. Like an old-time cartoon, you could practically see the smoke pouring out of Tommy’s ears every time she opened her mouth His reaction to her admitting she wasn’t planning on sex  —  just a little “helping hand”  —  was priceless. (Lauren ìLoî Smith/Paramount+) The poor guy knows her reality, but like every other father, he’d appreciate a bald-faced lie rather than her treating him like her 19-year-old bestie. Still, for all his ranting, it’s clear he’s just desperate to shield her from the harsher things in life. He sees so much of it daily, so who could blame him? But I’m not sure if he’d be any better off being in the dark. What if something does happen, and her oversharing makes the difference in catching her when she falls? What do you think? Is the line Ainsley is walking between naive and dangerously bold being over-told on screen as much as in her fictional life? A Modern-Day Romeo and Juliet (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Cooper choosing Ariana over his family was a quieter but emotionally rich storyline. The nurse’s comment about them being like Romeo and Juliet wasn’t just cute  —  it was a giant flashing sign of what might come. Two star-crossed lovers caught in the chaos of cartel drama? Yeah, this could go south fast. Suspense lurks around every corner to the point it’s uncomfortable to watch without shielding your eyes every time the door rings. And did anyone else catch Cooper’s reaction to the photo of Ariana’s late husband? Is he struggling to step into a relationship that already has so much history? He’d be stupid if it weren’t high on his list of concerns. Rebecca’s Chilling Smile and Ultimatum (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) Then there is Rebecca. The ending with her and Nate showing up at Ariana’s place was a masterclass in tension. Rebecca’s coercive tactics, Nate’s hesitation, and Cooper’s surprise arrival set the stage for a fiery confrontation. Rebecca’s icy treatment of Ariana was brutal (again), but that wry smile when she learned who Cooper was? Yikes. She’s clearly playing a game, but what’s the end goal? Is it just business, or is there something more personal at play? And did anyone else feel a little squirmy about how easily she manipulated Ariana with that veiled threat? Rebecca is the kind of character you love to hate  —  so what’s your take on her? Villain or misunderstood mastermind? All I know is if you had told me that Kayla Wallace had this performance in her when she was on When Calls the Heart, I would have been skeptical. Not anymore! Are You Raising Your Pitchforks from the Bud Light Slight? (Emerson Miller/Paramount+) I’m ready for fellow critics to raise their pitchforks over the bold move to tease the Bud Light controversy, but it made me laugh. Tommy has indeed been a diehard Michelob Ultra drinker because it’s barely more than water. That’s not a rousing endorsement of any beer, so the swing at Bud Light, once the king of beers, worked. Ellie tried pushing Bud Light on Tommy, Dale, and Boss, but they wouldn’t touch the stuff. Ellie described Bud Light’s sales going as well as “a popcorn fart in church,” which was the kind of cheeky humor Landman excels at. But here’s the question: is poking fun at real-world controversies a risky move, or does it just make the show feel more grounded? “All Roads Lead to a Hole” delivered a delectable mix of laugh-out-loud humor, tender moments, and nail-biting drama. With so many loose threads dangling, the season’s final episodes promise to be a wild ride. So, what are your predictions? Who’s in for a happy ending, and who’s headed for disaster?
