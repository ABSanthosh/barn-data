  "text": "Vice President Kamala Harris conceded the 2024 presidential election to Donald Trump Wednesday, addressing the nation from her undergraduate alma mater, Howard University in Washington, D.C. “My heart is full today, full of gratitude for the trust you have placed in me, full of love for our country, and full of resolve,” she told a crowd of supporters during a speech broadcast by multiple networks. “The outcome of this election is not what we wanted, not what we fought for, not what we voted for, but hear me when I say: The light of America’s promise will always burn bright as long as we never give up and as long as we keep fighting.” Her remarks followed an earlier phone call with President-elect Trump, in which Harris said she expressed hope for a peaceful transition of power. “Now I know folks are feeling and experiencing a range of emotions right now. I get it,” she said. “But we must accept the results of this election… A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results.. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.” She also steeled young people who may be feeling like their efforts in this election season did not matter. “This is not a time to throw up our hands,” she said, noting that hard work can be good, joyful work, and “the fight for our country is always worth it.” As of the time of Harris’ speech, Trump claimed 292 electoral votes to Harris’ 224. Trump also looks to emerge with an edge in the popular vote — by smaller margins than President Joe Biden in 2020, but still, a feat no Republican presidential candidate has managed in 20 years. With his victory, Trump becomes the first candidate to win the presidency in two non-consecutive terms in more than 130 years, since Grover Cleveland in 1892. And at age 78, he is also now the oldest man ever elected president, breaking the record held by Biden. Harris became the Democratic Party’s candidate in July after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race amid mounting concerns about his health and cognitive abilities. In August, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz joined Harris’ campaign as her running mate. Press PLAY on the video above to watch Harris’ concession speech, then hit the comments with your thoughts.",
