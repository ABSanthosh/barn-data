  "text": "The Garvey girls are at it again. When Bad Sisters returns for Season 2 Wednesday, the Apple TV+ series picks up two years after the events of Season 1. That means that the Sisters Garvey —  Eva, Becka, Ursula, Bibi and Grace — have had plenty of time to reckon with their involvement in the murder of John Paul, Grace’s monster of a husband. At first blush, it seems like happier times are ahead; the Season 2 trailer makes it clear that Grace (played by Anne-Marie Duffy) has found new love with a man named Ian (Killing Eve‘s Owen McDonnell), and her sisters are the attendants at her wedding. But isn’t there a niggling fear that the truth of John Paul’s death will ruin it all at some point? Sure, says Duffy — not that any of them are talking about it all that much. “She’s sort of the queen of denial, isn’t she, Grace?” the actress says in the video above. “She’s very good at it. She spent years and years honing her craft with an abusive husband. And then she moves forward in her life with this cloak of guilt, the she kind of has to, again, deny its existence in order to move forward and fall in love with this gorgeous man. “But ultimately, of course, secrets come just tearing out of us, don’t they?” she adds. “They come up for air, don’t they?” When you think about it, the idea that these ladies would be able to keep mum on the subject forever is incredibly optimistic, a point TVLine joked about with Duffy and her castmates Eve Hewson (Becka), Sarah Greene (Bibi) and Eva Birthistle (Ursula). “It’s not like we’re practiced!” Birthistle says in her character’s defense. “We made such a mess of it last time around.” They’ll have to be even more careful in Season 2 given the addition of a meddling church lady named Fiona (played by Killing Eve‘s Fiona Shaw). TVLine spoke with Shaw, as well, to get the scoop on what Fiona does and doesn’t know about the Garveys. To get a sense of what’s ahead in Season 2, press PLAY on the video above. Then hit the comments: Are you planning to watch Bad Sisters‘ second season?",
