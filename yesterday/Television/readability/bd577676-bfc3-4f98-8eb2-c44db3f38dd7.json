  "text": "Lots of Americans tuned in to see what President Donald Trump has in mind for his second term in office: 36.6 million viewers watched Trump’s joint address to Congress on Tuesday, Nielsen has announced, marking a three-year high for the annual speech. (Note: A President’s first speech to Congress is not technically considered a “State of the Union” speech, but instead referred to as an Address to a Joint Session of Congress.) Trump’s speech — which saw him touting his administration’s accomplishments in his first six weeks in office and praising Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency task force — topped Joe Biden’s 2024 speech, which drew 32.2 million viewers, representing a 13% increase. (The last speech to top Trump’s in viewership was Biden’s 2022 address, with 38.2 million.) Viewership of Trump’s speech peaked in the 9:45-10:00 pm ET window, with 37.9 million viewers. But the audience did skew old: More than 70% of viewers were over the age of 55, with just 2.1 million viewers aged 18-34. Plus, Trump’s speech fell short of all four of his previous addresses, with 37.2 million tuning into his most recent speech to Congress in February 2020. A total of 15 networks aired Trump’s speech, including: ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, Merit Street, Telemundo, Univision, PBS, CNN, CNNe, Fox Business, Fox News, MSNBC, Newsmax and NewsNation.",
