  "text": "And the winner for best Halloween costume goes to… TV’s erstwhile Young Sheldon.  “My costume for this year was supposed to arrive two days ago and still isn’t here. I’m seriously thinking that I might need to go out as Young Sheldon,” Iain Armitage shared on Instagram Thursday. “The good news is that I really look like him! But also, where’s my costume??!” Alas, Armitage’s costume never arrived. Two hours later, the 16-year-old shared a video of himself in Sheldon’s signature button-down shirt, bowtie and khakis. Armitage has not yet appeared on Georgie \u0026 Mandy’s First Marriage, which on Wednesday secured a full-season order. While co-stars Zoe Perry, Raegan Revord, Craig T. Nelson and Annie Potts are set to reprise their Young Sheldon roles in the spinoff’s Thanksgiving episode, Armitage does not make an appearance, which series co-creator Steve Holland previously revealed is by design.  “We would love to [have Sheldon appear] if we found the right episode for Iain,” Holland told TVLine. “We love him, and he’s been super supportive… but we’re trying to establish this show and give it its own identity. “Obviously, the Cooper family is still in Medford. It makes much more sense in these stories to have Mary pop over, or have Meemaw pop over,” the EP explained. “Sheldon is in California now, so if Sheldon is coming into the story, there has to be a bigger reason for it. If we can find a story where he is used to inform our characters, then that’s great. But we also know from Big Bang, in that [Season 11] discussion with Adult Georgie, that Sheldon didn’t come home a lot. He left and didn’t come [back] much, and Georgie was left to pick up the brunt of the family baggage.” Georgie \u0026 Mandy Cast: All the Chuck Lorre Shows You’ve Seen Them On Before In a Young Sheldon series finale interview with TVLine, Armitage said that he would be “honored to” reprise Sheldon on Georgie \u0026 Mandy, adding, “If I got a call to go back, that’d be so much fun. I’m also just excited to get to sit back on my couch with some popcorn and watch their show because they’re so good. But I could totally see myself getting in the khakis again, putting on the old penny loafers and bow tie, and going back out on the job.” In the meantime, see Armitage slip back into character above, then hit the comments with your reactions.",
