  "text": "When it comes to police procedurals, keeping things fresh and exciting is the key to success. Many shows try numerous tactics, but CBS‘s Elsbeth has created a unique advantage for itself. As the series comes to the halfway point of its sophomore season, it’s fair to say there are endless guest appearances. Something that has indeed worked in the show’s favor. Fans of Elsbeth have more than become accustomed to the revolving door of detectives. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) While we will likely still have more new faces down the road, we at least have a core group of investigators. Now that a good handful of the detectives are buddying up with Elsbeth, it’s about time we get familiar with some of these wildly different but equally entertaining sleuths. Username or Email AddressPassword Detective Jackie Donnelly (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Don’t claim to be a New Yorker around this intimidating lady unless you’ve done the hard-earned time. You’re not a real New Yorker until you’ve lived in a fifth-floor walkup apartment and the shower is in the kitchen. Maybe that’s how Donnelly became so surly because while she is a pleasant addition, she’s not exactly Miss Sunshine. We first met the detective in Elsbeth Season 1 Episode 3, investigating the death of a reality star. From there, it became clear she would have rather be shooting things than having any conversation ever. Still, she was one of the very first detectives to show Elsbeth appreciation, albeit in her own way. There’s a smile hiding under Donnelly’s jaded cynicism. Remember when the detective told Elsbeth to do her “thing” because it “works” even though she didn’t respect it? That’s sisterhood right there. The Elsbeth writers must feel the same because she’s already popped up twice during Season 2. Molly Price (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Believe it or not, Molly Price has been in the entertainment industry for over thirty years. You know what that means, right? You’ve definitely seen her in one thing or another. You may have seen her in the FX series FEUD: Bette and Joan by horror and musical enthusiast Ryan Murphy. In it, she flexed her acting chops alongside Jessica Lange and Susan Sarandon. Then again, it could be anything from her three decades of acting like And Just Like That…, The Path, or Almost Family. Hopefully, Detective Donnelly isn’t going anywhere any time soon because Elsbeth needs as many detectives in her corner as she can. We’ll get to that in a minute. Detective Buzz Fleming (CBS/Screenshot) Detective Grandpa is in the house and has nothing but stories about the good old days, much to HR’s chagrin. Buzz has been a very welcomed addition to Elsbeth. Having been introduced in Elsbeth Season 2 Episode 1, the character quickly established that he’s far too old to retire. That man is going to be busting criminals till he’s dust. Interestingly, he’s been at the precinct for a while, judging by how Fleming and Donnelly exchanged pleasantries during the poker game in “Elsbeth Flips the Bird.” Truthfully, I was expecting new detectives, but I thought we would be getting a fresh-faced recruit. That said, I’m glad I was wrong because Detective Grandpa has the perfect unbothered energy that compliments a show as campy as Elsbeth. Daniel Oreskes (CBS/Screenshot) Now, here is a man who knows his way around a precinct or two. Before you jump to any conclusions, I just meant that this actor has been in several police procedurals. Let’s be honest; procedurals rule broadcast television, so it’s no surprise that Daniel Oreskes has been around the broadcast block a time or two. And by “two,” I mean many, MANY times. From Law \u0026 Order, Law \u0026 Order: Criminal Intent, Law \u0026 Order: Organized Crime to Rescue Me, Blue Bloods, and Elementary, Oreskes has been sneaking onto screens for years. It’s not all procedurals, though. The actor has strayed from the beaten path a time or two. Namely, fans of Only Murders In The Building may recognize him as “Marv.” He was a staple on Courage, the Cowardly Dog for all those ‘90s kids out there. Then again, maybe, just maybe, you recognize Daniel Oreskes from The Good Wife. You didn’t think it was just the murderers who were reintroduced characters, did you? Detective Samantha Edwards (Michael Parmelee/CBS) If this series had been written thirty years ago, Detective Edwards would have been characterized as Elsbeth’s rival but would have been considered difficult by her male colleagues for always wanting to be thorough. Luckily, Elsbeth’s fantastic writers are brilliant, so Edwards not only isn’t a cliche but shows that getting the job done is more important than making friends. Did Samantha and Elsbeth have a rocky start to their working relationship in Elsbeth Season 1 Episode 6? I’m pretty sure Edwards wanted to shoot her after five minutes of conversation. Still, she’s a good cop. Unlike the other detectives at the precinct, Detective Edwards naturally thinks outside the box and pursues every clue that other cops don’t. She may be a little sharp with her words, but if it means the case is solved and justice is served, I’m all for Samatha’s permanent frown. At least she and Elsbeth finally find common ground in “Elsbeth Flips the Bird.” Nothing brings people together like the “Avocado Cartel.” Remember that nonsense? Micaela Diamond (Michael Parmelee/CBS) If you’re like this TV Fanatic, you likely feel that Micaela Diamond came out of nowhere but is popping up everywhere. You would be right in that assessment, as the actor has only been in the game for six years. Having started on Broadway, Diamond quickly proved her acting prowess. She went from playing Mary Magdalene in a Jesus Christ Superstar Live in-concert television special to CBS’s Elsbeth. Most recently, she joined Niecy Nash in the Ryan Murphy series on FX, Grotesquerie. That’s quite a meteoric rise if you ask me. While she’s not a household name at the moment, I can certainly see her star shining years down the road from a carefully crafted filmography. You can catch Micaela Diamond in her other roles on The Gilded Age, Up Here, and in the Netflix original movie Tick, Tick… Boom! alongside Andrew Garfield and Vanessa Hudgens. Detective Bobby Smullen (CBS/Screenshot) We’ve saved the worst for last because this character has unfortunately allied himself with the enemy. We may not know what the new Lieutenant has in store for Wagner (Wendell Pierce) and Elsbeth, but we know Smullen’s deal. Since day one, Detective Smullen has been a constant thorn in Elsbeth’s side. I’m surprised that Elsbeth and Kaya (Carra Patterson) don’t groan unanimously when he enters the room. For some reason, he is the only detective that refuses to give Elsbeth a chance. He dismisses every theory she poses. The captain had to separate them in Elsbeth Season 1 like they were his kids. The detective was first introduced in Elsbeth Season 1 Episode 1. Now Wagner has to deal with Smullen and Connor buddying up and forcing the poor captain to make everyone at the precinct like him. Do you see what you’re doing to the captain, Smullen? The man bought milkshakes and held a poker game. It’s diabolical. Danny Mastrogiorgio (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Unlike his insufferable character, Danny Mastrogiorgio would be friends with Elsbeth in real life. Believe it or not, we have another Broadway buff here. Mastrogiorgio has been shuffling from the stage to the screen and back again for thirty years. Before you even ask, the man has been in practically every procedural under the sun. He probably just stays in his costume and plays roughly the same character from set to set. In all seriousness, this man has been in everything. Yes, including The Good Wife. Is there anyone on Elsbeth that hasn’t been on The Good Wife or The Good Fight before? That’s not rhetorical. I’m genuinely curious. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) So, while Mastrogiorgio’s character can rub viewers the wrong way, at least he is played by an actor who truly loves the arts. If you want to see Mastrogiorgio in his other roles to compare notes, you can see the actor in Evil, Power Book III: Raising Kanan, East New York, and The Blacklist. No doubt, this is far from every detective on Elsbeth, but these are certainly the ones making the biggest splash. Considering the precinct can only have so many investigators on payroll, we’ll likely have this good group for a while. And hopefully, we’ll have Elsbeth for much more than a while. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) With the series taking a seasonal break soon, it’s an excellent time to get those Paramount+ subscriptions active again so you can relive all the hilarious campiness of Elsbeth Season 1 and Season 2. Did you recognize any of these actors from their previous roles? Who’s an actor you think would do great on a show like Elsbeth?
