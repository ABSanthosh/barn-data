  "text": "Critic's Rating: 3.5 / 5.03.5 One thing we can say for sure about the Fire Country writers is that they are an ambitious bunch. How else do you describe them pitting a small fire station against a million-dollar corporation? Whatever the series is plotting, I am all for this recent story development. For once, the drama isn’t a blazing forest fire or a medical emergency that goes from bad to worse. Fire Country is using an age-old tactic that is both a cliche and certified method to corral audience members around the characters. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) The writers are bringing in a “big bad” to rally Sharon, Vince, and everyone else at the station. It’s a tried-and-true technique that never fails. Fire Country has tried the “Hometown Hero” strategy, and now it seems like they are going for the “Great Evil” that unites a group of people. Sometimes, the old ways are the best ways. As great as that developing arc seems, a closer look at this episode’s plot shows that it wouldn’t have worked without side characters who lack self-preservation. Fire Country Has Gotten a Bit Lazy with Its Episodic Cases That Have Very Convenient Storytelling Circumstances I’m sure, from my Fire Country reviews, it sometimes seems like I have a bone to pick with the series, but I swear I love this show just as much as anyone else. However, I’m here to review a show, and that’s precisely what I’m going to do. You guys, the cases on “One Last Time” were absolutely ridiculous. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) First, there is the caretaker of a lighthouse museum who risked his life for the sake of getting the beacon going. Sure, it’s noble that the guy wanted to help the ship make it safely to shore, but as Jake expressed in the moment, that is what the Coast Guard is for. And, why, for the love of all that is good, did three fully grown and intelligent men think that an old-ass lighthouse would work without a single thing going wrong? And in a town like Edgewater? Really? Don’t even get me started on the two idiots who peeled their stoner van into the fire station. Is the station that much closer than the hospital? Has anyone ever thought, “The hospital is so many miles away, but there’s a fire station only so many miles away?” Fire Country is really stretching reality for us. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Remember the poor girl on Fire Country Season 3 Episode 13 who got herself glued into her mascot costume? Why would they go to a fire station instead of a hospital? At least Tommy, the surfer, could inspire Walter to get out of his own way — even if the dots barely connected and only in the most convenient of storytelling ways. What Is It with the Leone Men and Their Constant Habit of Being Their Own Worst Enemy Listen, I feel for Walter — I really do. However, it’s to the point where we, the audience, are starting to feel the burden of his dementia, and not in a way that makes the viewing experience more authentic. Honestly, I can’t believe the Leones got Walter to agree to assisted living in the first place. That is the conversation that should have been depicted. It’s been nice having Jeff Fahey’s (From Dusk Till Dawn) Papa Leone on the show, but it’s time for that cranky old bastard to go. He’s driving everyone crazy and bringing the drama to the fire station. Enough is enough. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Is it a hereditary trait for the Leone men to all be stubborn idiots who can’t get out of their own way? It may have skipped a generation, but Bode definitely has the gene. Quick question about Bode’s situation: Does “associating with criminals” mean that Bode can’t interact with Freddy if he should ever return? What about Cole and the guys at Three Rock? Also, why in the world would Bode need to be talking to someone who has a history of incarceration? Audrey called it when she clocked Bode for being shifty regarding his whereabouts. Speaking of Audrey, things are not looking too good for the fans still holding out hope for “Bodelia.” Relationships On Fire Country Rage Harder Than the Infernos That the Team Fights Look, I feel for everyone who has been hoping that Bode and Gabriela would get back together, but it looks like that ship has sailed and sunk. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) The chemistry between Leven Rambin’s (The Path) Audrey and Bode only seems to be growing. On top of that, now there is Finn who is not at all shy about his feelings towards Gabriela. Blake Lee’s Finn seems like a great guy, but it’s too soon for Gabriela. It’s like Fire Country wants to mark every milestone Gabriela makes by giving her another love interest. How about giving Gabriela a pursuit, a goal, or something that is all her own and doesn’t require a romantic story arc? For that matter, give Jake the same treatment. What is it with Jake Crawford? Jordan Calloway (Black Lightning) is way too damn hot to be playing a character that is so eager to be in his forties. Why does he move so fast every time he catches feelings for a female? By the end of the season, Jake will probably ask Violet to move in with him. However, she’ll likely have to move away from Edgewater before that can happen because of the new position she gained in this episode. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) If there is one thing Fire Country loves, it’s any reason to shelf a supporting character. However, with how the story has evolved, new developments may be on the horizon. Cal Fire may be facing its greatest threat yet, and it will take more than a hose to put this inferno out. Fire Country Brings in a Big Bad at the Final Hour with a Story That Will Likely Finish Off Season 3 Don’t get me wrong. As great as it was to see J. August Richards of Angel fame, his Fire Country character is not nearly as charming as the one he played on the WB series. The main thing I can’t stop thinking is, “How big is Oxalta that they’re not worried about how they will look in the press going after a small fire station?” Furthermore, why is the company going on the offensive right away? (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) As far as has been seen on screens, big brands usually like to keep in the local community’s good graces. Isn’t that how it goes? Not to mention that whatever Oxalta is doing, it is poisoning the water at Three Rock with pesticides. As seen on Fire Country Season 3 Episode 14, the company is quick to quiet anyone related to the contaminated water as they did with Birch’s sister. Oxalta isn’t even trying to act like they are going to play nice. Rather than work with the station to find a solution, the million-dollar company seems poised to bulldoze right through Sharon and her team. At least Eve figured out what the issue was, so she just has to make sure the camp has clean drinking water. And hallelujah, Manny is going to be alright. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Several readers expressed what their feelings would be if the CBS series decided to kill off Mr. Perez. Let’s just say the Fire Country writers dodged a bullet. Whatever the hands behind the show have planned with Oxalta, I have a feeling that things will not be the same for Cal Fire after. Whether that’s good or bad is yet to be seen, but we only have a few episodes until the conclusion of Fire Country Season 3. Do you think Bode is secretly using drugs? What are your feelings regarding Gabriela and Bode no longer being a possible couple?
