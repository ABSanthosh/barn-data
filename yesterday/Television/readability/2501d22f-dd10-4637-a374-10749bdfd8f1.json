  "text": "All American is returning to its origins –South Crenshaw and Beverly Hills high school football. After Spencer James (Daniel Ezra) exited the series, All American experienced a reboot. Season 7 will feature a new group of teenagers, including Alexis Chikaeze, who plays Preach’s (Kareem Grimes) teenage daughter. Jordan Baker (Michael Evans Behling), Layla Keating (Greta Onieogou), and Coop (Bre-Z) are all returning and will be the adults this season. (The CW Network/ YouTube Screenshot) It wouldn’t be All American without rivalries on the field, as the promo shows between Kingston Jeremy (Nathaniel McIntyre) and Yasi (Elijah M. Cooper), the rival quarterbacks. Cassius Jeremy (Osy Ikhile) is Beverly High’s new football coach. Returning to the beginning will allow the new teens to thrive, and original characters, such as Jordan and Layla, will have the opportunity to show how much they’ve grown. Jordan looks nervous in the teaser trailer about becoming the head coach at South Crenshaw. He wants to make his late father proud because that was always his goal, and he finds the delicate balance between being a coach and being a friend harder than he thought. Fans of All American will enjoy Easter eggs to the pilot when Jordan recruits a player, similar to when Billy Baker recruited Spencer. We’ll have to watch to see if they develop the same type of relationship. Layla also dispenses some advice she learned to her new protege about the importance of staying true to herself. That was always the essence of All American, a point that even Olivia re-iterates about her dad on her guest stint during Episode 2. We don’t know much more about it except Jordan needs her. (Courtesy of The CW) The CW will air a sneak peek of All American Season 7 on Wednesday, January 29th, at 8/7c. It will officially premiere on Monday, February 3 at 8/7c.
