  "text": "Ted Lasso has traded in Earl Greyhound for Ellie the Elephant. Ahead of Game 5 in the WNBA Finals, which pit the New York Liberty against the Minnesota Lynx, Jason Sudeikis stopped by ESPN‘s booth to cheer on the Liberty — and he brought everyone’s favorite curious-not-judgmental Ted Lasso character in his back pocket. When commentator Carolyn Peck asked Sudeikis to offer New York a piece of advice straight out of the titular soccer coach’s playbook, the actor delivered a statement in his character’s trademark southern drawl. “Shoot layups,” Sudeikis said. “Don’t let ’em shoot layups. That simple. Let’s go ladies. Let’s cook.” (Watch him channel the beloved coach in the video above, then keep scrolling.) Sudeikis’ Coach Lasso is known for his simple, declarative — sometimes nonsensical — advice, after taking over an English soccer team with no prior knowledge of the sport in the first season of the Apple TV+ comedy. Ted Lasso wrapped Season 3 in May 2023 with a finale that felt like an unofficial sendoff. A potential fourth season, however, has long been a source of speculation (and frustration) since the streamer never announced that the series has ended. In August, it was reported that Apple negotiations were underway, with a Season 4 eyeing an early 2025 start. Press PLAY on the video above for a taste of The Lasso Way.",
