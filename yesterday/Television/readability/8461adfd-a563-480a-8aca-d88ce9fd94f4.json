  "text": "We’re a big fan of franchises here at TV Fanatic. I’ve personally covered some of the most prominent during my tenure here and have enjoyed many for the most part. That said, the current craze of turning any moderately successful series into a franchise has got to stop.  (David Astorga/NBC) Lightning rarely strikes twice when it comes to getting a successful show off the ground, which is why most spinoffs are pale imitations of the mothership, a fate that is all but certainly awaiting Suits LA.  I’ve been on the fence about the show because I devoured every episode of Suits the moment they were available and theorized what could happen next for all of the characters.  (Shane Mahood/USA Network) I firmly believe that Harvey and Donna are one of the finest relationships on TV. Sure, there were some issues in the later seasons, but all that matters is that they got there in the end.  Even if Suits LA manages to surprise and deliver another eclectic array of personalities and some passionate relationships, it doesn’t have the hook the original series had.  Suits’ Big Twist Kept the Drama Flowing For Years (Christos Kalohoridis/USA Network) The inciting incident of Suits Season 1 Episode 1 echoed like a halo effect through the rest of the series. Mike may have been a deeply flawed individual, but his photographic memory got him a job as a lawyer in one of the most lucrative law firms in New York.  Despite his lack of credentials, he fought for what was right in the courtroom, and a large part of the show was this moral struggle about whether he should lose his job or be allowed to continue fighting the good fight.  At the time, no other legal show did the same thing, but Suits had this rich tapestry of personalities, so the series premiere’s big twist didn’t have any real stakes until a few seasons in.  But hot damn, it created a lot of tension, especially when the jig was up, and everything Mike built for himself came crashing down, and he was imprisoned.  (Shane Mahood/USA Network) Mike’s secret saved Suits from becoming stale on countless occasions. Unless Suits LA has a massive secret to throw at audiences in the series premiere, the series is already at a significant disadvantage.  In the pre-season material NBC has released so far, the network is trying to make Ted (Stephen Amell) a Harvey-lite. It doesn’t help matters that the teasers are already teasing Gabriel Macht’s return as Harvey, either.  Gabriel Macht’s Return Is An Encouraging Sign of Suits LA’s Quality (Ian Watson/USA Network) The synopsis confirms that Ted has some skeletons in his closet, but what can come close to Mike’s secret and Harvey’s part in keeping it hidden? The only solace I’m taking is that Gabriel has come out of retirement to film this three-episode arc.  Would he sign on for an arc if it was a throwaway and could contribute to the franchise’s going sideways after a Netflix-fueled resurgence? It’d be very surprising.  I’ve already touched upon how I feel about Suits LA promoting Harvey’s return because the new series should set up its world first and keep its new characters at the wheel for them to establish rapport with audiences.  (NBC/Screenshot) Who are these new characters, and what makes them tick? We need to know that to establish whether Suits LA has the legs to sustain itself as a brand-new franchise entry.  In hindsight, having a franchise veteran lead the spinoff wouldn’t have been a bad idea because there would have been an immediate draw.  There’s so much at stake for the Suits franchise with Suits LA because two failed spinoffs are not a good look. Pearson was so good, and I wish that had gotten a bit of love and a reprieve. It successfully took the franchise to Chicago and took a hard left turn from there.  (NBC/Screenshot) Can Suits LA pull off a similar move? Only time will tell.  What are your thoughts on the lack of hook with Suits LA? Do you think the success of the original series has set the spinoff up for disaster? Let’s get the comments section lit up.",
