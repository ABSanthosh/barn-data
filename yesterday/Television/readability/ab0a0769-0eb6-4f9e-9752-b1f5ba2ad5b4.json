  "text": "Faces new, familiar, and slightly different can be spied in the first teaser trailer for the new season of Doctor Who, seen below. The first footage, which was released at the end of the long-running serial’s latest Christmas episode, Joy to the World, brings back Ncuti Gatwa as the Doctor, who soon enough will be joined in the TARDIS by new companion Belinda Chandra, played by Varada Sethu (of last season’s “Boom” episode and Disney+’s Andor Star Wars series). In Season 2, which is currently set for a “2025” premiere, the Doctor meets Belinda and begins an epic quest to get her back to Earth. But a mysterious force is stopping their return, and the time-traveling TARDIS team must face great dangers, bigger enemies and wider terrors than ever before. Millie Gibson’s Ruby Sunday, with whom Fifteen parted ways at the close of last season, can also be glimpsed in the trailer above — as can Anita Dobson as the increasingly mysterious Mrs. Flood, Ruby’s Notting Hill neighbor. At the very end of Gatwa’s first season as the Doctor, Mrs. Flood — clad in white and carrying a white parasol and travel bag — observed to the camera from a rooftop, “What a very happy ending for little Ruby Sunday. But life goes on, doesn’t it, ruthlessly. And what happens, you might wonder, to that mysterious traveler in time and space known as the Doctor? “I’m sorry to say, his story ends in absolute terror,” the woman grinned, before bidding us, “Night-night!” TVLine readers gave Doctor Who Season 14 (or, “Season 1” if you’re Disney+) an average grade of “B-.” Russell T Davies serves as showrunner for Doctor Who, and executive-produces with Joel Collins, Phil Collinson, Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter.
