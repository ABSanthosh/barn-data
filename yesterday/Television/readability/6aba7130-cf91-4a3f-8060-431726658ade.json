  "text": "Wayne Northrop, Days of Our Lives and Dynasty Vet, Dead at 77Actor Wayne Northrop, who starred in Days of Our Lives and Dynasty, has died. He was 77. Northrop’s publicist confirmed to TVLine that the actor died at the Motion Picture and Television Woodland Hills Home on Friday. Our sister site Deadline was the first to report the news. “Wayne was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s six years ago,” Lynn Herring Northrop, Northrop’s wife and General Hospital actor, said in a statement. “He took his last breath in the arms of his family. We wish to thank the most caring and amazing place, The Motion Picture and Television Home for taking such great care of him. Wayne touched so many people with his sense of humor and wit. A husband for 43 years, the best dad ever to his two boys, Hank and Grady, and a rancher who loved his cows and was a friend to many.” Northrop originated the role of Roman Brady, Deidre Hall’s on-screen husband, in NBC‘s Days of Our Lives. He played the part from 1981 to 1984, and again from 1991 to 1994. His passing comes nine weeks after the death of Days’ Drake Hogestyn, who played John Black, the character who was at first believed to be Roman with brainwashing and plastic surgery. Northrop was recast in the soap in 2005 as Dr. Alex North, using recut scenes from his time as Roman to explain his new character’s backstory. The actor was also known for playing Michael Culhane, Blake Carrington’s (John Forsythe) chauffeur, in ABC’s Dynasty from 1981 to 1987. He also starred as Rex Stanton in ABC’s General Hospital spinoff Port Charles. In addition to his work on soaps, Northrop appeared in L.A. Law, Cold Case, Hotel and Eight Is Enough.",
