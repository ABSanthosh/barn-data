Here’s everything you need to know about streaming the buzzy, Ralph Fiennes-led thriller online. Conclave, the religious thriller that has garnered plenty of awards-season buzz, lands on Peacock on Friday, Dec. 13.

According to the official synopsis, the film “follows one of the world’s most secretive and ancient events – selecting the new Pope. Cardinal Lawrence (played by Fiennes) is tasked with running this covert process after the unexpected death of the beloved Pope. Once the Catholic Church’s most powerful leaders have gathered from around the world and are locked together in the Vatican halls, Lawrence uncovers a trail of deep secrets left in the dead Pope’s wake, secrets which could shake the foundations of the Church.” In addition to Fiennes, Conclave stars Stanley Tucci, John Lithgow, Carlos Diehz, Lucian Msamati, Brían F. O’Byrne, Merab Ninidze, Sergio Castellitto and Isabella Rossellini. Watch Conclave Trailer: (If you sign up for a service through our links, TVLine may earn a commission.)",
