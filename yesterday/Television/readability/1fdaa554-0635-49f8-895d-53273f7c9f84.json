The Golden Globe Award-nominated drama stars fellow nominee Eddie Redmayne as the Jackal, “an unrivaled and highly elusive lone assassin [who] makes his living carrying out hits for the highest fee,” reads the official synopsis. “But following his latest kill, he meets his match in a tenacious British intelligence officer (No Time to Die’s Lashana Lynch) who starts to track down the Jackal in a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase across Europe, leaving destruction in its wake.” The supporting cast includes Úrsula Corberó (Money Heist) as the Jackal’s wife Nuria, along with Game of Thrones vets Charles Dance and Richard Dormer and The Crown‘s Khalid Abdalla. Ronan Bennett (Top Boy) serves as writer and executive producer on the series, based on the classic Frederick Forsyth novel that inspired a number of film adaptations. All 10 episodes of The Day of the Jackal Season 1 are currently available to stream on Peacock. The series has already been renewed for a second season. Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * The Amazon Freevee comedy Dinner With the Parents, a remake of the British series Friday Night Dinner, has been cancelled after one season, our sister site Deadline reports.
