Get your ugly Christmas sweater on because it’s a special Elsbeth holiday episode. You may have to watch the promo for “Gold, Frankincense, and Murder” to understand the reference above. Don’t worry because we are going to unpack what could be the campiest episode of the season. That being said, Elsbeth has enough quirkiness for two shows. Couple that with some holiday cheer, and you have some certified yuletide mayhem. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) It may be the happiest time of the year, but let’s not forget the crowds, alcohol consumption, desperation, gift-giving pressure, emotional instability, and homes left vacant. This is a tough time of year for many people, and someone always snaps. So, let’s all be thankful for shows like Elsbeth that keep us laughing through the good and bad times. Username or Email AddressPassword It’s The Happiest Time Of The Year On Elsbeth Unless You’re Detective Donnelly The Elsbeth Season 2 Episode 6 promo kicks things off with the jolliest guy in the North Pole dead as a doornail. Someone should let Mrs. Claus know she has to take care of the reindeer now. Well, it wouldn’t be Elsbeth if someone didn’t drop dead. At the start of the promo, the titular character can be heard saying, “Oh, my gosh. Is that Santa?” as the covered body is wheeled out. Sure, a dead Santa means there is murder afoot, but the most exciting thing about that part of the trailer is that you can see a certain blonde detective on the case. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) That’s right, Molly Price’s (And Just Like That…) Detective Donnelly is back with all her glorious dry humor and perfectly timed quips dipped in cynicism and general crankiness. Donelly is a vibe. Who else could sum up a murder with just the right amount of New York sarcasm when the investigator says, “Classic Christmas light string shock and ladder fall resulting in a reindeer antler impalement.” Can you imagine the character giving a eulogy? Her deadpan humor perfectly complements Elsbeth’s over-the-top nature. I think it’s safe to say that Donnelly has been featured more than any other supporting character detective. She was just seen playing poker with the team in Elsbeth Season 2 Episode 5. Donnelly isn’t the only familiar face gracing the screen in “Gold, Frankincense, and Murder.” Fans of Saturday Night Live are in store for an early Christmas treat wrapped in homicide. Elsbeth Is Giving Viewers The Treat Of An SNL Alum Wrapped In Homicide (Michael Parmelee/CBS) There are certain actors that you will recognize immediately for specific talents, like Morgan Freeman’s voice. There are specific key identifiers that surge through your memory reserves and light up your synapses to recognize that person. In the case of Vaness Bayer, it’s that big, beautiful smile of hers that makes you want to crack up laughing. After doing almost one hundred and fifty episodes on SNL, this lady knows how to make viewers laugh. While many of her characters from the late-night live sketch comedy variety show are iconic, the actor has paved her way to a solid film and television career. If you love comedy that dips into absurd humor with vampires, you must see Bayer as Evie Russell, an emotional vampire on What We Do In The Shadows. The woman is hilarious. Listen, Vanessa knows how to turn her strengths into a career. So, while finding her in a serious dramatic role may be challenging, her comedic roles are practically endless. When you’re done laughing your butt off at Bayer on Elsbeth, you can watch her continue to deliver laughs on other shows like Barry and Brooklyn Nine-Nine. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Who Had Impalement By Reindeer Antlers On Their Murder Bingo Card? The official synopsis for Elsbeth Season 1 Episode 6 reads: “Celebrity Christmas curators Dirk and DeeDee Dashers (Vanessa Bayer) go from tinsel to tragedy after Dirk is killed in a freak accident. “Elsbeth begins to suspect his wife is behind the murder. Meanwhile, Elsbeth (Carrie Preston) gets a holiday surprise courtesy of Wagner and Kaya.” Correct me if I’m wrong, but isn’t it always the spouse? This feels like an open-and-shut case, which means the writers likely filled this episode with enough camp and quirk to last till New Year. What other show can serve up a homicidal killer decked out in holiday attire named DeeDee? Elsbeth always does right by its audience. The means of murder alone is a treat. Who had impalement by reindeer antlers on their murder bingo card? No one? (Michael Parmelee/CBS) Funnily enough, there has yet to be an impalement on the series, but the writers saw their opportunity to make the holiday season a little redder. However, the real mystery is at the end of the description of “Gold, Frankincense, and Murder.” What could Officer Kaya and Captain Wagner be up to? Enjoy The Holidays Now, Elsbeth, Because Winter Is, Technically, Here, But Also Still Coming Let me get this out of the way right now. What I’m hoping for with every fiber of my being is that Kaya and Wagner are about to play matchmaker for Elsbeth. Many viewers, myself included, had such high hopes during Elsbeth Season 2 Episode 2 when Fire Marshall Jake entered our and Elsbeth’s world. That tall drink of water took one look at Elsbeth and had her fumbling with her consonants. That’s my Christmas wish for Elsbeth. That she has a reason to stand under the mistletoe. (Michael Parmelee/CBS) At the very least, we know it has nothing to do with the Chicago case that Elsbeth seems to be caught up in. In “Elsbeth Flips the Bird,” we met the soon-to-be ex-wife caught up in a rather heated and publicized divorce. There hasn’t been much traction on the case in the show. The only other episode that dealt with this scandal was “The Wrong Stuff,” when Christian Borle’s Carter Schmidt came over from The Good Wife to deliver the news to Elsbeth in person. Hopefully, the series will pick up the pace on Elsbeth’s lawyer past before it goes on a break until after New Year’s. However, I have to say that I don’t think anyone is in a hurry to see Elsbeth separate from her New York team/family to go back to Chicago and deal with a job that won’t seem to let her go. Still, whatever happens, you know Elsbeth will handle it with her indestructible positivity and big heart for helping innocent people. And still, watch how her son doesn’t call her for Christmas.
