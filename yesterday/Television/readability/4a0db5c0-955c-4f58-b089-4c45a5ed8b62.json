  "text": "The Star Wars franchise may have found its new showrunner in a Lost alum — and a new TV show might not be so far, far away. A new Star Wars series is in the works from Lost executive producer Carlton Cuse, our sister site Variety confirms. (The InSneider first reported the news.) Cuse is joined on the new series by his son Nick Cuse, whose credits include Watchmen, Station Eleven and Masters of the Air. Beyond that, no details on the series have been revealed. Carlton Cuse served as co-showrunner of ABC’s long-running drama Lost along with Damon Lindelof. (Lost co-creator J.J. Abrams went on to co-write and direct two Star Wars films: 2015’s The Force Awakens and 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker.) Cuse also served as showrunner on the A\u0026E series Bates Motel, which wrapped up a five-season run in 2017, as well as FX’s The Strain, which ran for four seasons. His other TV credits include Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, Locke \u0026 Key and Netflix’s new medical drama Pulse. The new series would join several in the Star Wars franchise, with Andor returning for its second and final season on Disney+ this week. Ahsoka is set to return for a second season as well — with Hayden Christensen reprising his role as Anakin Skywalker — and The Mandalorian is moving to the big screen with The Mandalorian \u0026 Grogu, arriving in theaters next year.
