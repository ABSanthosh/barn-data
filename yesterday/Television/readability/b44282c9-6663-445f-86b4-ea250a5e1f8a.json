  "text": "The following contains spoilers from the premiere of Prime Video‘s Alex Cross TV series, which is now streaming all eight Season 1 episodes. Cross, Prime Video’s adaptation of James Patterson’s Alex Cross novels, wasted not much time in letting viewers in on the identity of the serial killer who would come to vex the titular D.C. police detective (played by Aldis Hodge) and his partner John Sampson (Isaiah Mustafa). The series premiere at first only showed us glimpses of a shadowy figure torturing a kidnapped victim, on his way to transforming said captive into a facsimile of a famous serial killer. And at episode’s end, it became clear that Ed Ramsey, a mover and shaker in D.C.’s elite social and political circles, is in fact The Fanboy out to create a series of tributes to like-minded killers. Ryan Eggold as Ed Ramsey, Aldis Hodge as Alex Cross (Keri Anderson/Prime Video) Cross showrunner Ben Watkins told TVLine that his aim in conceiving The Fanboy for this original story not based on any Patterson novel was to pivot away from the stereotype that has prevailed since Silence of the Lambs‘ Hannibal Lecter. “A lot of it has to do with who we cast to play Ed Ramsey,” Watkins said of actor Ryan Eggold, best known to TV viewers for his roles on The Blacklist and New Amsterdam. “I wanted to do a serial killer that was younger, more charismatic, more seductive, more physical,” Watkins explains. “I felt like that was something that wasn’t as done, and would surprise people.” In casting a younger, handsome actor such as Eggold, “every now and then you could find yourself engaging with this character and realizing how easy it would be for them to lure you into their trap,” Watkins says. But what you also gain, says the EP, “is you can see them going head-to-head with Alex Cross and perhaps having the upper hand, and that makes for a great show.” How are you enjoying Cross thus far, and Eggold’s role as the Fanboy killer?
