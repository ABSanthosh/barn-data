Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 10-21-24 promise to continue where they left off, with Steve telling Chad who she really is now that he’s saved Chad from Mark Greene. For once, it doesn’t stop there. Instead of dragging things out for months, Days of Our Lives will reveal who the phony woman is by the end of Monday’s episode. (Peacock/Screenshot) Many Fans Guessed It Was Something Like This, But The News Is Still Shocking Fake Abigail has been wandering around Salem without a name for a while, which is ridiculous, but many fans figured out she has something to do with Konstantin. It’s the only thing that makes sense. During John Black’s final storyline before Drake Hogestyn passed away, John was kidnapped from Katerina’s grave and tied up in Fake Abigail’s apartment. There’s no way the Fake Abigail storyline wasn’t related to Konstantin’s eternal anger that John killed his daughter, not with John being dragged into this mess. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 10-21-24 confirm this theory. In a plot twist that is likely not much of a surprise to many people, Fake Abigail will be revealed to be Cat Green — the “late” Katerina’s daughter, and her mother is still alive. (Peacock/Screenshot) Drake Hogestyn’s Death Makes This Reveal Underwhelming Hogestyn was too ill to film the end of this story, so John Black will never learn that he didn’t kill Katerina, at least not on screen. His confusion, relief, and anger that Konstantin let him take the blame for a crime that didn’t happen will have to be told secondhand, if at all. That sucks, and it doesn’t help that this story has a made-up-as-it-went-along feeling to it. There were few clues that “Abigail” was related to Katerina other than John’s random involvement in the story, so the plot twist falls flat. (Peacock/Screenshot) It’s hard to see what the point is now that John won’t get to experience the revelation that he never killed Konstantin’s daughter. The Deverauxes Need To Hurry Home To Make This Reveal Worth It According to Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 10-21-24, Chad will be reeling from this revelation, but that’s not enough. Everyone who loved him presented ten million red flags, but Chad didn’t want to see them because he wanted his wife back so badly. I get that, yet his gullibility makes it hard to be sympathetic. His wife was needlessly killed, but that doesn’t mean he should have given in to the fantasy that she could return when he knows Clyde is a liar. (Peacock/Screenshot) JJ is in Paris for the big reveal, though, and his parents really should come too. There are no specific Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 10-21-24 suggesting that Jack and Jennifer will be back, though we know Melissa Reeves is headed to Salem in about a month for Doug’s funeral and Thanksgiving. Still, they should come NOW. Kayla was right that this was an incredibly cruel scam, especially for Abigail’s parents. Also, Jennifer should have some choice words for everyone who pretty much kicked her out because she wouldn’t believe that this woman was her daughter. Yes, coming back from the dead is an overused plot device in Salem, but still. Jennifer was right and no one listened to her, and people should be held accountable for that. Plus, we need Jack’s meltdown over learning his daughter is still dead to be on-screen. Kayla said he would be crushed, and Matthew Ashford is a powerhouse who can bring that raw emotion, so let’s have it. (Peacock/Screenshot) Unfortunately, Days of Our Lives Spoilers for The Week of 10-21-24 Promise More Body \u0026 Soul Silliness I hate the Body \u0026 Soul stuff as much as I love the aftermath of big reveals like Fake Abigail and Fiona being the one who ran Sarah over. Sadly, the writers seem to love this ridiculous meta storyline, and it’s going into even more ridiculous territory now. Leo thinks Hattie’s curse is ruining the show and putting it in danger of cancellation. That’s not only a stupid story, but it’s a repeat of an equally ridiculous one in which Will developed a brain tumor after Leo claimed to have given him the evil eye. (Peacock/Screenshot) There’s also more of this contrived love triangle with Johnny, Chanel, and Alex. In a way, I can’t blame Johnny for being jealous. Chanel took forever deciding if she wanted him or Allie, and after she chose Allie, Wendy took forever deciding if she wanted Johnny or Tripp. The dude has never had a woman who was unconflicted about being with him. Still, the way this is being handled is ridiculous. Chanel is married to Johnny and has made it clear that she is not interested in anyone else, so there was no reason for any of this in the first place. Johnny is wrong about who slept with Alex, and Chanel can easily prove she was already in the real hospital when that went down, except Johnny isn’t telling her what he’s upset about. Chanel isn’t helping anything by sneaking around with Alex to throw Johnny a surprise birthday party. Why in the world is she going to Alex instead of Paulina with these plans, other than this stupid plot? (Peacock/Screenshot) At least Johnny’s whining gets Marlena’s attention. If that doesn’t stop Johnny in his tracks, perhaps Leo complaining to Paulina that someone had sex on the set will bring the truth to the surface, though I doubt it. Now Stephanie is likely to keep her tryst with Alex secret so that she doesn’t get in trouble with Paulina, which gives Johnny more time to convince himself that Chanel is cheating on him. The sooner this stupid story ends, the better. Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 10-21-24 Offer A Few Things On The Brady/Kristen Front Brady doesn’t want anything to do with Kristen and her stupid schemes, but we know that’s not going to last. (Peacock/Screenshot) It never does. One of Brady’s mental health issues is that he’s as addicted to troublemakers as he is to drugs. Fiona is the third woman he’s told in as many months that he thought she was a better person than she was and that he never wants to see her again. Kristen’s up to her old tricks, too. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 10-21-24 say she isn’t satisfied with Brady finally being released from prison and has another demand before she releases the experimental medication that will cure Sarah’s paralysis. (Peacock/Screenshot) No wonder Marlena is worried. These things almost always end with Brady and Kristen back together — and with someone near death because Kristen didn’t give them what they needed until it was almost too late. Involving Xander in her scheme to get Brady off the hook didn’t work, and now that Brady is free, Kristen wants Xander’s company. Xander should know better than to listen to her. If he does, she’ll move the goalposts again, and there’s no telling when he’ll actually get that serum, if ever. Besides, I’d prefer a story about Sarah learning to live happily despite her disability than one involving a magic cure. Not only is this a tired TV trope at this point, but it sends a negative message about disability that contradicts everything Maggie keeps saying about how Sarah can live a full, happy life as a wheelchair-bound person.
