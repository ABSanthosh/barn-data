  "text": "Ugh. Let’s pray that Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-27-25 aren’t exactly how they sound. There are several spoilers about people waking up shocked at who their bed partner is, needing to make confessions, or being forced to keep secrets. That sounds like it could be another story where everyone is drugged and doesn’t know what they’re doing. (Peacock/Sceenshot) Days Of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 1-27-25 Leave Me Concerned About Chanel The worst of these spoilers is that Chanel is shocked to wake up in Shawn’s bed. This is a terrible idea for several reasons. First of all, one of the reasons Belle is mad at Shawn is that he slept with Talia after a drunken night. If it even looks like he’s done the same with Chanel, Belle will go ballistic even though she and Shawn are not together. (Peacock/Sceenshot) I’ve had more than enough of this split for the sake of drama between these two. Days of Our Lives doesn’t need to make it worse with this nonsense. (However, another spoiler says Marlena will walk in on Belle and EJ together, so Belle will have less of a leg to stand on here.) Even more importantly: drugging people against their will is not cool, and it brings up all sorts of consent issues that Days of Our Lives doesn’t want to touch. Whenever they do this, they follow it up by calling drug-facilitated sexual assault “cheating” and blaming the victims. So let’s hope they don’t go there. I suppose if both Shawn and Chanel are high or drunk, they’re equally unable to consent, but that’s not exactly great either, even if it’s not as bad as one person taking advantage of the other. The show that once shook up daytime TV by being the first to suggest marital rape is a thing needs to get its act together with these kinds of stories.  (Peacock/Sceenshot) It’s bad enough that half the fandom doesn’t believe that a professor in charge of Chanel’s grades sleeping with her is anything but a purely consensual act without putting her through this again. I can also predict how this will go. Chanel will wake up in Shawn’s bed, assume she slept with him, and think about forgiving Johnny since they both slept with other people. Double ugh. As much as I want Johnny and Chanel back together, I don’t want it to be because of this kind of nonsense. Who Is Causing Trouble Now — EJ Or The Mystery Stalker? According to Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-27-25, there are several people who have strange nights due to whatever this is that’s going on. (Peacock/Sceenshot) If it were only Chanel who was affected, I’d think that this is more Body \u0026 Soul nonsense. However, Jada will have something to confess after her bachelorette party, and JJ is standoffish with Gabi. Plus, Belle sleeps with EJ. All of this points to the drugging, or whatever it is that happens, being part of EJ and Arnold’s plan to discredit Jada. Hopefully, EJ isn’t the one supplying mind-altering drugs or tainting people’s food or drink. It’s bad enough that he wants to ruin Jada’s life without doing the same thing to Belle he did to Sami! However, there is another wrinkle in this plan. “Rafe” (really Arnold) tells Javi to keep his mouth shut about something, which means Javi has to keep a secret from Leo. (Peacock/Sceenshot) I wonder if it has to do with why everyone is sleeping with the wrong person.  I also wonder if Javi ends up sleeping with Kerry while this is going on. That would be another low point, but I wouldn’t put it past Days Of Our Lives to go there. EJ And Arnold’s Ridiculous Plan Should Backfire, But Will It? I don’t understand why EJ thinks anyone would believe that Jada’s fiance would report her for misconduct, take her job, and demand the mayor rehire EJ. If this were anywhere but Salem, the plan would backfire, making the whole town realize Rafe has been replaced by an imposter. However, Salem residents often become stupid when the plot demands it, so EJ could get away with this… except for one thing: Rafe is going to escape his bonds. (Peacock/Sceenshot) According to Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-27-25, Rafe will escape just in time for his wedding. I predicted this as soon as the story began. It’s a bit of a tired TV trope, but Days of Our Lives does wedding derailments better than almost anybody. Rafe will probably run in just as Jada and Arnold are saying their “I Dos” and say he’s the real Rafe. This might be fun, or it might be stupid, but either way, I’m all for it. Anything to end this stupid Fake Rafe storyline. How Evil Is The Woman In White? The other big story, of course, is the Rachel Black disappearance story. Rachel met a mysterious woman calling herself The Woman In White — a name that longtime fans know belongs to her grandmother. (Peacock/Sceenshot) Kristen spoke in glowing terms of her mother on Friday’s episode and said she had named Rachel after her in the hopes that her daughter would grow up to be a good person and not do the impulsive and reckless things Kristen does.   However, the Woman In White is, ironically, a decidedly gray character. During her original run, she tried to kill Jennifer a few times before changing her mind, so it’s not surprising that she encouraged Rachel to permanently get rid of Ava. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 1-27-25 say that Rachel and the Woman In White will make a deal. I’m not sure what that means, but it probably won’t be anything good. Brady is worried about Ava after being unable to reach her, but are we going to trade the Fake Rafe story for a long Ava Is Missing story? Hopefully, the Woman In White will have another attack of conscience like she did when Jennifer fell in a hole, but there’s no guarantees. (Peacock/Sceenshot) Other Random Spoilers JJ is reluctant with Gabi. Hopefully, this distancing isn’t yet another story where Gabi thinks JJ cheated on her. I also hope that JJ isn’t deciding to distance himself because Julie’s mental health is poor after Doug’s death and she doesn’t like Gabi. Sophia makes a shocking suggestion. I really want her to decide to emancipate herself, but I’m afraid she’ll decide to go ahead with marrying Tate so that her mother can’t control her anymore.  Over to you, Days of Our Lives fanatics.
