Hours ahead of the 67th annual Grammys on Sunday (CBS, 8/7c), the Recording Academy is kicking off the festivities with a Premiere Ceremony, where the majority of this year’s 94 awards will be handed out. And you can watch a livestream of the star-studded event right here, beginning at 3:30/2:30c. The Premiere Ceremony will also feature performances by blues rocker Joe Bonamassa; opera divas Joyce DiDonato and Renée Fleming; Broadway legend Kelli O’Hara; banjo virtuoso Béla Fleck; R\u0026B singer Muni Long; and massive team-up from the voices of Yolanda Adams, Wayne Brady, Deborah Cox, Scott Hoying, Angélique Kidjo and Taj Mahal. Beyoncé leads the 2025 Grammys pack with 11 nominations, including Album of the Year, which she has previously lost four times; followed by Charli XCX and Post Malone with eight; Billie Eilish and Kendrick Lamar with seven; and Jack Antonoff, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Taylor Swift with six. Hosted by Grammys staple Trevor Noah, this year’s main ceremony is being held at Los Angeles’ Crypto.com Arena, where some of the biggest names in music will take the stage. In addition to presenting and performing, those celebs will also help the Recording Academy raise money to “support wildfire relief efforts and honor the bravery and dedication of first responders who risk their lives” in the recent L.A. fires. Hit PLAY on the video above to watch a livestream of the 2025 Grammys Premiere Ceremony, then drop a comment with your hopes for this year’s Grammy Awards. Who are you rooting for?",
