  "text": "CSI: Vegas vet Matt Lauria is getting a badge for his next role: The actor will star opposite Morena Baccarin in the Fire Country spinoff Sheriff Country, our sister site Deadline reports. Lauria’s Boone is the smart and capable chief deputy and right-hand man to Baccarin’s Sheriff Mickey Fox. After being partnered for years, the pair have a great shorthand and deep respect for each other. But there is also a note of tension between them because Boone feels that he was passed over for the sheriff position. Filming in Toronto and premiering this fall, Sheriff Country stars Baccarin as straight-shooting sheriff Mickey Fox — the stepsister of Fire Country‘s Sharon Leone — who investigates criminal activity as she patrols the streets of small-town Edgewater while contending with her ex-con father (Deadwood‘s W. Earl Brown) and a mysterious incident involving her wayward daughter.  The cast also includes Christopher Gorham (Covert Affairs) as Mickey’s lawyer ex-husband and Michele Weaver (Love Is_, Council of Dads) as a deputy in the Edgewater County Sheriff’s Department. In other recent casting news… * Grammy Award-winning country singer Gretchen Wilson has joined CBS’ music competition series The Road as “tour manager,” providing support and guidance to the emerging musicians while they make their way across America. * Gerald McRaney (This Is Us) has boarded Hulu’s Murdaugh Murders limited series as patriarch Randolph Murdaugh, our sister site Variety reports.
