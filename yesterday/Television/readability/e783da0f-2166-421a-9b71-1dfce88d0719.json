  "text": "Who would’ve thought that Dexter Morgan could be a social butterfly? In Episode 4 of Dexter: Resurrection, Dexter infiltrates a luxurious dinner party while under cover as Ronald “Red” Schmidt, aka the Dark Passenger. After being picked up by Uma Thurman’s Charley, he arrives at the beautiful estate of Leon Prater (Peter Dinklage), a man who’s obsessed with serial killers, so much so that he collects their trophies and keeps them in his museum-like corridor. Prater has pieces like John Wayne Gacy’s clown costume, Jeffrey Dahmer’s bloody fridge, Charles Manson’s guitar, and even more notably, the Trinity Killer’s hammer and the Bay Harbor Butcher’s blood slides. Shortly after, Dexter is introduced to four other killers just like him. There’s Mia/Lady Vengeance (Krysten Ritter); Lowell/The Tattoo Collector (Neil Patrick Harris); Al/Rapunzel (Eric Stonestreet); and Gareth/The Gemini Killer (David Dastmalchian). That’s a lot of killers all in one place! “It’s unbelievable,” Michael C. Hall tells TVLine in the video above, referencing the eye-opening soirée Dexter attends. “As an actor, I felt like, ‘What just happened? Did Dexter get transported into some twisted serial killer superhero movie?’ But I think that’s how he’s feeling too… We’ve set the show in an environment where that kind of thing feels almost plausible. That someone [like Prater] with that sort of fetishistic, crazy mindset and unlimited funds might try to pull something like that off.” While each of the killers in attendance is intriguing in his or her own way, Dexter is drawn to Lady Vengeance, a woman who hunts down sexual predators. Dexter immediately wonders whether she has a code of her own. A code that is, perhaps, just like his. “She’s very intrigued by him,” says Ritter about Mia’s instant connection to Dexter. “She’s incredulous of all of the serial killers and she wants to know more. I think she finds him attractive and that’s the first way in. And Dexter thinks that she has a code, [so] they kind of hit it off.” During dinner, Lowell makes known his plans for his next victim, a woman who’s getting a tattoo of a French bulldog. So while there does seem to be some sort of future for Dexter and Mia, Lowell has another thing coming. Dexter drugs the guy just as Lowell’s about to take down his vic. Dex then drags him to a local tattoo parlor and straps him to a table with his signature plastic wrap. And just before he stabs Lowell in the chest to watch him bleed out, he reveals his true identity. “I’m Dexter Morgan. The Bay Harbor Butcher.” Lowell’s eyes go wide because he knows exactly what that means. His killing days are done. One down, three to go?
