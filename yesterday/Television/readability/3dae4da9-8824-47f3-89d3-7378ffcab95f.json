  "text": "Emmy winner Holland Taylor has boarded the cast of the Apple TV+ comedy that was announced nearly two years ago and will reunite True Detective Season 1 stars Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson. The as-yet-untitled, 10-episode, half-hour comedy series stars Harrelson and McConaughey in a “heartfelt odd couple love story” revolving around the actors’ strange and beautiful bond. Matthew and Woody, playing heightened versions of themselves, find their friendship tested when their combined families attempt to live together on the former’s ranch in Texas. Taylor will play Ma Mac, Matthew’s mother. Emmy winner David West Read (Schitt’s Creek) will serve as showrunner on the Apple TV+ series and executive-producer with McConaughey, Harrelson, David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, Matt Thunell, Bill Bost and Jeremy Plager. An Emmy winner for her performance as Judge Roberta Kittleson on ABC’s The Practice, Taylor’s many other TV credits include Two and Half Men, The Morning Show, Billions, Bosom Buddies, Mr. Mercedes and (deep cut alert!) The Powers That Be.",
