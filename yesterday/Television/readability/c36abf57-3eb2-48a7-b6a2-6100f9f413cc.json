  "text": "Prime Video is moving out of the Steel City, cancelling the comedy The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh after just one season, our sister site Deadline reports. The series — which was one of TVLine’s Hidden Gems You May Have Missed from last year’s TV — starred Naveen Andrews (Lost) and stand-up comic Sindhu Vee as the heads of the titular Pradeep family, whose move from India to the States leaves them in hot water with the authorities. “As told through hilarious (and often conflicting) flashbacks from an interrogation room, the Pradeeps quickly find themselves embroiled—romantically, personally, and professionally—with a polar-opposite neighborhood family, leading to a predicament with many surprising twists,” reads the official synopsis. The cast also included Sahana Srinivasan (as Bhanu Pradeep), Arjun Siriam (Kamal Pradeep), Ashwin Sakthivel (Vinod Pradeep), Ethan Suplee (Jimbo Mills), Nicholas Hamilton (Stu Mills), Pete Holmes (Dark Suit) and Romy Rosemont (Light Suit). Additionally, Smash star Megan Hilty played Janice Mills, the Pradeeps’ Bible-thumping neighbor. The Pradeeps of Pittsburgh premiered in October 2024 on Amazon Freevee and was created by Vijal Patel, whose credits include Schooled and The Kids Are Alright. TVLine has reached out to Prime Video for confirmation. Were you a fan of The Pradeeps? Hit the comments to share your reactions to the cancellation news. When Is Your Favorite TV Show Back?
