  "text": "The big test day is almost here for Chicago Fire‘s Herrmann. During this Wednesday’s fall finale (airing at 9/8c on NBC), the firefighter prepares to take the exam to become a captain — and this time, he won’t bail on it. “He’s going to go to it, and he will not be alone because we have Mouch gearing up for another huge life change” as he takes on the lieutenant’s test, David Eigenberg, who plays Herrmann, tells TVLine. Should Herrmann pass and eventually become Firehouse 51’s chief, as Boden (former series regular Eamonn Walker) told him he hoped he would one day, the move to a leadership position would actually take Herrmann away from the action. “When you take on an officer’s advancement, you step further away from the actual fire, but you also take on the responsibility of the lives,” Eigenberg notes. “That’s a hard thing to do to worry about being responsible for people and also stepping away from the old life. And I think Hermann is ready for it, and we’ll see how that unfolds in the step towards chief.” Unfortunately, at this point, Boden has yet to return to help Herrmann through this next part in his career, Eigenberg says. Instead, the firefighter is turning to his buddy Mouch as the two go through this process together. But is there even space for Herrmann to move up the ranks at 51? Dermot Mulroney’s Chief Dom Pascal is currently filling Boden’s former role at the firehouse, and Eigenberg isn’t eager to replace him. “Dermot’s been such a wonderful addition. I’m very torn,” the actor says. “I honestly don’t know what they’re going to do, and I can say that I don’t want him to go.” “And then I have weird guilt about Eamonn,” Eigenberg adds. “I’m very close to Eamonn. He came back from London for a few days, and he’s been staying with us… I love the man dearly, and I love that character. And then when I, sometimes, say I really like Dermot, I feel weird.” Fire fans, what are you hoping happens with the chief position? Hit the comments!",
