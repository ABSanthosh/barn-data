  "text": "Critic's Rating: 3.5 / 5.03.5 It wouldn’t be The Cleaning Lady without Thony being unnecessarily thrown through the wringer. It’s hard to believe that The Cleaning Lady Season 4 started with so much promise for her future, only for it all to be whisked away from her when she least expected it. Yes, she’s moving on with her life, but there are hurdles around every corner, proving once again that she probably won’t get much of a break until the series finale. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) The Cleaning Lady Season 4 Episode 2 continued the trend of giving Thony something she’s always wanted, making it one of the most pitiful experiences of her life. Thony has wanted to have a residency and be on the way to becoming a full-fledged doctor whose skills are recognized in the U.S. since The Cleaning Lady Season 1. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) Thanks to the various things that have kept her away from it, she likely thought the day would never come that she would get close to it again. It’s a real shame that she’s been handed this opportunity, but she has to be at Jorge and Cartel’s beck and call whenever the pager goes off. Are Jorge and Thony on a Collision Course? She’s damned if she answers the pager and damned if she doesn’t because she’ll either be pissing Jorge off or Dr. Dupont whatever of the decisions she chooses. The saddest part is that Jorge was indebted to Thony after she saved his life on The Cleaning Lady, Season 4 Episode 1. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) Indeed, he was well aware that her work in the hospital would have to take priority over her commitments as a cartel doctor. How is she supposed to make a lasting impression on her fellow staff and the patients if she splits whenever the pager goes off? It’s nonsensical, and it’s a crap on Jorge’s part to put her in that position in the first place. They’ve had their ups and downs, but are on the same page for the first time and could carve out a decent working relationship. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) But Thony knows what she wants and isn’t afraid to get crafty to get it, and that’s why I firmly believe she’ll pull something when they catch up to the man who shot at them. Jorge clearly articulated that he wants her to keep the man alive, which means we’re probably in for some good old bargaining in the next episode. Can The Cleaning Lady Season 4 Keep Up the Pace? The big problem is that Jorge will probably do something to get back at Thony when he unravels the truth about Benny’s escape from the horrifying conditions in the desert. Thony toyed with the idea of saving Benny, but I don’t think she expected him to be more cunning and to find a way into her car. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) But when she was presented with his pleas for help, it resonated because she was vocal to Fiona about trying to do some good with her new job. Thony is between a rock and a hard place because her instinct is to help people, even if it puts her in the crosshairs of those who employ her. Jorge isn’t going to take too kindly to hearing what Feng has to say about Thony’s actions, but the former cleaning lady will probably devise a foolproof way to explain it away. Jorge has a weakness for Thony, not quite as strong as Arman’s, but it’s growing. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) Thony’s arc in the upcoming episodes should be interesting because she’s pulled between two worlds. I expect her to work with Benny to free the other undocumented immigrants from Feng’s reign of terror. Benny was an absolute ray of light and made quite the impression on Thony and Fiona, so I hope he somehow becomes a mainstay on the show. Benny Should Stick Around for the Rest of the Season There’s a lot of potential with the character. Away from the outside world, Ramona continued to try to wheel and deal from the confines of her prison. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) Sadly, the storyline is already falling apart. I know you have to suspend your disbelief with some aspects of The Cleaning Lady, but there’s no way that other people wouldn’t say who Ramona is in prison. It’s a shame because the writing in the other storylines has improved this season. It’s ridiculous to think that someone else hasn’t figured out who she is and sounded the alarm. Of course, her aim is to find a way to rise through the prison ranks, and a surefire way to do that is to get close to the inmate who is giving her all the attention. Ramona has been known to get herself out of the stickiest of situations, but something tells me she’ll be the next surprise death because there’s no viable direction for her storyline to go next. (Jeff Neumann/FOX) The prison arc is already wearing thin, and unless there’s a massive heel turn in the coming episodes, she needs to be found out or make a great escape. The Cleaning Lady Season 4 is still a drastic improvement from its last effort, but there are still some issues, so I hope the series can iron them out because this very well could be the series’ last hurrah. What are your thoughts on the episode, The Cleaning Lady Fanatics? Do you think Thony’s being offered good things but not the right tools to make them worth her time? (Jeff Neumann/FOX) What’s your take on Benny? Do you think he has staying power? Are you as frustrated with Ramona’s trip to prison as I am? Hit the comments.
