Alas, it’s a better time to be a Lifetime Fanatic, especially when you’re fond of those addictive flicks inspired by true stories. This Spring, Lifetime is getting the ball rolling with a beloved Lucifer alum, D.B. Woodside, an Empire couple, and Lifetime Queens Keshia Knight-Pulliam and Elisabeth Röhm. (David Brown) We’ve soared past Lifetime’s Christmas films and the musical era that marked the return of a Mary J. Blige-inspired production. Lifetime returns to its roots with popcorn thrillers inspired by true events and starring some of our favorite television faces. First on the roster is the tall drink of water, D.B. Woodside, and this girl could not be more excited about him headling a Lifetime flick. The network does a phenomenal job of centering women, telling authentic, impactful stories, and creating this beautiful, creative space and network to tell stories that resonate with us. It’s a hallmark of the network, pardon the pun. But that’s not to say that some of Lifetime’s intriguing movies aren’t also led by men. (Ethan Browne) Who wasn’t obsessed with the entire slue of films that revolved around Eric Roberts’ dastardly doctor stalking more women than Joe Goldberg? They’re officially cult classics. However, we can expect something different when Lucifer’s Woodside stars in Taken at a Basketball Game. Oh, yes, another taken film, and no, we’re not talking about those Liam Neeson ones. Woodside will star as a father who will go to whatever lengths when he learns that someone abducted his daughter, Star Trek: Discovery‘s Claire Qute, at a basketball game. We’ve seen countless stories of fierce, protective, and relentless mothers searching for their children, but we’ll get the male perspective this time. (Kevin Estrada/FOX) In a paternal role, Woodside is always delightful. He had a nice run of it during 9-1-1: Lone Star before his character relocated. Taken at a Basketball Game will see Woodside playing a desperate father, Wayne Edwards, who is determined to bond with his estranged 18-year-old daughter. He opts for some daddy-daughter time in the form of tickets to see their favorite team play. Unfortunately, Robyn’s trip to the restroom results in every parent’s worst nightmare: abduction. The film will find Wayne racing against the clock in a stadium packed with thousands to find his daughter by any means necessary. If they were estranged before, they likely won’t be after Daddy saves the day! (Courtesy of Lifetime) The movie will premiere on March 15, so let’s hope this daddy-daughter duo can channel some Luck of the Irish to have a happy ending. But the thrills don’t end there as Elisabeth Rohm and Keshia Knight-Pulliam collaborate for a film inspired by a novel. Rohm (Family Pictures) will executive produce and direct Wife Stalker, which will star Pulliam. The film is based on Liv Constantine’s The Wife Stalker, and the series always does well with its book-to-movie adaptations. Another exciting development is that real-life married couple Grace and Traí Byers are starring in this one. (Michael Lavine/FOX) Typically, there’s something more irritating than cute about real-life partners who share some projects. I will not name names today. But the Byers will be the exception to the rule. Pulliam and Mr. Byers will star as married couple Joanna and Leo in a delightful twist. They appear to be the perfect couple with two kids, Evie (Alayna Bernard) and Aaron (AJ Bernard), and the ideal suburban life. (Courtesy of Lifetime) However, it doesn’t take much for someone to burst their bubble and expose all the cracks and messy bits. Piper (Mrs. Byers) is a newcomer in a town who owns a thriving wellness center, but she’s far from well when she turns her attention toward a married Leo. And Leo, well, he finds her allure irresistible and is willing to risk it all! Joanna won’t take her husband’s infidelity lying down (even if he probably is), and while she’s digging into the mystery of Piper’s life, she finds more than enough information about this Black Widow with ulterior motives. ( Mshon Pulliam) And Joanna refuses to allow her family to fall into Piper’s web! The Wife Stalker will premiere on March 29 on Lifetime at 8/7c. Now that we’ve spilled all the tea on these exciting new thrillers, we need something from you. Let us know below if you’ll be tuning in and if you would like us to cover them.
