  "text": "Stop me if you’ve heard this one before. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-24-25 suggest that fake Rafe will finally get busted (yay!), but not until Jada and Shawn take the next step in their new relationship. From the second the Rafe doppelganger broke Jada’s heart, I knew this love triangle was coming. Did you? (Peacock/Screenshot) Jada Moving On While Rafe Is Kidnapped Is A Classic Soap Trope It would be way too easy if Rafe escaped, came home, explained to Jada that he had been replaced by a doppelganger, and picked up the relationship where he left off. EJ and Fake Rafe did a ton of damage. Most of it shouldn’t have happened because their plan was so damn obvious, but it did, and it won’t be easy for Rafe to clean up their mess. Let’s be honest. It wouldn’t be Days of Our Lives if Jada hadn’t already moved on with someone new by the time Rafe came home. Still, could the writing team have telegraphed any louder that Shawn was the rebound guy? Shawn was there when Rafe broke Jada’s heart when she was dragged to the police station for questioning (again, despite very dubious evidence), and when she was tempted to drown her sorrows in alcohol. There was no way this would stay platonic, even if Jada did decide the time wasn’t right to kiss after Shawn took her home. (Peacock/Screenshot) It was especially unlikely to remain platonic after Shawn and Jada both realized that Belle and EJ are sleeping together. Shawn and Belle have only two modes: trying again to have a relationship or being separated and angry at each other for moving on. EJ and Belle’s relationship is ridiculous for many reasons. One of the worst is that Belle seems to have figured out that EJ did something shady to get rid of Jada and is gunning for Belle’s job, yet she keeps sleeping with him. She also gets super defensive if Shawn suggests that maybe that’s not a good idea. (Peacock/Screenshot) Neither Shawn nor Belle has actually moved on. Belle’s interest in EJ seems to be that it pisses Shawn off, while Shawn is mostly interested in ensuring Belle doesn’t get hurt. It’s The Beginning Of The End For Fake Rafe EJ’s plan will fall apart soon enough… hopefully. I don’t know what’s about to happen with that syringe full of memory-erasing serum that Rafe and EJ are fighting over. If this ends with Rafe not remembering who he is, I will be incredibly annoyed. That would be yet another way to prolong this stupid story, which needs to end as soon as humanly possible. (Peacock/Screenshot) I know that magical drugs are a thing that happens in Salem, but I’m so sick of it, especially as a deux es machina to get the bad guys out of trouble. Fortunately, the stars are aligning for Fake Rafe to get found out regardless of EJ and Kristen’s chemical manipulations. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-24-25 say that after Fake Rafe kicks Gabi out, she realizes he is not acting at all like the brother she knows and loves and asks Kayla for a DNA test. Of course, in Salem DNA tests are rarely right the first time, but it’s great that Gabi is getting the ball rolling. A spoiler for later in the week says Jada and Shawn arrest Rafe — but which Rafe? Please don’t tell me that the two Rafes have switched back! (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 2-24-25 Suggest That Kristen’s Plans Have Backfired Royally For once, Kristen didn’t set out to do the wrong thing, but her intentions don’t matter, given that she allowed Ava to remain at the mercy of Kristen’s mother. If Kristen had defied her mother and brought Ava home, she might actually have had another shot with Brady. He would have been wary, but part of him would have realized that Kristen sacrificed her relationship with the mother she thought was dead to bring the woman Brady loved home. Ironically, that act would have made Brady see Kristen differently and make it easier for him to fall for her again. Now, however, Brady knows everything — except that Kristen turned to Rolf to ensure Ava was permanently neutralized. She was too late to screw with Ava’s head, but that didn’t change the fact that she knew where Ava was and kept it from Brady. The only way out for Kristen is if she’s the one who gets jabbed with the memory loss drug and forgets that she knew what her mother had done — and even then, Brady won’t believe her. (Peacock/Screenshot) Of course, there is another wild card here: Ava herself. Even before this ridiculous ordeal, Ava considered ending things with Brady because his daughter didn’t like it. I hate this idea. An eight-year-old who wishes her parents were still together should not get to decide whether her father moves on. However, Brady attributes Rachel’s criminal and out-of-control behavior to mental health issues. Additionally, he’s been put on notice that if Rachel continues to engage in criminal activity, Child Protective Services will remove her from both her parents’ care. That seems ridiculous, but that’s Days of Our Lives for you. No need to worry about things like how you’re going to blame both parents when they’re divorced and only one has custody. In any case, Ava may decide that to protect Rachel, she needs to move on from Brady and not take no for an answer. (Peacock/Screenshot) That worries me, especially if Brady plans to keep confronting Kristen. He’ll jump into bed with her if he’s single and brokenhearted. No, thank you! Belle sleeping with EJ is bad enough. We don’t need more grief or pity sex between Kristen and Brady. Besides, that allows their eight-year-old monster to get her way through her terrible behavior. After Four Days Of Craziness, Days Of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week Of 2-24-25 Promise More Realistic Storylines I prefer realistic storylines to doppelgangers and magic potions. If you do, too, Friday is your day. (Peacock/Screenshot) Most of the week is taken up with Fake Rafe silliness, but Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 2-24-25 promise several more mundane storylines at the end of the week: Paulina supports Chanel while Chanel undergoes a medical procedure. This is likely the uterine biopsy to make sure the abnormal cells Kayla found aren’t cancerous. Julie tells Doug III how much she wants Alice’s necklace back. In a way, I dread this story. Doug III has become a decent guy (and a better match for Holly!), but his world will crumble when Julie learns he stole that necklace. Leo asks Chad for a job. I don’t really care about this, other than to say that Jada’s fear that Leo would write about “Rafe’s” cheating on her in his gossip column was premature since he clearly hasn’t been hired yet.
