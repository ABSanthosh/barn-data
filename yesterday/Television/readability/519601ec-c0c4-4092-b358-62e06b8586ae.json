  "text": "The following contains spoilers from Episode 11 of NBC‘s Grosse Pointe Garden Society. Much like wrapping a dead body in a blanket and burying it in the sand, Grosse Pointe Garden Society pulled the wool over our eyes when it came to concealing Quiche’s identity. We didn’t see that one coming! In Episode 11, the shifting timelines finally converge as the night of the gala comes into clear focus. Amid the swanky Grosse Pointe soirée, Alice learns devastating news: It was, in fact, her mother-in-law Patty who killed her beloved dog. The gardener decides to exact her revenge by sabotaging Patty’s newly prized possession, the handmade quilt purchased for thousands of dollars during the gala’s auction. The whole gang kidnaps the blanket and takes it out to their gardening shed, where they realize revenge might be better served with an audience. So, Alice rage-texts Patty to come meet them, but her father-in-law Keith intercepts the message and arrives in Patty’s place. Then, there’s a dramatic — and hilarious — struggle, as the group fights Keith over the quilt as they try to feed it into a wood chipper. Amid much teetering and tottering, the gardeners fight off their foe, until finally the group successfully feeds part of the quilt into the rumbling machine. But Keith doesn’t give up. He desperately tries to rescue his wife’s new shiny toy. For a moment, it looks like he’ll be sucked into the machine and chopped into a million little pieces, but then he lurches backward, clutching the quilt in his hands. Crisis averted, Keith is alive and the blanket is (partly) intact. But wait! As the gang stands in the shed, stunned by the struggle that just occurred, Keith suddenly collapses. Heart attack?! Stroke?! Aneurysm?! No. The camera pans over his back, revealing multiple deep puncture wounds. Upon pulling the blanket out, he had stumbled into a spiked garden tool hanging on the back wall, impaling himself. So there you have it: The dead body isn’t Gary, Doug or Patty. It’s Keith. Keith is Quiche, and he died sort of by accident. Did you see that one coming, or did the big reveal surprise you as much as us? Let us know your reactions in the comments!",
