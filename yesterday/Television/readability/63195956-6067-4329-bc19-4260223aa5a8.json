Durance guest-stars as Emma O’Brea, whose husband has disappeared, and the spoilers hint that the case becomes complicated. Cassandra feels torn between her old friend as secrets arise and helping Karl solve this case. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) This will be another massive week to bring in another fanbase since Erica Durance‘s storyline has also been in several promos. She and Kristin haven’t acted together in around 15 years. In addition to this exciting reunion and intriguing case, several spoiler photos hint that Cassandra and Karl’s relationship speeds up and that she meets his daughter. Smallville Actresses Reunite as Childhood Friends It’s the Smallville reunion we’ve been waiting for since the official trailer for Murder in a Small Town was released. Cassandra (Kristin Kreuk) reunites with her old friend Emma O’Brea (Erica Durance) at an arts center fundraiser. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) It starts with a beautiful reunion, but Emma later discovers that her husband, Charlie, has disappeared. She turns to Cassandra for comfort and assistance, and Cassandra introduces her to Karl and his team. Did a Scorned Wife Commit Murder? A crime took place at the O’Shea’s residence, but it’s unclear if he was abducted or murdered initially. If anyone can solve it, it’s Karl and his team since he’s well-versed at finding clues others often miss. (Family Introductions-Murder in a Small Town-Season 1 Episode 4) Emma O’Brea insists to Det. Alberg that everyone loves her husband Charlie (Toby Levins). If you’ve watched enough police procedurals, that’s a red flag. Almost everyone has an enemy, and it usually starts at home. The more Karl talks to Emma, the more disturbing secrets are revealed. Since Charlie is so well-loved, I wonder if he had an affair, especially since Emma has uncovered secrets about her husband. There are very few things that have a wife holding a gun to her husband, emotionally asking why she wasn’t enough for him. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) The only other thing would be if she learned that Charlie had another life that didn’t include her, and he wanted out. That undoubtedly pushed Emma over the edge. However, did she kill him and report him missing? That’s an overdone trope in police procedurals. Charlie and his fling could have disappeared, and Emma could have found them before the cops did. It sounds like there were many secrets in this disturbing marriage. I can’t wait to learn if it will be a common trope or something exciting like from Gone Girl. Those missing-person cases are twisty. Cassandra’s Torn Between An Old Friend and Karl (FOX/ YouTube Screenshot) The promo teases that Karl eventually suspects Emma did something to her husband, Charlie. That puts Cassandra in a tight spot between her childhood friend and her cop boyfriend. She’s more likely to know what her friend is capable of, but will she want to betray her? Since the episode synopsis teases Cassandra and shares some vital clues with Karl, she must find something compelling about Emma and Charlie’s marriage. Hopefully, we’ll see Cassandra in an investigative mode and as a sympathetic friend. Seeing her as only Karl’s girlfriend has gotten tedious since we barely saw her at the library since the season premiere. This promises to be thought-provoking since it will affect Cassandra’s relationship with Emma and her blossoming romance with Karl. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) How Will The O’Shea’s Marriage Affect Cassandra and Karl? At the end of Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 3, Cassandra finally admitted how much she cared about Karl when he almost died in a burning fire. However, will seeing everything blow up in one of her oldest friend’s marriages set them back? She still seemed wary of commitment after being single for so long, and it’s challenging to become serious later in life while balancing careers, children, and relationship fears. I’m excited that the two will focus on real-life issues, not just having a case come between them. It looks like Cassandra takes a leap of faith and trusts Karl with information from the spoiler photos and the synopsis. (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Meeting Dad’s New Girlfriend The spoiler photos tease Karl’s teenage daughter, Holly (Dakota Guppy), who visits again. She’s come a long way from the teenager barely speaking to him in the series premiere, but teenage girls’ moods fluctuate. Even though she’s relaxed around Karl, how will Holly react to meeting Cassandra? Initially, Karl mentioned his daughters wanted him to place that dating ad, but in theory, that’s different from meeting someone who’s not your mom. The photo shows Holly smiling, so hopefully, Cassandra put her at ease. I’ve asked for more family scenes to learn about Karl and his daughters, so I’m anxious to see how they mesh in scenes. What interests you the most about these Spoilers, TV Fanatics? Are you excited to see Kristin Kreuk and Erica Durance in scenes again? Will you tune in for more Karl and Cassandra romance and some family time mixed in? We would love to hear your thoughts, so please share them with us below. Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 4 airs Tuesday, October 15 at 8/7c on FOX.",
