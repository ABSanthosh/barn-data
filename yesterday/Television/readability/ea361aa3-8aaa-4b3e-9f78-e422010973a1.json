  "text": "FBI: Most Wanted and FBI: International were cancelled after six and four seasons, respectively. Despite signs that CBS was invested in the FBI universe, the cancellations came fast and rough, and they were shocking for viewers who were invested in these shows. Cancellations are common and expected, and with the influx of TV, it’s almost guaranteed that your favorite show will be cancelled at one point or another. (Mark Schafer/CBS) There are some shows that no one misses when they’re gone, but others hurt. This writer doesn’t hold FBI: International in high regard; it’s a show I won’t miss. However, FBI: Most Wanted’s cancelation stings and makes me wonder: What the hell is wrong with CBS? The show was the first FBI-scripted spinoff, and the creators knew what they wanted from its inception. (Mark Schafer/CBS) It was conceptualized as a high-octane procedural about some of the most dangerous criminals on the FBI’s most wanted list. “Always in the field and always on the run, FBI: Most Wanted is a weekly adrenaline shot about the thrill of the chase,” reads an excerpt from the show’s official description. The spinoff dialed up its predecessor’s strengths by introducing even more unhinged criminals and giving them a larger playing field. FBI: Most Wanted Has the Best Cases By Far (Mark Schafer/CBS) The cases are the backbone of the show. With the team after fugitives who have committed heinous acts, there is always a sense of urgency that no other show in the franchise has ever matched. It succeeds in selling to the viewer just how crucial it is that this person be apprehended before they kill another person or dozens of people. Care is taken to craft the cases so they don’t seem straightforward and boring. (Mark Schafer/CBS) The show does not go for twists like expected; instead, it digs deeper into the characters. While it does not attempt to justify some actions or potential actions to be done by the suspect, it explores the nuances of how they found themselves in this position. It shows just how even the best reasons can have terrible consequences. FBI: Most Wanted also explores how bigotry and marginalization can expose people to violence. (Mark Schafer/CBS) A solid selection of guest stars brings the weekly criminals to life. It’s not once or twice that I’ve Googled who that actor was because they were so good. The show consistently brings on board talented performers and gives them good material to work with. FBI: Most Wanted Takes Risks It’s easy for many shows to stick to the same formula because why not? However, this show occasionally takes a risk that pays off greatly. (Mark Schafer/CBS) For example, FBI: Most Wanted Season 6 Episode 10 has an opener that lasts over five minutes as the team hunts down a gamer who has taken his game of murder into the real world. The take follows the Fugitive Task Force as they hunt him down in the streets. That long take pays off greatly as it immerses the viewer in the action while setting up the mood for the episode. It feels like a game, as the production team utilizes numerous techniques to resemble gameplay. (Mark Schafer/CBS) This is just one of the technical or narrative risks the show takes that makes it stand out. FBI: Most Wanted Doesn’t Pretend to Be What It’s Not The show does not have the best characters. A lot of them can be boring and one-dimensional in their private lives, but that is not a huge issue because their private life is not of focus. They also don’t have the closeness one would see on other shows, and they don’t pretend to. It’s all about the case. (Mark Schafer/CBS) While they are not entirely abandoned, they don’t dominate the narrative to the point that it births unnecessary drama. They are given a few minutes each episode before it dives into the meat of the issue. This formula has worked well and set the show apart from its counterparts. FBI: Most Wanted was not pulling great numbers, but it wasn’t doing badly. It might not have been in CBS’ 10 million viewers club, but it had a consistent audience. (Mark Schafer/CBS) Around six million viewers tuned in every night to witness the hunt of the Fugitive Task Force. It’s a shame this will not happen anymore, and the network does not have a replacement. Over to you, TV Fanatics. Did you think the cancellation was premature? Chime in in the comments section.
