  "text": "Former The Late Show With Stephen Colbert bandleader Jon Batiste got the Super Bowl LIX crowd good and warmed up when he performed “The Star-Spangled Banner” ahead of the big game. The Grammy- and Academy Award winner, a Louisana native, was one of several artists from the state who played Caesars Superdome in New Orleans Sunday before the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles took the field. Batiste accompanied himself on a piano painted by his wife, Suleika Jaouad, who is currently undergoing cancer treatment. (Read more about her contribution to the big game here.) Watch footage of Batiste’s take on the National Anthem below: Batiste and his group, Stay Human, were The Late Show‘s house band from 2015 to 2022. The singer, songwriter and composer has won several Grammys, including two at this year’s ceremony (Best Song Written for Visual Media, with Dan Wilson, for “It Never Went Away” from American Symphony; and Best Music Film for American Symphony). He also took home a Best Original Score Oscar in 2021 for Disney’s Soul. His recent work includes Beethoven Blues (Batiste Piano Series, Vol. 1) and the score for Jason Reitman’s SNL film Saturday Night. Earlier in the evening, R\u0026B artist/Grammy winner Ledisi sang “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” often referred to as the Black national anthem, and instrumentalist Trombone Shorty and singer Lauren Daigle teamed up for “America the Beautiful.” What did you think of Batiste’s national anthem performance?
