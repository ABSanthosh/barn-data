Not only is it a powerful vocal and an epic, Father John Misty-worthy production, but the lyrics are sharp enough to draw blood. “I wrote half of it while I was still in active addiction,” The Voice’s Season 27 winner tells TVLine, “and I went through the process of going to treatment.” Every step of the way, the singer continued fighting with the number in hopes of bringing it to a conclusion. “I did keep trying to finish it, but all I got was this first half,” he says. “It wasn’t until the day that I got out of rehab that I was able to finish that song.  “Now I always say that I think that the song itself was like the reward for making it through, you know?” he continues. “I wrote it as a reminder for me, but it seems to be resonating with a lot of people. And that’s a gift. As songwriters, that’s our role in the world. Our responsibility is to find the words that other people haven’t been able to or can’t.” David then asks, no doubt knowing the answer, whether a song has ever expressed something that we’ve wanted to but haven’t been able to. “And they said it in four words,” he marvels. “You’re like, ‘Oh my God, how could… why? It was so simple.’ “That is the dogma of a songwriter, I believe,” he adds, “and that’s the gift that we potentially are able to give to the world. At least I see it that way.” The Voice’s 20 Best Performances of All Time Check out TVLine’s full interview with David here.",
