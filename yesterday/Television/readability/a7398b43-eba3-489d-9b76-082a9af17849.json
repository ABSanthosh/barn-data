  "text": "When Tim Riggins said “Texas forever,” he meant it. Taylor Kitsch, who played the moody high school football star on the acclaimed small-town drama Friday Night Lights, has revealed that he’s already been approached to be in Peacock‘s upcoming FNL reboot. “I’ve been asked, and we’ll leave it at that,” Kitsch admitted when asked about FNL during an interview with SiriusXM’s The Spotlight With Jessica Shaw. Don’t expect Kitsch to put on football pads again, though. The actor is 43 years old now, for one thing, and the Friday Night Lights reboot — which officially went into development at Peacock last month — is set to focus on a new set of characters. “Following a devastating hurricane, a ragtag high school football team and their damaged, interim coach make an unlikely bid for a Texas High School State Championship becoming a beacon of light for their town,” per the official synopsis. Kitsch won’t be playing that coach, either, he states firmly: “I would come in and do something, maybe for an episode or something. But I don’t want to go and do the whole thing.” He’s also open to playing a new, non-Riggins role on the reboot, “maybe play an opposing team’s coach or something,” but he concedes that as soon as fans saw him on screen, they’d “be like, ‘That’s Riggins.'” Kitsch played Tim Riggins for five seasons on Friday Night Lights, which debuted on NBC in 2006 and then was co-produced with DirecTV’s The 101 Network for its final three seasons. Original executive producers Jason Katims, Peter Berg and Brian Grazer have signed on to return for the Peacock reboot. Should Kitsch return to Dillon as Riggins, or another character?
