  "text": "The funeral of Dr. Charles’ mother on Chicago Med brought about the unexpected return of a character that viewers haven’t seen in five seasons. During Wednesday’s episode, the psychiatrist was greeted by his daughter Anna (played by Hannah Riley), and she wasn’t alone: Dr. Charles’ other daughter, Robin (Mekia Cox), was also in attendance! It’s been a long time since Cox’s character was last seen in the Windy City, where she was an epidemiologist at the hospital. She appeared throughout Seasons 2-3, dating Colin Donnell’s Dr. Connor Rhodes until she left Chicago to focus on her health. Robin returned in Season 5 as her mother battled cancer, then appeared in a Season 5 episode for her mom’s funeral. As a family death once again brought Robin back to Chicago after several years away, her father acknowledged how hard it must be for her to attend her grandmother’s funeral, given how she treated her granddaughter. But Robin surprised Charles, revealing that her grandmother apologized for being racist every time she called her. During his eulogy, Charles acknowledged what a difficult relationship he had with his mother, but he loved her because the “love between a parent and child goes beyond any one moment,” he concluded as Robin and Anna watched in tears. In other surprising developments during the hour, Hannah was waiting on the results of her physical exam and psych evaluation to find out if she could be a surrogate for her sister. She worried that her drug addiction and unstable romantic life were going to be an issue, but when she got the call informing her that it was no-go, it was her physical that turned out to be the problem. Turns out the doc is already pregnant! Congrats, Papa Ripley?! Elsewhere, another doctor made their exit from the hospital: Naomi was not happy that Dr. Lenox went to Mrs. Goodwin with the accusations against Dr. Hayes. But she, eventually, found another way to fight by convincing his other victims to speak to the Tribune paper. Still, Naomi told Caitlin that she needs a fresh start at a new hospital. Chicago Med fans, what did you think of the season’s penultimate episode? Hit the comments! Chicago P.D. Wedding First Look: Burgess and Ruzek Finally Tie the Knot",
