  "text": "Tom Llamas is officially NBC‘s new top newsman. Llamas made his debut as anchor of the NBC Nightly News on Monday, taking over for departing anchor Lester Holt, who signed off on Friday after a decade behind the anchor’s desk. Llamas didn’t waste any time introducing himself on Monday’s broadcast: He got right to business, giving us the latest details on the fire bomb attack on a Jewish community group in Boulder, protests against ICE and the war in Ukraine. He did add a personal note at the end, though, telling viewers: “My thanks to all of you as we start this new adventure together. Tonight, and always, we’re here for you.” Holt announced in February that he was stepping down as NBC Nightly News anchor, a role he’s held since 2015. Moving forward, he will focus on NBC News‘ Dateline, which he has anchored since 2011. “After 10 years, 17 if you include my years on the weekends, the time has come for me to step away from my role as anchor of Nightly News,” Holt said in a statement to NBC staffers. “It has truly been the honor of a lifetime to work with each of you every day, keeping journalism as our true north and our viewers at the center of everything we do.” Llamas, whose ascension to the Nightly News anchor chair was first reported in March, has served as a senior national correspondent for NBC News and reported for NBC Nightly News alongside Holt. He also anchored Top Story with Tom Llamas, a daily primetime newscast for NBC News NOW, and contributed to various NBC News outlets, including Today. How did Llamas do in his debut as anchor? Give him a grade in our poll, and let us know in the comments if you plan to keep watching.",
