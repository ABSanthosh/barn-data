  "text": "Critic's Rating: 4 / 5.04 Hallmark’s Countdown to Christmas is in full swing, and Tis the Season to be Irish transports viewers to Ireland. Hallmark fans of holiday and destination films will appreciate this one because the scenery is gorgeous and includes opposites that attract romance and plenty of other fulfilling relationships. Fiona Gubelmann (The Good Doctor) and Eoin Macken (La Brea) star in this holiday film. Due to her filming schedule, Gubelmann hasn’t appeared in a Hallmark film in several years, while this is Macken’s first Hallmark film. (Martin Maguire/ Hallmark Media) What makes Tis the Season to be Irish special is that Macken is from Ireland. He looks at home there and speaks Irish, including inside jokes. It was the ideal film for his Hallmark debut. Macken plays Sean, a local Irish realtor, while Gubelmann portrays Rose, a house flipper interested in one of his Irish cottages. Upon arrival in Ireland, Rose is horrified to learn that the cottage needs more work than expected and that Sean, the local preservationist, must oversee every renovation. Even When They Clashed, Gubelmann and Macken Had Chemistry From the minute I saw Rose (Gubelmann) and Sean (Macken) on-screen, I wanted more. (Courtesy of Hallmark Media) Hallmark is well-known for its enemies-to-lovers and opposites-attract trope, and these two sizzled as they bantered back and forth. If you’re an HGTV fan, you know there are many regulations with renovating and flipping houses, especially if you don’t read the fine print. That happened to Rose, who jumps in and buys an Irish cottage without researching it. Sean delights in rubbing it in her face, saying she couldn’t renovate certain things without his approval as the historic preservationist. While I know Rose was disappointed at the cottage’s condition, it allowed her to put her own stamp on it within reason. Naturally, you’d want to keep the Irish charm that appeals to others. (Martin Maguire/ Hallmark Media) Even though they got off on the wrong foot, their chemistry sizzles, their banter is entertaining, and they learn they aren’t so different as they interact more. They both want to honor the cottage’s legacy. Rose initially travels to Ireland because her mother traveled there years ago before she died, and Sean cares about and honors his hometown and doesn’t understand flipping houses for profit. Despite meeting as rivals, they become unlikely friends since it’s difficult to stay angry with someone when Irish magic and holiday traditions are in the air. Watch This Film for the Irish Scenery and Christmas Traditions I love Hallmark’s destination movies, staring at beautiful scenery, and learning new traditions. Tis the Season to be Irish transports viewers to an Irish countryside, complete with historic cottages, an Irish pub, and a Christmas market. (Martin Maguire/ Hallmark Media) It was magical to hear the bagpipes playing in the background as Sean and Rose explored the hills, the fairy trees, and the nearby lake. Many Irish Christmas traditions included desserts like plum pudding or mince pies. But the atmosphere was welcoming as locals and tourists gathered at the pub to drink 12 rounds of drinks and celebrate the 12 Days of Christmas. I would have loved to join that Irish pub’s fun and toast with them. We experienced other traditions, like the Mistletoe Harvest, making crafts for Wren Day, or the Christmas Day swim, where they jumped into the cold lake. The Irish community treats tourists like family. Soon, many people, including Sean’s mom and a rogue sheep named Lambchop, take Rose under their wing and try to play matchmaker. (Martin Maguire/ Hallmark Media) Rose Learns About Herself From New Friends Hallmark movies have become less cheesy over the last few years and have featured friendships or families in addition to the lead romance. Tis the Season to be Irish includes two supporting characters Rose befriends at the Inn. I won’t spoil much, except that they are all at a crossroads in life, so this new friendship heals all three. Rose learns the importance of leaning on others and that she doesn’t have to be alone. As she learns to let her new friends in more, will she open her heart up to Sean, too? (Martin Maguire/ Hallmark Media) Tis the Season to be Irish Writers and Directors are Hallmark Movie Pros While having a talented cast is essential, featuring a talented crew is just as important. Joie Botkin and Samantha Herman have previously written destination Hallmark films, where they write the location and its customs as magical as the romance. Boitkin wrote Savoring Paris in 2024 and Love is Greek to Me in 2023. In 2023, Herman created Christmas Island, which took place in Switzerland. Both writers were versed in writing a holiday romance in Ireland. Lesley Demetriades directed the film, and she’s directed several Hallmark films. Her last holiday film was for GAC, with a real-estate twist, so that experience also helps this one. (Martin Maguire/ Hallmark Media) Interestingly, most of the crew were women. Perhaps that is why Rose’s point of view is stronger throughout the film. Gubelmann shines in her layered emotional delivery. Macken has some stand-out scenes, too. We haven’t seen him in a rom-com in a long time, and his comedic timing is impeccable. Tis the Season to be Irish is about letting go and believing in new possibilities. After you watch it, please comment here or on social media with your thoughts about the film. Tis the Season to be Irish premieres on the Hallmark Channel on Sunday, November 10 at 8/7c.",
