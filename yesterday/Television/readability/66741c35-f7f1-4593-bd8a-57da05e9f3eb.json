  "text": "Initially, Murder in a Small Town began as a two-hour movie thirty years ago. Over the years, it grew into a combined series between Canada and FOX TV. Murder in a Small Town Season 1 had its ups and downs as it tried to find its footing and establish itself as a murder mystery procedural. While we think the series would have benefited from more episodes, it only had eight, so it’s time to rank and review its most memorable and least satisfying series moments. ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Maybe selecting Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 1 was a cop-out. However, having an extra thirty minutes helped flesh out the stories and introduce viewers to the heart of the series: Karl and Cassandra’s romance. Within minutes, there was a murder, but it interspersed with the police chief and the local librarian meeting on a blind date. Not many police procedurals keep a romance near the forefront. The premiere also worked because James Cromwell gave a layered performance as George Wilcox. You suspected he killed his neighbor almost immediately, but the motive was unclear. As EP Jeff Wachtel shared, Cromwell gave an eerie performance as he hid the evidence. You almost felt sorry for Wilcox because he watched his stepfather abuse his mom and sister, so he wanted to save his sister from her abusive husband, and he failed again. It also demonstrated that these cases weren’t black and white. Most of these suspects weren’t evil serial killers but the product of their childhood, which made them react. Worst Episode: Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 6 (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 6 was the most disappointing episode, and it wasn’t only because it wasn’t based on L. R. Wright’s material. I believe Ian Weir and his team knew the main characters. It bothered me that the series made the psychiatrist, Dr. Lewis, evil. They wasted a real opportunity to go old-school and have her and Det. Alberg team up to analyze Shane and realize why he killed the politician. Instead, it was all about power, control, and having him do her dirty work. Watching her play mind games with Karl was painful, even if she was partly right about Cassandra. That made it hurt worse. Even though Karl was a good man, Cassandra genuinely needed a break to heal after her abduction. Best Karl \u0026 Cassandra Moment: They Realize They Want Each Other (Hulu/ Screenshot) There were many moments when Karl and Cassandra were together since they got together quickly, and the series pulled them apart. However, the best was when they realized they both wanted their relationship to work out. Cassandra was right. They tended to overthink things, and that often got in the way. Karl would always be a cop, and she would always speak her mind. They either needed to accept those quirks or not. I loved that they gave in to their sizzling chemistry. Kristin Kreuk and Rossif Sutherland naturally play off each other’s banter, and she makes him loosen up more. While we’re relieved they ended the season together, we need a second season to see where this relationship evolves. Best Supporting Character: Sergeant Sid Sokolowski (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) It was a toss-up between Sergeant Sid and Corporal Yen because they both go the extra mile, but Sid has become more of a fan favorite. His presence has helped the other characters, from guiding Karl as a father to improving Corporal Yen’s self-esteem on the job. But nothing was as good as watching Sid jump into a burning in Murder in a Small Town Season 1 Episode 3. He would have risked everything to save Karl’s life. The cases sometimes affected Sid deeply as we learned about his late sister’s drug problem. His compassion made him a better cop. Worst Supporting Character: Andy Kendrick ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) It often felt like Fritzy Klevans-Destine was wasted as Andy Kendrick. He tried hard, but he often seemed to mess up, whether missing some evidence or flirting with a witness. As Sid mentioned, Kendrick survived on his charm. That grew tiresome after a while. The best part about him was his blossoming friendship with Corporal Yen, but she was more interesting to watch. He redeemed himself by saving Karl’s life, but I’m unsure how much more they can do with him. Best Guest Star: Erica Durance as Emma O’Brea (Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) Murder in a Small Town featured many guest stars, but reuniting Smallville’s Erica Durance and Kristin Kreuk was a special treat. The ladies had wanted to do a project together, and this one allowed them to showcase their real-life friendship as childhood friends in the series. They likely had more layered scenes as Durance played an agitated wife worried about her missing husband. Murder in a Small Town took advantage of Durance’s talents, giving the episode a Gone Girl vibe. It was one of the best episodes, partly because of Durance and Kreuk’s connection. Overall Grade: B ( Kailey Schwerman/ FOX) It’s challenging to adapt mysteries and thrillers, and condensing one novel into an episode didn’t always work for this series. The case-of-the-week format worked for the most part. However, some cases would have worked better if they had longer to breathe. This is why the series premiere and two-part season finale played the best. However, Murder in a Small Town included several positives. In addition to Karl and Cassandra’s relationship, the series boasted a strong supporting cast and excelling guest stars. Aaron Douglas and Mya Lowe could carry scenes when Sergeant Sid or Corporal Yen featured their character arcs. We can’t wait to learn more about them. The series pulled from famous actors for guest arcs, starting with James Cromwell, but Stana Katic, Erica Durance, and Noah Reid were popular choices, too. If the series gets renewed and a few tweaks are made, it could have a better second season. Over to you, TV Fanatics. How would you rate Murder in a Small Town Season 1? Let us know in the comments.
