  "text": "Jimmy Johnson is retiring from Fox Sports after 31 years at the network. The Fox NFL studio analyst and former NFL coach made the announcement on The Herd With Colin Cowherd, stating, “Probably the most fun I’ve ever had in my career, and that’s counting Super Bowls and national championships, was at Fox Sports… But I’ve made an extremely difficult decision.” Johnson added that he’s been thinking about retiring “for the last four or five years.” “I’m going to miss it. I’m going to miss all the guys, and I’ll see them occasionally, but it has been a great run starting back 31 years ago,” he said. Johnson first joined Fox Sports in 1994 as an analyst on the Fox NFL Sunday pregame show.
