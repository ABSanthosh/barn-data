Gina Rodriguez joins the cast as ADA Marion Alba and will interact with Will Trent in the season premiere. She’s been rumored to have a run-in with the special agent, and then they’re forced to work together to bring down a violent Atlanta gang. TV Fanatic chatted with Gina Rodriguez during a recent virtual press day, where she discussed how this opportunity occurred and how the dynamics were among the cast. (Nino Muñoz/Disney) She also teased what she liked about her new character, Marion Alba, and how Marion interacted with Will. It sounds like it will be a fun season, as it was a delightful chat. Check out the interview below. (Disney/Screenshot) Gina, we are excited to see you on Will Trent. How did this opportunity come about? Luckily, Ramon Rodriguez has been my friend for over ten years, and he asked me to come to play on his show with him. I am so blessed that he did because Will Trent is incredible. The show is terrific, and the actors are outstanding. I was lucky to have this opportunity to create something so different from the television I’ve done.  It gave me a chance to be somebody new; try on new, try on this new character, be able to take the drama that I’ve done in the past and mix it with a little bit of my comedy. I owe it all to Ramon. Ramon is the greatest. (Gina Rodriguez/ Instagram) Will Trent has mainly been on the same cast since it started. So, how have the dynamics been since you’re the new girl? It’s so interesting because I didn’t even think about it that way. I’ve known Ramon for years and knew I would play with my friend. As the lead, he creates a beautiful, loving, welcoming environment. But you’re right. I was the new girl. Things could have been different if I hadn’t come into the space with many outstanding human beings. Erika, Christensen, Iantha Richardson, and Sonja Sohn, everybody is so loving and caring. Some parents on the show also understand that I’m a mom and there’s so much love for children and family. It’s honestly been an easy transition to come and play with everybody. It could have been different, but luckily, it was just fantastic. (Nino Muñoz/Disney) I’m so glad because they’ve always had the same cast for about two years, and you’re the first new series regular in about two years. They have a rhythm and a flow, but I feel blessed that I’ve done television for over ten years and directed it, too. I know everybody’s position on a television set and feel comfortable in a television production. So, I hope to slide right in and help move the production forward. I’m very cognizant of what it takes to make a TV show. So, when I join a show, I try not to step on other people’s toes. I try to slide right in, do my work, and contribute as much as possible. (Disney/Screenshot) Absolutely. So, what can you tease about your new character, Marion Alba? Marion Alba is very straightforward and no-nonsense. She is strong-minded and knows what she wants. She’s very career-driven. She came to Atlanta from a different city to continue her journey and career as an ADA, which was an excellent opportunity. She desires to help and is not afraid of putting herself in positions to help.  She brushed up against Will a bit wrong because she was unaware of his position or how people treated him. Everybody knows Special Agent Trent, and they revere him or are annoyed by him. She has a blank slate. So, she comes in confident in who she is and doesn’t let Will push her around. (Gina Rodriguez/ Instagram) That will probably be very fun to see. Will you mainly interact with the GBI, or will we also see you interact with some of the APD? Luckily, I interact with everyone. Yeah, I come in, and I get my hands in everywhere. Marian is the new ADA of Fulton County. She oversees a lot of things, and I contribute in a lot of different ways. So, there’s no stopping Marion from getting involved with many people. What will the fans think of possibly becoming Will’s love interest? Some wanted Angie and Will to reunite, and some hoped Sara Linton would come on this year. Right. Am I Sara Linton? No, I’m joking. I don’t know. But we’ll see. I think that the writing is so good that you’re going to go on a roller coaster, just like we have in the past with Will Trent. You will feel all kinds of different things. That’s a big part of what Marion does. She’s helping a lot with these new cases and gets intertwined in many ways by helping many people in the GBI and the APD. I am curious to hear what fans think and how the evolution of my character makes people feel. (Wilford Harewood/Disney) What is your favorite thing about your character? Oh, there are so many. I love that she’s grounded and clear in her wants, has boundaries, and has unpacked her past. So, she comes with very little baggage. She doesn’t want anybody else’s baggage, either.  She is unafraid to speak her mind and is not a pushover. So, she comes in unafraid of a space with a powerful personality. And I think that’s my favorite part: that she is an excellent, badass chick. (Disney/Screenshot) I can’t wait to see that. And for the final question, describe the season three premiere in three words to me. It’s uncomfortable, exciting, and the opening of an epic adventure — too many words. I gave you too many words, but I’m a mom, and my brain is scrambled eggs. But it’s the start of a pretty epic adventure. Will Trent Season 3 premieres on Tuesday, January 7, at 8/7c on ABC. It’ll premiere on Hulu the following day. You won’t want to miss Gina in this. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

That’s a big part of what Marion does. She’s helping a lot with these new cases and gets intertwined in many ways by helping many people in the GBI and the APD.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eI am curious to hear what fans think and how the evolution of my character makes people feel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"737\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-737x1024.jpg 737w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-216x300.jpg 216w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-768x1067.jpg 768w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-1475x2048.jpg 1475w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-691x960.jpg 691w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-778x1080.jpg 778w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1-864x1200.jpg 864w, https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1.jpg 1728w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 40px), 720px\" data-pin-media=\"https://cdn.tvfanatic.com/uploads/2024/12/Marion-Alba-meets-Will-Trent-Will-Trent-Season-3-Episode-1.jpg\" data-trellis-processed=\"1\"/\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cspan\u003e (Wilford Harewood/Disney)\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/figcaption\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is your favorite thing about your character?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOh, there are so many.
