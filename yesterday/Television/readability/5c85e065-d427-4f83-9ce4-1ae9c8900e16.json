  "text": "It’s a good thing Sullivan’s Crossing has been renewed for Season 4, because our girl Maggie has some serious explaining to do. The show’s third season finale, which aired Wednesday on The CW, ends with another attractive stranger coming to town. What’s out of the ordinary about that, you ask? Nothing, except that this particular attractive stranger (played by Marcus Rosner) introduces himself as Liam — Maggie’s husband. She had previously referred to Liam as merely a “summer fling,” which clearly downplayed the depth of their legal, wedded relationship. There would never be a “good” time for Maggie’s estranged husband to show up, but his arrival at this juncture in her life feels particularly ill-timed. Not only is she finally thriving in her career again, having just performed a successful surgery on Edna’s brain tumor, but even her relationship with Cal is back on track. Sadly, life has decided to throw yet another wrench into their happy ending — this time by the name of Liam. Marcus Rosner as Liam on Sullivan’s CrossingCW screenshot So, what’s the deal with this guy? Unfortunately, we’ll have to wait until Season 4 to get any concrete answers. Is it 2026 yet? Other finale developments worth discussing… * Sully decides to throw caution to the wind — not to mention finally release some of the ghosts of his past — and visit Ireland with Helen. It’s an “extended” trip, but we’re fairly confident that a time jump will bring him back to town sooner than later. After all, there’s no Sullivan’s Crossing without Sully, right? … Right? * Maggie and Cal aren’t the only couple at a crossroads. Marriage has been a hot-button issue for Rafe and Sydney (he wants it, she doesn’t), and it looks like it could finally lead to a breakup. He doesn’t explicitly end things in the finale, but you can tell that he isn’t hopeful about the future of their relationship. As we begin the long wait for Season 4, let’s talk about what happens next: Why do you think Maggie married Liam, and what could this mean for her future with Cal? Exactly how long will Sully be away? And if this is the end of Sydney and Rafe, will you be disappointed? Grade the finale and season below, then drop a comment with your thoughts.",
