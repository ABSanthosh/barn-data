Lanterns follows new recruit John Stewart (played by Aaron Pierre) and legend Hal Jordan (Kyle Chandler), two intergalactic cops drawn into a dark, Earth-based mystery as they investigate a murder in the American heartland. Jagannathan is set to play Zoe, “who is effortlessly confident and poised in any setting, even those where she stands out. She is every bit as composed and cunning of the influential men around her,” per Deadline, which also reports that the character is a rumored love interest for John. (Kelly Macdonald is said to portray Hal’s love interest, Sheriff Kerry.) Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * Elsbeth has tapped Ioan Gruffudd (Forever) to guest-star as an artist in Scotland who sparks with Elsbeth when he helps her solve a murder from across the pond in the Valentine’s Day episode, per Deadline. Additionally, Alan Ruck (Succession) will play twins in an upcoming episode, while Sullivan Jones (The Gilded Age) will recur as a handsome medical examiner in New York. * Prime Video has renewed the daily court show Tribunal Justice, created by Judge Judy Sheindlin, for Season 3, per Deadline.
