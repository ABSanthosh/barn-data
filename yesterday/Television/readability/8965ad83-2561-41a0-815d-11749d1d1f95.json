  "text": "For starters, one person usually gets their heart smashed into a million pieces on The Bachelor, knowing that one of their saddest moments will be broadcast to the world.  You can feel the nerves radiating off of everyone in the final moments, and this season shouldn’t be any different.  There will be a final rose (maybe), an engagement (supposedly), tears (by me), and live tweeting (also by me).  (Disney/Matt Sayles) I’m beyond ready for this season to kick off! What say you all? Are you ready for Grant’s season to begin?  The Bachelor Season 29 premieres on January 25 at 8/7c on ABC. The Bachelor will return for season 29 in a few weeks, which is insane.  The series has been around for so long now that it’s just a thing that happens. The sun will rise and set, and The Bachelor will premiere on ABC with the most dramatic promotional packages you’ve ever seen.  (Disney) Grant Ellis was a contestant on The Bachelorette Season 21, in which he hit it off with lead Jenn Tran but ultimately wasn’t the man for him. But he made a significant enough impression to step into the lead role of the latest Bachelor season.  Grant came across as very likable. He had a charming smile and a penchant for staying away from the drama, which meant he didn’t always get the most screen time, but he made do with what he had.  Jenn’s season was filled with many duds, but Grant was a great choice if for no other reason than his always respectful and vulnerable nature, the hallmark qualities of a solid lead.  We’ve crafted a list of the top reasons we’re excited to see what Grant’s season offers! So, check it out, and let us know how you’re feeling leading up to the season.  Grant’s A Sweetheart (Disney/Ricky Middlesworth) Jenn eliminated Grant right before hometown dates, which was a devastating dumping for the day trader, who’d told Jenn he was falling in love with her.  From the start, Grant stood out among the pack with his dazzling smile and chill personality. He was a gentleman through and through, and while he made an impression on Jenn, he wasn’t in her face or trying to muscle it up with the other guys in a way to get some competitive edge (or extra screen time).  Grant seemed to be there for Jenn and more interested in getting to know her and developing a connection than engaging in the drama.  While the drama IS what has made The Bachelor one of the longest-running reality shows, you don’t necessarily want your lead to be an antagonist. Say what you want about the show, but some people come on looking for love and call me naïve, but Grant appeared to be one of those people.  Not only was Grant sincere, but he was down-to-earth, considerate, and willing to open up to Jenn. He wasn’t recycling talking points or deflecting. He was open to having heavy conversations and building something with Jenn because he wanted love, a family, and that golden retriever lifestyle.  Now that he’s the lead, he’ll be in an interesting position where he calls the shots and, hopefully, gets to experience a whole new journey with a happy ending.  The Girls Will Be There For Grant (Disney/Matt Sayles) Look, in some seasons, the series leads are not what the audience or contestants expect.  Countless men and women will sign up thinking that someone they had their eye on is poised to be the one handing out the roses, and then they will be crushed when they see someone else when they get out of the limo.  Many people will play it off like they’re open to whomever, even though it’s not the person they were expecting, but it’s very easy to see through those people.  The powers that be did the correct thing with Grant and announced him while they were still casting for the season. That means the women competing for his heart should be familiar with Grant and want to be there for him.  It sounds like a small thing because of the series’ reputation as a stepping stone for many to something else, not a vehicle to find everlasting love, but any time we can skip the episode where another contestant has to tell the lead the person they were vibing with the most originally wanted someone else, the better.  I like my Bachelor drama with a hint of realism, not totally manufactured.  A New Set of Bucket List Places To Visit  (DISNEY/John Fleenor) People watch this series for many different reasons, and watching people fall in love is sometimes far from the top of their list of things they’re hoping to see. Nowadays, the flagship series is known for traveling as much as almost anything else. The girls and guys travel across the United States and beyond as they collect roses and flyer miles.  Many of the episodes act as an advertisement for any given city or country, and they do an excellent job of allowing the places they visit to act as more than just a backdrop.  It’s beautiful to see different places and communities highlighted, and I’m surely not the only one who jots down some of these places and adds them to my growing list of destinations I’d like to visit when I win the Mega Millions.  Come for the love declarations, but stay for the tropical location advertisement.  Drama AND Love (Disney/John Fleenor) It goes without saying that a season of The Bachelor will have drama and a lot of lovey-dovey scenes, but there’s something about Grant that gives me hope it will be a more light-hearted season.  Grant has such an easygoing nature, and while he’ll have his moments as the lead where he has to break a heart or tell someone about their behavior, I doubt it will be at the level we’ve seen in the past.   Naturally, the contestants will have their issues away from Grant, but here’s hoping Grant’s calm, cool, and collected nature rubs off on his ladies and brings us a season equal parts drama and lightness.  I am all about the fights and the theatrics (every season needs a villain, okay!), but I’m also interested in seeing a good guy find something special mixed in with the absurdities only this series can bring.  I like my Bachelor viewing to include a few scenes that have me clutching my pearls and a few that make me believe in love again.  The Most DRAMATIC FINALE EVER Because… DUH You must tease the ending if you want people to stick around all season. No one will want to tune in if everyone knows the whole season leads to a boring conclusion.  But Bachelor endings typically ARE pretty dramatic. How excited are you for Grant’s turn to find love?
