  "text": "Lucas’s decision to continue with the National Park anyway may come back to haunt him. Spoilers for When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 10 suggest that the battle for McGinty’s Meadow intensifies, and McGinty goes after both Lucas and Nathan. This may be the most we’ve seen Lucas interact with other Hope Valley residents as he and Nathan work together to protect their own. (Ricardo Hubbs/ Hallmark Media) While Elizabeth is busy, her older students inform her that Little Jack has gone missing. That’s every mother’s worst nightmare. Georgie (Melissa Gilbert) returns to Hope Valley, wanting answers about the gold and to see Bill. Finally, Mike and Mei host a harvest festival for everyone. It will be nice to see more of Mei’s heritage highlighted again. McGinty Declares War on Hope Valley, Making Lucas and Nathan Protect Their Own Edie warned Lucas that McGinty hated losing, but he didn’t listen. He followed his instincts, and McGinty and his minions sued Lucas. We’re unsure what McGinty is going after Lucas for, but it shocks both Lee and Nathan that the ranchers would go to these extremes. (Hallmark Channel/ Screenshot) It worsens when Allie returns to the woods to gather more information on McGinty. She’s determined to protect those wolves and not let McGinty scare her away. Naturally, McGinty acts like a bully and threatens Nathan. There is nothing worse than a creep insinuating that his daughter made trouble. The best part about this episode is that Lucas and Nathan work together against McGinty. Lucas also hated how McGinty treated Allie at that meeting, and he tried to stop Nathan from fighting McGinty, which would have escalated things to an even worse level. (Hallmark Channel/ Screenshot) We can’t wait to see how these two leading men find a solution to protect themselves and create the National Park. We’re rooting for them. Georgie McGill Returns Testing Bill’s Loyalty Poor Bill. As the sneak peek teases, Georgie McGill returns, wanting to discuss the gold’s whereabouts. She seems displeased that he’s shared case details with Rosemary, a civilian and a reporter. Bill appears torn since he’s still smitten with Georgie, but he doesn’t want to anger Rosemary, who’s become his partner-in-crime. Rosemary is still angry about the last time he kept things from her, and she tends to learn things at the worst possible time. Since Georgie and Rosemary hang out later at the festival in the spoiler photos, maybe they agree to combine forces and share their research, and the three of them will find the gold together. We’re more interested in Bill and Georgie’s romantic relationship. Their chemistry sizzled last time they were together on When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 6. They share a history, and Bill lights up when she’s in the room. She’s the one one recurring character we would like to see more of. She fits in seamlessly; we need more of Bill and Georgie’s romance. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) Only a few episodes remain until When Calls the Heart Season 12 ends. Elizabeth is busy helping her students prepare for graduation, including assisting Emily in finding her career goals. It’s every mother’s worst nightmare. While Elizabeth is busy with other people, Little Jack goes missing. He’s young and likely wandered off while playing after school, and thankfully, the older boys noticed it quickly. However, with the battle over the land and the gold, you wouldn’t want a little boy to get caught in the fray. (Hallmark Channel/ Screenshot) Elizabeth was rightly concerned, and a search party quickly gathered. While I understand the urgency, it felt like the series just did this in When Calls the Heart Season 12 Episode 9 when Allie and Oliver went missing. They need a new playbook. While the idea is interesting, having the children from the same family go missing is a bit redundant. Mike and Mei Plan a Harvest Festival Finally, Mike and Mei plan a Mid-Autumn Festival, which is one of the most important holidays in Chinese culture. Since their wedding, the series hasn’t focused much on Mei and Mike or her heritage, so I’m excited to see what they do with this. (Jeff Weddell/ Hallmark Media) The festival brings friends together and reminds them to be grateful for what they have. When Calls the Heart is primarily about community coming together, so this is the ideal festival for the series. Typically, Chinese lanterns are displayed to symbolize wishes and good fortune. The spoiler photos show many of these lanterns outside the saloon around the couples. It appears that almost everyone is in attendance. I suspect the event will occur after they find Little Jack and will be a celebration of his return as much as it honors Mei’s heritage. Over to you, Hearties.
