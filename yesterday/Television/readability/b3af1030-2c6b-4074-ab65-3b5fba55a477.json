  "text": "The Witches’ Road nearly led us to a Madisynn King encore. Agatha All Along showrunner Jac Schaeffer, as a guest on The Ringerverse’s latest House of R podcast (embedded above), revealed that one cameo from a previous Marvel property that she tried to make happen involved She-Hulk‘s scene-stealing party girl Madisynn, played by Patty Guggenheim. On She-Hulk, Madisynn famously recounted her run-in with a demonic talking goat named Jake, after she was accidentally transported from magician Donny Blaze’s stage show to a hell-ish realm. On Agatha All Along, Patti Lupone’s Lilia at one point scoffs at witchy stereotypes, including that they talk to goats. Schaeffer says (at the 3:20:00 mark in the video above) that she tried to weave that “goat” thread into a Madisynn cameo. But it was not meant to be. “I really wanted to include the character of Madisynn because I think she’s so deeply funny, and she talked about Jake the goat,” Schaeffer recalls. “We were all banging our heads against the wall trying to figure out, ‘How do we make the goat our literal and figurative gateway to getting Madisynn on the road?’ and it just didn’t work. It was shoe-horning. And I had to let that go.” However, working in a cameo from WandaVision‘s Ralph Bohner — again played by Evan Peters, and serving as a Deep Throat-like source of Westview Hex intel for Teen — “was always in the cards,” Schaeffer attests. “We had written a lot for him [on WandaVision] and the pandemic made it that we wouldn’t finish that material,” Schaeffer explains. “We wanted to bring him back because I believe he is a vital piece of this corner of the MCU. And the idea of him being the vehicle of the exposition dump, I was like, ‘Perfect!’ He can make anything entertaining. “It felt ultimately really, really right for the show,” Schaeffer says. “If I had been unable to find the right way, the correct way, to deploy him, I would have cut him,” as she elected to do with Madisynn.",
