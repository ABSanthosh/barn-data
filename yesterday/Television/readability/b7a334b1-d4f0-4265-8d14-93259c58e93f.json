  "text": "Amazon MGM Studio’s Jack Ryan feature film officially has its leading lady. Sienna Miller (Curb your Enthusiasm, Extrapolations) is set to star opposite John Krasinski in the movie continuation of the popular Prime Video series, per our sister site THR.com. Details about the film’s storyline are being kept under wraps for now, though we do know that Miller’s character is an MI6 agent. Jack Ryan is based on the fictional Ryanverse created by author Tom Clancy. The TV series follows its titular character as he’s thrust away from his desk job into the field of danger, terrorism, and espionage after uncovering a threat at a global scale. Executiveproducer and director Andrew Bernstein will helm the film; he previously worked on Season 2 of the series. Aaron Rabin, who served as a co-executive producer and writer for Season 4, will pen the script. In addition to Miller and Krasinski, the film’s cast includes Wendell Pierce (The Wire) and Michael Kelly (House of Cards). Miller’s previous credits include Anatomy of a Scandal, American Sniper, The Loudest Voice and Horizon: An American Saga. Excited to see where Ryan’s story heads next and how Miller’s character plays a role? Drop your comments/predictions below.",
