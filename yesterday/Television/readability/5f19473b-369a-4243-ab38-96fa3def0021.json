Chris Meloni will join us ahead of his show’s Season 5 premiere for a TVLine Spotlight conversation, the latest in a series of in-person Q\u0026A events featuring your favorite television stars and creators. And if you’re in New York City that night, you can be there, too! RSVP for the April 16 TVLine Spotlight event at this link. The evening will take place from 6 to 7:30 pm, and it’s free, but you must sign up to attend. Now a Peacock exclusive, Organized Crime will be back for Season 5 on Thursday, April 17, with its first two episodes (of 10). The long-awaited season opener will also air on NBC that night, at 10/9c. (All other episodes will only be available on Peacock.) Per the season’s official synopsis, the new season will explore “the dangerous worlds of cross-border smuggling, high-tech domestic terrorism and a crime family intent on repaying Stabler for the injury he did them in Rome. As his worlds collide, Stabler will put everything on the line to protect the vulnerable and fight for justice.” Want to join us — and Meloni — for the next TVLine Spotlight? Click on the RSVP link above, and we’ll see you on April 16!",
