However, TVLine may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Amazon is once again offering a stellar deal: New users can get Audible for just 99¢/month for three months. Here’s how to claim the Audible offer, to unlock all the audiobooks we love from The Summer I Turned Pretty, Interior Chinatown, Lessons in Chemistry, Big Little Lies and Bosch to the Audible original Slayers: A Buffyverse Story. Audible Premium PlusOn Sale 93% off What Is Audible? Audible is a membership service that provides customers with the world’s largest selection of audiobooks as well as podcasts, exclusive originals and more. Members still have to pay for titles, but certain plans offer deals and discounts. And, with the Audible Premium Plus subscription, users get one credit per month that can be exchanged for one audiobook title — so the monthly fee practically pays for itself! Audible Premium Plus Limited-Time Sale Until Thursday, July 31, you can get Audible Premium Plus for just 99¢/month for three whole months. That means you’ll pocket nearly $60 by avoiding the $14.95/month subscription price. After the three-month period, you can cancel your subscription or it will automatically renew at its regular price. This is truly one of the best ongoing deals from Amazon, and a major Audible discount you won’t want to miss. How to Sign Up for Audible Premium Plus Deal Signing up for Audible Premium Plus is easy. Here are step-by-step instructions for claiming the limited-time deal: Go to the Audible Premium Plus page on Amazon Click the yellow “get this deal” button Sign in using your Amazon.com email and password Enter payment information Start listening to Audible for 99¢/month! Is There an Audible Free Trial? Audible regularly offers a 30-day free trial for both of its subscriptions, but the current Audible deal unlocks three full months for just $3. (The current deal cannot be combined with the Audible free trial.) Whether you want to sign up for Audible Plus or Audible Premium Plus, you can enjoy a whole month free of the best audio hits — but we definitely recommend capitalizing on the three-month deal outlined above. When there isn’t an active deal, signing up for an Audible free trial is easy. Here are step-by-step instructions for claiming your single free month if you miss the aforementioned deal: Go to Audible’s landing page on Amazon Choose between a Plus or Premium Plus plan and click the yellow “$0.00 Unlock Free” button Sign in using your Amazon.com email and password Enter payment information Click “Start Free Trial” Start listening to your Audible free trial! How Does the Audible Free Trial Work? Your Audible membership is free for 30 days — or three months with the Amazon’s latest deal. If you enjoy your Audible free trial, keep the subscription by allowing the membership to automatically continue and renew at its regular price. Remember, you can cancel your free trial before it ends to avoid being charged. If you do decide to continue with your membership, there are no commitments and no cancellation fees. How Much Does Audible Cost? Once your Audible free trial is up, your plan will automatically renew at its original price. There are two plans offered by Audible: the Plus and Premium Plus plans. The Audible Plus plan is $7.95/month after the free trial period ends, while the Audible Premium Plus subscription is $14.95/month. But keep in mind, you can forgo the Audible free trial to unlock the special 99¢/month deal, instead. What Is Included in an Audible Membership? Both plans can access a selection of Audible Originals, audiobooks, and podcasts including exclusive series to listen to thousands of different titles. On top of that, Premium Plus members get one credit per month to use to exchange for any single title in Amazon’s premium selection and access to exclusive member sales and discounts on all additional purchases. How to Listen to Audible Download the free Audible app to start listening on your iOS or Android device. You can also listen on any Alexa-enabled device, compatible Fire tablets, Kindles, Sonos devices and more.",
