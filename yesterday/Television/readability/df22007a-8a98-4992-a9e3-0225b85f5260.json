The Apple TV+ alt-history drama has enlisted The Summer I Turned Pretty’s Sean Kaufman to play an older version of Kelly Baldwin and Alexei Poletov’s son, Alex, our sister site Deadline reports. The character, who is named after his late father, was seen in Season 4 as an eight-year-old (portrayed by Ezrah Lin). Per tradition, the series jumped forward in time at the end of its last finale from 2003 to 2012. Joining Kaufman as a series regular for the upcoming season are Ruby Cruz (Willow) as Lily Dale, the youngest daughter of Miles (Toby Kebbel) and Amanda Dale (Shannon Lucio), and Ines Asserson (Heirs of the Night) as A.J. Jarrett, a US Marine training for a space mission.   Ready for some more recent newsy nuggets? Well… * The Boys has tapped Mason Dye (Stranger Things) to guest-star during Season 5 as Bombsight, a supe who was mentioned in Season 4 as having starred in the 1950s Vought film The Curse of Fu Manchu, our sister site Variety reports. * Canada’s Bell Media has picked up the digitally remastered crime drama Homicide: Life on the Street, which debuted Stateside on Peacock in August. * Following a postponed release, both seasons of Comedy Central’s Detroiters are now available to stream on Netflix. * Watch a trailer for the six-episode series The Creep Tapes, the next chapter in the Creep franchise, premiering Friday, Nov. 15 on Shudder and AMC+ with its first two episodes, followed by new episodes releasing weekly on Fridays: Which of today’s TVLine Items pique your interest?",
