  "text": "In truth, TV couples rarely move at a normal or healthy speed in their respective relationships. However, key plot points usually make the commitment speed make sense, but not on Fire Country.  Certain aspects of the story need to be put to rest after completing Season 1 and Season 2. One in particular is this Bode and Gabriela plot that the show needs to be done with.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Fire Country made some much-needed changes in its sophomore season, but it wasn’t enough to distract from the plot’s glaring issues.  Much of that is because the storytelling just doesn’t make sense — not for sane characters, anyway.  Fire Country Seems to Be Mistaking Toxic Relationships for Passionate Romance  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) In the beginning, it sure made sense that Gabriela and Bode would be attracted to each other. They were both going through similar situations and bonded during intense life-or-death situations. Those are some great building blocks for friendship.  However, since the beginning of Fire Country Season 1, there have been many episodes and drama, yet the writers still have Gabs and Bode pining for each other.  The only logical explanation is that they have formed a toxic bond based on unfinished business. What other reason could those two have for refusing to move on from a relationship that never actually was?  Then, Stephanie Arcila’s (Penny Dreadful: City of Angels) Gabriela had the nerve to kiss Bode after agreeing to marry Diego. Of course, this is all after she left Jake, the superman of firefighting, to be with Bode, the inmate with terrible decision-making skills.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) If this were any other show, Gabriela’s friends would tell her to quit jumping from relationship to relationship and learn to love being alone.  If for no other reason than to let these handsome men get the help they clearly need as well.  Every Character on Fire Country Is Past Due for Years of Therapy  Is there something in the town water? What is with all these capable and intelligent characters making such questionable decisions?  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Why were Jordan Calloway’s (Black Lightning) Jake and Bode so adamant about being Gen’s dad? The best and most logical reasoning is that they were both trying to replace lost love in their lives.  Also, why in the world would Vince and Sharon think Bode, freshly out of the pen, would be the best choice for raising Gen? How did that make sense to them?  As a side note, I called it out about Gen not being Bode’s kid after watching the first half of Fire Country Season 2.   That wasn’t the only thing I was on the money about, either. In the early Fire Country Season 1 episodes, I said that Michael Trucco’s (The Fall of the House of Usher) Uncle Luke would probably be a villain.  I guess the Fire Country writers were waiting for a rainy day because the cat, or rather a snake, is out of the bag. Getting 3 Rock shut down and lying to everyone about it was truly messed up. I don’t blame Manny for knocking Luke’s block off.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Of course, now Manny (Kevin Alejandro) has been arrested, Bode is on some kind of self-destructive hero’s path to being a firefighter, Gabriela is married to a man she probably doesn’t love, and Gen’s real dad is back.  If There is One Thing Fire Country is Good At, It’s Making Sure Its Characters Don’t Stay Happy for Too Long  I’m fully expecting Fire Country Season 3 to be a literal dumpster fire, pun intended, of drama and unresolved issues unless there is another time jump.  What I am most curious about is how the series will look now that Bode is fully free and out in the world. How will the show stack the odds against him without that orange jumpsuit?  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) The show built itself around the idea of a protagonist who is trying to do right and change his life. Well, he did that, more or less.  Unless the writers come up with some ingenious ideas, the only direction for Bode to go now is down. If Fire Country has proven anything, it can’t let its characters stay happy for too long.  Although, it wouldn’t hurt if Bode smiled more often. It’s not even a matter of him being more handsome when he does.   It would give the character more layers and avoid awkward moments like when he stood like a statue while taking a picture with the governor. Seriously, that was cringe-worthy.  Overall, though, I still love this CBS show and have high hopes for Fire Country Season 3. However, I should probably brace for more character deaths that send all the other characters spiraling into more bad decisions.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) What were your thoughts on Fire Country Season 2?  Who do you think was the most toxic character in Season 2?  Please comment below to let me know your thoughts, and join me again as I catch up on Fire Country Season 3!
