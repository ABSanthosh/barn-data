  "text": "With so much change all at once from Fire Country Season 1, it’s a miracle that viewers didn’t get whiplash going into Season 2. While some adjustments were appreciated, not every change is exactly logical.  It’s very clear from the abrupt story progression and the amount of time between the episodes that the sophomore season was another show affected by the SAG-AFTRA strikes.  Max Thieriot plays Bode Leone in a scene from Fire Country Season 2. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) However, Fire Country made the most of the story they built up before the Season 1 finale. But in trying to redirect the course of the plot, did the series veer too much in one direction and not enough in the other?  For example, instead of Bode always looking like a hero by the end of the episode, now he’s shunned by practically every character. It’s true that he’s made some terrible choices, but some of the characters are taking it a little too far.  From Hero to Zero, Just About Everyone Has a Beef With Bad Boy Bode  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) It’s funny to be trying to defend Bode after he was so insufferable in Fire Country Season 1, but halfway through Season 2, it feels like Bode should be wearing a scarlet A on his chest wherever he goes.  All this constant pressure on the character is starting to paint a clear picture of why Bode’s life went the way that it did. Of course, he’s always trying to be the hero because one wrong move and everyone turns on him.  Still, he needs to learn how to make his life about himself and stop trying to live up to someone else’s expectations. First, it was for his mom, and now it’s for his possible daughter Gen.  Side note, I don’t think Gen is Bode’s daughter. I think Bode and Gen are going to bond over Cara’s death, and then they will eventually find her biological dad. That’s just my personal TV Fanatic opinion, and it’s likely to be dead wrong.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) Also, did they have to kill off Cara in the most traumatic way? That poor woman died young after just starting to build a relationship with Jake and Gen. That’s messed up, Fire Country writers.  Someone Get Gabriela in Therapy Because This Poor Girl Has a Messed-Up Sense of Self-Worth  Speaking of being messed up and living for others, what the hell is going on with Stephanie Arcila’s (Penny Dreadful: City of Angels) Gabriela? Seriously, that girl cannot stay single to save her life.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) I mean that literally because her life has been about one guy or another. First, she was in love with Jake, then with Bode, and now with this Diego character. In all fairness, she attracts some pretty damn handsome men.  However, nothing justifies getting engaged after a few months. I know this is scripted broadcast television, but viewers can only extend their imagination so far.  I’m sure the writers thought the engagement would come off as sweet and make it look like Gabs has moved on with her life, but it just screams naive in the worst way.  I’m sure Gabriela and Diego are just plot devices to set Bode and Gabriela back up for a “will they, won’t they” again, but I don’t see the point.  Why are Gabs and Bode still so caught up in each other? They never even actually dated. They had a couple of steamy moments, and that’s it. Diane and Manny are at a cavern in hopes of saving two girls while the others deal with technicolor fire. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) I’m not even counting the life-or-death situations because they have those in just about every episode with multiple characters.  So, what are those two holding on to? Gabriela was in a longer and healthier relationship with Jordan Calloway’s (Black Lightning) Jake, but she got over that with barely a tear, yet she can’t get over the man who constantly chooses everyone over her, let alone his own future.  The Fire Country Writers Are Asking a Lot from Its Audience That Hopefully Pays Off by Season 3  There was so much that was shifted around for Fire Country Season 2 that it’s hard to know what will stick by the time I reach the end of the season.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) For one thing, will Sharon stay on this path of self-destruction? Apparently, she almost upended her marriage by getting so close to that Liam guy.  Also, it has to be said that in what world does a fully grown man chase a woman to her hometown to be with her because they had some nice conversations?  Can anyone explain that to me? Unless Sharon gave Liam a physical cue, like a hand on his inner thigh, there’s no way in hell any guy would see a simple conversation as an opening. Especially not any that handsome.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) There’s just a lot in this season that the hands behind the show are asking audiences to go along with. One thing I can get on board with, though, is the intense action.  The stakes have been raised, particularly in Fire Country Season 2 Episode 5. Having Sharon drive the engine through a flaming forest with firefighters on top was insane.  That whole situation had me at the edge of my seat because you honestly never know who is going to die on the show next in order to serve the plot.  This CBS series is making some choices, and I am all on board for the wild ride because, from what I’ve heard, Fire Country Season 3 is pretty incredible.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) What were your thoughts on Fire Country Season 2?  Am I right in thinking Gen isn’t Bode’s biological daughter?  Drop a comment below to let me know what you think, and join me again as I catch up to Fire Country Season 3!
