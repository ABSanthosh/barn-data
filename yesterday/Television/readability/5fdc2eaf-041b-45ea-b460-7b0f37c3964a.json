  "text": "This exclusive sneak peek from Happy Face Season 1 Episode 3 shows us exactly who Keith Jesperson is. He’s hardly father of the year material. As he pulls the strings of his daughter’s life, dragging her ever closer to him, he makes it clear that this is all about him. (Screenshot Courtesy of Paramount+) So much for wanting to be closer to her for a little father-daughter time. It actually makes my heart hurt to hear him in this clip, using something that he once claimed he found delightful about Melissa and twisting it like a knife in her back. (Screenshot Courtesy of Paramount+) On Happy Face Season 1 Episode 1, we saw how hard Melissa fought to keep her father out of her life. We also saw that he was willing to do anything to remain in the limelight, including calling his daughter’s place of employment. He knew very well that where she worked would be to his advantage. A show that uses true crime victims and families to entertain is where a man like him would want to be, even if Melissa didn’t work there. Maybe he didn’t expect her to step up so effectively. (Screenshot Courtesy of Paramount+) Or maybe he hoped to bring her down while his star kept rising. It’s hard to know what a man like that thinks, but this clip offers a pretty good indication. Keith will use any tool before him to get what he wants, and right now, he wants to stay relevant. He can pretend that he’s interested in getting to know Melissa and her family, but it seems more likely that he’s using that vein to circumvent her involvement by going straight to Hazel for his own purposes. Not much he does comes without strings. What strings he’ll pull next is the biggest question. Check out the exclusive clip now (and prepare to cringe in pain for Melissa!). What do you think? How far will Keith go to keep Happy Face in the daily conversation? Does a piece of him really want to reconnect with his daughter, or is it all about him? Be sure to check out our Happy Face Season 1 Premiere review to be all caught up before our next review drops tomorrow. Happy Face is a great new entry in the “inspired by” category of scripted true crime entertainment. Don’t get left behind!
