  "text": "Warning: This article spoils several events from Virgin River Season 6, now streaming on Netflix. The doctor is out. Following a brief return in the sixth season of Virgin River, Mark Ghanime will not return to the Netflix drama as a series regular in Season 7, TVLine has confirmed. “I love Mark, who plays Cameron, and I love the character of Cameron,” showrunner Patrick Sean Smith tells TVLine. “He will always be a part of the world, and I would love to see his character back, but he won’t be a series regular in Season 7, unfortunately.” Cameron found his way to Virgin River in Season 4 (2022), filling a key position at Doc’s then-struggling clinic. He was also a wannabe love interest for Mel, if only to give Jack some competition, but there were never any actual sparks between them. As it turns out, Cameron’s true match in town was none other than Muriel, with whom he struck up a May-December romance that fizzled out when his ex reentered the picture in the hopes of starting the family he always wanted. Without spoiling too much of Season 6, we’ll just say that Cameron’s brief return allows for him and Muriel to get the closure they deserve — and for him to support her through an extremely difficult time. In spite of their history, or perhaps because of it, they’re able to reach a very mature place by the end of the season. That said, does anyone ever really leave this town for good? Heck, we were pretty sure we’d seen the last of Ricky when he enlisted in the Marines, yet he managed to pop in for a visit this season. For that reason, Smith says, “I would love and can definitely imagine several opportunities of how we could bring Cameron back into our world.” Virgin River was renewed for Season 7 back in October. An exact premiere date was not included in the announcement, though we expect to see it sometime in 2025. How do you feel about Cameron’s Season 6 subplot? Were you hoping he and Muriel were endgame? Drop a comment with your thoughts on all things Virgin River below.",
