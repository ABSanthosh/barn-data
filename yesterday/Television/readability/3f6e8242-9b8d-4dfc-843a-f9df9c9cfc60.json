  "text": "When Sylvester Stallone’s Dwight stood to give a loving, celebratory speech to his staff near the end of Tulsa King‘s Season 2 finale, anyone who’s ever watched a mob drama knew: Something bad was going to happen. But we sure didn’t expect an assault team to rip The General and his lady from their slumber, throw hoods over their heads and cart them to an undisclosed location under cover of night. Well played, Terence Winter. Now, who the heck is on the other side of that bright light? Read on for the highlights of “Reconstruction.” TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS | Though Cal makes some noise about wanting a cut of Dwight’s operation, he backs down pretty quickly when Dwight has Bigfoot point a gun at Thresher’s head. Manfredi says he’s going to take over Cal’s weed operation as payment for getting rid of Ming, and he suggests that Cal go enjoy his oil money and “leave the gangster life to the f–king gangsters.” And Cal just kinda… does? Weird. Not long after, Bevilaqua pays Dwight a visit and demands half of his business in exchange for living in peace. But Dwight can’t let go of the fact that Bevilaqua was responsible for Jimmy the Creek’s death, so he offers 25 percent; the offer insults Bevilaqua. Around the same time, Chickie shows up in Tulsa and yells at the Even Higher Plane staff as he demands to see Dwight. (God, this guy sucks.) Dwight knows his old boss is in town, courtesy of a heads-up from Vince, and he wants nothing to do with Chick’s touchy-feely offer of returning to the family and running it as his second-in-command. “I hope you get the f–king pain you deserve,” is how Manfredi puts it; the conversation breaks down shortly thereafter. THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY | Chickie naturally meets with Bevilaqua next, and it seems like they’re in accord about wanting to whack Dwight and reclaim his territory. But when the pair go to the casino to put their plan in action, Chickie is dismissive of Bevilaqua in front of Dwight — and Bevilaqua doesn’t like that AT ALL. He puts a bullet in Chickie’s head, right there in front of the bar, and Dwight immediately cuts Bevilaqua in for half of his business. “You earned it,” he notes. ‘YOU WORK FOR US NOW’ | At the end of the episode, everyone gathers at the casino to watch the commercial — directed by Grace and starring Dwight’s employees — for Mitch Keller’s Car City. (Yep, it’s officially his!) Dwight stands up and offers a few remarks after, telling everyone that he’s happy to see them happy and celebrating that “we are now legit, and you do not have to look over your shoulder anymore.” Then, at 3 am, a group of armed and armored men kick their way into Margaret’s house and kidnap her and Dwight. He’s thrown into the back of a van and eventually brought into a room where his hood is removed and a light shines in his face. “Who are you?” Dwight asks, blinking and unable to see who’s holding him captive. “You work for us now,” a disembodied man’s voice says. (This is probably a good time to bring up that, at one point in the episode, we saw someone — FBI? ATF? — demand all of the files on Manfredi from a governmental agency. Hmm.) Now it’s your turn. What did you think of the finale cliffhanger? Grade the episode, and the season as a whole, via the polls below. Then hit the comments with your thoughts!",
