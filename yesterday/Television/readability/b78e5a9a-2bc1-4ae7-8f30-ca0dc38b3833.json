  "text": "Corey Stoll (Billions) and Joel Kinnaman (For All Mankind) are joining some Imperfect Women at Apple TV+. The actors have boarded the streamer’s limited series starring and executive-produced by Elisabeth Moss and Kerry Washington. Adapted by Annie Weisman (Physical) from Araminta Hall’s novel of the same name, Imperfect Women is described as “an unconventional, psychological thriller examining a crime that shatters the lives of a decades-long friendship of three women,” reads the official logline. It “explores guilt and retribution, love and betrayal, and the compromises we make that alter our lives irrevocably. As the investigation unravels, so does the truth about how even the closest relationships can change over time.”   The cast also includes Kate Mara (Pose, House of Cards). In other recent casting news… * Sam Witwer (Star Wars: The Clone Wars, Star Wars Rebels) will reprise his role as Darth Maul in Star Wars: Maul – Shadow Lord, a new animated series set after the events of the final season of The Clone Wars and debuting on Disney+ in 2026. * Lee Corso will retire from ESPN’s College GameDay in August after 38 years at the network.
