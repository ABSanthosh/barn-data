Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-30-24 more or less confirm that Chanel will start the new year with a broken heart. At least there will be some strong drama at the end of this awful story! (Peacock/Screenshot) Days of Our Lives Spoilers For The Week of 12-30-24 Suggest Johnny And Chanel Will Have A Disastrous New Year’s Eve Party Parties on Days of Our Lives never go well, so it’s unsurprising that whatever happens will go down at Johnny and Chanel’s New Year’s Eve bash. You’d think that after everything that happened at Johnny’s surprise birthday party, these two would swear off hosting any more such events, but nope. In a way, it’s poetic. The last party fell apart because Johnny mistook Chanel’s attempts to organize it for an affair with Alex. It took weeks of groveling for Chanel to forgive him. That would have been the time to come clean about Joy. Chanel would have been heartbroken and it would have been harder to repair the relationship, but at least they wouldn’t be doing the same thing all over again only a few months later! (Peacock/Screenshot) It’s not clear yet how this will all go down, but one thing is for sure: this drama will tear apart not only Johnny and Chanel but Abe and Paulina. Paulina’s Help Will Likely Make Things Worse It’s too bad Lani and Eli have left town, as Chanel will need as much family support as she can get. At least she has Paulina. Her mother is her fiercest defender, which Chanel may need right now. Still, Paulina is likely to do something completely off the wall to protect her baby girl, and there’s no telling where that might end up. This is the same woman who stormed into a hospital room muttering, “We’ll see about that!” when she was told Abe couldn’t have any visitors after he was hit in the head and who was ready to tear Whitley King limb to limb when she learned that Whitley had kidnapped Abe and made him think SHE was Paulina. How much worse will she be when it comes to avenging Chanel’s heartbreak? Most people wouldn’t dare cross EJ on his best day, but Paulina will not hesitate to take her rage out on him or his son. (Peacock/Screenshot) How Will Paulina’s Wrath Affect Multiple EJ Storylines? Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-30-24 don’t say anything about Paulina confronting EJ, but we already know that his job is in jeopardy. Jada asked Paulina on Friday to do something about EJ. She wants Paulina to replace him because he is an incompetent and corrupt DA who will decline to prosecute guilty people if there is a conflict of interest and will never recuse himself. Paulina might be hesitant to play musical DAs. Her last switch from EJ to Trask and back to EJ again didn’t go well and probably didn’t help her approval rating. Still, even if she’s hesitant at first, Paulina will quickly change her mind if she learns that EJ’s son broke her daughter’s heart.  EJ has bigger problems to deal with, considering Rafe’s doppelganger has become the houseguest from hell that won’t leave and the real Rafe is on his doorstep, but if he loses the DA position, he loses the only leverage he has over anybody. (Peacock/Screenshot) One Story That Won’t Go Away: The Fake Rafe Nonsense Unfortunately, this Rafe doppelganger storyline will continue into the New Year, and Rafe is likely to be miserable soon. Only in Salem can someone be at risk of being thrown into a dungeon and replaced by a lookalike simply by ringing the doorbell, but here we are… again. With Rafe at the door and a phony Rafe in the living room, the only way this can end is with Rafe locked in that damn secret room that the Salem PD never remembers to check when people go missing. This story was old before it began. Doppelgangers have been part of Days of Our Lives for as long as I can remember, but outgoing head writer Ron Carlivarti has taken it to a new level, offering a new doppelganger story at least once a month. Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-30-24 say that Jada thinks Rafe is “acting strange,” so it’s obvious that she’s dealing with Fake Rafe, not her fiance. Ugh. (Peacock/Screenshot) Sophia And Tate’s New Year Likely Won’t Be Happy Either Tate screwed up badly by not telling Holly that his ex-girlfriend is pregnant. Holly’s already upset that he turned so quickly to her one-time BFF, especially since he had sex with Sophia and wants to wait endlessly for the right time with her, so it’s 50-50 how it would have gone if she’d found out that he’d fathered a child with Sophia. Still, Tate lying to her about why he can’t go to the concert Friday night so he can go with Sophia to an abortion clinic in another state was only asking for trouble. This looks like an affair, and it doesn’t help that Sophia wants it to be one. (Peacock/Screenshot) Sophia already did a lot of whining about how unfair it is that Tate and Holly are happy together when she’s pregnant with his child. She thought that his answer to learning she was pregnant would be to dump Holly to be with her for the baby’s sake, and instead, he offered to go out of state with her so she could get an abortion. The abortion likely wouldn’t have happened anyway — assuming there was a baby in the first place, which Sophia’s behavior makes me wonder about. This happens all the time on Days of Our Lives. Countless numbers of Salem women have gone to the clinic and decided they couldn’t go through with it. It’s a shame that Sophia couldn’t have a real story about abortion. Explaining that she was considering it but her uber-religious family would never accept it, nor would they accept that she had sex before marriage, was a good start. It’s especially important to tell authentic stories about this now when reproductive rights in the United States are in jeopardy, and having Sophia have to cross state lines fits into that. But making it a typical story about two girls jealous of one another and fighting over the same man ruins it, especially when Tate could have avoided some of this drama by telling Holly what was going on. (Peacock/Screenshot) Not Everyone Will Have A Miserable New Year Believe it or not, Days of Our Lives spoilers for the week of 12-30-24 promise some happy news for some people. As is typical for New Year’s in TV Land, several couples will get together. There might even be good news for Holly, as Doug III will offer a sympathetic ear, and she may move on with him. Of course, he’s a criminal who stole Alice Horton’s necklace, but still. There’s potential there. There may also be sparks for Stephanie and Philip, and Alex might decide to date Joy for real.  Most prominently. JJ and Gabi decide to take things to the next level.   I’m not sure how I feel about that since they’ve been together for all of one date since JJ’s been back in town, and Gabi is still in denial that she wants more than friendship, but at least it keeps both characters in Salem and is an antidote to all the broken hearts and doom and gloom elsewhere.
