  "text": "Where will Dexter hide the bodies now? Even more importantly: Did he just uncover significant clues about the season’s nefarious kidnapper? Heading into Original Sin’s seventh episode, our titular antihero enters an active crime scene with Levi Reed’s dead corpse in his truck. (Risky much?) Luckily, his Miami Metro badge helps him avert suspicion, as he greets Masuka and LaGuerta. A found body part could lead to partial prints, so what’s a serial killer to do? He tosses the arm to a gator when nobody’s looking and acts like he was attacked. Problem No. 1: solved. But there’s still the other dead body to take care of, and that one goes into a dumpster. Is it the best plan? Probably not. But it’ll do… for now. FLASHBACK | Laura’s patience for her undercover gig is running low. It’s been almost a year and the danger (and her fear) is escalating. She’s picked up by one of Estrada’s men and finally gets an introduction to Hector at his massive compound. (Turns out he’s kind of a snack, too.) After making her strip nekkid and take a swim with him in his luxurious pool (to ensure there aren’t any wires on her and to establish trust), he tells her he’s impressed with how she’s built up her business. He’s planning on expanding sales to the northeast and wants her to learn more about their operation… at a shipyard next week. (AHHH!!) He won’t confirm whether he’ll be there, but says he’ll see her soon. Back in the present, things aren’t looking good for the captive Nicky. The boy creates a makeshift weapon and attempts to use it on his kidnapper, but after the failed attack, the kidnapper lops off his finger with pruning shears and sends it to the station. After Tanya runs the print, she confirms to Spencer that the digit is his son’s. However, a small spatter of blood on the outside of the box could potentially be the perp’s. It’s a long shot, but it’s something. Dexter examines the finger and realizes there’s a small hesitation cut on the boy’s finger that wasn’t on Jimmy Powell’s. After finding the bossman crawling through the lab report, Dexter tells him what he found. In addition, the lab results indicate that the killer shares Nicky’s blood type. When Dexter sees a bandage wrapped around the captain’s wrist, that’s when the wheels start turning. He deduces that he’s gonna need to find a new dumping ground way sooner than he thought… In the episode’s final scene, we see someone buying the same Lunchables-style kids meals that the abducted children have been getting fed. As a grocery store employee makes small talk, the camera slowly pans up to show us the customer’s identity and it’s… Captain Spencer?! OTHER GORY DETAILS * What’s the over/under on Spencer actually being the masked kidnapper? Could this potentially be a red herring or are you 100% sold on him being the Big Bad? * Sofia and Dexter are donezo. (Too bad, so sad.) But Dex doesn’t really have Prince Charming energy anyway, so no surprise there. But the split does cause friction and a platonic break-up between Deb and her friend, which is kind of a bummer. Debora then punches a teammate in the face, gets kicked off the team and is suspended from school. Classic Deb! * Lastly, yes, I’m still waving the “More Sarah Michelle Gellar” flag over here, thankyouverymuch. Now it’s your turn! Thoughts on Episode 7? We want to here ’em! Drop some comments below.",
