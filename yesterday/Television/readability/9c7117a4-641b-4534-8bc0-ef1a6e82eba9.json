  "text": "Chris Estrada will be doing some heavy lifting for NBC. Estrada (This Fool) will star in Forklift, a new single-camera comedy in the works at the network, according to our sister site Deadline. Estrada will also co-write and executive-produce the series about a forklift driver who gets promoted to warehouse supervisor and “finds that upward mobility comes with a cost when his friends and co-workers go from viewing him as their brother to now being part of Big Brother.” Estrada is a stand-up comedian who co-created and starred in Hulu’s This Fool, which wrapped up a two-season run in 2023. He also guest-starred in an episode of NBC’s Lopez vs. Lopez earlier this year. In other recent casting news: * Sarah Bolger (Once Upon a Time) and Stanley Morgan (The Serpent Queen) have joined the cast of The Westies, the MGM+ crime drama starring Titus Welliver and J.K. Simmons. Per Variety, Bolger has been cast as a steely IRA operative, while Morgan will play “the impulsive troublemaker of the Westies gang.” * Fox’s Memory of a Killer, starring Patrick Dempsey and Michael Imperioli, has added Odeya Rush (Lady Bird) as the married and pregnant daughter of Dempsey’s character Angelo, a hitman who has developed early-onset Alzheimer’s, Deadline reports. * Fox’s Best Medicine, a midseason dramedy based on the UK series Doc Martin, has cast Cree (Big Sky, Mr. Iglesias) as “adorable and energetic” medical receptionist Elaine Denham, Variety reports. The character was played by Lucy Punch on the original series. Hit the comments with your thoughts on the castings above!",
