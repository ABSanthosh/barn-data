This Showtime thriller leaves viewers questioning whether there are supernatural elements or if we just want them to ease our consciences about some of the characters’ grave misgivings. There’s no doubt that Yellowjackets is one of the few recent series to have dug so deeply into our psyche. So, what’s next? Let’s explore Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 1, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Has Yellowjackets Been Renewed? Hot on the heels of the success of Yellowjackets Season 1, the Showtime network announced plans for Seasons 2 and Season 3. According to Showtime and Paramount Media Networks CEO and President Chris McCarthy, “Season 1’s success was so impressive, we fast-tracked the approval of Season 3 to maximize the momentum.” Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 5, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) So, before Season 2 even aired, we knew another season would come. Perhaps that should have prepared many viewers for the major cliffhangers we experienced with the Season 2 finale, “Storytelling.” But most of us weren’t ready for how Yellowjackets ended after bringing in characters we hadn’t seen since the girls returned from the wild. Now, our question is, when do we get answers for Season 3? Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 5, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) How Did Yellowjackets Season 2 End? The final episode of Yellowjackets Season 2 left us with some serious loose ends. In the past timeline, we watch Ben burn down the cabin before trying to hide away from the madness (perhaps supernatural) that has its hold on the girls. And in the present, we see the death of adult Natalie. Given Misty’s role in her passing, some fans wonder if Natalie (Lewis) will return in Season 3 to haunt Misty (Ricci) with guilt. Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 1, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) We discovered that the woman in the tree haunting Taissa’s (Cypress) son is actually her in the throes of sleepwalking. We see brief scenes of her sleepwalking in the past too, leaving some troubling suspicions for future episodes. It also sets the stage for her reconnection with Van (Ambrose), whom we haven’t seen thus far in the present timeline. We cheered her on in the past as she survived a brutal bear mauling. Just when we get her back in our lives, there’s the chance that she’ll be out just as fast. Season 2 ended with the announcement that Van has terminal cancer and isn’t expected to live long. She has zero interest in fighting back. But will Taissa’s appearance — and need for help — change her mind? Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 1, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Show Season 3 Plot (and Spoilers!) There are quite a few loose ends to tie up from the Season 2 finale, meaning it will be a busy season. And how will that guilt affect Misty’s already unhinged personality? At least she has Walter (Wood) to keep her grounded. Or will he make her more deranged than she already is? What happened to Ben (Krueger) in the past, and why haven’t we seen him so far in the present timeline? Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 1 streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025 (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Perhaps karma caught up with him, and he’s the body we saw being cooked in the beginning but has yet to be identified. We also want answers to the supernatural undercurrent we’ve witnessed over the last two seasons. What caused the girls to split into rival groups, and how were they rescued? Will Taissa be able to overcome her sleepwalking issue and reclaim her family? Or will she cave to the wildness and lose her humanity? Will her reconnection with Van give Van the will to fight back against her terminal cancer? She did survive a brutal bear attack. Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 3, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Colin Bentley/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Yellowjackets Season 3 Episodes Yellowjackets Season 1 had ten episodes, while Season 2 had only nine. Season 3’s number hasn’t been announced, but it’s predicted to be at least nine. While co-creator Ashley Lyle (@ashannlyle) once teased her Twitter (X) followers with hints of a bonus episode airing sometime in 2024 before the release of Season 3, it doesn’t seem like that’s coming to fruition. Returning Show Season 3 Cast The Yellowjackets drama features an all-star cast of Critics Choice Awards, Emmy nominees, and winners. With two timelines to follow, each main character has two actors — an adult and a teen counterpart. But there are still a few original teen cast members who have yet to be seen in the present timeline. Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 5, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Some of the returning original characters include: Shauna — Melanie Lynskey (adult) and Sophie Nelisse (teen) Taissa — Tawny Cypress (adult) and Jasmin Savoy Brown (teen) Natalie — Sophie Thatcher (teen) * there might be little to no appearances from Juliette Lewis since the adult Natalie died in Season 2 Misty — Christina Ricci (adult) and Samantha Hanratty (teen) Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 3, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Colin Bentley/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Lottie — Simone Kessel (adult) and Courtney Eaton (teen) Van — Lauren Ambrose (adult) and Liv Hewson (teen) Other returning characters include: Walter — Elijah Wood Ben Scott — Steven Krueger Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 2, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Travis — Kevin Alves Jeff — Warren Kole Several additional characters from the ’90s timeline have yet to appear in the present, leaving us to wonder which characters will die next in Season 3. The creators of Yellowjackets stated that they hope to have a five-season series, so it’s unlikely that they’ll kill off the entire 90s team this season. But nothing official has been announced, so there’s no guarantee of how they’ll handle the storyline. (Kailey Schwerman/SHOWTIME.) The end of Season 2 left us wondering if we’ll see the teens’ demise in the past timeline, which has yet to be seen in the present. The season finale hinted at the difficulties as the cabin burned to the ground. Will new actors be introduced in Season 3, like the adult Van storyline that was left up in the air, entangled with the chaos of Taissa? Character Lottie did hint in Season 2 that only six of the Yellowjackets girls’ soccer players survived the wilderness. These were Lottie, Misty, Natalie (now dead), Van, Shauna, and Taissa. Recently, news broke that comedian Joel McHale will be a guest star for the third season. However, no clues have been given to his role. Hale’s most known for appearing in Animal Control, The Bear, House of Villians, and Crime Scene Kitchen. We also know that Hillary Swank will guest star, but other than seeing her bloodied on the side of the road in the brand-new trailer, we have no idea who she will be. Yellowjackets Season 3 Episode 2, streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME, 2025. (Kailey Schwerman/Paramount+ with SHOWTIME) Yellowjackets Season 3 Trailer The first teaser trailer has just been released, along with a slew of new photos (which can be seen throughout this article). There is a LOT to digest for those willing to dig deep into the thrillingly brief scenes from the teaser. Take a look for yourself and let us know what you think. Yellowjackets Season 3 Release Date Yellowjackets Season 3 will return with two new episodes on Paramount+ with Showtime on Friday, February 14. Happy Valentine’s Day! Nothing says love like a bunch of traumatized survivors who haven’t been able to get past their horrifying past for decades! Those with the Showtime cable package will have to wait until Sunday, February 16 to see the premiere episodes. You know what that means — stay away from social media and websites like this! Where to Watch Yellowjackets Season 3 Although Yellowjackets is a Showtime production, you can stream it on the Paramount+ with Showtime two days earlier. Watch Yellowjackets Online",
