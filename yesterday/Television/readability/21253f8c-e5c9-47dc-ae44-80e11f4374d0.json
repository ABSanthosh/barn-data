  "text": "Derrick No. 2 makes Gaby laugh, he knows all the lyrics to “Tubthumping” and she can be herself around him. So is she really going to let a seemingly perfect guy slip through her fingers? In Wednesday’s episode of Shrinking, Gaby struggled to fully commit to the budding couple’s situationship. After riding shotgun to Gaby’s less-than-stellar advice to Alice, Derrick began to realize that Gaby’s noncommittal attitude toward him may be here to stay and he wasn’t having it. And once he deduced that Gaby invited the entire dang world to Thanksgiving dinner but not him, he called her “f–ked up” and stormed out. Needless to say, the couple’s fate is up in the air heading into the season finale (which drops on Apple TV+ a day early, Tuesday, Dec. 24). So why can’t Gaby fully get down with this absolute catch that’s staring her in the face? According to Damon Wayans Jr., Derrick is “starting to get a little frustrated.” “In his mind, Derrick sees this woman as like, ‘This is the woman I could settle down with potentially,'” the actor tells TVLine. “She just has to get out of her own way to let that happen. But I think he also likes her enough and likes her friend group enough to where he wouldn’t mind just being friends with her if it came down to that. I’m sure he’d prefer being in a relationship. But yeah, she has to figure out if she’s gonna sort it out or not.” Even when the couple started regularly dating, Gaby still continued to give the guy the cold shoulder. “If you watch her and Derrick’s trajectory, he’s always trying to hang out with her,” he says. “She’s still only giving pieces of her. It’s like, ‘Come on, man! You know that we’re good together. Why are you making this so hard?'” Viewers will learn more about the couple’s future in Episode 12, but despite the show’s on-screen drama, Wayans only has positive things to report about the cast behind the scenes. “Everybody on that show is just chef’s kiss, man,” he says, adding that they’re “great people to be around” and “comedic titans.” His kudos are especially directed toward his scene partner Jessica Williams whom he calls a “star.” “I don’t know how to say it in a more meaningful way, but it’s very rare that you work with somebody and you’re just having an out of body experience watching you two interact,” he says. “She really brings that. She has this light in her eyes and you have to be ready to respond. She’s gonna say something that’s not on script, it’s gonna be hilarious and you have to be ready. She gives you that feeling. Man, what a treasure she is.”   Are you holding out hope for Gaby to come to her senses? Let us know in the comments below.",
