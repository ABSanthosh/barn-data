  "text": "The following contains spoilers from Tuesday’s FBI Season 7 premiere. Special Agent Tiffany Wallace showed up for her “last day of school” in CBS‘ FBI Season 7 premiere on Tuesday night. Katherine Renee Kane’s character was highlighted in several of last season’s episodes, when Agent Hobbs, with whom Tiffany had worked undercover, was killed by a terrorist named Hakim Siran. Tiffany promised Hobbs’ family justice, and was able to deliver it in the season finale, when the team caught up to Hakim and Tiff gunned him down (in self defense). Tiff, though, didn’t get closure for herself. Because early in the Season 7 premiere, we learned that she had already given notice, and was helping Scola, Maggie et al investigate a curious truck bombing on her “last day of school.” “It makes sense to need some time off” after the whole Hakim thing, Scola told his partner. But, “this does not have to be permanent,” he suggested. “Scola,” she responded, flatly. “Have you ever talked me out of anything? Ever? Once? Ever?” Point taken. “Sorry,” Tiffany added a beat later, “but there’s nothing more dangerous than having a partner who didn’t want to be in the field anymore, but stuck around anyway.” Luckily for Scola, Tiffany was out in the field with the team when the hunt for a pair of Ducati-riding gunmen led to a footchase through Penn Station. With Maggie and OA rushing two murder targets to safety, Scola was sneaked up on and stabbed in the thigh by one of the suspects. Tiffany rushed to Scola’s aide, using her belt as a tourniquet. “To think I was gonna call in sick today…,” she quipped. Later, once the Case of the Week was cracked, Maggie suggested that she and Tiffany make time next week for a drink, but Tiffany said she will be long gone by then, moving to Georgia, as she is, to live near her sister. What was it, Maggie asked, that prompted Tiffany to hit the “eject” button? “It wasn’t any one thing,” Tiffany answered. “I just wanted closure. I thought I’d get that after Hakim was gone; I didn’t.” The Biggest Cast Exits of 2024 (So Far) And why did Kane herself hit “eject” on FBI — or vice versa — after a four-season run? “It was time to look towards new creative endeavors,” the actress said in an August statement. “I’m excited for the future and wish the show all the best.” Incoming FBI showrunner Mike Weiss, meanwhile, addressed Kane’s exit in TVLine’s Returning Favorites Fall Preview, saying, “Of course it’s going to be a little tough this season to be making FBI without Katherine. She’s such a major talent and she will be deeply missed on set by cast and crew — but myself, the cast, and crew, can’t wait to cheer her on as fans in her future projects.” In the wake of Kane’s exit news, FBI cast Lisette Olivera (of Disney+’s National Treasure: Edge of History series) in the series regular role of Syd, a Behavior Analysis Unit agent who gets rotated onto Jubal’s team. Olivera’s first airdate has not yet been announced. Want scoop on any FBI show? Shoot an email to InsideLine@tvline.com, and your question may be answered via Matt’s Inside Line!",
