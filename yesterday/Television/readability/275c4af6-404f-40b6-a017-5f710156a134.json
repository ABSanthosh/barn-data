  "text": "The 30th annual Critics Choice Awards ceremony, which has been delayed twice due to the L.A. wildfires, finally has a new date. The ceremony will now be held Friday, Feb. 7, starting at 7 pm ET, and be broadcast on E!, live from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica. The show will also be available to stream the next day on Peacock. However, a previously planned red-carpet special, Live from E!: Critics Choice Awards, will no longer air ahead of the telecast. The Critics Choice Awards were originally set for Sunday, Jan. 12, but had to be postponed when high winds led to devastating fires that destroyed thousands of buildings and left many homeless in the L.A. neighborhoods of Pacific Palisades and Altadena. The ceremony was initially rescheduled for Sunday, Jan. 26, but that date, too, had to be moved as the fires continued to wreak havoc. “This unfolding tragedy has already had a profound impact on our community. All our thoughts and prayers are with those battling the devastating fires and with all who have been affected,” CCA CEO Joey Berlin said in a statement. This year’s Critics Choice Awards will be hosted by comedienne/TV personality Chelsea Handler, TVLine has confirmed. Heading into the 2025 Critics Choice Awards, FX’s highly acclaimed drama Shōgun led the pack with six total nominations. Shōgun was one of eight shows to earn a nod in the Best Drama Series category, while cast members Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai, Tadanobu Asano, Takehiro Hira and Moeka Hoshi all picked up nominations for their work, as well. Shōgun to date has already earned 18 Emmys, four Golden Globes and four Television Critics Association Awards. Following close behind at this year’s Critics Choice Awards are ABC’s Abbott Elementary, Apple TV+’s Disclaimer, Max’s Hacks, Netflix’s The Diplomat, HBO’s The Penguin and FX’s What We Do in the Shadows, all of which scored four nominations each.",
