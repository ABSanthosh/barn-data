  "text": "As the cast of The Studio can attest, working with acclaimed actor Bryan Cranston exceeded their expectations, but what maybe surprised them the most was (oddly enough) the Breaking Bad star’s fit physique. In an interview that includes Seth Rogen, Catherine O’Hara, Kathryn Hahn, Chase Sui Wonders and Ike Barinholtz, the ensemble couldn’t praise Cranston’s physical comedy prowess enough, but Barinholtz took their shared accolades one step beyond. “His body is amazing! He’s in incredible shape,” he tells TVLine in the video above. “If there’s one takeaway from this interview, it’s Bryan Cranston has a great body.” The rest of the actors erupt in laughter at Barinholtz’s comment, including Rogen, who exudes one of his signature belly laughs that fans have come to love. “That’s the headline,” the show’s head honcho says with a smile. One certainly would need some A+ physicality given the events of the show’s season finale (now streaming on Apple TV+). For starters, Cranston’s Griffin climbs up a large water fountain and performs a sex act on the statuesque water feature. It only gets weider from there. As Matt desperately tries to sober up his boss ahead of a big presentation they hope will stave off the sale of Continental Studios to Amazon, Griffin’s consumption of an ungodly amount of mushrooms and other assorted drugs catches up with him. It’s as if he’s starring in his own Fear and Loathing sequel. The executive then winds up splayed out at the base of the sculpture, soaking wet and dead to the world. The group comes to the only rational and sane conclusion they can think of: They must “Weekend at Bernies” Griffin through the casino in order to prop him up on stage. What follows is a melee of pratfalls and freak-outs, a guffaw-worthy display by this fine group of actors. In the clip above, the cast waxes poetic about puppeteering Cranston’s lifeless body throughout Vegas, all amid their characters’ sheer panic. Hahn says Cranston was “so game” throughout the climactic season ender, while Sui Wonders adds that he was “a committed actor” who continued to throw new ideas into the mix in order to keep one-upping whatever scene or moment they found themselves in. “I remember one time, because we’re wheeling around his corpse and we were in a real hotel room, I picked up a dental kit,” Sui Wonders recalls, “and he goes, ‘You thinking what I’m thinking? Yeah, you’re gonna brush my dead body. You’re gonna have that toothbrush in my mouth before I come to.'” To help revive their blasted boss, Matt and his employees take a page out of another movie’s script: Denzel Washington’s Flight. They cover his mouth up and stuff some cocaine up Griffin’s nose in hopes that this drug gets him lucid enough to show face during the presentation. To his credit, he does make it to stage, plummeting from the ceiling on a pair of wires, but his drug-addled brain can only utter a single word: “Movies.” Realizing Griffin isn’t going to be of any further help, Matt improvises and urges the entire audience to repeatedly chant “movies!” as confetti rains down from above. Uhh, mission accomplished? Press PLAY on the video above to hear what else the cast had to say, then vote in our polls below and drop some comments.",
