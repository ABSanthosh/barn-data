What is… watching Jeopardy! from the comfort of your own couch? The Ken Jennings-hosted daily quiz show will finally be available to stream, showrunner Michael Davies tells our sister site Rolling Stone. Per Davies, 14% of the show’s viewership currently comes from people accessing episodes illegally uploaded to YouTube. In order to protect the series, “we have to expand,” Davies says. “We can’t just leave it exactly where it is. We mustn’t change the format… but we have to expand or it’s going to be in trouble.” Sony will be shopping the next-day streaming rights for the series in the fall, but it remains to be seen who will pay the price and when it will start to be available online. The series will then join its offshoots, which are already accessible to watch online, with ABC’s Celebrity Jeopardy! and Jeopardy Masters! available to stream next-day on Hulu. Late last year, Amazon released its own offshoot, Pop Culture Jeopardy!, hosted by Saturday Night Live’s Colin Jost. New episodes drop every Wednesday and stream exclusively on Prime Video.
