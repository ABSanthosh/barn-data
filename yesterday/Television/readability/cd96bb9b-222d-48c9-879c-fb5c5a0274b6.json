  "text": "Y’all do love to see a Squid Game played. Season 2 of Netflix‘s most-watched series of all time topped the streamer’s non-English TV list with 68 million views, breaking the record for most views for a show in its premiere week (previously set by Wednesday Season 1 in 2022, with 50.1 million) and ranking No. 1 in no fewer than 92 countries. Since its release on Dec. 26, Squid Game‘s lonnnnnng-awaited sophomore run has already become Netflix’s seventh-most popular non-English TV show in record time. NFL Christmas Gameday Live coverage of the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans (which featured Beyoncé’s halftime performance) and the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers claimed the No. 1 and No. 2 spots on the English TV list (with a little over 14 million views each). (Netflix rightly defines a “view” as “total stream time divided by runtime.”) Squid Game‘s nine-episode freshman run, which was (quietly) released in September 2021, has to date amassed 265.2 million views, making it Netflix’s most-watched series of all time. (Wednesday Season 1 holds the title for English-language Netflix series, with 252.1 million views.) Squid Game Season 1 also stands as a Top 10 all-time show in three different countries. Squid Game Season 1 followed Seong Gi-hun (played by Emmy winner Lee Jung-jae), a gambling-prone divorcé, as he and 455 other strangers were whisked away to a secret island complex to compete in a series of children’s games all given decidedly deadly spins. Ultimately emerging from that ordeal as the sole survivor, Gi-hun in Season 2 vowed to track down the Front Man (aka In-ho, played by Lee Byung-hun) and end his operation once and for all.  TVLine readers gave Season 2 an average grade of “B,” while its torturous cliffhanger finale earned a “B-.” Season 3 aka the final season was announced back in July, and is confirmed by Netflix to be released in 2025 — “probably summer or fall,” series creator Hwang Dong-hyuk told our sister site Variety. Read our Season 2 recaps of the game–changing reveal at the end of Episode 3… the outcome of the brutal men’s room brawl in Episode 6… and the action-packed finale, which teed up Season 3 with a tragic death. We also sang the praises of two cast members in our Performer of the Week column, and raised 15 burning questions that Season 2 left us with!
