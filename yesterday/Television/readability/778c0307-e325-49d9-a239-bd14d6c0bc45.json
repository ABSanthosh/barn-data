  "text": "It’s no secret that many fans of the 9-1-1 franchise have mixed feelings about adding another series. Unfortunately, the more series a franchise acquires, the more likely some shows will suffer over others. In the case of 9-1-1, its first spinoff faced a painful death on FOX, and we barely had time to grieve before they were ushering us into a new era. It would be a bit easier to swallow if 9-1-1: Nashville didn’t already feel as if it’s too close to 9-1-1: Lone Star from location all the way to character and plot setups. (Disney/Anne Marie Fox) But one has to imagine that Ryan Murphy and ABC anticipated the frustration and malaise of some fans with this idea, so there feels like a conscious effort to ensure this latest project is big. For starters, 9-1-1: Nashville was fortunate enough to get a straight-to-series order. It’s not something that happens too often, but because of Disney’s deal with Ryan Murphy, it makes sense that they’d give him so much free reign, even if he does come up with questionable series, like Doctor Odyssey. With full backing, this latest spinoff feels like they’re going for an even flashier version of 9-1-1: Lone Star, capitalizing on Disney’s larger budget and the different overall vibe. And nothing confirms that more than how big 9-1-1: Nashville is going with its casting. We already have Chris O’Donnell helming the series. (Michael Yarish/CBS) He’s a prolific actor in his own right in film and television, and this will mark his first big role since he signed off on CBS’ NCIS: Los Angeles. The O’Donnell casting was definitely a wise choice, not only because he’s a solid actor but also because he has a built-in fanbase who will happily flock to his next project, even if it’s something that would’ve appealed to him before. It also means we have a stalwart actor at the center of the series, keeping the same vein as both 9-1-1 and Lone Star, with established actors Peter Krause and Rob Lowe at the helm. Frustration over the redundancy of lead character demographic aside, it’s evident that the franchise has a formula that they’re happily trying to stick to here. (Kevin Estrada/FOX) But now, we have the news that Grey’s Anatomy‘s Jessica Capshaw will star in the series as well. It’ll be her first major television role, particularly as a series regular, since she departed Grey’s Anatomy in controversial fashion. With her addition to the series, it’s starting to feel a bit strategic, doesn’t it? For anyone who had reservations about yet another 9-1-1 series or those who are still rightfully upset about Lone Star’s cancelation and terrible final season, it feels like they’re squashing any dissent with casting choices. Any Grey’s Anatomy fan will tell you that placing Jessica Capshaw in anything is bound to bring legions of fans to the forefront, willing to support one of the series’ most beloved and popular actresses in her next big role. (Disney/Anne Marie Fox) If O’Donnell was clever, Capshaw is glaringly strategic — enough so that I’m genuinely curious if the series will stop there (because we have to keep budget in mind, after all) or push it further with other casting choices that tap into some of broadcast’s most dynamic and popular series. Given the polarizing reaction to this spinoff, it seems like 9-1-1: Nashville is intentionally making it more challenging to oppose it. With each bit of news trickling in, there’s a deliberate effort to pique interest and ensure they have a built-in fanbase of viewers rallying around the show before it even airs. But maybe I’m reading too much into this. (Disney/Christopher Willard) What do you think? How did you initially feel about this spinoff?
