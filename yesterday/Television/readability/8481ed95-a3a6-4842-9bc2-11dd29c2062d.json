  "text": "Television has always been a reflection of society’s darker fascinations, but the rise of serial killers and true crime has taken center stage in recent years. From fictional antiheroes like Dexter Morgan and Joe Goldberg to dramatizations of real-life horrors like Dahmer and The Act, our screens are filled with stories of murder, manipulation, and mayhem. But why do these characters captivate us so deeply? And where is the line between exploring human darkness and exploiting real-life tragedy? Dexter Morgan – Dexter (Showtime) As Dexter: Original Sin brings us closer to the roots of one of TV’s most iconic killers, let’s dig into how TV turned these murderers into cultural icons — and why true crime has become a genre we can’t seem to quit. Fictional Killers: Charming, Terrifying, and…Sympathetic? There’s something about fictional killers that lures us in. Dexter Morgan, a forensic expert by day and vigilante serial killer by night, stands out as a character we’re not only willing to watch but actually root for. His rigid code—he only kills other murderers — makes him more relatable, even though his actions are far from justifiable. Joe Goldberg – YOU (Netflix) His struggles with loneliness and alienation, coupled with his morality in a chaotic world, give his character a depth that makes him hard to resist. Then there’s Joe Goldberg from YOU, the “nice guy” who manipulates, stalks, and murders anyone who threatens his twisted version of love. Joe narrates his crimes with the charm of a rom-com lead, making his darkness all the more intriguing. These characters give us a chance to explore the darker parts of ourselves without actually experiencing real-world consequences. But at what point do we cross the line between exploring human depravity and glorifying it? Dahmer (Netflix) The Rise of True Crime and Horror: Serial Killers in Fiction and Reality While fictional killers like Dexter and Joe Goldberg captivate us, the true crime genre has exploded in popularity over the past decade, driven by the desire to understand what makes killers tick. But the fascination doesn’t stop at realistic portrayals of murderers. American Horror Story: Hotel blurred the line between horror and real-life serial killer history by introducing a version of H.H. Holmes (James March character), the notorious Chicago murderer who once turned a hotel into a killing chamber. On AHS: Hotel Season 5 Episode 4 “Devil’s Night,” March even hosted a dinner featuring infamous criminals like Eileen Wuornos, John Wayne Gacy, Richard Ramirez, and other killers, making a macabre spectacle out of history’s darkest figures. Richard Ramirez – American Horror Story: Hotel (FX/Screenshot) This mix of fictionalized horror and real-life serial killers amplifies the allure, turning historical figures into characters in an ongoing narrative of violence. AHS: Hotel didn’t just lean into the grotesque — it celebrated the idea that these killers’ legacies could become part of popular culture. It underscores how our obsession with murder has grown beyond just the screen and into almost every corner of media. These stories challenge the boundaries of ethics in storytelling. Is it okay to turn the pain and trauma of real people into drama? At what point do we risk crossing the line from awareness to voyeurism? Eileen Wournos – American Horror Story: Hotel (FX/Screenshot) Our obsession with serial killers isn’t just a TV phenomenon; it’s rooted in real-life cases that have captivated audiences for decades. Ted Bundy, for instance, remains the #1 killer we can’t look away from — even years after his execution. His charm, intelligence, and ability to manipulate made him a figure of public fascination, much like the fictional killers we watch on screen, such as Dexter and Joe. This fascination isn’t just a passing trend or TV trope; it’s a genuine, unsettling curiosity about what drives people to commit such violence — and why we can’t seem to look away. James March – American Horror Story: Hotel (FX/Screenshot) No discussion about TV’s portrayal of serial killers would be complete without diving into Hannibal Lecter, a character so expertly crafted, he’s both a horrific murderer and a deeply cultured, almost charismatic figure. Played to perfection by Mads Mikkelsen on Hannibal, Lecter is the epitome of a charming monster. His ability to manipulate those around him while maintaining an air of sophistication is precisely what makes him so captivating. He’s a killer who can discuss fine wine and classical music one moment and then, without hesitation, turn into a monstrous figure the next. His relationship with Will Graham makes Hannibal different from other fictional killers. Hannibal Lecter – Hannibal (Brooke Palmer/NBC) Their complex dynamic is one of the series’ most fascinating aspects. Will, a gifted profiler, is drawn into Hannibal’s world both intellectually and emotionally. Their connection is unsettling as Will starts to blur the lines between himself and Hannibal. It’s this interplay of good versus evil, of light versus darkness, that elevates Hannibal beyond just another monster on TV. In many ways, Hannibal mirrors the real-world appeal of killers like Ted Bundy. Both are intelligent, manipulative and, on the surface, surprisingly charismatic. Bundy’s ability to charm his way into people’s lives — despite the horrific acts he was committing — shares striking similarities with Lecter’s manipulations. Ted Bundy – Conversations with a Serial Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes (Netflix/Screenshot) The TV portrayal of Hannibal, just like Bundy, forces us to question: How do we reconcile these characters’ charming, intelligent parts with the grotesque acts they commit? Are we fascinated by their complexity, or are we in danger of excusing their crimes because of their charm? Why Do We Keep Watching? The answer to our obsession lies in psychology. Humans have a natural curiosity about danger and the unknown. Serial killers give us an opportunity to confront our fears and anxieties from a safe distance, analyzing them without any real-world threat. Gypsy Rose – The Act (Hulu/Screenshot) True crime shows often offer closure, allowing us to see killers caught and victims’ stories told — something we crave in a world where justice isn’t always served. But there’s also a dark thrill in watching these shows. Just as Dexter uses his dark urges to balance out his moral code, audiences feed their own morbid curiosity with each new true crime hit. We’re not just watching for justice; we’re watching because we’re drawn to the darkness. Hannibal and Will – Hannibal (Brooke Palmer/NBC) Where Does the Line Blur? The ethical question of how far TV should go when portraying serial killers and true crime stories is more pertinent than ever. Shows like Dahmer and The Act remind us that while the allure of these stories is undeniable, we must ask ourselves whether we are becoming complicit in exploiting real-life victims. Fictional killers like Dexter, Hannibal Lecter, and even Norman Bates from Bates Motel, while disturbing, allow us to distance ourselves from the true horrors of their actions. True crime, on the other hand, demands a deeper ethical reckoning. Norman Bates – Bates Motel (Cate Cameron/A\u0026amp;E Networks) As shows like Dexter: Original Sin revisit the origins of one of TV’s most iconic antiheroes, we’re left to question: Are we using these stories to better understand the human mind—or are we just feeding our fascination with horror? The True Crime Boom: Here to Stay? TV’s portrayal of serial killers and true crime stories is far from new. But with modern series delving deeper into the psychology of killers and with real-life cases like Ted Bundy, Jeffrey Dahmer, and Gypsy Rose Blanchard holding our attention, the genre shows no signs of slowing down. The ethical boundaries between entertainment and exploitation continue to shift, and we, as viewers, must decide where we stand. John Wayne Gacy – Conversation with a Serial Killer: The John Wayne Gacy Tapes (Netflix/Screenshot) As new series continue to emerge on TV, we’re faced with the ongoing challenge of navigating our obsession with killers — real and fictional. At the end of the day, are we learning something meaningful about humanity? Or are we simply indulging in our darker desires? What do you think about TV’s portrayal of serial killers and true crime? Are we learning from these stories, or is it time to rethink how we consume them? Share your thoughts, and let’s unpack the ethics of our cultural obsession with murder.
