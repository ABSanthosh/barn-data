  "text": "Try to control your eye-rolls when I say things look rather rocky on the next episode of Fire Country. The joke was right there if you’ve seen the promo.  In all seriousness, the series has dealt with some dire situations, but this one has even this TV Fanatic stumped. Not to worry, though, because Edgewater’s hometown hero and Cal Fire’s own Superman firefighter are on the case.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) In the promo for Fire Country Season 3 Episode 12, Bode and Jake are out by a mountainside when they notice some boulders that appear to be the aftermath of an avalanche.  If a rock slides in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it even make a sound? Last rock pun, I promise.  It’s no big deal, though, because it happened before they got there, right?   The clip cuts to a disembodied voice asking for help before it closes in on human eyes trapped under the stone prison.  Normally, Jake and Bode could easily extract the victim with their well-developed upper body strength. The only problem is one of those rocks is a massive boulder.  Seriously, it’s huge.  (CBS/Screenshot) After Three Seasons of Fire Country, Two Brothers, and Lifelong Friends Are Finally Going to Show Just How Strong Their Bond Is  Things only seem to get worse as the two men race against time to save the trapped individual.  In the promo, Jake can be heard saying, “If there is a secondary slide, then none of us are getting out of here alive.”  Well, in a town like Edgewater, anything that can go wrong likely will and in the most dramatic way possible. At least the drama is not between two lifelong friends for once.  Despite currently being on Fire Country Season 3, Jake and Bode have not had many, if any, cases or assignments that paired them solely together.  In the instances when they worked closely together, there always seemed to be some issue at hand, whether it was Bode holding a grudge against Jake or Jake riding Bode hard during his Cal Fire training. (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) For once, it seems like audiences may get the chance to see them exercise some real brotherly love in the face of danger, just the two of them.  It would almost be sweet if not for the impending doom that will surely bring them to the edge of their training.  It kind of makes you ask yourself, where the heck is everyone?  It’s Somebody’s Party, and Manny Is Still Going Brood If He Wants To  Something seems to be afoot at the Cal Fire Station, and even though it looks to be a party with balloons and frills, everyone seems rather somber in the pictures for the next episode.  What this event could be about remains to be seen, but there’s a kid, and Three Rock firefighters are in attendance.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) It’s a little hard to guess just because CBS‘s Fire Country likes to use any excuse to throw a little shindig at the station from time to time.  There is definitely an element of arts and crafts, so it could be an outreach event for Three Rock, but that would seem complicated since the Three Rock men have strict rules about interacting with civilians.  It almost looks like a kid’s birthday party, but that makes even less sense since Gabriela is the only one from Cal Fire in the pictures.  Besides, Manny (Kevin Alejandro) doesn’t look to be in the most festive mood.  Is Fire Country About to Give a Firefighter an Early Retirement from the Series?  You know what seems to be the oddest thing about Fire Country Season 3 Episode 12? The title.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) With an episode called “I’m the One Who Just Goes Away,” you would be justified in raising an eyebrow at the ominous tone.  The rather mouthful of a title says volumes without saying anything.  Some readers have speculated that Gabriela’s character could be leaving because of her personal journey of growth and finding her place in the world.  I may have given Gabriela a lot of grief in my Fire Country Season 1 and Season 2 recaps, but I don’t think anyone truly wants the character to disappear.  Then again, the title could refer to Manny. He has been on the struggle bus for quite some time, backtracking from a captain to an inmate.  He and Gabriela managed to reconcile their issues, but Manny is still the kind of guy who won’t give himself a break for all the mistakes he’s made.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) The Perez family has been going through a lot for a while, and one of them may be past the point of no return.  At least it isn’t all somber news and deadly avalanches as, for once, Bode’s love life doesn’t seem like a car wreck waiting to happen.  Move Over Vince and Sharon Because There Is a New Fire Fighting Couple in Town  It was pretty brief, but in the promo for “I’m the One Who Just Goes Away,” Bode says to Audrey, “We should figure out what this is first,” before the two nearly kiss.  Does anyone else absolutely love this storyline for Bode? Audrey brings out a sweet and gentle side in him, giving the character more depth and layers.  Ever since Fire Country Season 3 Episode 9, he’s been far more compliant with commands and has been doing things by the book.  (Sergei Bachlakov/CBS) It’s hard not to correlate that with him always being partnered with Cal Fire’s toughest new probie.  If nothing else, I am looking forward to the moment that Bode tries to play overprotective with Audrey before she completely shuts that down.  Don’t get me wrong—I like Gabriela, especially with her paving her own path in the world. However, Audrey has stronger self-esteem and knows what she wants her life to look like.  Bode needs to be around people like him who have decided what their future should be and are prioritizing that.  The story has benefited greatly from the characters’ branching out from their typical roles from the first two seasons. The character development has been slow but impactful.  Bode looks less like a forced hero and more like a level-headed firefighter who is fantastic at his job but is making time for a personal life.  (CBS/Screenshot) It may just be me, but I love a work/life balance that mirrors Edgewater’s strongest couple, Sharon and Vince.  We’ll have to wait and see what happens.  For now, check out the promo for CBS’s Fire Country Season 3 Episode 12 below!  Do you think Audrey is the right fit for Bode at this point in his life?  What do you think Manny could be wrestling with in this episode?  Drop a comment below to let me know what you think, and join me again when I bring you more spoilers for Fire Country!
