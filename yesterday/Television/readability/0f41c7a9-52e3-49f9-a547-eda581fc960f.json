  "text": "Frasier plays host to a family reunion this week… but it’s not exactly all hugs and smiles. TVLine has an exclusive sneak peek at the episode, premiering this Thursday on Paramount+, with Community alum Yvette Nicole Brown guest-starring as Olivia’s infamously overachieving sister Monica. In the clip, which you can watch above, Monica grills Olivia about her new boyfriend Mark… who Olivia just made up on the spot. He plays Spanish guitar in the symphony, Olivia claims, but Monica tsk-tsk’s at the fact that he’s a soloist: “So he’s musically and emotionally unavailable.” Monica wonders if Olivia is attracted to men like this because of her “distant father” — but as Olivia points out, “he’s your father, too!” Olivia insists Mark is the right man for her, and he lives right here in Boston, so when Monica guesses that he’ll be at Frasier’s party, then, Olivia can’t help but say yes. So now who is Olivia going to rope into playing Mark? Can Alan do a Spanish accent? Elsewhere in the episode, titled “My Brilliant Sister,” Frasier scrambles to impress a reclusive author, and Freddy gets jealous when Eve takes a liking to an actor friend of hers. Do you think all of these storylines might overlap at the same party? If so, you’re a good guesser! Press PLAY above for a sneak peek at this week’s Frasier, and then hit the comments to give us your take on Season 2 so far.",
