  "text": "Warning: The following contains spoilers for Wednesday’s Abbott Elementary. Proceed at your own risk! Someone at Abbott Elementary is in need of a new job, and we’re not talking about a second gig for extra spending money à la Gregory. During Wednesday’s episode of the ABC comedy, Crystal visited the school, wanting to know why Abbott wasn’t in need of supplies, like usual, and Ava accidentally let it slip that they’ve been blackmailing the nearby golf course in exchange for fancy goods. Then O’Shon raced over to tell Ava that the school district got a tip about Abbott receiving bribes, and reps were on their way to perform an audit. Janine and the rest of the teachers scrambled to load up all the contraband they’ve gotten into a truck, but Manny and his fellow district reps (guest stars Jim Rash and Wayne Wilderson) showed up early. While Janine and company shuffled computers from room to room and cleared out the library’s fancy bean bags (“On it! This isn’t my first raid,” librarian Ms. Inez proclaimed), Ava led the reps on a carefully selected tour. The jig was almost up when the reps entered the gym and noticed an outdated Christmas 2009 banner over the new scoreboard, but then Mr. Johnson started a long-winded story that wore down their patience, and they began to leave. Just when it seemed like the Abbott crew had pulled off this haphazard scheme, the golf course lawyer Miles arrived and loudly declared that he comes bearing “fresh bribes,” aka Janine’s spellers. Miles then mistook the reps for teachers (“It’s hard to tell. You guys should carry yourselves with more confidence,” he said after they corrected him) and asked if they were going to start blackmailing him, too. The district reps threatened suspension for any teacher found to be taking bribes, but when Ava accepted full responsibility, they didn’t just suspend her. Turns out it’s difficult to fire teachers because of unions, but not so much with principals. And so, Principal Coleman was sent packing! Before Ava departed with a box of her belongings, she shared a surprisingly touching moment with Barbara, who confessed that she once thought Ava was too selfish to care about the students, and that they’d be better off without her. “But now I see how wrong I’ve been. Actually, I’ve been seeing it for a long time,” Barbara added. Ava, in turn, told Barbara that she asked her to take over the music class not to make her life more difficult, but because she thought doing something she loves would reinvigorate Barbara. Those were the words that Barb needed to hear to take on the task despite how tired and overwhelmed she’s been feeling by work. “Never too late to become a sugar baby. Coleman out,” Ava declared with a smile, before exiting Abbott. Now, the question is: Who will be the school’s new principal? Gregory, who once had his eye on the position, feels like an obvious choice. Or will Janine’s experience with the district give her a leg up? And have we ever meet the school’s Vice Principal? Of course, there’s also the possibility that the district will want to bring in an outsider (played by a Big Name Guest Star), given the recent scandal at Abbott. Who do you think should fill the vacant spot? Hit the comments with your thoughts and dream castings!",
