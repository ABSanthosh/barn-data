  "text": "Eric Dane, whose many TV credits include Grey’s Anatomy, The Last Ship and Euphoria, has been diagnosed with ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis aka Lou Gehrig’s disease). “I am grateful to have my loving family by my side as we navigate this next chapter,” the actor said in a statement to People.com, sharing his diagnosis. Dane married actress Rebecca Gayheart in October 2004, and though divorce proceedings began in 2018, Gayheart very recently filed to dismiss the divorce. The couple has two daughters: Billie, 15, and Georgia, 13. “I feel fortunate that I am able to continue working and am looking forward to returning to set of Euphoria next week,” Dane said in his statement. “I kindly ask that you give my family and I privacy during this time.” Season 3 of HBO’s Euphoria began filming in early February; Dane, who plays Cal Jacobs, is due back on set April 14, per People.com. ALS is a nervous system disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord, and causes loss of muscle control, according to the Mayo Clinic. The disease gets worse over time, and there is no cure. Lou Gehrig was diagnosed with ALS in 1939, shortly after taking himself out of the Yankees lineup and voluntarily ending a streak of playing 2,130 consecutive games; he died a little over two years later.",
