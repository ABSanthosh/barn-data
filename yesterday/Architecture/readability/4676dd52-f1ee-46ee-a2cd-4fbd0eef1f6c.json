However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.The best Airbnbs in Tulum are the kinds of lodgings that underscore the region’s natural beauty via private pools and hot tubs, jungle (or beach!) views, and proximity to sandy shores. Whether you plan to go in with a group on a rustic villa or want to post to the grid from your own penthouse pool, there’s a listing for you.Though Tulum has become a playground for tourists in recent years—one of the largest neighborhoods is called the “Hotel Zone” for a reason—a private rental home is ideal for anyone looking to escape the crowds, enjoy some laid-back beachside living, and spend some time talking to the people who actually live here (say, your Airbnb host).While you’re here, there are 100 different ways to experience this historic town, though your itinerary should include a dip in freshwater cenotes, snorkeling in the crystal-clear waters of the gulf, and history lessons in Mayan culture. You might just end up with an unforgettable meal or stumble on a secret beach, but location (and your home base) is everything. Here, nine restful Tulum Airbnb rentals that go the extra mile to ensure that you’re protecting your peace during your precious OOO time.Perks: Dedicated concierge, beach access, private pool, hammock, pet-friendly, travel crib upon requestEach space within this two-bedroom getaway is focused on communal gathering: A sheltered outdoor dining area overlooks the private swimming pool, coastal-influenced seating in the living room sets the scene for movie nights, and the spacious kitchen has miles of meal-prep space for a whole assembly line of sous chefs. The stone walls anchoring the kitchen, den, and outdoor hangout spaces highlight the warm sunlight creeping in through the vacation rental’s wall-spanning windows, while warm woods elsewhere contrast the earthy interior palette. Beyond the cozy confines of your villa, guests can find an assortment of beach clubs in the area to stake out (Gitano Beach is a can’t-miss), along with more than a few coffee shops and tons of restaurants spread across the La Veleta and Hotel Zone neighborhoods. From $99 per night.Perks: Two pools, in-unit washer and dryer, air conditioning, outdoor showerYou might think it’s short-sighted to plan an entire stay around a bathtub…until you spot the gorgeous carved-out slab of stone tucked away under the covered patio of this three-bedroom home. It gets even better from there: You can take a dip in the hammock-lined cenote on site, as well as a handful of other shared-access pools situated next to shaded lounging areas. A stay here is all about getting into the water—with a beach a short five-minute drive away when you want to sink your toes into the sand. Inside, retreat from the sun to rooms lined with stone floors and bathed in calming neutrals. Even when you’re spending time indoors, you’ll still feel the breeze rolling through the sliding doors and spot lush greenery peeking around every corner. From $219 per night.Perks: Private rooftop pool, concierge service, gym, yoga mat, in-unit washer and dryerLocated in the Aldea Zama neighborhood, this three-bedroom has enough room to comfortably put you and 10 of your closest amigos up. Moody interiors cancel out the sunny exteriors with a dark, natural color palette softened by plenty of textured rugs and furnishings. Additional green decor accents remind you that, yes, you are in paradise.The toughest decision you can make here will be which plunge pool to spend the day in: Panoramic views of the city are best surveilled from a vantage point in the rooftop plunge pool, though the living space also opens up to a private terrace with yet another one if the loungers upstairs get snapped up. Guests can also access a host-provided mini projector and screen for a romantic movie night under the stars. From $354 per night.Perks: High-speed Wi-Fi, rooftop pool, filtered water, beach bag and towelsWraparound views of the surrounding jungle give this posh penthouse a treehouse feel—it might just be the most magical way to wake up on vacation. The two-bedroom rental features an elevated plunge pool bookended by a cozy lounging area for afternoon siestas under the sun. Meanwhile, in the living room, a lengthy wall-hugging sofa has an abundance of seating and pillows for every single guest to sprawl out, even when the home is at capacity (five guests). And while the interiors lean neutral, all it takes is cracking a window to let your verdant jungle surroundings in. One quick tip: Now that you’ve booked the penthouse suite now, you may as well act like it. Guests can book massages, a private chef, and shuttles to and fro for an additional fee. From $600 per night.Perks: Private pool, outdoor dining area, luggage drop-off, room-darkening shadesRainfall showers, linen sheets, and a cozy outdoor couch are just a few of the creature comforts offered at this earthy one-bedroom apartment doused in neutral hues. Limewashed interior walls mirror the texture of the private plunge pool on the patio, honoring the indoor-outdoor living Tulum is lauded for. The sleeping space is separated from the living room and kitchen by an arched wall, making this a good option for couples who don’t fear an open plan. Nearby, guests can head further into the La Veleta neighborhood—grab dinner at Il Bacaro La Veleta or Canova (both serve Italian fare), or set up a Sian Ka’an tour of the reserve. The spot is easily accessible to other excursions—take a scenic drive over to the region’s most popular beaches (including Tulum Beach) once you’ve recharged your social meter. From $266 per night.Perks: Outdoor shower, two pools, three terraces, beach club accessDespite its smaller-than-a-villa footprint, this two-bedroom serves up spa-like oasis vibes with a greenery-lined pool, and the kinds of tasteful interiors that could fill an entire design catalogue. Rainfall showers, plenty of outdoor lounge space, minimalist furniture, and high-quality linens have all the makings of a posh stay. But our favorite design moment is the reading nook set up in one of the expansive portal windows overlooking the backyard trees.Located in Aldea Zama, the apartment is a short walk from the city’s best restaurants and the downtown neighborhood of Tulum Centro. You can also hop on a bike to mosey down to the beach or drive through Tulum Town to peer at the historic sites. This is a good spot for a small group (calling all responsible bachelorette parties!) who want to experience Tulum at a more laid-back, less frenetic pace. From $203 per night.Perks: Private pool, pet-friendly, exercise equipment, hammock, in-unit washer, security cameras on propertyYou may not be staying directly on beachfront property, but you can still benefit from the surrounding scenery when you’re sunbathing on the roof here. Guests can feel slightly secluded in the jungle, only a few miles from Tulum’s best-known beaches and clubs (should you care to get a glimpse of the crowds once in a while).Inside this two-bedroom rental, there’s enough space to house up to seven guests and plenty of comfy seating (even an indoor hammock) for all your lounging purposes. Wherever you choose to sprawl out, nature is never too far away: The design prioritizes indoor-outdoor living with wall cutouts and massive windows that draw the breeze in. From $111 per night.Perks: Pool, pet-friendly, patio, luggage drop-off, in-unit washerThe view from the living room couch here faces the treetops—a fittingly beautiful backdrop for this one-bedroom gem hidden in the jungle. While there are no actual doors dividing living spaces in this condo, the arched doorways are covered by thick privacy curtains to cordon each space off from one another. The pool sits just off the private balcony and feels cocooned in its own little world, shielded by tall privacy walls. But if making a friend is more appealing than keeping to yourself, head to the shared pool on the ground level of the larger property. Note that you’ll definitely need to rent a car to stay here, as it’s a five-minute drive in to town, and to access other local restaurants, bars, and grocery stores. But for this rate, and this setting? Consider it all balanced out in the ledger book. From $115 per night.Perks: Shared pool, pet-friendly, concierge, bike rentals, room-darkening shadesProximity is a big perk when staying at this luxe bungalow villa—downtown Tulum is just five minutes away by car, 10 minutes from the beach, and 15 minutes from Gran Cenote and Kaan Luum Lagoon. And even though you’re located near the Holistika yoga resort, you’re still far enough away from the city’s buzzy energy to rest and recharge.The one-bedroom, two-story home was built using the palapa style—a traditional Mayan method of weaving thatched roofs from dried palm leaves that are common along the Mexican coast. Other calling cards of the area are the local artwork, polished concrete floors, built-in furniture, and—yes—the pool. A hardwood staircase connects guests with the property’s communal spaces, such as a yoga space, another swimming pool, and a garden. But the bedroom alone, with its wrap-around terrace and jungle view, plus an ethereal mosquito net to protect the bed, is worth writing home about on its own. From $49 per night.The AD Travel EditCraving an escape?
