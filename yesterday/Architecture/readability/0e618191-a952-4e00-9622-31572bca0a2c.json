However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.When a young couple who wanted to give their Victorian home a more contemporary look, they turned to Pensaer Studio for a 430-square-foot extension to the original structure. The London firm’s team took their clients requests into account before they got started: the pair wanted a design that was sophisticated, airy, and could also link out to their garden.The studio also redesigned the garden with its colorful planter beds to assure an aesthetic continuity with the redesigned home. What was once a small kitchen with a low ceiling, tucked into the back of the house with no connection to the outdoors, has now become a 10-foot-long space that combines a kitchen, a dining room, and a living area, all with views of the surrounding shrubbery. The studio also found room for a new toilet with some extra square feet that were left over.The project sought as far as possible to use materials that were free of chemicals and toxins, with the goal of creating a home that is healthier with less dust and fewer pollutants. “The warm woodwork in oak contrasts with the polished concrete floors, creating a modern and welcoming ambiance. A bench, installed at an angle by the window, seamlessly connects the interior with the garden, making the most of the natural light and reinforcing the connection to the outdoors.” “The key was to try to design around very specific spaces to achieve the most efficient layout possible. We chose this route rather than creating larger open expanses that, while they would offer greater flexibility, would also take up more area. The result is a very defined set of intimate spaces that allowed almost all of the garden to be preserved,” explains Rhys Owen, founder of Pensaer.The London studio, known for bringing together craftsmanship and architecture in designs that “cultivate joy,” made use of custom furniture for this extension. “The interior is designed to offer a sense of calm, sophistication, and warmth. The cozy feel of finishes like oak contrast with the polished concrete floor and the integrated woodwork elements encourage the connection between the home’s owners and the space. Beams transform into shelves, and then into seats, creating a continuous flow.” the studio says. Note the focus on organics that spreads beyond aesthetics—the project used materials that were free from chemicals and toxins to create a healthier living space.The walls on one side of the apartment double as storage space. The kitchen is from Hølte, a company that specializes in creating bespoke fronts for IKEA systems. “This project posed some interesting design challenges,” Owen says. For example, it was necessary to ensure that the space would be filled with natural light, which in the end was achieved by incorporating a large skylight into the ceiling. The studio also wanted to make sure that there was a smooth transition between the main house and the extension, which was done by choosing materials that blended well with both the old and new parts of the house. “By integrating natural materials with sculptural elements, we have designed a space that conveys a sense of serenity and is at the same time stimulating,” explains Owen.The extension features a kitchen lit from one end via a skylight, which diffuses a soft natural light into the space, and a dining room framed by wooden beams, which creates rhythm and depth throughout the room: “The goal was to create a sophisticated space, which would allow for some touches of color with a contemporary aesthetic.” “We also put a lot of thought into how to balance the interior and exterior, making sure the clients felt connected to their garden. Our approach always starts with the question, ‘What architecture suits this particular client?’ and from there we tailor the design to how they live in and interact with the space.”“Designed to last, the house incorporates robust materials that not only enhance its visual appeal but also promote environmental sustainability. Every element, from the carefully selected finishes to the strategic placement of windows, contributes to creating an overall experience that is both tranquil and uplifting, making this a perfect haven to live a contemporary lifestyle.” In the end, the studio gave the owners what they wanted: a modern and bright house, connected to the outdoors and respectful of the character of the original building. And all of this was done using sustainable and healthy materials while making the most of every square inch of construction.\"This project is the result of a close collaboration between architects, structural engineers, and skilled artisans, who have worked to achieve a low-carbon, cost-effective design without compromising aesthetics or functionality,” Owen explains. The tiles in the bathroom are in the same shade of pink that was used for the planters in the garden. The 430-square-foot extension on this London home was originally published in AD Spain.",
