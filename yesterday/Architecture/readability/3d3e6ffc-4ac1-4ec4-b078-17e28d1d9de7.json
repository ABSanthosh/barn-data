  "text": "Soccer superstar Neymar is ushering in a new era in South Florida. The Brazilian footballer, born Neymar da Silva Santos Júnior, paid $26 million for a residential plot in Miami, officially closing on the deal last week, per Wall Street Journal. Sources later confirmed to The Real Deal that he plans to build a 13,000-square-foot home with the help of London-based design firm Elicyon, though exact timing has yet to be revealed. The news of Neymar’s hefty purchase follows speculation that the left winger, who currently plays for the Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal and the Brazil national team, will reportedly join Major League soccer team Inter Miami in 2025.Neymar’s purchase is located on Bal Harbour, an enclave at the northern tip of Miami Beach. He reportedly bought the home from Philosophy Care mogul Bent Philipson, who’s currently facing an ongoing lawsuit for fraud and resident neglect in one of his Long Island nursing homes. The dwelling was initially listed for $30 million in January 2024 before the price bumped down to $28.5 million in May, and then $26 million in October.The exclusive property sits on a 0.6-acre lot with 150 feet of water-facing views. The plot is located walking distance to the beach and other nearby upscale experiences such as shopping and dining, according to Zillow. But Neymar was most drawn to “the privacy and security of the gated community, as well as the size of the property,” Bento Queiroz of Compass, who represented Neymar, told the Wall Street Journal.Shop Open DoorLove celebrity homes?

The Brazilian soccer star has invested in a slew of global properties over the years. His most recent purchase was a $3-million pad in 2020 which is tucked away in the affluent São Paulo suburb of Alphaville and boasts amenities including a mile-long swimming pool and a 20-car garage. Earlier this month, it was reported that Neymar also has his eyes set on a six-acre private island in Brazil. The tropical hideaway, Japao, can “only accommodate up to 10 guests and can only be reached by boat or helicopter,” per The Sun. The current asking price is £7 million, or $9.1 million.",
