  "text": "A Compact Home on Sweden’s West CoastHee House, designed by Studio Ellsinger, stands on a flat plot just south of Hamburgsund on Sweden’s West Coast. Framed by pines, weathered rocks, and meadow grass, the vacation home balances a modest footprint with a sense of generous interior scale. The design responds directly to the site’s prevailing coastal climate, using durable materials and careful orientation to protect against wind and rain.From the north, the façade remains closed to shield views from the road and neighboring properties. Toward the south and east, large openings draw in daylight and connect the interiors to the forest edge and open fields. This dual character — introverted on approach, expansive within — establishes a clear distinction between shelter and landscape.images © Christopher HuntVertical Space and Structural IngenuityAt only 7 by 7 meters in plan and reaching 7 meters in height, Studio Ellsinger’s Hee House achieves surprising volume. To preserve clear sightlines and avoid structural elements interrupting the main space, the design moves roof loads into a horizontal laminated timber frame. This strategy eliminates the need for bracing or exposed beams that would segment the experience of the tall room.The architects clad the roof and all gable surfaces in untreated aluminum sinus sheeting, chosen for its resistance to the harsh coastal conditions and its ability to weather naturally over time. A cantilevered canopy extends from the main volume, reinforcing the house’s protective posture while marking the entry.Hee House by Studio Ellsinger is located just south of Hamburgsund on Sweden’s West CoastCustom Detailing for a design-minded clientThe clients — a photographer and a writer, both working within design — worked together with Studio Ellsinger and brought an informed perspective to the Hee House. Their openness to unconventional solutions led to a fully bespoke approach. Nearly every element was designed specifically for the house, from the window profiles to the kitchen and fitted furnishings.Inside, the layout organizes a large central volume around a lofted platform. Beneath the loft, a compact sequence of rooms includes a hallway, bathroom, and private bedroom. The loft itself is held aloft by a bookshelf that stretches the full width of the space.
