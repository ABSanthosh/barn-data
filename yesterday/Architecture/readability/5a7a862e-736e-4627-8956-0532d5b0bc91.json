  "text": "A Sustainable Luxury Oasis in MexicoA design-minded and nature-centric retreat, Kymaia Hotel, has opened its doors in Oaxaca, Mexico. Designed by Ezequiel Ayarza Sforza, the project takes shape with a focus on sustainable architecture and an immersive experience of Mexico’s coastal biodiversity. Kymaia is located thirty minutes from Puerto Escondido and is conceived as an architectural homage to the Oaxacan landscape. Designed in collaboration with the renowned Mexican studio Productora, the hotel features twenty-two suites scattered across the terrain. The Ocean Front Suites, sited at the highest points, include private pools and panoramic ocean views. Meanwhile, the pyramid-inspired structures house Junior and Senior Suites, incorporating elements such as hot tubs and lush gardens.The material palette of stucco, clay, and local wood reflects a commitment to traditional craftsmanship and environmental sustainability. Sand-toned finishes and wood details evoke an aesthetic that is at once rustic and refined, so the built space appears to rise from the coastal terrain.images courtesy Kymaiakymaia hotel: a wellness-centric retreatKymaia Hotel’s thoughtful layout brings three restaurants and a spa to Puerto Escondido, Mexico, along with the ‘Shala,’ a serene space designed for yoga and meditation. Trails, gardens, and a central pool connect the spaces, encouraging a dialogue between architecture and the natural environment. Each area is designed by Ezequiel Ayarza Sforza to create opportunities for contemplation and immersion in the lush biodiversity of Oaxaca.Key gardens throughout the hotel, such as El Palmar, La Nopalera, El Humedal, and El Guayacán, replicate local ecosystems. From the shaded respite of swaying palm trees to the rich biodiversity of wetlands, the landscaping celebrates the region’s flora and fauna, encouraging guests to reconnect with nature.Chef Eduardo García leads Kymaia’s culinary program, which features three dining venues: Septimus, Huachinango Bar, and the subterranean La Cueva.
