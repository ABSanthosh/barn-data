  "text": "November 24, 2024 Architecture and interiors firm Picnic Design has created a built-in storage unit with nooks for two kids in their tween years. The request came from two siblings who have been sharing a room since birth and have reached the point where they would like to have their own room. Since a room for each child is not possible, the designers’ goal is to create “a space of one’s own.” The built-in nooks were designed to be distinct for each child and located at different heights, with one accessed from the floor and the other using the ladder of the bunk bed. They nooks are decorated according to each kid’s latest obsession, and LED lights that line the opening lets the child set the mood in their space. Additionally, inside each nook, there are a few shelves for their treasured toys and stuffed animals. There’s also a secret passage for when the kids want to connect with each other. On the opposite wall, there’s a closet and a built in bench for added storage. Photography by Scott Norsworthy",
