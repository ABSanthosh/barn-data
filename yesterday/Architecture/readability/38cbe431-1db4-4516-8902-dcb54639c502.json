Inextricably linked with the Southwest’s love of terra-cotta, it’s a natural fit for cultivating ranchlike vibes on stucco exteriors or, naturally, livening up a roof. Inside, Fire Clay’s connection to humble yet masterful pottery breeds a sense of rusticity. And if you’re simply interested in a color that can match aged oaks and leathers, Fire Clay fits the bill.Looking for even more insights on color?

From light and airy hues to earthier, more muddy tones, 2024’s selects serve moods for any room.Upward by Sherwin-Williams Sherwin-Williams looked to the skies to source its 2024 Color of the Year. Upward is a soft and beautiful blue, imbued with slight red undertones, a hint of gray, and some of the natural attributes we associate with green. Evocative of Scandi slow living or coastal vibes depending on its application, Upward is an asset for anyone looking to create a calming contrast from the busyness of modern life. Image courtesy Sherwin-WilliamsSkipping Stones by Dunn-Edwards Similar yet distinct from Sherwin-Williams’s Upward, Skipping Stones takes its cues from the sea rather than the sky. Described by Dunn-Edwards color expert Deming Carpenter as “a perfect bridge between warm and cool,” this moody, meditative blue is a welcome addition to an interior, whether it appears on cabinets, all four walls, or more subtle applications. It’s also right at home alongside the other nature-inspired colors of the New Dawn collection, part of the brand’s broader 2024 Color + Design Trends selections. Image courtesy Dunn-EdwardsCracked Pepper by Behr Behr’s top pick for 2024 goes boldly back to black at a time when brighter near-neutrals would seem to rule the day. A luxe charcoal tone, Cracked Pepper proves that even a darker color can feel soft, cozy, and comfortable while still making a statement. Whether used as an anchor in a modern space or as feature of something more classic, there are plenty of reasons why this top seller in Behr’s Designer Collection Palette is worthy of its Color of the Year status. Illustration courtesy BehrBlue Nova by Benjamin Moore Benjamin Moore’s Blue Nova is another mid-toned blue that balances the warm with the cool. Andrea Magno, the brand’s color marketing and development director, describes Blue Nova as a “captivating, otherworldly” color that captures the spirit of twilight to achieve something magical. As a matte finish, Magno appreciates its ability to introduce a “velvety feel,” but it’s also got the versatility to add an air of approachable excitement to kitchen islands, cabinetry, and even front doors. Image courtesy Benjamin MooreSweet Embrace by Dulux Described by Dulux as “delicate and optimistic,” Sweet Embrace exudes warm, welcoming qualities. Ready to illuminate rooms that otherwise don’t see much sun or to create an oasis of calm in a home office, this lavender-leaning near-neutral can be either a foundational or transformational color depending on its application. No matter if it’s paired with greens and blues, an earthy orange, or a soft gold, Sweet Embrace’s light, airy attributes are a fit for any style or season. Image courtesy DuluxPeach Fuzz by Pantone Amid 2024’s rising tide of cool tones, Pantone’s Peach Fuzz is a warming counterweight. Whether as a rug offering a textural contrast to harder surfaces or deployed as a dining room accent wall to create a convivial atmosphere, Peach Fuzz brings comfort, compassion, and connectivity to any space where people want to feel at ease. Capable of both standing out amid traditional neutrals and holding its own among today’s landscape of brighter, bolder colors, expect to see Pantone’s pick pop up anywhere that calls for chilled out vibes or creative inspiration. Image courtesy PantoneViridis by Graham \u0026 Brown Viridis, Graham \u0026 Brown’s 2024 Color of the Year, is a garden of earthy green delight. The color plays well with the lush, forest scene of New Eden, the brand’s Design of the year, grounding the jewel tones of its illustrated flora and fauna. However, Viridis is more than capable of holding its own, bringing out the best of dark woods, soft decor, and any number of adjacent shades of green. Image courtesy Graham \u0026 BrownBay Brown, as shown in the Seesaw wallpaper by York Wallcoverings As rich as fertile soil and fine leather, York Wallcoverings’ choice of Bay Brown for 2024 is a reminder that greens and blues aren’t the hues found in nature. This particular neutral is stately enough to function in classical design contexts while possessing a depth that makes it a provocative choice for moodier, more contemporary spaces. But no matter how it’s used, Bay Brown carries with it a sense of quiet—yet unmistakable—luxury. Image courtesy YorkMountain Sage by James Hardie Mountain Sage marks the first-ever Color of the Year selection for siding manufacturer James Hardie. Specifically billed as a trending color for exteriors, this neutral-tinged take on an earthy green shows that turning the home into a soothing sanctuary can start from the outside in. Available in various James Hardie sidings and trim battens, Mountain Sage offers mood-boosting tranquility while blurring the boundaries between the built environment and the natural world. Photography courtesy James HardieRenew Blue by Valspar Can’t decide between the greens of today or the blues of tomorrow? Renew Blue, Valspar’s 2024 Color of the Year, rejects that false binary. As the name suggests, this blue is all about restoring equilibrium and recharging, managing to feel peaceful yet provocative. Whether grounded with help from neutrals like Perfect Backdrop and Dusk in the Valley or standing out on its own, there’s no doubt that Renew Blue has what it takes to help your home feel like a space for getting in touch with your true colors. Image courtesy ValsparThis Time Two Years Ago…Review Predictions for the 2023 Color of the YearFrom a cool color that gently nudges us away from last year’s dominant shade to a supersaturated hue that celebrates color at its richest, paint color picks in 2023 brought a range of design trends and moods into perspective. There may not be a single aesthetic theme, but as Behr’s choice of Blank Canvas suggests, the year’s defining color story was whatever you chose to make it.Raspberry Blush by Benjamin Moore Representing a conscious desire to leave 2022’s neutrals behind, Raspberry Blush is Benjamin Moore’s unapologetically bold choice for its 2023 Color of the Year. Warm and vivid, it’s designed to create an instant impression in both big or small doses, adding a touch of excitement and happiness to any space. “I think there’s definitely a wow factor,” Benjamin Moore color marketing and development director Andrea Magno says. “We just kept coming back to the color again and again and finding different things we really loved about it.” Photography courtesy Benjamin MooreAlizarin by Graham \u0026 Brown Graham \u0026 Brown honored Alizarin, a rich, stirring auburn hue, with its annual title. The color, which is named after the pigment spawned from the rubia plant species long utilized as a dye, evokes a lush, ebullient ambiance. With its warm richness and muted shade, Alizarin can infuse great rooms with a sense of old-world grandeur that feels incredibly timeless. Meanwhile, small spaces can benefit from the dose of color that’s enlivening without being domineering. The water-based, low-VOC paint complements Florenzia Dusk, Graham \u0026 Brown’s 2023 wallpaper selection, which reimagines a floral pattern from the brand’s archives in shades of navy, gold, and rust. Photography courtesy Graham \u0026 BrownWild Wonder by Dulux With roots in the natural world, Wild Wonder radiates positivity with a soft, slightly yellow glow. The magic of Dulux’s selection is that it can continue to surprise and delight across contexts in the home. Whether used to foster a sense of comfort and shelter when paired with a neutral such as Dulux’s Brave Ground in a bedroom or to create a sense of fun in a naturally lit living room alongside Manuka Honeybee and Rocksalt Rose accents, the color is an inspiring yet balanced selection fit for brighter days ahead. Illustration courtesy DuluxTerra Rosa by Dunn-Edwards As its name implies, Terra Rosa is also in the realm of earthy tones, pairing rich terra-cotta with a bit of dusty rose. Part of the brand’s Life in Poetry palette, the color more than holds its own as a dominant ground, while its muted shade makes it a tasteful, timeless accent to almost any color palette. Redend Point by Sherwin-Williams A dusty blush-beige with a desertlike feel, Redend Point sits at the center of both the neutral spectrum and the emerging trend towards energizing earth tones. Sue Wadden, Sherwin-Williams’s director of color marketing, references notions of “empathy and care culture” when explaining the brand’s selection, so it only makes sense that Redend Point nicely adapts with its surroundings. “It’s a great option [that] plays well with other neutrals,” Wadden says. “If you put it next to beige, Redend Point really looks like a color. But on its own, you see that it really does act like a neutral, so it’s well-behaved.” Illustration courtesy Sherwin-WilliamsVining Ivy by Glidden and PPG Representing a relatively subtle transition away from the neutral-ish greens that defined 2022, Vining Ivy successfully straddles the line between green and blue by incorporating jewel-like elements. Exuding the same kind of calm, grounding, natural qualities of a green while offering a bit of intrigue, Vining Ivy suggests that consumers aren’t quite ready to settle for just one color when the possibilities of the present feel so open-ended. “We’re really talking about how this color is both green and blue because, realistically, that’s how our customers are talking about color,” says Ashley McCollum, Glidden color expert, of the decision. Photography courtesy PPGBlank Canvas by Behr While Glidden and PPG chose to offer up green and blue as their color of the year, Behr’s choice of Blank Canvas represents the starting point of a forked path: a journey towards a more colorful future, or one of a neutral, monochrome calm as seen in trending organic modern interiors. Despite the implications of its name, Blank Canvas is more than capable of standing on its own by offering a playful, warmer take on traditional white. And whenever you’re ready to design your masterpiece, Erika Woelfel, Behr’s vice president of color and creative services, sees Blank Canvas as “the perfect artistic color for people to start expressing their creativity.” Photo courtesy of BehrViva Magenta by Pantone A berry red that blurs the lines between warm and cool, Viva Magenta is the bold color that is turning heads on the runway and turning up in the metaverse. Described by Pantone Color Institute’s executive director, Leatrice Eiseman, as “audacious, witty” and like “a fist in a velvet glove,” Viva Magenta can make a statement big or small, whether it is color-drenching kitchen cabinets or simply as an accent in colored glassware on open shelving. Indeed, it’s an appealing option for any room of the home that calls for a color that can be as alluring as it is accessible. Photo: Michael MarquandThis Time Three Years Ago…Review Predictions for the 2022 Color of the YearPaint companies were strikingly in unison on the shade that would define 2022. Of course, outliers existed (such as Pantone’s Very Peri), but the manufacturers generally hovered in the pale green palette. Below, we’ve gathered a comprehensive rundown of the colors that companies like Behr, Sherwin-Williams, and more predicted would rule 2022.Breezeway by Behr A silvery green suitable for everything from beachside vibes to modern, contemporary settings, Behr’s Breezeway “inspires us to fully embrace the hobbies or adventures, both near and far, that excite us,” said Woeful. A standout of the 20 shades comprising the company’s 2022 Color Trends palette, Breezeway functions as an intriguing and perfectly viable neutral for those ready to brighten a space by bringing the outdoors in. Photo: Courtesy of BehrArt and Craft by Dunn-Edwards Though visually a departure from the parade of pale greens other brands chose to define 2022 trends, Art and Craft—a highlight of Dunn-Edwards’s Naturrensing palette—maintains a similar connection to the earth and an ability to offer something more than just the neutrals of the past. “This is a versatile color that we expect to see applied across a variety of industries and disciplines throughout 2022,” said Sarah McLean, Dunn-Edwards’s color expert and stylist, of this light and airy take on brown. “Art and Craft is truly a down-to-earth color that signifies stability, comfort, and calm.” Photo: Courtesy of Dunn-EdwardsEvergreen Fog by Sherwin-Williams Another grayish green taking its name from thick, heavy air, Evergreen Fog is what Wadden called a “universally accepted, super-versatile” color that’s emblematic of “growth, rebirth, and joy.” Capable of merging the spirit of organic modernism with the aesthetics of the ’70s, Sherwin-Williams sees Evergreen Fog playing well on walls and cabinets at home, while also fitting in nicely with some of the interior design trends that the brand expects to define the commercial spaces of a post-pandemic world. Photo: Courtesy of Sherwin-WilliamsOctober Mist by Benjamin Moore Although the month that gives this color its name might conjure images of orange pumpkins or umber leaves, October Mist is among the soothing shades of green that offers a grounding connection to the natural world for 2022. Magno admitted that October Mist “doesn’t scream green,” but much like the stem of a flower, this grayish shade blends in effortlessly while creating an opportunity for other dazzling colors to flourish. Photo: Courtesy of Benjamin MooreOlive Sprig by PPG As the name suggests, PPG’s Olive Sprig was another of 2022’s grayish greens. The culmination of bubbling trends that were accelerated by the pandemic, Olive Sprig is “usable and also aligned with the warm, colorful neutrals that we had seen rising in popularity,” as PPG senior color marketing manager Amy Donato put it. Tying in with notions of renewal and rebirth—a theme mentioned by multiple brands—Olive Sprig offers a chance to transition from cool grays to neutrals with a bit more personality. Photo: Gross\u0026DaleyVery Peri by Pantone Last but certainly not least, industry leader Pantone announced its color of the year for 2022 in early December. The selection was Very Peri, a perfectly purple blue shade of periwinkle. “For those who are gun-shy about using too much color and taking that first step, it’s a great color to use maybe just on one wall instead of all four walls,” said Leatrice Eiseman, executive director of the Pantone Color Institute, and it’s decidedly different from any pale or olive green. Photo: Courtesy of PantoneBreathe by Graham \u0026 Brown Not content to let earthier greens and browns have all the fun, Graham \u0026 Brown’s Breathe shows that the idea of connection to nature can draw inspiration from the sky as well. The pale and powdery blue of Breathe also nods to wellness and sustainability, and the shade works remarkably well when paired with Restore Midnight, Graham and Brown’s deep blue, naturally inspired wallpaper of the year. Photo: Courtesy of Graham \u0026 BrownBright Skies by Dulux Fitting for a year where forecasters latched onto the idea of brighter days ahead, Dulux’s Bright Skies is an airy, open tone that can reinvigorate any room through the sense of freedom and possibility it offers. Honored as the brand’s color of the year by a team of international color and design experts, Bright Skies is a fun yet functional option that pushes the boundaries of a neutral without flying too close to the sun. Photo: Courtesy of DuluxGuacamole by Glidden While parent company PPG opted for Olive Sprig, Glidden advocated for a more festive and appetizing shade of green for 2022. Made for kitchens, Guacamole looks great against a white subway tile backsplash. And now that we’re cautiously entertaining more, it’s certainly a living room conversation-starter best discussed over a bowl of chips. Photo: Courtesy of GliddenCraving more color?
