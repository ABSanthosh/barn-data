At the heart of the space designed by Mitsuhiro Shoji of Uchida Shanghai, a sculptural fan-shaped ceiling hovers above a curved hinoki wood counter, casting dramatic shadows and anchoring the composition. This element draws from the elegance of traditional Japanese motifs while referencing the scale and expression of Chinese aesthetics. Amid this, rich materials — from Jingdezhen porcelain to earthen plaster — create a tactile, culturally layered atmosphere where heritage and modernity quietly converge.all images by Kenta HasegawaUchida Shanghai infuses the space with warm hues and texturesTwo private dining rooms extend this narrative. One features a softly illuminated ceiling with washi texture, evoking warmth and tactility, while other is finished in silver leaf, creating a serene and reflective atmosphere. These spatial contrasts embody both cohesion and cultural dialogue.Throughout the interior, the team at Uchida Shanghai selected materials particularly for their richness and cultural resonance. Chinese-toned earthen plaster walls provide depth and warmth, while handcrafted ceramic tiles and Jingdezhen porcelain introduce subtle detailing that bridges craftsmanship and cuisine.
