The annual showcase of design products from around the world features a slate of furniture collections designed in collaboration with architects and architectural designers. Some firm names of note include Herzog \u0026 de Meuron, Foster + Partners, Snøhetta, and Zaha Hadid Architects. The 2025 edition of the event (the 63rd official Salone) is open now and will conclude on April 13th. RIPPLE by Zaha Hadid Architects for Serralunga RIPPLE by Zaha Hadid Architects for Serralunga. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"The Ripple outdoor sofa and table are a testament to Zaha Hadid Architects’ ability to seamlessly blend form and function. The pieces are not only visually striking but also offer a comfortable and practical solution for outdoor seating and dining.\" ONDA by Zaha Hadid Architects for Febal Casa ONDA by Zaha Hadid Architects for Serralunga. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"ONDA is inspired by the low, flowing waves of the Adriatic Sea – ripples shaped by the sandy seabed and now reinterpreted as a distinctive feature across the glass surfaces of the sideboard and kitchen island door fronts. A material interpretation of motion, where every detail evokes the element of water and its natural fluidity.\" Corker by Herzog \u0026 de Meuron for Classicon Corker by Herzog \u0026 de Meuron for Classicon. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"Warm, grounding, stable and flexible in the ways it can be used: Corker is one of those universal talents that simply look good in any environment as an extra seat or side table. Corker is available in three sizes and plays with its nature not only in its name but also in its design: The silhouette of a wine bottle cork served as inspiration. The piece of furniture can almost be viewed as a pop art object due to its direct, simply enlarged reference to an object taken from everyday culture. Corker originated at the London Serpentine Gallery Pavilion 2012. The design of the temporary summer pavilion was a joint project by the architectural office Herzog \u0026 de Meuron and Chinese artist, designer and architect Ai Weiwei.\" Ori by Foster + Partners Ori by Foster + Partners. Image: Foster + PartnersProduct description (per Foster + Partners): \"Ori was crafted through an iterative design process focused on aesthetics, functionality and purity. Composed of spun aluminium cones, stainless steel elements and threaded aluminium tubes, its vertical axis locks all components together ensuring stability and ease of maintenance. Responding to seasonal changes and bird species, the swapable feeding tube and cages allow for a variety of food types, including seeds, nuts and suet. Ori’s design simplifies cleaning, reducing the risk of disease transmission among birds. The bird feeder is designed to protect the feed from the rain while allowing for aeration through a perforated tray. The water bath features an overflow drainage system that directs excess water through a central tube to the ground.\" Eva \u0026 Eve by Foster + Partners for Lumina Italia Eva \u0026 Eve by Foster + Partners for Lumina Italia. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"The idea was to create a cone of light, a subtle yet alluring flux similar to that of a candle, attractive and also useful. Eva has a turned aluminium base housing the electronic components, the LED and the optics, and a glass cylinder closed at the top by a conical diffuser. The light flux is projected by way of a holographic filter, a small primary lens and a large secondary lens onto the upper opaline cone, while the LED source remains hidden. Eva also has a tactile dimension: thanks to an encoder system (an infrared sensor to detect rotation) the intensity of the light can be precisely controlled by manually operating the ring on its base. Eva uses an 18W high-performance LED and comes in two finishes: anodized black and anodized brass.\" Panorama by UNStudio for Fantoni Panorama by UNStudio for Fantoni. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"An ever-evolving dynamic Panorama, a system of partitions featuring continuous black edging on both sides, offering different layouts and fostering a sense of comfort and community. Panorama, a project developed by UNStudio for Fantoni, addresses the challenge posed by the new workplace, which favours a hybrid working approach, by encouraging the use of third spaces. These in-between areas create welcoming, flexible settings for a better working experience, for meeting and relaxing, individually or with others. The elements of Panorama - which easily integrate with other Fantoni office collections - define 3 specific operating areas: Learning \u0026 focus, Collaboration, [and] Social.\" Array by Snøhetta for MDF Italia Array by Snøhetta for MDF Italia. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"Array is a sofa system designed by Snøhetta to offer maximum flexibility and comfort. It represents a new approach to sofa design and construction, with the goal of reducing environmental impact, achieving customised living solutions, and simplifying logistics. To this end, it introduces small modules, which permit a variety of layouts, are easy to transport, and can be easily disassembled and reassembled for replacement or recycling. The concept of comfort extends to the entire supply chain, moving beyond its ergonomic component.\" Hos by Kengo Kuma \u0026 Associates for Gandia Blasco Hos by Kengo Kuma \u0026 Associates for Gandia Blasco. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"With the Hos collection, the Japanese architect Kengo Kuma has explored the possibilities of fabrics made with recycled PET fibers, creating a series of textiles with the consistency of a rug, inspired by natural phenomena and elements, which he has used as a membrane in combination with different wooden frames to design furniture with a very architectural structure. Pieces that seek to provide warmth and softness, enveloping the human body and, in some way, also protecting it.\" Spun by Heatherwick Studio for Magis Spun by Heatherwick Studio for Magis. Image: Salon del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"Spun is not just a new seat, a new concept in seating and sitting. Its harmonious, dynamic and perfectly symmetric shape is reminiscent of a cotton reel, a top that spins on its axis or a vase thrown on a potter's wheel. A captivating contemporary sculpture when it is still, Spun becomes a comfortable, fun seat when it moves, a seat on which we can experience new sensations, rediscover the pleasure of rocking, turn 360°, and play with the world around us.\" Android by Studio Libeskind for Antrax IT Android by Studio Libeskind for Antrax IT. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"Android, sculptural radiator designed by Daniel Libeskind. It derives from a 100% recyclable aluminum plate folded to create a dynamic sequence of angles. It reserves in its geometry high thermal efficiency.\" OASI by Stefano Boeri Architetti for Aran Cucine OASI by Stefano Boeri Architetti for Aran Cucine. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"OASI, designed for Aran Cucine, is the first case in which Stefano Boeri Architetti have developed the anticipated vision of the Vertical Forest in the field of industrial design, an occasion that allows the expression of the idea of man-tree coexistence through a domestic furnishing item. Starting from the classic layout of the free-standing kitchen island, OASI defines a simple single dining table-cooking block that houses all the essential elements of a traditional living space like the typical Italian kitchen. The square-shaped free-standing block that results from this is thus developed as a well-expressed multi-function technological device able to support all the phases of the food cycle – storage, washing, preparation, cooking, serving, consumption and recycling,according to a process that is a key principle in Stefano Boeri Architects design: circularity.\" Shtef shelving system by 3LHD for Prostoria Shtef shelving system by 3LHD for Prostoria. Image: Salone del MobileProduct description (per Salone del Mobile): \"The basic structural module is a square that is applied on the wall as a visually autonomous object. However, to make the system adaptable to various ambiences and intended purposes, several modules with different proportions have been developed as well as freestanding variants. L-cross-section shelves are inserted in the structural module; they come in 5 different formats and can be used together with the rear part mounted upward or downward. Shelf is made out of aluminium to achieve lightweightness.\" You can look at last year’s furniture highlight here.",

Starting from the classic layout of the free-standing  kitchen island, OASI defines a  simple single dining table-cooking block that houses all the essential elements of a traditional living space like the typical Italian kitchen. The square-shaped free-standing block that results from this is thus developed as a well-expressed multi-function technological device able to support all the phases of the food cycle – storage, washing, preparation, cooking, serving, consumption and recycling,according to a process that is a key principle in Stefano Boeri Architects design: circularity.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShtef shelving system by \u003ca href=\"https://archinect.com/3LHD\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e3LHD\u003c/a\u003e for Prostoria\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/6a/6a4361e109189d1679ce747e2d0d8d33.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=1028\" data-size=\"1028x757\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/6a/6a4361e109189d1679ce747e2d0d8d33.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\" srcset=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/6a/6a4361e109189d1679ce747e2d0d8d33.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514 1x,https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/6a/6a4361e109189d1679ce747e2d0d8d33.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\u0026amp;dpr=2 2x, https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/6a/6a4361e109189d1679ce747e2d0d8d33.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat\u0026amp;enlarge=true\u0026amp;w=514\u0026amp;dpr=3 3x\"/\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003eShtef shelving system by 3LHD for Prostoria.
