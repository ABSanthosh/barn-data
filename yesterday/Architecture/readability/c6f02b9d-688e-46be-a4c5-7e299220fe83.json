  "text": "Walter White may have been one who knocks, but Joanne Padilla is spraying the hose.The Albuquerque retiree, 63, is the owner of a Northeast Piermont Drive dwelling known to Breaking Bad fans as the home of fictional druglord Walter White, the high school chemistry teacher-turned-meth kingpin played by Bryan Cranston in the acclaimed AMC series.While the show’s use of the New Mexico home’s exterior was initially a blessing, its celebrity has caused major issues for Padilla and her family since the acclaimed drama’s 2008 premiere. In a recent viral video, Padilla can be seen spraying a hose at people flocking to the residence. However, the short clip doesn’t tell the full story, Padilla explains to AD.She moved into the house with her parents in 1973. When a scout from Sony knocked on the door and expressed interest in using the home’s exterior to shoot a pilot, the family complied. “In the beginning, it was fun,” says Padilla, whose parents have since passed. “And then about mid-season, it started to get more of a cult following—an obsession.”People would steal things from the property or tag it with graffiti. They would leave unidentified packages at the door. Padilla was SWAT-ted. Once, a van parked in the driveway, refused to leave, and dragged Padilla’s elderly mother as she grabbed the rearview mirror, injuring her. Mimicking the scene in which White throws a perfectly intact pepperoni pie on top of the garage in anger after an argument with his wife, Skyler, multiple people have attempted to throw pizzas onto the roof—“hundreds of thousands of times,” exaggerates Padilla. “Oh my gosh, that was a 30-second scene that Bryan Cranston made on the first try.”In front of the Breaking Bad house, Joanne Padilla’s parents, the late Louie and Fran Padilla, pose with Bryan Cranston and his Emmy. Photo: Courtesy of Joanne PadillaIn the recent video, Padilla was visiting with her friend, YouTuber Danny Duncan, who is known for his outlandish Jackass-style skits. Padilla says the fans on the street were followers of Duncan’s. “He asked [them], ‘You want to get sprayed?’ And they’ll do anything for him,” says Padilla. “Those young kids said, ‘Spray me, spray me.’ And he did. We were just having fun.”Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

As for what she’d like to see done with the home once it sells, Padilla says it’s all about the fans. “Let the fans have what they have been dying to have for the last 13 years,” she says, referring to the time since the show has been off the air. “Make it into a museum. Give the people what they want. We finally decided it’s time to move on. It’s time for me to have my life back and go enjoy my life.”",
