  "text": "a network of gardens and elevated spaces defines Premio UnicVV Desine Landscape Architecture conceives Premio Unic, a 340-unit condominium development in Bangkok, Thailand, designed to integrate landscape architecture with the environmental context of the site. The project incorporates a network of gardens and elevated spaces to provide multiple landscape experiences within a residential setting. The design approach emphasizes ecological integration, spatial efficiency, and material consistency.The landscape strategy is based on creating layered green zones that serve both functional and environmental roles. These include ground-level gardens that facilitate circulation between separate lobbies, and an elevated pool deck positioned within the tree canopy. This configuration supports visual privacy, climatic comfort, and spatial hierarchy. A recurring motif, derived from fingerprint patterns, informs the organization of exterior spaces. This formal language is adapted across the site to accommodate the built footprint, circulation routes, and programmatic requirements. The fingerprint concept is expressed through hardscape geometry and material transitions, offering a coherent spatial identity across the development.gardens and elevated lounge areas blend with the landscape | all images courtesy of VV Desine Landscape ArchitecturePremio Unic’s design emphasizes ecological responsivenessVegetation is selected to establish microhabitats, delineate outdoor rooms, and contribute to biodiversity. The arrangement of plant species supports visual screening and ecological functionality, contributing to a system of interconnected green areas that provide shelter and pathways for urban wildlife. VV Desine Landscape Architecture Studio designs the podium-level pool as an extension of the garden system, visually embedded within the surrounding canopy. Shade structures at the ground level provide comfort and delineate semi-private zones. Circulation paths, courts, and pavilions are integrated into the overall plan to structure movement and offer varied spatial experiences. The landscape design of Premio Unic emphasizes modular integration with the built environment, ecological responsiveness, and the creation of a consistent formal language. This approach enables both human and non-human users to engage with the site while maintaining alignment with the building’s architecture and programmatic intent.the flowing fingerprint pattern acts as a unifying motif that shapes the site’s identitythe podium-level pool ensures privacy through elevation, framed by tall trees that enhance seclusionthe fitness area overlooks the garden and pool, linking vertical and horizontal spaces",
