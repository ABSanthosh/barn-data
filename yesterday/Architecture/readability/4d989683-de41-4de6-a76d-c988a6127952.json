  "text": "At JAPAN SHOP 2025 this year, Arakawa and Koshin Planning presented an exhibition together designed around the theme of “Ever Origin.” The brands tapped Japanese designer Atsushi Shindo who created the “The Great Tree” installation for the booth that invited visitors into the spacial experience. Spanning 32 feet in diameter and almost 40 feet tall, the shimmering structure towered above attendees, drawing them into a world where nature, technology, and material memory converge. The collaborators had a mission within the structure – to change perception of the properties of resin, the cellulose-derived material proving to be much more sustainable. The resin, which is intentionally subject to the forces of gravity, meets the wire structure, keeping these elements in direct objection to their gravitational pull. “The Great Tree” aims to explore the potential of bio-resin and acetate explorations, as well as consider the possibilities of wire networks in architecture and design. Comprising over 180 plant-derived cellulose acetate pieces and suspended with more than 600 meticulously placed wire grips, “The Great Tree” is balanced between gravity and weightlessness. These amber-tinted resin components were 3D-printed using plant-based material sourced by Koshin Planning – an intentional choice that emphasized sustainability and referenced the ancient origins of resin as natural tree sap. Rather than aim for sterile perfection, Shindo and his collaborators allowed the irregularities of the resin’s flow to remain visible. Subtle bulges, ripples, and edge pooling lent each piece a sense of life, capturing and refracting light for a dreamy effect. The ethereal effect of the resin was further elevated by Arakawa’s advanced wire grip system, which suspended the pieces in place while giving the illusion that they were floating. Known for their versatility in architectural and interior design, Arakawa’s systems – particularly the SFK-1S panel grip – acted not just as structural tools but as spatial enablers. These minimal components allowed Shindo to craft a composition with no visible support structures, enabling a sense of lightness, movement, and upward expansion. Arakawa was founded in 1973 by Dr. Hideo Arakawa, on the principle of “creating what doesn’t exist.” Developing the world’s first adjustable wire fitting system, the ARAKAWA GRIP, put the company on the map. The innovative system won the Good Design Long Life Design Award in 2022, and they have since expanded into many more cutting-edge products using this technology. Focusing on signage, display, and communication design, Koshin Planning has always centered their work on the ideal “bringing as many creative ideas as possible to life.” Based in Jingumae, Shibuya, and founded in 1981, they have decades of experience in the industry, including digital fabrication tools, and large-scale 3D printers. In 2024, the company launched SOKEI, a creative project bringing together artists and designers from diverse backgrounds. Koshin Planning aims to explore the possibility and promise of 3D printing, through both research-driven and collaborative methods.
