  "text": "Imaginary Objects crafts a Tiny Thai Treehouse Without the TreeSomewhere between a backyard fort and a modernist miniature, the Kid Cabin by Imaginary Objects is like a dream treehouse in Thailand. Recently completed in Chonburi, the playful project is not perched in the trees but rooted in the landscape, striking a balance between groundedness and imagination. Like a micro-retreat for children, the cabin is designed with an element of wonder while maintaining an architectural sensitivity.Found in a sweeping field alongside an RV, the Kid Cabin is at once a hideaway and a station for watching the horizon. Inspired by the informal magic of treehouses but opting for a firmly grounded foundation, the cabin leans into ideas of simplicity, tactility, and open-air living. The lightweight teak structure is a nod to traditional Thai housing vernaculars, yet it’s refreshingly unburdened by nostalgia. It contains just two small bedrooms, a shared bathroom, and a breezy open deck that acts as the de facto living room — a liminal zone where inside and outside trade places.images © Jinnawat Borihankijanankid cabin: a house designed for childrenThe Kid Cabin is a study in permeability by the design team at by Imaginary Objects. The bedrooms feature windows that open wide , turning walls into nothing and making nature an immediate house guest. The deck extends outward with a cantilevered table that dares you to dine, draw, or daydream at the very edge of the cabin’s footprint. Every gesture of the architecture encourages immersion. This is not a space that keeps its inhabitants separate from the outdoors — it insists them step into it.Kid Cabin by Imaginary Objects Scales Everything to Kid Logic is designed at a child’s scale. Steps, ladders, and even the bathroom door are all sized to child-sized dimensions, subtly teaching young inhabitants that space can respond to them, not the other way around.By including a large communal sink front and center, Imaginary Objects anticipates the chaos and curiosity that kids bring with them.
