The A.R.M Holding Mega Project proposes an urban framework that foregrounds landscape, public space, and social infrastructure, aligned with the city’s ambitions for more sustainable growth.The approach centers on improving resident well-being by distributing urban density and weaving built forms and open, green spaces together across five square kilometers. A large central park sits at the center, maintaining the spatial memory of the racecourse, with a series of mixed-use neighborhoods organized around it. With nature weaving through them, and with all amenities accessible by just a five-minute minute walk, the configuration is reminiscent of an ‘archipelago of urban islands in a sea of green’, as architect Bjarke Ingels notes.

Consideration of physical, emotional, social, and environmental dimensions foster this sense of connectivity across the various island-like pockets which all seamlessly lead into one another before converging around the central park. ‘The park doesn’t stop at the center,’ says Bjarke Ingels. ‘It bleeds between the islands, weaving nature through the urban fabric.’To enhance this sense of well-being, the architects also place an emphasis on walkability, accessibility, and the integration of local SMEs in what the developers refer to as a ‘city-as-gym’ concept. To improve public health outcomes, all residents can reach green spaces, amenities, workspaces, and social services by just a five minute walk. Sustainability strategies are also prominent, aligned with the goals mapped in the Dubai 2040 Urban Master Plan, with the integration of passive cooling and urban farms, while equestrian facilities nod to the site’s heritage.Dubai’s former racetracks in Jebel Ali are set to be transformed into a vibrant districtfostering social, economic, and environmental sustainabilityThe A.R.M Holding Mega Project has been framed as an effort to balance global architectural expertise with local cultural and social priorities. H.E.
