Spanning 1,800 square meters, the project reuses the historic structures of the site to house spaces for social, cultural, and educational activities, incorporating contemporary wooden systems with remnants of the original brick–concrete foundations.The project combines local craftsmanship and industrial fabrication with exposed concrete elements constructed by villagers and prefabricated wooden and steel membrane structures assembled on-site. This combination preserves traditional construction methods and introduces materials such as fair-faced concrete, rammed earth, and wood.all images by Arch-Exist Photography, courtesy of CLAB Architects, unless stated otherwiseConstruction Over Relics follows dual-axis constructionLocated in a remote mountainous area, Lianhe Village exemplifies the effects of rural depopulation. The once-active village committee office and school have deteriorated into relics, reflecting the community’s past vitality and current challenges. As part of China’s rural revitalization initiative, the team behind CLAB Architects revitalizes the site with four functional spaces—a kitchen restaurant, a small museum, an outdoor living room, and a library—mirroring the historical configuration of ‘three buildings, one dam.’The design concept prioritizes preservation, retaining the usable elements of the old buildings while introducing a wooden structure system. This approach establishes two architectural axis systems: the original brick-concrete foundations serve as historical markers and functional dividers, while the new wooden structure provides stability and flexible spatial arrangements. Two distinctive concrete towers, the Handshake Tower and the Welcome Tower, punctuate the site. The Handshake Tower symbolizes the convergence of the old and new structures, while the Welcome Tower, positioned at the hilltop entrance, greets visitors and anchors the tensile membrane roof of the semi-outdoor living room.CLAB architects transforms a disused village committee and primary school into community centerthe project reuses the historic structures of the site to house spaces for various activities | image by Xu LangConstruction Over Relics spans 1,800 square meters | image by Xu Langincorporating wooden systems with remnants of the original brick-concrete foundations | image by Xu Lang",
