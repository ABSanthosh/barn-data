The La La Land star and her writer-producer husband bought the property in Tarrytown, one of the oldest enclaves in the Lone Star state. The suburb is located minutes away from downtown Austin. After quietly tying the knot in 2020 and welcoming their first child the following year, the family of three moved from California to the historic West Austin estate, which holds the title of most expensive real estate purchase in their portfolio. The pair has decided to part ways with the abode after investing years into restoring the property.The home was completely updated by the award-winning architecture firm Cuppett Kilpatrick. For the project, the Austin-based firm took inspiration from “the gracious nature of the surrounding community,” per the official listing. The four-bedroom, three-and-a-half bathroom pad is tucked away on an oak-shaded street. The main house, constructed with Georgia-style masonry, spans 10,000 square feet. A detached garage is outfitted with a screening room and an entertainment space above. Elsewhere on the 1.24-acre plot is a two-bedroom guesthouse, a screened-in breezeway looking out onto the pool, and a garden reminiscent of a countryside retreat.A landscaped garden area in the yard of the home. Photo: Travis Wayne Baker/Twist ToursStone and McCary tapped local architects Koch McIntyre Construction to reimagine the interiors of the traditional-style house. Quaint features like herringbone oak, brick floors, and creamy marble used for fireplace surrounds and counters are incorporated in every room. The estate boasts five spacious living areas and two dining rooms flooded with natural light. Other amenities include arched doorways, leaded-glass windows, a sunlit solarium, a wood-paneled library, and a playroom. Construction on the property is not yet finished, though it is slated for completion in the summer. The listing is currently the most expensive in the city.An exterior shot of the home.
