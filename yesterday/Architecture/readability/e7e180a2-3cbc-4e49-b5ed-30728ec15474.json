  "text": "Clap Studio revamps the oven club in valencia, spainFive years after their first spatial intervention, Clap Studio returns to Valencia, Spain, for the redesign of OVEN Club, which transforms the beloved nightlife venue into an immersive furnace of sound and sensation. Tapping into the visceral imagery of the club’s name, the new interior concept channels the intense, kinetic environment of an actual oven, where heat, transformation, and vibration converge. Clap Studio juxtaposes cold, reflective stainless steel with richly hued Alpi wood finishes in red and black, creating a visual temperature gradient that mirrors the emotional arcs of a night out. The result is an atmosphere that feels simultaneously industrial and psychedelic, minimal yet sensorial. Light bounces, textures shimmer, and surfaces breathe with energy. A horizontal screen behind the DJ booth adds another layer of immersion, pulsing in sync with sound and light to draw the crowd deeper into the experience.all images by Simone Marcolinenhancing the spatial and sonic experience with led gridsLocated in the heart of Valencia, OVEN Club has long been a staple in Spain’s electronic music circuit, known for its eclectic programming that ranges from house to techno and everything in between. With the latest transformation, Clap Studio cements the reputation of the venue as a cultural landmark, using design to intensify the spatial and sonic experience. The DJ booth remains the nucleus of the layout, flanked symmetrically by two bars that feature embedded LED grids—custom-programmed to shift with the night’s tempo. These light structures mimic the heating elements of an oven, reinforcing the sense of a space in constant flux.Clap Studio returns to Valencia, Spain to redesign OVEN Clubtransforming the nightlife venue into an immersive furnace of sound and sensationthe new interior concept channels the intense, kinetic environment of an actual oven",
