  "text": "Amelia tavella completes Edmond simeoni schoolAfter the success of the award-winning École A Strega, Amelia Tavella returns to her native Corsica, France, with the Edmond Simeoni School and Cultural Space. Nestled at the foot of Lumio village, the project combines educational and cultural facilities, blending into the Mediterranean landscape across three tiers carved from local Balagne stone (granite). Featuring terraced structures inspired by traditional farming techniques, the school exemplifies Tavella’s philosophy of architecture as an extension of nature.The school has embraced Lumio, marrying the village and its surroundings, including its landmarks: the tower, the bay, and the citadel of Calvi overlooking the sea — the other realm. A single obsession guides the design: to follow the land’s curves, slip into them, and magnify them, while drawing on Corsica’s terraced farming structures, known as restanques. ‘Three buildings, three pulsations,’ reflects the architect.all images courtesy of Amelia TavellaCorsica valley’s ‘green cascade’ bridges nature and learning The school’s levels, overlooking the sea, symbolize a journey of ascent. At the top are the elementary classrooms, closely connected to the village. The preschool and cultural center — united — rest lower on the site, cradled within the valley as it cascades, preserved. The interconnected buildings form a ‘green cascade,’ where nature becomes integral to the learning experience. The roof of each tier functions as a playground for the level above. In this way, children play suspended, immersed in the invasive nature that becomes part of their learning experience.An internal street connects the school’s different levels and extends outside, resembling the steps of an open-air amphitheater. The white stone staircase, designed in collaboration with artist Pauline Guerrier, mirrors the contours of the surrounding landscape while evoking the steps of an ancient philosophical school. Here, Amelia Tavella’s integration of art into the architectural design serves as an educational tool, enhancing children’s connection to beauty and creativity.Amelia Tavella returns to her native Corsica with the Edmond Simeoni School and Cultural Spacenestled at the foot of Lumio villageblending into the Mediterranean landscape across three tiers carved from local Balagne stonecarved from local Balagne stone (granite)at the top are the elementary classrooms, while the preschool and cultural center rest lower on the sitean internal street connects the school’s different levels and extends outsidea single obsession guides the design: to follow the land’s curves, slip into them, and magnify themthe roof of each tier functions as a playground for the level above.project info:name: Edmond Simeoni School and Cultural Space architect: Amelia Tavellalocation: Lumio, Corsicaaerial photographer: Thibaut Dini Audric Verdierdesignboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here.edited by: ravail khan | designboom",
