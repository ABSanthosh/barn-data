  "text": "Real Housewives of New York alum Kelly Killoren Bensimon is preparing to list her downtown Manhattan apartment—which served as a filming location during her tenure on the reality series—for $8.99 million. “People talk about new beginnings, but for me, this is about closure,” the former model told the New York Post. “So much of my life was filmed from that apartment. I’m closing the past. It’s all about success, wellness and the future.”The three-bedroom, three-bathroom duplex unit is in the Beaux Arts–style Police Building, which served as the New York City Police Headquarters from 1909 until 1973. In 1988, it was converted into a co-op; Killoren Bensimon moved in in the ’90s. Her ex-husband, fashion photographer Gilles Bensimon, still lives next door, according to the Post. “It’s a highly unusual building, where people never want to leave. It’s where my kids were raised,” Killoren Bensimon said when she previously listed the apartment for rent at $25,000 a month. Now a broker at Douglas Elliman, the reality star is representing her own listing.The 2,400-square-foot home features a great room with 16-foot ceilings and an arched window that stretches nearly that full height. There’s also an all-white kitchen with a breakfast bar, glossy black hardwood floors, a roomy walk-in closet, and a bathroom lined top-to-bottom in brown marble.Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.ArrowThe building has been home to a number of famed residents over the years, including supermodel Christy Turlington, actor Winona Ryder, and fashion mogul Calvin Klein. The designer once resided in the building’s four-story domed penthouse unit. “It has white-glove service, a beautiful courtyard and a very warm, very New York feel, with a sophisticated, eclectic group of people,” Killoren Bensimon said of the historic building.",
