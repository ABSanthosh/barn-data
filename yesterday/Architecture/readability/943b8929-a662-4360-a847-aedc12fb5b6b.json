  "text": "EA Research and Design Office unveils gin distillery in japanIn the serene landscape of Joetsu City, Japan, Takeru Shoji and Takayuki Shimada of EA Research and Design Office present Echigo Herb Distillery, a space to accommodate the artisanal process of gin-making. The three-story building combines reinforced concrete, steel, and wood for a form that appears grounded yet floating. Four large, horizontally stretched arched openings connect the structure to the natural environment at four corner points while giving the illusion that it hovers above the landscape. Artificial terraces and pathways extend from the garden into the distillery. Distillation equipment is also placed on these terraces, which are planted with juniper berries and other botanicals used in gin-making, weaving the production process into the architecture itself. The four corner supports are treated as garden elements, further enhancing the sense of upward lightness. all images © Koji Fujii (TOREAL)gallery at Echigo Herb Distillery immerses visitors in the processThe distillery, designed by the Japanese team of the EA Research and Design Office, is situated on a site with deep roots. Since 1980, the client company has operated its head office and factory here, researching wild herbal enzymes and manufacturing enzyme-based food products. This project builds upon that legacy, utilizing alcohol produced during the fermentation process to craft gin.The ground floor houses the distillers, encircled by a two-story atrium that allows natural light to flood the space. A cloistered gallery on the second floor wraps around the distillation equipment, providing a 360-degree view of the production process and allowing visitors to connect with the craft at the heart of the facility. A staircase leads to the third floor, a multi-purpose laboratory that offers panoramic views from Mount Yoneyama to Mount Myoko. There, reversed perimeter beams are used as flower beds and provide robust support for 90-millimeter steel columns. These thin elements make the roof appear to be floating above the structure. The ceiling itself is finished with mirrored stainless steel, creating an effect reminiscent of water and evoking the essence of gin-making.a space to accommodate the artisanal process of gin-makinglocal stone and wood resources compose the material paletteMateriality is central to the design, with local craftsmanship and resources celebrated throughout. The ground floor and terraces incorporate soil from the region, rooting the structure in the land. The 8.5-meter terrazzo bar counter is a microcosm of the local landscape, using stones from Mount Myoko, the Sekikawa River, and the Naoetsu coast. Concrete walls bear the grain of Joetsu cedar formwork, while the same cedar is used for the exterior of the adjacent machine room. By moving between the earthy, grounded spaces and the airy, panoramic upper floors, visitors experience a profound connection to the land and the craft of distillation. the three-story building combines reinforced concrete, steel, and woodthe four corner supports are treated as garden elementsthe ground floor houses the distillersa two-story atrium that allows natural light to flood the space",
