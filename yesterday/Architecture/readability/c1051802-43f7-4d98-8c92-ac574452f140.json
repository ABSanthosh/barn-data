  "text": "anchor Image courtesy of City Hall The full details for a proposed new pedestrian corridor along Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan designed by Field Operations have been released by the city in anticipation of the first redesign of the famous thoroughfare in its 200-year history. The plan covers a swath from Central Park South to Bryant Park, expanding sidewalks in the area by 46% and reducing the number of lanes for motor vehicle traffic from five to three.  Arcadis and Sam Schwartz Engineering are joining Field Operations as the co-leads of the design and study. Their work expands on the previous mayoral administration’s Open Streets program. The city says the plan is \"projected to pay for itself in less than five years through increased property and sales tax revenue.\" Image courtesy of City HallAside from the stated economic benefit the redesign is meant ultimately to solve an existing spatial imbalance, as 70% of Fifth Avenue's current daily traffic is pedestrians.  At this volume—which increases during times when Madison Square Garden (MSG) is being used—the present configuration is untenable according to the city. The new plan increases safety by reducing crossing lengths by one-third along the route. A 'greening' effect is also provided by adding more than 230 new trees and 20,000 square feet of planters, offering shade and flood prevention to go along with the addition of new seating and improved lighting that make the busy corridor a safer environment overall for New Yorkers. Image courtesy of City HallThe proposal's schematic design is expected to be made ready by the summer of 2025. Speaking in a press release, the EVP of the Regional Plan Association, Kate Slevin, said: \"As the plan advances, we hope it can go even farther — incorporating a protected bike lane southbound, if not on Fifth Avenue proper, on one of the avenues between Second and Sixth Avenues, and leading to a longer-term vision for surrounding streets in midtown.\" The projected costs and construction timeline for the project were not made available by the city, though the New York Times and other outlets have reported it could begin as soon as 2028 once the proposal is approved.",
