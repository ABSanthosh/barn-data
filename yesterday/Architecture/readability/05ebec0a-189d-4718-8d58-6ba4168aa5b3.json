  "text": "Atlas Architects revives 1960s rowhouse in BussumRosa by Atlas Architects is a carefully crafted renovation and extension of a 1960s rowhouse in Bussum, Netherlands, uniting contemporary design elements with the structure’s original character. The centerpiece of this transformation is a warm pink concrete masonry block that functions both as a visual anchor and as a practical feature, incorporating cabinetry and an outdoor fireplace. The project expands the kitchen and dining areas, linking the interior with newly designed outdoor spaces through expansive folding doors and a coordinated pink terrace. This consistent warm pink palette defines Rosa’s visual identity, offering a soft yet striking contrast to the original brown brick of the home.all images by Max Hart NibbrigRosa’s design adopts a cohesive color paletteThe concrete masonry block, with its vertical brick arrangement, creates a modern focal point that harmonizes with the existing architecture. The extension thoughtfully integrates this block to create continuity between the kitchen, dining area, and outdoor spaces, emphasizing openness and connection to the garden. The terrace, finished with matching pink bricks, ties the house and garden together. The aluminum window frames, matched to the pink hue of the masonry, maintain visual consistency, while a cleverly concealed sunscreen enhances the design’s functionality without interrupting its minimalist aesthetic.
