  "text": "In 2014, heads turned when furniture behemoth RH unveiled its inaugural Gallery outpost in Atlanta. Imagined as a grand Southern estate, the Buckhead location illuminated a bold, multifaceted approach to retail—one central to RH’s upscale branding overhaul.Pictured above is the RH Ligné King Bed in Oak. Courtesy of RHThese sensory-driven destinations, all of which occupy architecturally significant buildings, have recently sprouted in Raleigh, North Carolina; Palo Alto, California; and even Madrid. Next year in Paris, RH’s transformation of a former Abercrombie \u0026 Fitch location on the Champs-Élysées will ramp up the brand’s European footprint. But in the shorter term, the furniture giant still has tricks up its sleeve, as it opens a brand-new outpost: RH Newport Beach, The Gallery at Fashion Island. Comprising a whopping 97,000 square feet, it’s the largest RH Gallery yet, transporting customers as they wander through its four airy levels.Given the success of its Fashion Island legacy store, RH expanded within the bustling South California market with a visually impactful Gallery designed in-house. “We believe great architecture amplifies and renders our product and brand more valuable,” RH chairman \u0026 CEO Gary Friedman tells AD PRO. “We either find great historical architecture and readapt it, or we build it, and RH Newport Beach is an entirely new design built from the ground up.”Pictured above are pieces from the RH Ligné collection, on display at the Newport Beach gallery. Courtesy of RHVisitors are greeted by a creamy Venetian plaster façade and tranquil, resort-like garden courtyards, which feature bluestone and decomposed granite pavers. After entering through one of the industrial glass-and-steel doors, they’ll encounter a central hall with 14-foot-high ceilings and vignettes showcasing RH collections. Artworks, antiques, and artifacts culled from Friedman’s own trove accompany these displays, along with designs from RH Modern, RH Baby \u0026 Child, and RH Teen. Nearby, a dramatic double floating staircase conjures 1950s Venice.On the second floor, the RH Outdoor range dots open-air terraces. A level up is home to the first-ever showroom dedicated to Waterworks (acquired by RH in 2016.) Starring a stunning stone tub, it encompasses more than 3,000 square feet of bath and kitchen fittings, fixtures, accessories, lighting, and surfaces. The 8,500-square-foot RH Interior Design Atelier is also on floor three, serving as a one-stop resource for customers: Whether they are seeking expert advice, tackling room renovations, or simply eager to pore over the materials library spanning textiles and finishes, they’ll find what they’re looking for.Open 10 AM–8 PM Sunday through Wednesday, RH Newport Beach is open till 9 PM on Thursday through Saturday for late-night drink opportunities. Courtesy of RHAfter a stretch of shopping, the fourth floor provides a welcome respite. In addition to two wine bars, there’s a sky-lit RH Ocean Grill where guests can savor spritzes, caviar-topped mini lobster rolls, and grilled king crab legs. The venue elicits Euro charm, with its alfresco seating and views of a bubbling fountain and olive trees—all backdropped by the gleaming Pacific Ocean.“Furniture is just one aspect of the RH ecosystem we are building. The next generation of Galleries supports our long-term vision to move the brand beyond creating and selling products to conceptualizing and selling spaces,” says Freidman, noting how they are conceived to “activate all the senses: sight, smell, taste, touch, and sound. These new Galleries and the integrated hospitality experience position our brand for the RH of the future.”",
