  "text": "paris’s grand palais fully opens to the public after renovationAfter four years of renovation, the Grand Palais in Paris fully reopens following a major transformation led by Chatillon Architectes (find designboom’s previous coverage here). The project, which began with the unveiling of the restored Nave for the 2024 Olympics, is the most extensive restoration in the building’s 120-year history. Spanning 77,000 square meters, the work improves public access, brings back long-concealed architectural elements, and adapts the historic structure to meet modern cultural and technical needs.images © Charly Broyez for Chatillon Architectes, unless stated otherwiseChatillon Architectes reveals the true identity of the buildingParis-based Chatillon Architectes focused on restoring the original layout of the building, which had become fragmented over time. They studied over 3,000 archival plans and drawings to guide the work, aiming to respect the original design of the monument while updating it for contemporary use. New exhibition spaces, restaurants, and circulation routes are added, with over 40 elevators and 30 staircases introduced to make the building fully accessible.‘The Grand Palais is a powerful symbol of France’s cultural legacy – iconic and instantly recognisable, yet so much of its beauty has been hidden for decades,’ says François Chatillon, founder of Chatillon Architectes. ‘We didn’t set out to reinvent it, but through a process of revelation we wanted to uncover its identity. This renovation was about bringing it back to life, staying true to its spirit while opening it up for the future and giving the monument back to the people.’Built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition, the Grand Palais was originally designed by a team of architects led by Charles Girault. It combined Beaux-Arts architecture with then-revolutionary materials like steel and glass. In later years, parts of the building were damaged, altered, or closed off, reducing access and hiding many of its key features.The renovation reopens the original central axis, allowing visitors to move freely from Square Jean Perrin to the Seine. This new connection forms what the architects call a ‘place centrale’, an open area created by combining the Rotonde d’Antin, the Salon Seine, and other interior spaces. One major change was the removal of a wall separating the Nave from the Palais de la Découverte, restoring a sightline that hadn’t been visible since 1937.the Grand Palais in Paris fully reopens to the public | image © Antoine Mercusot for Chatillon Architectescentre pompidou to use gallery spaces during its renovationLighting and technology enhancements throughout the galleries have transformed them into versatile spaces for a wide range of exhibitions. The Centre Pompidou will use these spaces while its own museum is being renovated. Other public areas include a mezzanine-level café, Le Réséda, led by Michelin-starred chef Thierry Marx, and a new brasserie, Le Grand Café, overlooking the Champs-Élysées gardens with interiors by Joseph Dirand.Interior partitions are replaced with glass to bring in light and expose the building’s original proportions. Every element, from doors over six meters tall to statues, ornaments, and 150 windows, was carefully restored. ‘At Chatillon Architectes, we strive to revitalize historic landmarks, such as the Grand Palais, as both emblematic monuments and vibrant cultural spaces,’ shares Simon Chatillon, partner of Chatillon Architectes. ‘We approach cultural projects with a strong sense of place, developing thoughtful and innovative interventions that bring renewed energy and help define their future.’The gardens surrounding the building have also been redesigned, visually connecting to the nearby Champs-Élysées. More than 60,000 plants from 250 species were added to support biodiversity, using a rainwater-fed irrigation system built into the renovated roof. A new pedestrian entrance at Square Jean Perrin replaces a former road and improves the site’s integration with the city.Chatillon Architectes’ project is the most extensive restoration in the building’s 120-year historythe work brings back long-concealed architectural elementsadapting the historic structure to meet modern cultural and technical needs",
