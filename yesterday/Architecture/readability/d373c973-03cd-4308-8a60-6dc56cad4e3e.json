  "text": "temporal layering enlivens blue rock swim club in canada Way of Normal transforms a long-dormant brewing space beneath a popular local restaurant in Canada into the Blue Rock Swim Club, a bar whose conceptual history is set within the scene of a forgotten underground bathhouse, long abandoned and slowly reclaimed. More than a spatial renovation, the challenge of creation lay in crafting a compelling historical narrative within a context — and a city — that prioritizes new-build construction over historical preservation.To conjure a sense of temporal layering, the studio selected materials for their tactile honesty and implied permanence. Board-formed concrete anchors the space with brutalist restraint, while wire-brushed, charred wood introduces the rich patina of age. Along one wall, a custom mural in soft, weathered tones has been sanded back — its faded surface suggestive of both art and artifact.all images courtesy of Way of Normalway of normal excavates imagined pasts for the design conceptThe team at Way of Normal approached the brief by mapping the spatial logic of traditional bathhouses. With no existing entrance from the street, access into the Blue Rock Swim Club was carved out through a neighboring service corridor. Recast as an immersive passage, this liminal space is clad in waxed stainless steel and monochrome finishes, guiding visitors downward in a quiet, reflective descent — like slipping beneath the surface of still water.Entry begins in a moody ‘locker room’, now functioning as a subdued foyer. From there, guests are led through the ‘remnants of changerooms’ reinterpreted as individual washroom stalls, before arriving at the heart of the space —the ‘basins’. This sculpted dining area is embedded within the building’s original foundations, its sunken floor and tiered platforms evoking the eroded geometry of communal pools and long-lost rituals.view from the sunken seating space into the bartransforming a long-dormant, underground brewing spaceHints of LA and Brazilian modernism lend the project its warmth.
