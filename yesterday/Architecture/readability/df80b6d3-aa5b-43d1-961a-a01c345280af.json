  "text": "anchor Graph by Archinect using data provided by Dodge Construction Network Total construction starts fell 9% in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1.03 trillion, according to Dodge Construction Network.  Nonresidential building starts declined by 3%, residential starts dropped 4%, and nonbuilding starts decreased by 22%. On a year-to-date basis through April, total construction starts were down 3% from last year. Nonresidential starts were down 10%, residential starts were down 5%, while nonbuilding starts were up 8%. For the 12 months ending in April 2025, total construction starts were up 2% from the year ending in April 2024. Nonresidential starts were up 1%, nonbuilding starts rose by 5%, and there was no change in residential starts. Related on Archinect: Architecture industry saw 'accelerated decrease in billing activity' in April, says AIA/Deltek Architecture Billings Index“Broad-based monthly declines in construction starts represent a troubling signal for the sector,” said Dodge Construction Network chief economist Eric Gaus. “While not definitive, the slowdown in April aligns with delays in the planning pipeline and other economic data that capture the volatility and uncertainty of all the April tariff announcements. Uncertainty around trade policy and the economy’s direction will continue to weigh on construction activity in the coming months.” The largest nonbuilding project to break ground in April was the $1.8 billion Hudson Tunnel Project in New York City. The largest nonresidential building project to break ground was the $1 billion Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Sacramento, California, and the largest multifamily structure to break ground last month was a $331 million residential and retail development in Jersey City, New Jersey. Regionally, total construction starts in April rose in the Midwest and declined in the Northeast, South Atlantic, South Central, and West.",
