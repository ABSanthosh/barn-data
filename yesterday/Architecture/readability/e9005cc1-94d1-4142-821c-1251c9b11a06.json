The name ‘Tyyni,’ meaning ‘calmness’ in Finnish, reflects the design’s emphasis on simplicity and connection with nature. Developed by architect Piotr Gniewek and executed by Finnish company Ehta Group Oy, the collection incorporates modern construction methods with established sauna-building techniques.The compact and simple structure consists of a sauna chamber with a stove, a recreational space, a dressing room, and a shower room. Its minimal form and extensive mirrored glazing allow it to blend into its surroundings, making it adaptable to various outdoor settings. When combined with a terrace, the layout extends its functionality for social or private use.all images courtesy of Tyyni StudioTyyni Sauna merges modern design and traditional sauna cultureConstructed from 90 mm thick cross-laminated timber (CLT), the sauna ensures durability and structural stability.
