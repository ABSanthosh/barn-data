It’s no wonder the style’s reach extends far beyond its rural roots; a farmhouse living room typically offers a polished yet cozy and unstuffy atmosphere, plus the style is conducive to large hangouts with plenty of seating for guests and lounging. Architectural features commonly present in farmhouse-style living rooms include working fireplaces, vaulted ceilings, shiplap walls, built-ins, and exposed beams.Below, we’re sharing some inspiring farmhouse living room decor ideas from top interior designers with experience in the cozy aesthetic. These spaces prove that you can easily embrace the look through thoughtful furniture selections, a timeless, neutral color palette, and intentional decor—no sprawling countryside property required. Read on for answers to all your burning questions about farmhouse living rooms, including how to design one yourself.What styles of farmhouse living room are there?Before you get started designing your space, consider your desired outcome, as the look is versatile and can be taken in a number of different directions. For example, a modern farmhouse look might feature a more sleek, pared-back design, whereas a coastal farmhouse aesthetic would likely resonate with homeowners aiming for a more nautical atmosphere.How can I design a farmhouse living room?To design a farmhouse living room, start by selecting your seating. “Designing a farmhouse living room is about blending comfort with a sense of history,” says Laura Lubin, founder of Ellerslie Interiors in Nashville. She notes that oversized sofas and plush armchairs will look right at home in such a space. After addressing the seating situation, Lubin advises bringing in some rustic, natural materials as well as some vintage or antique finds. Last but not least: “Don’t forget a strong focal point, whether it’s a stone fireplace or a large piece of artwork, to ground the room and bring in that farmhouse charm,” she notes.What are the hallmark features of a farmhouse living room?When implementing the aesthetic, designers typically include a wooden coffee table, brass light fixtures, textiles featuring a striped or windowpane design, and some sort of chandelier—oftentimes one that is wagon wheel-shaped. The furniture in these rooms is generally a neutral color. Most thoughtfully designed farmhouse living rooms feature a fusion of old and new items, Lubin explains. “You want to mix modern design elements with traditional, timeless pieces,” she says. “Think reclaimed wood beams, exposed brick, or stone fireplaces, paired with contemporary furniture.”What materials make sense in a farmhouse living room?Designers agree that natural materials are ideal for a farmhouse living room. “Reclaimed wood is a favorite; it brings in a sense of history and craftsmanship,” Lubin says, adding that linen, cotton, and leather are all excellent choices to fit the style. To contrast with these materials, consider incorporating metals—“like iron or brass in light fixtures or hardware,” which offers a modern contrast to the more rustic elements, creating a beautifully balanced space,” the designer adds. “It’s all about using materials that age well and tell a story over time.”What color palettes are typically used to fashion a farmhouse living room?When designing a farmhouse living room, bring in neutral, earthy tones, Lubin says. “Soft whites, warm grays, and muted beiges create a calm, inviting backdrop, while natural greens or rich navy blues offer a subtle pop of color,” she states. “The goal is to keep the palette warm and approachable, enhancing the natural textures and materials in the room.”Still wondering how to nail the look?
