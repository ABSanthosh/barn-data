  "text": "The Extended Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, February 21st. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today. According to the Global Wellness Institute, the wellness economy surpassed $6.32 trillion in 2023. That figure covers everything from wearable meditation devices to herbal teas, and while personal care and beauty appear to lead the way, when combined, wellness tourism and spas take the top spot, with over $2 trillion dedicated to wellness spaces. Architects and designers know it’s one thing to throw on a face mask and light a scented candle, but it’s quite another to engineer an environment that genuinely lowers cortisol levels and realigns circadian rhythms. Designing a sanctuary requires a lot more than pleasant paint colors and transportive aromas. For instance, adding a pocket door to a space might encourage fluid movement, but choose the wrong mechanism and, well, that thing will scrape along its runners like a factory gate if you’re not careful. Similarly, a sound bath can be an experience of utter transformation or just as easily a claustrophobic nightmare in an echo chamber. It all depends on the acoustic properties of the space it’s held in. For architects and designers being meticulous in decision-making is the key to success, and the correct choices help to ensure that the outside world, along with all its woes, stay politely at bay. That’s why the Architizer A+Product Awards highlights exceptional products, those that have been chosen by a prestigious jury as being the best in what they do. The following 14 winners embody that precision. They offer solutions to everyday dilemmas like absorbing ambient noise without the sterile look of a recording booth or introducing natural daylight without turning a room into a greenhouse. None of it is decorative fluff. Each product addresses real-world design challenges by considering occupant well-being while never sacrificing aesthetic value. Enter A+Product Awards IRIS Luminous SkyCeiling By Sky Factory Popular Choice Winner,  Lighting, Recessed \u0026 Mounted Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Some interiors don’t have the luxury of a true skylight, so Sky Factory’s IRIS Luminous SkyCeiling fakes it with an algorithmic light show calibrated to the sun’s daily arc. This system modulates color and intensity so convincingly that drifting clouds appear like real overhead, tricking the brain into syncing with natural daylight. Even NASA asked Foster + Partners and Branch Technology to test IRIS for off-world living concepts — showing how well it simulates Earth’s familiar sky. Unfired Circular Tile By Loqa Jury Winner, Best of the Year, Sustainable Design, 2024 A+Product Awards In a restful environment, materials shape perception, which is why Loqa’s Unfired Circular Tile, with its artisanal texture and a guilt-free footprint, is the perfect choice. Formed from 85% industrial waste — ceramics, glass and fly ash — and no high-temperature firing, each tile cuts carbon emissions while boasting 106% more strength than conventional choices. The result is a textured finish that evokes calm and supports a truly sustainable retreat. Lido Freestanding Bathtub By: Hydro Systems Jury Winner, Fixtures \u0026 Fittings – Bath, 2024 A+Product Awards Nodding to Morris Lapidus’s mid-century flair, Hydro Systems’ Lido Freestanding Bathtub goes beyond the average oval tub to become a sculptural focal point in any spa-inspired interior. The gently dipping 1.5-inch deck allows effortless entry, while a 31-degree back slope and HydroLuxeSS™ material deliver the kind of indulgent soak that can confidently be specified for daily restoration. Optional hydro therapies — Cold Plunge, Hydro Indulge or Thermal Air — push the experience further. BuzziCee + BuzziPlanter By BuzziSpace Jury Winner, Contract Seating, 2024 A+Product Awards BuzziCee is an acoustic seating concept that hushes the open-plan clamor with upcycled materials and soft geometry. Paired with BuzziPlanter — a lush, sustainable vessel for greenery — this duo turns shared spaces into zones for calm, connectivity and collaboration. BuzziSpace proves that well-being can be built right into the furniture with nature and noise control. Facet Bathtub By Stone Forest Popular Choice Winner, Fixtures \u0026 Fittings – Bath, 2024 A+Product Awards Stone Forest’s Facet Bathtub is made of natural stone to offer a soul-healing centerpiece. Hand-carved over three weeks from single blocks of Antique Gray Limestone or Noce Basalt each ovoid tub absorbs the ambient room temperature to turn a simple soak into an immersive, spa-like experience. Subtle planes and squared ends also provide both architectural flair and functional rest. VetraSpan-L By Sentech Architectural Systems Jury Winner, Glass \u0026 Glazing, 2024 A+Product Awards Architects looking to dissolve the line between indoors and out will find VetraSpan-L’s uninterrupted 50-foot expanse irresistible. Free of vertical joints or bulky frames, Sentech’s structural glass system amplifies openness to provide uninterrupted vistas. The result is an uncluttered façade that concentrates the focus on the view, not the hardware. Pure + FreeForm Ceilings By Pure + FreeForm Popular Choice Winner, Ceilings, 2024 A+Product Awards Ceilings can be an underutilized surface, but Pure + FreeForm’s ceiling products make them work harder with seamless, noncombustible panels. Made from at least 20% post-consumer content and free of off-gassing, these refined ceiling baffles help create a calm and health-conscious environment. By finishing to exacting tolerances, the system ensures architects can shape sanctuaries without sacrificing performance or sustainability. Dekton® Pietra Kode By Cosentino Group Jury Winner, Hard Surfacing, Tiles \u0026 Stone, 2024 A+Product Awards Cosentino’s Dekton® Pietra Kode is the epitome of timeless Italian stone, yet, it is ideal for modern wellness-focused interiors, without the upkeep or carbon footprint of its quarried cousins. Reinterpreted by Daniel Germani, each color retains the grounded serenity of Vicenza, Travertine or Ceppo di Gré yet stands up to everyday demands indoors or out. It is a product that is carbon-neutral, ultra-compact surface that provides quiet luxury with lasting peace of mind. Wall Scapes By Turf Jury Winner, Walls \u0026 Wall Coverings, 2024 A+Product Awards Turf’s new Wall Scapes turn noise control into an artful statement, layering a double panel system in carved motifs that evoke farmland, forest peaks and waves. Each pattern is cut and configured so the gaps become part of the design. With up to 0.4 NRC for acoustic relief, these large-scale panels bring a calming presence with a dash of visual intrigue. A simple yet effective solution. Cono By Luxxbox Jury Winner,  Pendant Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Luxxbox’s Cono pendant hushes background clamor while delivering warm, targeted illumination — exactly what’s needed in a lounge or private nook designed for peaceful conversation. Crafted from renewable wool on a PET shell, it is a multifunctional solution that merges acoustic performance with excellent lighting. Whether hung alone or in clusters, Cono is a brilliant all-rounder product. Italica By Gruppo Romani SpA Industrie Ceramiche Popular Choice Winner, Tiles \u0026 Stone, 2024 A+Product Awards Rustic terracotta rarely feels this contemporary. Italica takes an age-old aesthetic and elevates it for modern projects that demand both comfort and practicality. Five earthy tones — from volcanic reds to salty neutrals — let architects shift between large-format expanses or smaller, modular tiles. By harnessing the strength of porcelain stoneware, Italica enables a stress-free design that respects tradition while encouraging everyday calm. 690/695 Sliding Door System By C.R. Laurence Jury Winner, Doors \u0026 Hardware, 2024 A+Product Awards Because nothing kills a quiet space faster than a door that scrapes or squeaks open, CRL’s 690/695 Sliding Door System glides with near-silent grace. A single advanced soft-brake mechanism hushes movement across broad glass spans while the minimal 2.5-inch header all but disappears, letting the architecture speak for itself. In any space aimed at genuine repose, this door helps keep the outside world firmly at bay. Seyun Collection By Zaha Hadid Design Jury Winner, Residential Furniture, 2024 A+Product Awards Carving serenity from natural timber, the Seyun Collection by Zaha Hadid Design brings calm curves into any environment. Commissioned by Karimoku, the sculptural chairs, stools and tables pair digital precision with hand-finished warmth that’s both visually fluid and physically ergonomically supportive. Sustainably sourced and assembled with minimal waste, each piece aligns with an architect’s pursuit of tranquil, earth-friendly design. Bio-Acoustic Claypot Wall Panel By CSI Creative Popular Choice Winner, Finishes, Acoustics, 2024 A+Product Awards As much as they might try plants, on their own, can’t do everything, but that’s where CSI Creative’s Bio-Acoustic Claypot Wall Panel comes in to help. Combining serious sound-dampening with botanic design, the recycled felt and terracotta wall planters referenced from African craft, integrate greenery in a modular recoverable system that architects and designers can install without the need for a horticulture degree. The result is a visually tactile surface that balances cultural authenticity and acoustic performance. The Extended Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, February 21st.
