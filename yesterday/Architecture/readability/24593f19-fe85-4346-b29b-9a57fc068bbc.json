  "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio’s houses are proof that the man has good taste. The Oscar winner, who currently has five highly anticipated films in the works, including One Battle After Another, opposite Sean Penn and Benicio Del Toro, has lived many lives and called many different places home. The notoriously private actor has long been a lover of beautiful properties: Since he shot to fame with 1993’s What’s Eating Gilbert Grape?, he’s bought and sold about a dozen homes, located everywhere from Palm Springs to Malibu to New York City to a private island in Belize.In recent years, DiCaprio has doubled down on the West Coast by building out his compound in the Hollywood Hills, the site of his first home, which he purchased from Madonna back in the ’90s, and picking up a beach house in Malibu, where he’d previously owned another home for more than 20 years. Below, we’ve rounded up all of the lavish pads, each with its own distinct aesthetic, that make up DiCaprio’s extensive real estate portfolio.Hollywood Hills propertiesDiCaprio’s first major home purchase was technically made up of two adjacent Hollywood Hills properties, one of which he bought from Madonna for $2 million sometime in the ’90s, and the other of which he picked up in 1994. In all, he paid $4 million for the entire compound. According to realtor.com, DiCaprio has significantly renovated the property since he purchased it nearly 30 years ago, though these days, he mainly uses it for entertaining purposes. (He’s also rented the home out to famous friends, like Tobey Maguire, in the past.) In 2020, Vanity Fair reported that the Oscar winner converted the property’s outdoor basketball court into a viewing party venue for election night (the court was an addition he made in 2004 and is reportedly DiCaprio’s location of choice for entertaining). Other amenities of the home include a screening room, a wine cellar, an infinity pool, a spa, and a subterranean garage.In late 2022, DiCaprio picked up a neighboring mansion for $10.5 million, expanding his compound to a whopping four properties and five lots. His latest purchase was originally built in 1963, and features a separate guesthouse and a pool in addition to the main residence. Aerial images of the expansive compound in 2023 revealed that DiCaprio is doing some serious renovations on the place, possibly including refurbishing the pool (which had been emptied out) and reroofing the property, too. Time will tell how the prolific actor will continue to build upon his impressive entertaining compound.Oceanfront Malibu homeFollowing the 1997 box office success of Titanic, DiCaprio shelled out $1.775 million for an oceanfront Malibu home just off the Pacific Coast Highway in 1998. The 1950s-era bungalow featured three bedrooms and two bathrooms, and measured 1,765 square feet. Indoors, noteworthy details included a herringbone backsplash and brass finishes in the kitchen; blue patterned wallpaper along the stairwell; and a chic marble fireplace in the living room. Outdoors, the home boasted a wooden deck with a private hot tub and steps leading directly to the beach. DiCaprio tried to list the Carbon Beach property for $10.95 million in 2016, but ultimately decided to put it on the rental market instead, asking $25,000 a month for it in 2017. He tried listing the property again for just under $10 million later in 2017 to no avail. A few years later, the actor listed the refurbished midcentury home once again, this time for $10 million toward the end of 2021, and the third time proved to be a charm: He sold it for right around the asking price. Fun fact: An interior designer who worked with the actor in the ’90s told the Behind the Velvet Rope podcast that the house once featured Titanic-themed towels, posters, and memorabilia.Silver Lake Spanish-style abodeDiCaprio’s former pad in Silver Lake last changed hands in 2019; Manny Fierros of Ontrak Real Estate sold the home. Courtesy of Manny Fierros of Ontrak Real Estate DiCaprio continued to build out his West Coast real estate portfolio in 1999 with the purchase of a stunning three-story Spanish-style hacienda in Silver Lake. The Revenant actor paid $769,000 for the four-bedroom, four-and-a-half-bathroom pad, which boasted exposed beam ceilings and hardwood floors throughout, as well as an elevator connecting all three floors. Originally built in 1931, the home retained many of its original details. A covered loggia extended through elegant arches to the backyard and swimming pool. DiCaprio held onto the property for nearly 20 years before finally selling it for $1.56 million in 2018, slightly less than his $1.749 million asking price.Belize islandThe actor took a big leap into environmental restoration with the purchase of a 104-acre, unpopulated island off the coast of Belize for $1.75 million in 2005. Known as Blackadore Caye, the island is “like heaven on earth,” DiCaprio told The New York Times in 2015. He partnered with Paul Scialla, the chief executive of New York–based developer Delos, to create plans for a “restorative island” that will offer folks the experience of a luxury resort while also helping to heal the island itself. The resort was designed by architect Jean-Michel Gathy and, once completed, will feature 36 bungalows and 36 estate homes on-site. DiCaprio’s original hope was to open the island to the public in 2018, but so far, the project has not yet been actualized. As of 2021, in fact, reports stated that construction had yet to begin, and activists have decried the project as harmful to the environment. “The main focus is to do something that will change the world,” DiCaprio told the Times back in 2015. “I couldn’t have gone to Belize and built on an island and done something like this if it weren’t for the idea that it could be groundbreaking in the environmental movement.”Battery Park apartmentsA view of the green roof at the Battery Park apartment building where DiCaprio owns two units. Photo: Richard Levine / Alamy Stock PhotoIn 2008, DiCaprio purchased his first East Coast property, a $3.67 million apartment in NYC’s Battery Park neighborhood. It is located in an eco-friendly building where amenities abound and residents include celebrities like Tyra Banks, Cobie Smulders, and director Oliver Stone. There’s a yoga studio, a billiard room, a 50-foot lap pool, a landscaped terrace, and even a dog spa. The building also boasts a 24-hour fresh filtered air system, solar panels, and its own water treatment facility. In 2014, he expanded his holdings by purchasing his next door neighbor’s unit for $8 million. The second unit is a 2,300-square-foot, two-bedroom apartment with its own 1,000 square feet of outdoor living space. The actor still owns these homes.Palm Springs retreatLeonardo DiCaprio's Palm Springs estate is available as a vacation rental starting at $3,750 per night. Photo: Mark Kanning / Alamy Stock PhotoLike many Hollywood stars, DiCaprio found himself looking for a vacation home just outside the city, and in 2014, he settled on a $5.2 million complex in Palm Springs previously built for actress and singer Dinah Shore in 1964. (DiCaprio’s real estate move reportedly even jump-started a boom in Palm Springs property sales.) The midcentury-modern gem was designed by renowned architect Donald Wexler, and spans 7,100 square feet, with six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms. The 1.3 acres also boast a guest house, a tennis court, a pool, and a detached gym. The actor still owns the home, but put it on the rental market in 2016. As of 2024, the picturesque getaway appears to still be available to rent.Studio city ranchThat same year, DiCaprio also purchased a $2.05 million 1930s ranch located in the Los Angeles suburb of Studio City. Tucked behind a picket fence, the house measured 3,407 square feet, and featured four bedrooms and three bathrooms. There were two living rooms, each with its own fireplace, a wet bar, and a massive eat-in chef’s kitchen. The actor didn’t hang onto the home for long, however—he sold it for $2.237 million just two years later.Greenwich Village condoTurns out 2014 was a busy real estate year for DiCaprio: He also bought a $10 million condo in Greenwich Village. The 3,663-square-foot unit was comprised of three bedrooms and two and a half bathrooms, and outfitted with a number of next-level wellness amenities, including a walk-in steam shower with a custom-designed light therapy system, circadian rhythm lighting, a built-in juicing station, and in-duct aromatherapy. DiCaprio didn’t end up spending much time in the home, however, and he flipped it back onto the market less than two years later, ultimately selling it at a $2 million loss in late 2016.Paradise Cove beach houseDiCaprio expanded his holdings in Malibu in 2017 by buying a $23 million beach house situated in the exclusive neighborhood of Paradise Cove. At the time of purchase, there was only a small 610-square-foot cottage perched on the 1.76-acre lot, though it seems unlikely that the actor kept it that way for long. Mansion Global reported at the time that the previous owner, a billionaire named Vinnie Viola, had already gotten approval to raze the house and build a two-story residence in its place. Plans also included a swimming pool, a cliffside deck, and a private beach. (Director Ridley Scott, a previous owner of the lot, maintained that tiny cottage for two years before selling it to Viola for $11 million.) As of 2024, however, it appeared that construction on the site was still in progress, so it remains to be seen what sort of residency DiCaprio will build there.Los Feliz mansionIn 2018, DiCaprio purchased a $4.91 million traditional-style 1926 Los Feliz mansion from musician Moby. Set on an ultraprivate quarter-acre lot, the 4,644-square-foot home comprised five bedrooms and eight bathrooms, including two main suites, and boasted a pool and hot tub out back. Original features, including three fireplaces with detailed mantels, French doors, vaulted ceilings, and built-in bookshelves, gave the residence extra charm. According to the Los Angeles Times, Moby renovated much of the home during his two years of ownership, including adding custom millwork and upgrading the aforementioned fireplace mantles. The updated features included a lower-level guest suite that had a hidden passage connecting it to a steam room, as well as a loft space perfect for a yoga room or study. According to the Times, the actor purchased the residence for a family member. He didn’t hang onto it for long—DiCaprio listed the home for $5.75 million in 2021 and sold it to singer Miguel for $4.9 million the following year.Los Feliz Spanish colonialAD photographed Leonardo DiCaprio's recently purchased home in 2018, when it belonged to Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Justin Mikita. Photo: Emily BerlIn early 2021, DiCaprio purchased Modern Family star Jesse Tyler Ferguson’s Los Feliz Spanish Colonial for $7.1 million. (Previous celebrity owners include Gwen Stefani and Robert Pattinson.) The stunner was built in 1928, and features four bedrooms spread across nearly 5,000 square feet. Ferguson and husband Justin Mikita worked with former Will \u0026 Grace set designer Peter Gurski to design and furnish the rooms in their eclectic aesthetic, which included dark teal-colored walls in the double-height study, a massive wrought-iron birdcage in place of a chandelier in the front foyer, and tweed Philip Jeffries wallpaper in the main suite. DiCaprio still maintains this home.Malibu homeA few months after the Los Feliz purchase, the Oscar winner shelled out $13.8 million for a new Malibu spot, a modern 3,200-square-foot, four-bedroom, five-bathroom estate situated in an ultra-private gated community. The new beach house was originally built in 2005, but details about its interior are sparse, given that DiCaprio purchased it in an off-market deal. What’s known, however, is that there is a large deck, a newly built upper deck, and stairs that lead directly down to private beach access.",
