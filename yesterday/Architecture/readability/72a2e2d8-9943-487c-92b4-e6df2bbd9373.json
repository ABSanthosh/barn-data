However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Picture this: A wood-burning stove, a claw-foot tub, no cell service, and no news. Are you in heaven? Or are you in one of the best Airbnb cabins we’ve rounded up across the US? From an organic design marvel in Washington that would make Frank Lloyd Wright weep to a California cabañita in the trees, there are so many places to enjoy the great outdoors in an abundance of comfort.Although images of immaculate cabin rentals may have swept the imaginations of city dwellers years ago, we’re sensing a renewed spirit of escapism as people look to all the cozy cabins, tiny homes, chalets, and comfortable cottages within driving distance to get through the tail end of winter. These are not your average vacation rentals, by the way, but more so elevated A-frames and Lincoln log-style beauties, fleshed out with curated design features and thoughtful design details throughout. Here, you can get a little lost in the beauty of the wilderness (without giving up too much in the way of modern accommodations).Perks: full-service kitchen, hot tub, BBQ grillThe term “cozy” is often synonymous with “small.” Not so in this jaw-dropping A-frame that sleeps 10 of your luckiest pals and acquaintances. Surrounded by miles of woods, the location sets the stage for a tranquil escape, but those who are looking for a few activities to pass the timewill be happy to discover its proximity to the Rockbridge Nature Preserve, as well as local wineries and breweries. While the white shiplap interior, floor-to-ceiling windows, and floating staircase create a contemporary feel, there’s also plenty of texture among the leather, wood and rattan furnishings to warm things up.Perks: waterfront access, grocery delivery, firepits, whole home generatorThis log cabin, set along the Lake Michigan shoreline, marries the rustic allure of traditional wood paneling with sophisticated furnishings. Every detail nods to the surroundings, from its floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace to the tree sprouting up through the floors. Shades of blue and green throughout also capture the colors of the lake. The open-plan first floor allows everyone to mingle whether they’re cooking in the amenity-abundant kitchen, lounging in front of the fire, or enjoying sunset views from nearly any angle in the space.Perks: rainfall shower, wood-burning fireplaceVisitors to this New England town—known to be one of the best ski areas on the East coast—often come to hit the slopes. But even those who have no interest in venturing outside on a cold winter day will relish their visit if they stay at this Scandinavian-inspired cabin. Light wood beams and moldings, thick rugs underfoot, and minimalist furnishings tempt even the most dedicated skiers to stay indoors. While you’re holed up in your new lodgings, enjoy a blissful soak under the rainfall showerhead or take in the view from the glass wall in the bedroom that offers an unobscured view during leaf-peeping season and beyond.Perks: outdoor patio, fully-stocked kitchen, luxury linensAn hour outside Boise, situated among the Rocky Mountains, lies a magical escape where you can leave all your stress on the car ride up. This high-design A-frame cabin features luxury amenities, stylish furniture, and views for days (you can choose whether to enjoy them through the floor-to-ceiling windows or while relaxing in the hot tub on the deck). The wide-open, marble countertop kitchen is ideal for dining in with a hearty meal, while the circle of outdoor Adirondacks are the ideal place to gather after dark around the fire pit.Perks: outdoor fireplace, hot tub, BBQ pitWhen you think of a treehouse, backyard childhood escapes come to mind. While the memory may be sentimental, thoughts of these ramshackle cabins—that, let’s face it, were likely more dangerous than our parents wanted to admit—will disappear when you walk into this tree-top cabin. Butcher-block counters, a live-edge dining table and a wood-paneled shower reflect the setting among the pines, but velvet furnishings, a vintage-inspired chandelier and a dreamy bathtub elevate the space to something well beyond your childhood fantasies.Perks: dog-friendly, hot tub, indoor hammockPerched above a river on a granite ledge, the amazing views are the cherry on top when it comes to this two-bedroom hideaway. Don’t sleep on the curb appeal—the asymmetric A-frame structure of the home is only the beginning of your visual journey. Inside, warm wooden walls, one-of-a-kind furniture, an indoor hammock, and a marble-clad shower await. The home is a 30-minute drive from the Mountain Loop Highway, which grants access to outdoor adventures in Big Four Ice Caves, Lake Twenty-Two, Heather Lake, and Gothic Basin, to name a few.Perks: small kitchenette, cozy sunken-in bed, mountain viewssLocated 100 miles from Los Angeles in the San Jacinto mountains, Idyllwild offers gorgeous greenery and mountain views. The expansive windows on this hillside cabin allow you to appreciate it all—whether from the king-size bed or the outdoor deck.Perks: heated blankets, electric stove, electric toilet, firepitSure, the panoramic windows are the real eye-catchers here, but this off-the-grid tiny house sports many more fun design details, including the floor-to-ceiling blond wood, the standing shower, a built-in bed and storage, and the distinctive black trim on the exterior. Located about a 20-minute drive from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, Fall Creek is near Lake Eau Claire and the Augusta State Wildlife Area.Perks: giant windows, five minutes away from Swedish sauna, wood stoveThis energy-efficient container cabin-slash-tiny home, another minimalist retreat located in the Catskills, is within spitting distance of Kaaterskill Wild Forest and even closer to a Swedish sauna for warming up from the cold. The tasteful decor, claw-foot outdoor shower, and aforementioned sauna make it a year-round destination, and the host notes that several people have even gotten engaged here (when you see the cozy interiors, you can totally understand why).Perks: sound system, indoor fireplace, waterfront viewsFor a weekend getaway from NYC that isn’t the Catskills or Adirondacks, try the Easy A—a gorgeously appointed A-frame cabin just about a three-hour drive away on the Delaware River. This creekside property, located in the Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, was recently renovated (we’re especially obsessed with the oxblood and sky blue kitchen tiles), and it is also within walking distance of a waterfall. The entire cabin sleeps six and features indoor fireplaces and an outdoor firepit for extra cozy stargazing at night.Perks: secluded treetop porch, walk-in rain shower and soaking tub, lots of windows for natural lightThe Texas Hill Country, situated between San Antonio and Austin, is a vast expanse sprinkled with natural hot springs and pools, rivers, and lakes. Not to mention barbecue. This light, bright treehouse sits just above it all on a beautiful bluff and is outfitted with luxe linens, a rain shower and a soak tub.Perks: electric vehicle charging, poontoon style rental, modern open kitchenThe entire interior of this two-bedroom cabin in northwestern Wisconsin deserves a round of applause, but it’s the full-size kitchen and its massive portal to the surrounding forest that we can’t stop thinking about. With some cabins, you’re sacrificing space for a larger living area (preferably centered around a fireplace)—the kitchen is often an area that gets overlooked in footprint. But not here; fully stocked with Instagram-worthy dinnerware, the dinner table easily becomes a place for refueling… and playing games… and catching up over morning coffee. The list goes on. When the weather agrees, head down to the lake for a dip.Perks: firepit and electric fireplaceNamed after the designer Fritzie Glass in 1969, the Glass House Airbnb is a peaceful retreat for design lovers looking to get away. Standout features are the pea green kitchen cabinets and the wooden wraparound deck with poppy blue seating. If you want to get toasty after a chilly day in Wisconsin, the Airbnb comes with a firepit on the grounds. Alternatively, warm your hands with the electric fireplace while catching a flick on the smart TV to enjoy in the winter months, as well as many cross-country skiing trails nearby.Perks: pullout couch, dogs are welcome with a $45 pet fee, hot tub, and outdoor deck equipped with picnic tablesConveniently located an hour away from Washington, DC, this Black A-frame Airbnb features exposed beams and a multilevel deck. The interior has white ceilings and airy white cabinets and subway tile in the kitchen. Head over to the living area and you’re met with earth-toned couches, side chairs, and a modern rug. Being planted in nature, you’d be remiss not to enjoy a cup of coffee or tea on the deck overlooking the flowing creek that runs adjacent to the home.Perks: wood barrel stove, sauna, access to 20 acres of landNothing says cabin quite like firepits, fireplaces, saunas, and firewood: all key features of this off-the-grid G-frame cabin. Located in a rural, wooded area in New Hampshire, the 196-square-foot cabin packs a lot of punch in its modest living space. This completely off-the-grid cabin runs on solar power, and features a kitchenette with a burner and butane stove as well as a private bathroom with a compostable toilet. This one feels more like a camping situation as you won’t have hot water or a refrigerator, but the simpler life does come with some sweet perks all the same: Don’t forget to sweat your stress away inside the barrel sauna.Perks: pet-friendly, liftable wall for stargazing, two outdoor hammocksBoth a tiny home and an A-frame, this quirky, rustic cabin is nestled between Glacier and Yellowstone National Parks in Montana, where wild elk sightings are not unheard of. Relax in the hot tub or take an outdoor shower (fully solar) after a long day of exploring the 100-acre property and nearby biking and hiking trails.Perks: fire pit, lofted space for guests to sleep, luggage dropoffDo you love skiing? Fall foliage? LEED certified construction? Well look no further than this tiny home in southern Vermont. Located within an hour of three major New England mountain resorts (Stratton, Snow, and Okemo), its streamlined decor, sleeping loft, and ceiling fan make for a serene retreat from any future slop action.Perks: design built into sandstone rock, carport, secluded yardA true cliffhanger, this home is built into a rock formation and the natural materials are dramatically showcased in the living room and shower. Situated near Mesa Verde National Park, there are uninterrupted views of the desert canyon and cactus garden. Rates start at $166 per night.Perks: barrel-style hot tub, wood-burning stove, saunaNo roundup of the best Airbnb cabins would be complete without a submission from the Catskills. Just a few hours north of New York City, this cabin offers a separate guest studio for extra sleeping room, an outdoor Japanese-style hot tub, and multiple decks.Perks: sound system, dishwasher, charming old-timey interiorsChannel your inner country star at this Nashville adjacent getaway. Sink into the leather club couches in the living room while you enjoy the stereo system or jam alongside the antique radio, all while surrounded by 26 lush acres. You'll never know you were just a short drive to the airport. Rates start at $150 per night.Perks: kid-friendly arrangements, Southwestern design, large outdoor porch for animal watchingSleeping up to 12 guests, this Colorado a-frame with views of Mt. Baldy certainly stretches the imagination when it comes to accommodations. In addition to your human party, you might have sightings of moose or elk, as well as striking sunsets while enjoying the modern amenities. Rates start at $275 per night.",
