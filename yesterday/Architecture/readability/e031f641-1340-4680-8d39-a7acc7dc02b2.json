TYPE’s retrofit approach provides a model for how affordable, sustainable renovations can revive historic properties.TYPE identified an opportunity to achieve affordability by focusing on the material palette. The team’s approach emphasized underused, low-cost sustainable materials, which enhanced the inherent beauty of the space. The renovation showcases how careful material selection can contribute to both affordability and sustainability without compromising on quality or aesthetics.images © Lorenzo Zandria dialogue between the old and newThe design concept by the architects at TYPE centered on celebrating the Crescent House’s original features while integrating modern upgrades. The project prioritized enhancing the thermal performance of the existing building envelope, in line with the local authority’s plan to improve the facades with double or triple glazing. By focusing on a ‘fabric first’ approach, TYPE aimed to demonstrate that investing in building fabric need not compromise the finish. The team tested new, affordable, and sustainable materials, such as lightweight honeycomb cardboard for sliding doors and cork for flooring. Ecoboard, a sustainable alternative to MDF, was used for joinery, and painted surfaces were chosen for easy maintenance.Working within the constraints of a Grade II listing shaped many of the design decisions, but TYPE saw these limitations as opportunities to enhance the original features. The budget required a focus on upgrading the building fabric, with Spacetherm and Aerogel insulation used to minimize the impact on the historic listing. The underfloor heating system had to be both removable and thin to fit within the existing listed furniture, ensuring that the upgrades respected the building’s original character.TYPE retrofitted an historic apartment on the Golden Lane Estate in the UKMaximizing Space and Functionality of the crescent houseOne of the key elements of the retrofit was the efficient use of space. The open-plan layout was subtly subdivided to create a more dynamic floor plan. This reorganization allowed for the introduction of functional features such as additional storage for an ironing board and vacuum, a discreet drying area, a small office space, and a utility cupboard. The redesign also ensured that the studio could function both as a shared space and offer privacy when needed.The selection of materials focused on sustainability and affordability. Cork floors, honeycomb cardboard partitions, and painted surfaces were chosen for their low environmental impact. The use of demountable and recyclable elements allowed for flexibility, ensuring the design adhered to the building’s listed status. The exposed steel structure added an industrial aesthetic while reinforcing the apartment’s historic character.TYPE’s approach to working with listed buildings underscores the importance of retaining, reusing, and recycling wherever possible. This ethos aligns with the broader goal of reducing environmental impact and maximizing sustainability in construction. The project serves as a prototype for future renovations, showcasing how smart material choices and thoughtful planning can lead to energy-efficient, cost-effective solutions that respect the historic fabric of a building.the project focused on reducing energy use while preserving the building’s historic characteraffordable sustainable materials were used to revive the apartment’s interiorschallenges included damp issues, lack of insulation, and adapting the layout for modern living",
