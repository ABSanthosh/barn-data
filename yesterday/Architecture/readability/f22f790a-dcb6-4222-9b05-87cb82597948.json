  "text": "Perched on the edge of Seattle’s lush St. Mark’s Greenbelt and a short walk from the vibrant Capitol Hill neighborhood, a 1979 condo designed by renowned architect Gordon Walker recently underwent a transformative remodel by SHED Architecture \u0026 Design. Walker, co-founder of Olson Walker (now Olson Kundig), left an indelible legacy in the Pacific Northwest, and this project aimed to honor his original vision while adapting the space for contemporary living. The condo’s owner was initially drawn to the property’s serene views of the densely forested Greenbelt and its close proximity to Volunteer Park, an ideal setting for daily walks with his two Akitas, Chela and Bosco. While the architectural framework of the 1,675-square-foot space remained strong, the interiors needed updates to better suit modern needs. The remodel sought to preserve Walker’s original design principles – prioritizing a connection to nature and contextual harmony – while incorporating influences from the owner’s global travels, particularly to Australia, Korea, and Japan. SHED’s approach blended respect for Walker’s architectural sensibilities with the owner’s desire for a space that balances openness and privacy. Key goals included creating an inviting and functional kitchen for a professionally trained chef, enhancing natural light, and crafting luxurious yet serene bedroom suites. As a professionally trained chef, the owner envisioned a kitchen that was both highly functional and visually striking. SHED transformed the space into a culinary haven with rift-sawn white oak cabinetry crafted by Henrybuilt. The new layout allows for multiple cooks to work comfortably while maintaining a clean, minimalist aesthetic that encourages social interaction and ease of movement. Natural light floods the living room through expansive floor-to-ceiling windows that frame the Greenbelt views, creating a seamless indoor-outdoor connection. A refined material palette enhances the space, with a modernized fireplace clad in blackened steel and set atop a quartzite hearth. Quartzite remnants were repurposed to craft a custom coffee table and side table, adding continuity and sustainability to the design. The open-plan layout effortlessly connects the living room to the dining area, kitchen, and outdoor patio, where a custom concrete fire pit anchors a wood bench – an inviting space for gatherings and quiet reflection alike. The condo’s unassuming exterior maintains its quiet presence amid Capitol Hill’s bustling environment, but stepping inside reveals a striking transformation. The double-height entryway now features a sage-green front door, a sculptural chandelier, and a reimagined stairway enclosed with a white powder-coated steel guardrail. The formerly open-tread staircase was enclosed, not only providing additional closet storage but also carving out a cozy nook for the dogs. The upper level was reconfigured to accommodate two private bedroom suites – one primary and one for guests – each designed to evoke a sense of calm and sophistication. Grasscloth accent walls, white oak paneling, and custom casework create warm and inviting spaces. The bathrooms, compact yet luxurious, feature milestone plaster walls, Japanese-inspired tile, and a steam room, offering a spa-like experience. Thoughtfully integrated storage enhances functionality without compromising aesthetics. A private patio adjacent to the suites provides a peaceful outdoor retreat and a subtle visual connection to the street below. Throughout the condo, SHED introduced new glazing, electric shades, and improved insulation to address the challenges of temperature control, transforming previously stuffy interiors into a comfortable, climate-controlled sanctuary. The remodel successfully balances reverence for Walker’s original design with the demands of modern living, resulting in a timeless yet contemporary home that reflects both the heritage of the Pacific Northwest and the unique experiences of its owner.
