  "text": "onion subverts the traditional canteen layout in bangkokThai practice Onion wraps the Refectory at King’s College International School Bangkok in baby blue. While conventional dining rooms are only used at lunch time, this new space is envisioned to function throughout the entire school day, subverting the traditional canteen function that can be used for eating, studying, and socializing.Embracing an open, flexible design concept devoid of rigid partitions, the canteen’s two distinct zones — one air conditioned and the other naturally ventilated — are subtly defined through materiality and colors. The dominant hue is inspired by the navy blue of the school’s senior year uniforms, though a lighter, more soothing shade, to create a more relaxed atmosphere that contrasts with the warm orange brick of the building.all images by W Workspacecolor and materiality subtly divides zones at the refectoryThe Refectory’s two zones accommodate 246 painted timber seats in total, divided into a 285-square-meter air-conditioned zone with 156 seats and a 240-square-meter naturally ventilated area with 90 seats. The latter section further connects with fluidity to the central area of the building, eliminating the need for enclosed walls.Presenting a variety of seating arrangements, the dining hall caters to different postures and group sizes, from two-seater square tables to 20-seater long tables. With this, the design team at Onion prioritizes communal dining while extending its function beyond meal times, creating a space where students and teachers can gather, read, or study together at any time, with most tables arranged for group seating of different sizes.Onion completes The Refectorywrapped in baby blue",
