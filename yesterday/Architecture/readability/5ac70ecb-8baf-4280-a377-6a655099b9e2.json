However, most of the featured frames are available in additional sizes and finishes.Wooden Bed FramesWest Elm Midcentury BedMaterial: Kiln-dried solid and engineered wood and solid pine slatsSizes available: Twin, full, queen, kingFinishes available: Cerused white, white, acorn, pebbleWarranty: NoUpsides: Even with a headboard, it’s easy to fit this frame in most any room. It’s compact, but the size doesn’t mean it skimps on style.Downsides: The assembly was a little tricky and the under-the-bed storage leaves a little to be desired.Someone who favors a midcentury-modern style, low-slung bed for a small space that they can keep forever and ever.Bed frame reviewer: Madeleine Luckel, contributorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? The main reason was that it had a headboard, and its narrow dimensions meant it still fit in my New York City bedroom. Midcentury modernism isn’t always my favorite style, but I liked the clean and elegant lines of this piece. I also thought the tone of the wood had a nice warm glow to it.What was the delivery and assembly like? I arranged for assembly from West Elm in addition to delivery, but it was tricky to get it to arrive. It was a few years ago at this point, but the delivery person did not show up for the scheduled time slot twice. The third try everything worked out, but it was a hassle to repeatedly coordinate being home from work in order to accept it. (This was, of course, back in the pre-work from home era!)Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? Yes, but I think my expectations were pretty much just that the bed frame have a headboard and fit in my room. (It has continued to fit in every room I’ve lived in since, FYI!) I will say that I was more into its appearance at the time I ordered it than I am now.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? I would probably give it a 6 or a 7. At one point when I moved, and it was disassembled and rebuilt by my (very good) movers, it ended up with a constant squeak. The next time I moved I asked them to screw it together extra tightly, and the problem was solved, but it was an issue for a couple of years and seemed like something that could happen to other customers.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Yes, if it fit the parameters of what they were looking for. It’s fairly low to the ground, so some things that I would like to store underneath it (such as my standard-size Away suitcase) don’t fit. If the friend lived in New York or another city apartment, I’d be sure to note that.Burrow Chorus BedMaterial: Hardwood frame, fabric upholstered headboardSizes available: Full, queen, kingFinishes available: Walnut, oakWarranty: Yes, 1 yearUpsides: It’s super sturdy and can really blend into a room while still elevating the overall aesthetic. (And some great customer service.)Downsides: It does arrive in three different (rather heavy) boxes. There was also an incorrect piece and the frame did acquire some noticeable imperfections in transit.Someone who wants a subtle piece of furniture that’s sturdy and streamlined but still let’s their fun duvet take center stage.Bed frame reviewer: MacKenzie Chung Fegan, contributorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I’ve traditionally been Team Headboard, but when I moved in with my now-spouse, I made peace with her minimalist, metal frame platform bed. But after years of wear, our bed was giving out, creaking and wobbling and damaging our hardwood floor with an overtaxed center post. In contrast, Burrow’s Chorus frame looked sturdy and solid—and I was eager to have a headboard back in my life.What was the delivery and assembly like? Things got off to a rocky start! My bed frame arrived in three boxes—the headboard in one, the frame itself split between the other two—each over 50 pounds. I unboxed the pieces on the ground floor and was able to carry each piece individually up two flights of stairs without much of a problem. The top, bottom, and side rails of the bed fit together by inserting a tooth on one piece into a slot on the other, but when I started assembling the frame, it became clear that I had been sent an incorrect part. One side rail had teeth where the slots should be and slots where the teeth could be, making it impossible to attach to the top and bottom pieces.I emailed Burrow customer service on a Saturday evening, heard back on Tuesday, and my replacement part arrived by Friday. Once I had all the correct pieces, it was a cinch to assemble. It could conceivably be a one-person job if not for the fact that you have to flip the entire frame over, which definitely required spousal assistance. As someone apt to lose that little IKEA hex wrench, I appreciated that assembly required no tools, with the exception of one screw. The whole thing took about 15 minutes.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? It was just as advertised. I ordered the oak frame with a headboard in Papyrus, a light taupe color with a subtle sheen. The frame feels sturdy and stable—no more creaking—and elevates my mattress slightly higher off the ground than my previous frame. Overall, the minimalist design and solid wood construction makes me feel like I finally have an adult bed.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? I would give it an 8/10 in terms of sturdiness. It’s my first frame made of solid wood, and certainly compared to a metal or particle board it feels stable, like a bed of substance. Because of the interlocking joinery, there are no screws that might loosen over time (aside from one that holds the center post in place) and have to bear the weight of two sleeping humans plus sometimes a dog.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? I would recommend it, but with some reservations. One of the side pieces did arrive with a noticeable ding on one corner. This isn’t a Burrow-specific problem, however—and judging from my customer service experience, I’m sure Burrow would quickly send a replacement. I think most will be pleased with the purchase. The bed isn’t flashy. The headboard colorways are all muted tones, and there are no extraneous flourishes to the frame. A statement piece it is not. It’s ideal for those who want their bed to do its damn job, but otherwise kind of blend into the background and not fight for attention with their high-quality patterned sheets.Zinus Linda Wood Platform Bed FrameMaterial: WoodSizes available: Twin, full, queen, kingFinishes available: OakWarranty: Yes, 5 yearsUpsides: It’s affordable, super sturdy thanks to a solid wood and metal frame, and leans into a lovely neutral vibe.Downsides: Assembly was a little tough and takes some time.If your budget often exceeds your tastes. This is a lovely piece at a low price tag that will blend well with a Scandi aesthetic.Bed frame reviewer: Rachel Fletcher, commerce directorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I loved the look of the Linda immediately—it gave me Scandi vibes and felt like it’d be a great neutral piece. It also looked way more expensive than the price tag, which I saw a few of the reviewers mentioned in the comments.What was the delivery and assembly like? The bed frame arrived flat packed—the box was heavy and a bit unwieldy—but I attribute this to the fact that the frame really is made with high quality wood and it didn’t take too much cajoling to get it inside. I won’t say that assembly was the easiest thing I ever did—I worked on it together with my dad and, after a few missteps and getting used to the Zinus assembly system (more on that in a bit), it took the better part of an afternoon. Zinus does not offer any on-site assembly or white-glove options (that $350 price tag has its limits after all!) and claims that set up should take an hour but that definitely was not the case for us. There were quite a few pieces inside the box, but the instructions were pretty easy to follow (again, after a couple of false starts) and each part was labelled and numbered in a pretty logical manner (piece two connects to piece three and so on). Zinus also provides all the tools, nuts, and bolts you need to assemble, which makes things much easier.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? If anything, the frame exceeded my expectations. It looks great and is sturdy as a rock.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? 10. The bed is made of solid wood and has a metal interior frame. The pieces all fit together with ease once we figured out how to put them together, and the way Zinus designs everything to fit into place is pretty ingenious—it felt sort of like an old school Lincoln Log build-out—and there weren’t any squeaky or wobbly bits to deal with.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Definitely. For the price, I truly don’t think the quality can be beat. And the style of the Linda is pretty agnostic—it’s a little midcentury, a little Scandinavian—so much so that I can imagine it fitting into a host of home decor aesthetics, from a cozy cabin to something more minimalist or beachy or boho! With the Linda, the decor world is your oyster.The Bed by ThumaMaterial: Handcrafted, repurposed wood bed frame, 100% polyester pebbled linen-weave PillowBoard, recycled plastic slatsSizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California kingFinishes available: Walnut, natural, espresso, grayWarranty: Yes, lifetimeUpsides: It’s made using sustainable materials, will hold up well over time, and is easy to put together.Downsides: The material does give the appearance of faux wood.The Thuma Bed is great for someone who moves around a lot since it’s so sturdy and will hold up well over time. Also ideal if you don’t want to spend much time with assembly.Bed frame reviewer: Zoë Sessums, senior digital design editorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I love any furniture that doesn’t require tools for assembly. I can handle a complex design and assembly, but I appreciate the thoughtfulness that also goes along with some considered joinery. I was excited to see exactly how this solid wood and upholstered bed frame comes together and to see how it holds up.What was the delivery and assembly like? Delivery was easy and straightforward. I could lift each piece myself—always a bonus—and it came with a minimal amount of packaging. I began the assembly process myself, but asked for help/company halfway through because I didn’t want to scratch my wood flooring. The instructions were simple, and I was able to put the bed together in less than an hour. It was a lot like using giant Lincoln Logs—you just stack and join the pieces in a certain order and voilà! You’ve got yourself a bed frame.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? I was very pleased with the easy assembly and the heft of the frame. The Japanese craftsman technique was true to the promise of having a quiet, easy-to-put-together setup. My only bits of criticism had to do with the aesthetic quality of the wood (it has a faux-wood look, in my opinion, despite the material, and the brown just wasn’t my favorite) and the challenge of moving the bed frame (if you try to scoot it over yourself, there’s a chance one of the legs will tip over, which happened to me a couple of times).How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? 9. Very sturdy! I jumped on it, I lunged on it, and it held up well. I only knock it a point for the lack of sturdiness when attempting to move it.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? I think this is a really great option out there for a simple, modular bed frame that is made from sustainable materials and that will hold up over time (a perfect choice for someone who moves regularly). It’s also nice that the PillowBoard is optional, so you can change the look of your bed setup regularly.[Editor’s note: This bed is also one of the most popular products among our readers several years running.]Nectar Bamboo Platform Bed FrameBed frame reviewer: Kate McLaughlinWhat attracted you to this bed frame? As someone who prioritizes longevity, the versatility of the frame was enticing to me. I was initially attracted to the fact that this bed frame uses Japanese joinery (i.e., no screws, nails, or tools required!). As someone who lives in New York and moves fairly regularly, it’s always such a hassle to take my bed apart and put it back together in a new place. I was also drawn to the sleek design, which I find to be incredibly versatile. I could see it working well with a number of different styles from Japandi to post-modern. My room leans more midcentury and even though this bed frame isn’t a traditional MCM design, it still fits in. If I decide to go in a different direction one day, I think the bed frame will be able to transition with me since it’s easy to dress up or down with bedding and the rest of the room’s decor.What was the delivery and assembly like? The frame comes in a single flat-pack box. It’s a bit heavy, but overall manageable. If you live in an apartment building without an elevator or need to take it to an upstairs bedroom, it will probably take two people to carry it up. It took probably 30 minutes total from the moment I opened the box to having it set up, and that included a few errors on my part. Once I realized what I was doing, the actual assembly was probably 5 minutes.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? I’m very pleased with the bed frame. I know it’s going to make my next move so much easier, and in the meantime, it looks really great in my bedroom. I also like that it’s high off the ground, meaning ample room to store seasonal clothing, spare bedding—you name it.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? I would give it a 9. In addition to the sturdy bamboo base, the slats Velcro to the side of the frame, so they’re really secure and don’t move around.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? I think the quality of this bed frame is great, and the price point is really reasonable compared to similar designs on the market. If you’re looking for something that makes a major statement in a room, this might not be the one, but it’s great if you want something simple, versatile, and easy to put together.Upholstered Bed FramesArticle Uden Bed FrameMaterial: This bed frame is made out of American white oak, rubberwood, beech, a little plywood, and a polyester blend for the bed frame’s softer parts.Sizes available: Queen, kingColors available: Ashford ivory, light willow greenWarranty: One year manufacturerUpsides: It’s got a super-comfy headboard you can lean into and feels expensive at a fraction of the price. The communicative delivery process is a nice plus.Downsides: The cream color leans more warm gray than white.Someone a little hesitant about purchasing a bed frame online who wants something that makes a statement through its shape and design—not color.Bed frame reviewer: Erika Veurink, contributorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I’ve always been drawn to the comfort of a bed frame with a cushioned headboard. It mitigates my usual pillow stacking to read before bed. I wanted a design where the same comfort the headboard offered ensconced the entire bed, so it didn’t look like a one-off on the part of the design. I love the neutral color of the bed frame, which compliments whatever colorful bed-scape I’ve thought up.What was the delivery and assembly like? Delivery was very hands-on, in a good way. I received updates from the minute the order was placed, and even a check in after it was successfully delivered. Assembly took right around the hour I expected, thanks to the detailed instructions. As I assembled with my husband, we were both pleasantly surprised at how quickly the time went by.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? If you read other reviews on Article’s website, you’ll note an overwhelming sentiment that the bed is less cream than photographed. The actual color of the bed frame worked for the room I placed it in, but I have to side with the reviewers. The color was a warm gray, soft and easy to match with, but not white. Once assembled, I couldn’t get over how much I adored the subtle curve of the piece. Leaning against the headboard is like being ensconced, in the best way possible.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? I was impressed by the quality of the bed frame, especially during assembly. It felt like one of my more expensive pieces for half the price.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Yes! As long as you have some flexibility on color, this is a great bed frame. Plus, the detailed and high-touch delivery process is a welcome addition to what can definitely be a more high-stress process.Castlery Joseph Bed with Bouclé HeadboardMaterial: Solid pine and MDF frame, PU foam, linen and polyester stain-resistant fabric blendSizes available: Queen, kingColors available: Cream bouclé, carbon boucléWarranty: Yes, 2 yearsUpsides: This frame softens and elevates a room, but won’t get in the way when making your bed in the morning. It’s also made of high-quality fabric, so no snags or pulls.Downsides: Does have some space for under-the-bed storage, but might not have as much clearance as other options. There’s also a small bit of wobble on the headboard and it’s a little pricey.If you want a low-slung upholstered bed frame that won’t overwhelm a room.Bed frame reviewer: Holly Johnson, senior consumer revenue managerWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I’ve slept on secondhand (translation: Old-as-the-hills) four-poster beds my entire life. Creaky, shaky, possibly haunted. This bed is the complete opposite—it’s low to the ground, upholstered, and has a grown-up, sophisticated feel. I’d always hesitated at low beds before, because I live in New York and need all of the under-bed storage I can get. Fortunately, this one has just enough space that I can slide under a few bins of sweaters and craft supplies. Easy breezy.What was the delivery and assembly like? Mercifully, this bed came with white-glove delivery, so aside from clearing out my space and finding a new home for my no-longer-needed boxspring, I didn’t have to lift a finger. The bed arrived in three boxes, all of which fit into the freight elevator of my building in one trip. I did need to get a certificate of insurance for the delivery (gotta stay in the good graces of the co-op board), but that was easy. The movers unpacked the boxes in my hallway, then brought the components into my bedroom and assembled the bed in under 30 minutes. The packaging fairies (read: Delivery service) then hauled away all of the boxes so I didn’t have to. I hopefully won’t need to disassemble the bed anytime soon, but when I do, a standard Allen key can be used to take the headboard, side, and end rails apart for easy transport. Wood slats can either be left in place during a move, or taken out entirely.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? The bed is super comfortable, easy to make in the mornings, and I love how the upholstered design softens the room visually and acoustically. The upholstery is of nice quality, too—no snags or sagging, at least at this point—and there’s some subtle variation in the coloring that adds a bit of depth (my bed features the Stone fabric, but bouclé is also available).How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? The base is super solid, so 10. There is a tiny bit of wobble on the headboard, so I’d give that a 9.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Yes, absolutely. The price point is higher than more spartan, un-upholstered models from other manufacturers, so for a “starter” unit, you may be better off going with a lower-priced or secondhand model. If you’re willing to go that next step up, though, this is a great bed. My room feels about 30% more refined because of it. Considering the quality of the construction and the white-glove delivery, the cost definitely seems fair.Crate \u0026 Barrel Anneli Ivory Upholstered Queen BedMaterial: 79% polyester, 13% rayon, and 8% linen upholstery, FSC-certified pine and engineered wood frame, polyfoam fillSizes available: Queen, kingColors available: Ivory, taupe, graphiteWarranty: NoUpsides: It has a super balanced feel that makes an impact with an oversized design but won't overwhelm a room.Downsides: It is an investment piece, which means it's not cheap.If you want a statement bed frame that will also blend in with everything in your room and evolve over time with your personal design choices.Bed frame reviewer: Jordan Goldberg, contributorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I was most attracted to the balanced feel of the Anneli frame’s design. It comes in a subdued ivory shade and has an easy-on-the-eyes structure that makes it seamlessly blend in with my minimalist aesthetic. The oversized design, on the other hand, makes a statement—you can’t miss this bed—while remaining restrained and not too overpowering. It’s also made with a polyester, rayon, and linen blend, which I felt ensured the durability and longevity of the investment piece.What was the delivery and assembly like? The delivery and assembly process was simple and didn’t require much on my end. I provided my building information and Crate \u0026 Barrel did the rest—including sending over a certification of insurance to provide my building with! Two movers brought the bed straight into my bedroom, assembled it quickly, and removed all the garbage. They also helped me adjust the rug to ensure that the bed was centered in the space. The entire process took 20 minutes max!Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? So far, yes! The size is just right in my space as I’m still able to fit a nightstand on each side (a win in an NYC apartment). The best and most surprising element is the amount of support the bed frame provides. My mattress feels like new as the panels holding it up keep the bed firm to support my back. The texture of the bed is soft-to-the-touch but definitely feels like it will stay intact for years to come. As visitors have come to see my new space, the bed frame has been one of the most frequently complimented pieces.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? 10. This is one of the most solid bed frames I’ve ever had. I believe it’s because the base of the bed is on the ground. The headboard is tightly secured as well so there’s no movement when getting into bed.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Yes, it’s an investment piece I know I’ll love for years to come. The simple colorway and timeless structure make it a frame that can blend in with any interior design style and will evolve with me as my personal style changes.Bed Frames with StorageThe Bed Frame by FloydMaterial: TSCA Title VI-certified birch veneer and birch plywood, powder-coated steel supports, nylon ratchet strapsSizes available: Twin, full/queen, kingFinishes available: Birch, walnut, oakWarranty: Yes, 1 yearUpsides: This is a super-adaptable bed frame that you can customize to your specifications and looks really nice.Downsides: The packaging is super heavy and assembly can be a little difficult.If you want a storage bed that fits a constantly changing lifestyle and streamlined decor tastes.Bed frame reviewer: Zoë Sessums, senior digital design editorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? Instagram piqued my interest in this adjustable bed frame with a low-profile design. I was intrigued by the construction, the modular capabilities, and movability. I loved the idea that down the line I could transform the queen-sized bed frame to instead fit a king-size or twin mattress sizes, add a headboard, or add a storage drawer. And putting together a bed frame without needing tools sounded good to me!What was the delivery and assembly like? This bed frame was delivered to the ground floor of my fourth-floor walk-up. And boy howdy, did I feel like I was going to die trying to get it up all the flights of stairs—and that was with the help of a very strong person! In hindsight, I would take each piece out of its box before attempting to move. Assembly was more challenging than I anticipated (or more challenging than it looked on IG), and it helps to be limber and have room around the frame, but now after assembling the bed a handful of times, I’d say it gets easier.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? I wanted to hate the Floyd frame because sometimes I feel that way about ultra-popular furniture, but I have to say I love this frame more than I thought I would. It’s wonderful! I enjoy the height, the modular element, and the way it looks in my room. Floyd, you win, this bed frame exceeded my expectations.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? 8. The bed is sturdy and heavy-duty, and I am confident about diving into it, but I don’t trust it to stand up to everything.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? 100%.

I think it’s worth the price.Platform Bed FramesLenia Panel White Queen BedMaterial: Solid and veneered wood headboard and frameSizes available: Twin, full, queen, kingFinishes available: Walnut, white, and white oakWarranty: One year manufacturerUpsides: The white-glove delivery and assembly makes things super easy and efficient. Once it’s all done you’re left with a stylish and sturdy bed. You can also really customize the bed to your exact preferences.Downsides: It is a little pricey.Anyone looking for a bed frame that they can tailor to their specific design desires and a super hands-on delivery.Bed frame reviewer: DaVonne Onassis Bacchus, contributorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I decided to do a furniture overhaul in my bedroom, and, based on past experiences with Article, I am not hesitant to turn to the brand for quality pieces. My previous bed frame started squeaking just after a few days, so, as I read through the Lenia’s reviews, I paid close attention to sturdiness and the assembly process, both of which customers seemed pleased with. Additional features I was keen on included the midcentury design and open space under my bed for storage and easy cleaning.What was the delivery and assembly like? The delivery process was seamless. It arrived within a two-week window from order to delivery and I was able to get a time slot that worked with my schedule. The day prior to delivery I received an email and text reminder, as well as on the morning of delivery. The live tracking feature was helpful as I prepared my space for the white-glove assembly process. The assembly team was fantastic, clearly communicating their plan and efficiently setting up the bed frame. They unboxed and assembled the large pieces outside and quickly brought it in to expedite the process. I was impressed with how clean they kept my space, immediately removing the empty boxes to the delivery truck. The assembly process took about 30 minutes in total. Overall, from ordering to delivery, communication was excellent.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? Once the mattress was placed on the new queen bed frame, that first lay down was glorious. It was exactly what I wanted: sturdy! My initial impression was the solid construction of the frame; it is well made and it did live up to my expectations. Though I ordered the white bed frame, which can be a bit stark depending on your bedding color and bedroom decor, I’m glad to report there are two additional options available (walnut and white oak) if you don’t want the look of white.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10 and why? I’d give it a solid 9. It is very sturdy. I’ve spent time tossing and turning, jumping, laying, and, of course, sleeping. I’m very pleased!Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Based on my positive experience and satisfaction, absolutely. It is worth the price if you’re looking for a well-constructed and durable piece of furniture with a seamless delivery and assembly process. (And who isn’t looking for those factors when it comes to a bed frame purchase?) There are various options if you have size specifications (twin, full, queen, king); color options of white oak, white, and walnut; and various headboard designs. And, for some who may have smaller spaces, storage underneath the bed is a welcome option. Overall, it’s a stylish bed that comes with a great shopping experience.West Elm Simple Bed FrameMaterial: Solid and engineered wood with wood slats for a sturdy foundationSizes available: Twin, full, queen, kingFinishes available: White, acornWarranty: NoUpsides: It’s raised enough that it offers plenty of under-the-bed storage.Downsides: It requires a little bit of upkeep and doesn’t have a headboard.Anyone who wants a super-simple wood bed frame without a headboard or footboard and that also provides ample storage space.Bed frame reviewer: Katie Henwood, senior SEO managerWhat attracted you to this bed frame? When I moved into a small apartment in the West Village with my partner last summer, I knew we’d have to get creative with our storage solutions. We wanted a tall frame that could fit boxes and oversized items underneath, but still matched our minimal midcentury style. Enter the tall version of this simple bed frame.What was the delivery and assembly like? The frame was delivered quickly and in two separate boxes, neither of which were super heavy. We were lucky, since we had to carry them up five flights of stairs. The assembly was a breeze: The instructions were simple, and everything you need is included except a screwdriver. Oh, and there were no tears, which can’t be said for every piece of furniture I’ve assembled in the past. I count that as a win.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? Not only does this frame hide everything that won’t fit anywhere else, it looks good and is comfortable at the same time. To avoid clutter collecting under the bed, we ordered three of these under-bed storage boxes to hold our extra bedding, coats, and shoes. Even with all that, there’s still room for a snowboard (in a travel case!). We call it the Mary Poppins bag of bed frames—everything just seems to fit.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? I’d give this frame a 7. In the year we’ve had it, we’ve had to tighten a few screws once or twice, which takes about 30 seconds, but otherwise haven’t had any issues.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? Anyone looking to create more space in their small apartment, this is the bed frame for you. It’s not bulky like some bed frames that come with storage built in, and is simple enough to take with you wherever you go in the future. Hopefully the next place will have more closets!George Oliver Buhr Contemporary Modern Wood Platform BedMaterial: Metal, manufactured wood, solid woodSizes available: Twin, full, queen, kingFinishes available: WalnutWarranty: 5 yearsUpsides: It’s super affordable and sturdy and will arrive quickly.Downsides: The headboard feels a little thin, the assembly instructions might not be totally accurate, and the overall design leans a lot more pared down.Anyone looking for a simple bed in a child’s room or spare room that they won’t have to spend a lot of money on.Bed frame reviewer: Yelena Moroz Alpert, contributorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I was looking to get a new size for my son’s bed, he currently has a midcentury-modern style twin bed from Crate \u0026 Kids and I liked the walnut look of the Buhr style. I appreciated that the images show the grain variation and its rich color. I also really liked that the headboard is adjustable and can go up and down depending on the depth of the mattress. This was important to me because I would hate to have a gap between the mattress and the frame.What was the delivery and assembly like? The delivery was within two days—I was super impressed how quickly it came—just in time for me to put it together over the weekend. In terms of packaging, I liked that the styrofoam was wrapped in plastic so it did not crumble all over the place. All the pieces were well-wrapped, so nothing got scratched or dented en route. The instructions were generally okay, but my husband and I did have trouble figuring out the direction of the headboard and the directions of the legs. The images were pretty small and hard to see and there was minimal verbal instruction. Also, I think the actual pieces could have been labeled better. It took us about two hours to put it together because of the headboard debacle. Once we figured all that out, it was easy to assemble and straightforward. I also LOVED that the wooden slats just rolled out on Velco strips that connected to part of the frame.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? It is what I would expect and more out of a $350 bed frame. I once ordered a different bed frame from Wayfair and had to send it back because it cracked as we were putting it together and the wood looked fake. This one actually looks like real wood, because it is. I also liked that some of the screw holes had a metal thread, so it made me feel more confident about construction. My least favorite thing is that I wish the frame looked a bit more substantial. The wood headboard is a bit thin. Also, the design is a bit simplistic. While I appreciate the clean lines, I wish it had more detail around the headboard.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? 8. One thing to note: The side parts of the frame have a supporting leg in the middle. Once the bed was made, it was a bit wobbly, and we realized that these supporting legs were a bit higher than the rest of the legs. So we just unscrewed them and the bed frame is level now. So far I’ve slept on it without any issue and my two kids have slept on the bed, and it seems sturdy.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? I would recommend it to a friend who was looking for something for a kid’s room or a guest room. I would not recommend it as something for a primary bed. It’s just too simple in terms of silhouette. However, it’s a solid choice for someone on a budget. It looks substantial enough and is not flimsy upon construction. When I was sitting up and reading at night, the headboard did not hit against the wall or feel as if I was pushing it back.Scandinavian Minimalist Birch Platform Bed FrameMaterial: Solid birch woodSizes available: Twin, twin XL, full, full XL, queen, kingFinishes available: BirchWarranty: N/AUpsides: Easy to build and deconstruct, squeak-free design, lots of storage space underneathDownsides: High price pointPeople who want a Japanese-inspired frame with lots of storage spaceBed frame reviewer: Lori Keong, associate commerce directorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? I had been on a personal Odyssey for over a year after moving into my first one-bedroom in search of the perfect bed frame. Originally, my bed was sitting on one of Casper’s Foundations, which is a fancy term for “box spring.” It served me really well over the first couple years of my New York life as I moved from place to place, but it became a source of embarrassment to not have a more grownup bed setup.I knew I still wanted something with a low-profile that wasn’t literally a box spring on the floor and that would still allow me to store bedding and other items underneath since my apartment is so small. It also needed to be less ubiquitous than the Floyd (the unofficial bed frame of Brooklyn) and well-made.Japanese-leaning designs were high on my list. I sat on the wait-list for the No Fuss Plus bed frame from Canadian brand Quagga for close to a year before I chanced upon this similar style at Etsy. It had a similar no-construction-necessary slatted frame that blends Japanese and Scandinavian aesthetics. It’s also higher up off the ground than the Quagga, which was kinda perfect for storage.What was the delivery and assembly like? Since I ordered this from Etsy, I couldn’t exactly get white glove delivery. Instead, the guy across the hall from me (bless him) helped me lug a giant box full of wood pieces up to my space for free. (That’s the kind of neighborly spirit we can all get behind.) Assembly was a breeze once I pried the box open. All you have to do is figure out where the slats fit into each other and then pop each one into their designated grooves within the base.Sometimes with flat-packed furniture, you can tell the pieces weren’t well-constructed to fit together, but these were sawed uniformly so they’re interchangeable and lock together. There was no construction manual necessary and setup took approximately 10 minutes (even on a glass of wine) by myself to figure it out.Did the bed frame live up to your expectations? I was pretty nervous to buy a bed on Etsy that had less than five reviews at the time, but this bed has been one of the best purchases I’ve made in recent years. The construction feels super high-quality, and its silhouette is unlike anything you’ll find at a big-box retailer otherwise. I love the design and how many cavities of space it creates underneath the bed for stuffing any number of storage containers. It cost more than I wanted to pay for it, but I think I’ll have this bed for a very long time, so it will be well worth it in the end.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10? 9. The bed feels super sturdy since all the bed pieces lock into each other like puzzle pieces. It never buckles under the weight of my body combined with the weight of my very heavy Company Store mattress, along with any overnight guests. The only time you might experience sagging is if you’re right on a corner or edge, depending on the size of your mattress, but I haven’t really had any issues with that.Squeaking and clanking is a huge no-no for me, and thankfully there are no metal pieces to announce your comings and goings or nocturnal activities. The pieces fit so well together that you shouldn’t have to worry about any noise whatsoever from moving pieces.Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend? 1000%. It’s so good that I was almost tempted to gatekeep it, but the guy who makes the beds runs a small operation out of Arvada, Colorado and is doing a great job! Go Blake!Sarah Ellison Yoko BedMaterial: Solid and engineered walnutSizes available: Queen, kingFinishes available: BirchWarranty: One-year warrantyUpsides: If you want the AD Open Door look—literally—go with this incredibly stylish and sturdy option that’s sure to become the centerpiece of your bedroom.Downsides: Definitely a splurge and best for larger bedrooms since it’s only available in a queen and king size. Prospective buyers are also encouraged to invest in white glove delivery to make the delivery process easier.Name and job title: Sydney Gore, senior digital design editorWhat attracted you to this bed frame? The oversized round feet really sold me on this bed frame, it’s so unique! It didn’t take long for Yoko to become my dream bed after I saw it enough times on Instagram, and then in our own meetings for home tours. I tend to avoid subscribing to specific aesthetics like Japandi for example, but when it comes to setting a mood for a bedroom I’ve always leaned toward keeping things minimal because this is a space reserved for rest so you want it to feel peaceful. Sarah Ellison pulled inspiration from Japanese minimalism while conceptualizing this contemporary design.What was the delivery and assembly like (How long did it take? Were the instructions clear?)? I won’t lie, the delivery was a bit of a nightmare. DWR accidentally scheduled my delivery as curbside instead of white glove so I had to bribe the guys doing the drop-off to bring it into my apartment. (They were originally going to leave all the boxes in the entryway of my building, which would have been a disaster.) The parts for the bed frame are separated in three boxes that are very challenging to carry up the stairs because they are so heavy. I’m grateful that everything worked out in the end, but it was a really stressful experience. As for the assembly, I hired someone from TaskRabbit and he managed to put the bed frame together in under an hour all by himself even though the instructions claimed that you should have at least four people working on it. (Shoutout to Peter for being a total pro!)Did the bed frame live up to your expectations (What’s your favorite element in the design? Is there anything you would change about it?)? Is it possible for a bed frame to exceed all of your expectations? Not only did it elevate the appearance of my bedroom, but it has reinspired me to make better use of the small space and curate it with even more intention. While some people gawk at the idea of a bed taking up most of the room, when you’re sleeping in a bed like this it feels like a luxury. I currently have a full size mattress and I like that it leaves some room around the perimeter of the bed which I use as a surface for bedside books and beverages. It makes me feel like I’m on a private island where no one can disturb my peace for hours on end—I’ve never slept better in my life.How would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10 and why?10/10, no notes. If anything, I struggle to get out of it because I’m so comfortable!Would you recommend this bed frame to a friend (Why? And is it worth the price?)? I would 100% recommend the Yoko bed frame to anyone that can afford it—though it’s understandable that most people can’t/aren’t comfortable with dropping thousands of dollars on a single item. While this bed is perfect for me in every way, someone else might feel differently depending on their preferences.What to Consider When Buying a Bed FrameThere is a world of bed frames out there and it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by all the options. So before you hit “buy,” here are a few questions you should ask yourself.What type of bed do you want?We at AD classify bed frames into four different categories: wood frames, upholstered frames, frames with storage, and platform frames. To identify which of these bed frames types best suits your lifestyle, think about both the aesthetic of your room and what you want out of a bed frame. If you want a frame with built in drawers to tuck things away, a storage bed is probably your move. If drawers aren’t an absolute necessity for you but you still want some space to put containers or boxes, get a platform bed. If you want a big statement headboard that makes a room feel cozy or more dramatic, an upholstered frame.To headboard or not to headboard?That is the question. The decision to buy (or make!) a headboard often comes down to two main factors: personal style and space. Having a headboard can help fill some empty space and it can also offer additional support when you’re sitting up in bed. However in other cases and in some rooms, it can feel overwhelming. Opt for no headboard if you want something super minimal (or even monastic) that allows you to have real estate for a few other things in your room. If you like that cozy, full feeling and want a headboard to fill negative space, then get a frame that has one.Do you want a wooden or upholstered bed frame?The answer to that comes down to your style and the decor in your room. An upholstered bed frame can help soften a space, adds an interesting textural element, and looks quite luxe. A wood frame on the other hand is more classic and structured. Either material pairs well with most decor styles, it just comes down to the space you have and what you think would compliment your room better.How We TestedIn an effort to ensure you’re only bringing beautiful, well-made furniture into your spaces, just know that we test and review every single product you see on this list in our very own homes. Whether those are sprawling suburban spaces or tiny New York City apartments, we made sure these beds are put to use in a real life setting—no labs or test tubes for us. We assemble the pieces ourselves as well as sleep, jump, cuddle and bedrot in them, all to make sure we can stand behind each option on this list. So how do we pick the products themselves and what did we ask our testers?:What attracted you to this bed frame? Whether the bed frame was the finishing touch to our tester’s Japandi oasis or your mid-century dream come true, we wanted to know exactly why the piece sparked joy. For some, inspiration came straight from the pages of AD. Others were scouted out their frames on Instagram while some were in the market for something with very specific qualities (under-bed storage, an upholstered design, something headboard-less).Delivery and assembly: Waiting months on end to snooze on the perfect bed frame is not it. We surveyed testers on whether or not their beds arrived within the guaranteed delivery window and how it was packaged. Flat packed in one box? A box per piece? We let you know exactly what to expect on your doorstep with each order. Some of our testers also put together their bed with their own two hands—and let you know if it’s worth it to spring for white glove delivery.First and second impressions: Sometimes what you see online isn’t always what you get in person. We asked our testers to detail any notable first impressions, design quirks, and if their mattresses sat well on the frames. We asked if they were ultimately pleased with their choices as well as whether they thought the item was worth its price tag.Style: We consider it our jobs to make sure your home is filled with beautiful things. AD’s editors take great lengths to curate design-forward styles from today’s top home retailers and report exactly what prospective buyers can expect. We take into consideration different decor aesthetics (Scandi! Modern Farmhouse! Mid-Century!) and use our expertise to pinpoint exactly what kind of home a particular piece of furniture would (or wouldn’t) work in.Price: We make sure we have a wide range of products that span the affordable to the most splurge worthy so you can find a bed that fits your budget.Comfort: Our selections are impossibly stylish but also incredibly comfortable. Especially when it comes to anything sleep-related, we’re invested in ensuring the best rest you can possibly get.Ease of use: We don’t think it should take a rocket scientist-level education to assemble any piece of furniture. We even called out if we think a particular style called for splurging on white glove delivery.Sturdiness: There’s nothing worse (or scarier) than a bed frame giving out on you. The frames on this list have been put through countless nights of rest without a wobble—meaning you can rest easy (literally!)Overall value: We have lofty standards and wouldn’t recommend anything that we wouldn’t also recommend to a friend. We also wanted to know who the furniture may not be a great option for—so we grilled our testers to get the bottom line on whether their frame deserved a spot on our list.",

Midcentury modernism isn’t always my favorite style, but I liked the clean and elegant lines of this piece. I also thought the tone of the wood had a nice warm glow to it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like?\u003c/strong\u003e I arranged for assembly from West Elm in addition to delivery, but it was tricky to get it to arrive. It was a few years ago at this point, but the delivery person did not show up for the scheduled time slot twice. The third try everything worked out, but it was a hassle to repeatedly coordinate being home from work in order to accept it. (This was, of course, back in the pre-work from home era!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, but I think my expectations were pretty much just that the bed frame have a headboard and fit in my room. (It has continued to fit in every room I’ve lived in since, FYI!) I will say that I was more into its appearance at the time I ordered it than I am now.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10?\u003c/strong\u003e I would probably give it a 6 or a 7. At one point when I moved, and it was disassembled and rebuilt by my (very good) movers, it ended up with a constant squeak.

But after years of wear, our bed was giving out, creaking and wobbling and damaging our hardwood floor with an overtaxed center post. In contrast, Burrow’s Chorus frame looked sturdy and solid—and I was eager to have a headboard back in my life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like?\u003c/strong\u003e Things got off to a rocky start! My bed frame arrived in three boxes—the headboard in one, the frame itself split between the other two—each over 50 pounds. I unboxed the pieces on the ground floor and was able to carry each piece individually up two flights of stairs without much of a problem. The top, bottom, and side rails of the bed fit together by inserting a tooth on one piece into a slot on the other, but when I started assembling the frame, it became clear that I had been sent an incorrect part. One side rail had teeth where the slots should be and slots where the teeth could be, making it impossible to attach to the top and bottom pieces.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI emailed Burrow customer service on a Saturday evening, heard back on Tuesday, and my replacement part arrived by Friday. Once I had all the correct pieces, it was a cinch to assemble. It could conceivably be a one-person job if not for the fact that you have to flip the entire frame over, which definitely required spousal assistance. As someone apt to lose that little IKEA hex wrench, I appreciated that assembly required no tools, with the exception of one screw. The whole thing took about 15 minutes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e It was just as advertised. I ordered the oak frame with a headboard in Papyrus, a light taupe color with a subtle sheen. The frame feels sturdy and stable—no more creaking—and elevates my mattress slightly higher off the ground than my previous frame. Overall, the minimalist design and solid wood construction makes me feel like I finally have an adult bed.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10?\u003c/strong\u003e I would give it an 8/10 in terms of sturdiness. It’s my first frame made of solid wood, and certainly compared to a metal or particle board it feels stable, like a bed of substance. Because of the interlocking joinery, there are no screws that might loosen over time (aside from one that holds the center post in place) and have to bear the weight of two sleeping humans plus sometimes a dog.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you recommend this bed frame to a friend?\u003c/strong\u003e I would recommend it, but with some reservations. One of the side pieces did arrive with a noticeable ding on one corner. This isn’t a Burrow-specific problem, however—and judging from my customer service experience, I’m sure Burrow would quickly send a replacement. I think most will be pleased with the purchase. The bed isn’t flashy. The headboard colorways are all muted tones, and there are no extraneous flourishes to the frame. A statement piece it is not. It’s ideal for those who want their bed to do its damn job, but otherwise kind of blend into the background and not fight for attention with their \u003ca

I won’t say that assembly was the \u003cem\u003eeasiest\u003c/em\u003e thing I ever did—I worked on it together with my dad and, after a few missteps and getting used to the Zinus assembly system (more on that in a bit), it took the better part of an afternoon. Zinus does not offer any on-site assembly or white-glove options (that $350 price tag has its limits after all!) and claims that set up should take an hour but that definitely was not the case for us. There were quite a few pieces inside the box, but the instructions were pretty easy to follow (again, after a couple of false starts) and each part was labelled and numbered in a pretty logical manner (piece two connects to piece three and so on). Zinus also provides all the tools, nuts, and bolts you need to assemble, which makes things much easier.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e If anything, the frame exceeded my expectations.

The bed is made of solid wood and has a metal interior frame. The pieces all fit together with ease once we figured out how to put them together, and the way Zinus designs everything to fit into place is pretty ingenious—it felt sort of like an old school Lincoln Log build-out—and there weren’t any squeaky or wobbly bits to deal with.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you recommend this bed frame to a friend?\u003c/strong\u003e Definitely. For the price, I truly don’t think the quality can be beat.

I began the assembly process myself, but asked for help/company halfway through because I didn’t want to scratch my wood flooring. The instructions were simple, and I was able to put the bed together in less than an hour. It was a lot like using giant Lincoln Logs—you just stack and join the pieces in a certain order and voilà!

The Japanese craftsman technique was true to the promise of having a quiet, easy-to-put-together setup. My only bits of criticism had to do with the aesthetic quality of the wood (it has a faux-wood look, in my opinion, despite the material, and the brown just wasn’t my favorite) and the challenge of moving the bed frame (if you try to scoot it over yourself, there’s a chance one of the legs will tip over, which happened to me a couple of times).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10?\u003c/strong\u003e 9.

I was initially attracted to the fact that this bed frame uses Japanese joinery (i.e., no screws, nails, or tools required!). As someone who lives in New York and moves fairly regularly, it’s always such a hassle to take my bed apart and put it back together in a new place. I was also drawn to the sleek design, which I find to be incredibly versatile. I could see it working well with a number of different styles from Japandi to post-modern. My room leans more midcentury and even though this bed frame isn’t a traditional MCM design, it still fits in. If I decide to go in a different direction one day, I think the bed frame will be able to transition with me since it’s easy to dress up or down with bedding and the rest of the room’s decor.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like?\u003c/strong\u003e The frame comes in a single flat-pack box. It’s a bit heavy, but overall manageable. If you live in an apartment building without an elevator or need to take it to an upstairs bedroom, it will probably take two people to carry it up. It took probably 30 minutes total from the moment I opened the box to having it set up, and that included a few errors on my part. Once I realized what I was doing, the actual assembly was probably 5 minutes.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e I’m very pleased with the bed frame. I know it’s going to make my next move so much easier, and in the meantime, it looks really great in my bedroom. I also like that it’s high off the ground, meaning ample room to store seasonal clothing, spare bedding—you name it.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10\u003c/strong\u003e?

The actual color of the bed frame worked for the room I placed it in, but I have to side with the reviewers. The color was a warm gray, soft and easy to match with, but not white. Once assembled, I couldn’t get over how much I adored the subtle curve of the piece.

Creaky, shaky, possibly haunted. This bed is the complete opposite—it’s low to the ground, upholstered, and has a grown-up, sophisticated feel. I’d always hesitated at low beds before, because I live in New York and need all of the under-bed storage I can get. Fortunately, this one has just enough space that I can slide under a few bins of sweaters and craft supplies. Easy breezy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like?\u003c/strong\u003e Mercifully, this bed came with white-glove delivery, so aside from clearing out my space and finding a new home for my no-longer-needed boxspring, I didn’t have to lift a finger. The bed arrived in three boxes, all of which fit into the freight elevator of my building in one trip. I \u003cem\u003edid\u003c/em\u003e need to get a certificate of insurance for the delivery (gotta stay in the good graces of the co-op board), but that was easy. The movers unpacked the boxes in my hallway, then brought the components into my bedroom and assembled the bed in under 30 minutes. The packaging fairies (read: Delivery service) then hauled away all of the boxes so I didn’t have to. I hopefully won’t need to disassemble the bed anytime soon, but when I do, a standard Allen key can be used to take the headboard, side, and end rails apart for easy transport. Wood slats can either be left in place during a move, or taken out entirely.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e The bed is super comfortable, easy to make in the mornings, and I love how the upholstered design softens the room visually and acoustically. The upholstery is of nice quality, too—no snags or sagging, at least at this point—and there’s some subtle variation in the coloring that adds a bit of depth (my bed features the Stone fabric, but bouclé is also available).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10?\u003c/strong\u003e The base is super solid, so 10.

The price point is higher than more spartan, un-upholstered models from other manufacturers, so for a “starter” unit, you may be better off going with a lower-priced or secondhand model. If you’re willing to go that next step up, though, this is a great bed. My room feels about 30% more refined because of it.

The best and most surprising element is the amount of support the bed frame provides. My mattress feels like new as the panels holding it up keep the bed firm to support my back. The texture of the bed is soft-to-the-touch but definitely feels like it will stay intact for years to come.

I was intrigued by the construction, the modular capabilities, and movability.

And boy howdy, did I feel like I was going to die trying to get it up all the flights of stairs—and that was with the help of a very strong person! In hindsight, I would take each piece out of its box before attempting to move. Assembly was more challenging than I anticipated (or more challenging than it looked on IG), and it helps to be limber and have room around the frame, but now after assembling the bed a handful of times, I’d say it gets easier.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e I wanted to hate the Floyd frame because sometimes I feel that way about ultra-popular furniture, but I have to say I love this frame more than I thought I would.

My previous bed frame started squeaking just after a few days, so, as I read through the Lenia’s reviews, I paid close attention to sturdiness and the assembly process, both of which customers seemed pleased with. Additional features I was keen on included the midcentury design and open space under my bed for storage and easy cleaning.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like?\u003c/strong\u003e The delivery process was seamless. It arrived within a two-week window from order to delivery and I was able to get a time slot that worked with my schedule. The day prior to delivery I received an email and text reminder, as well as on the morning of delivery. The live tracking feature was helpful as I prepared my space for the white-glove assembly process. The assembly team was fantastic, clearly communicating their plan and efficiently setting up the bed frame. They unboxed and assembled the large pieces outside and quickly brought it in to expedite the process. I was impressed with how clean they kept my space, immediately removing the empty boxes to the delivery truck. The assembly process took about 30 minutes in total. Overall, from ordering to delivery, communication was excellent.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e Once the mattress was placed on the new queen bed frame, that first lay down was glorious. It was exactly what I wanted: sturdy! My initial impression was the solid construction of the frame; it is well made and it did live up to my expectations. Though I ordered the white bed frame, which can be a bit stark depending on your bedding color and bedroom decor, I’m glad to report there are two additional options available (walnut and white oak) if you don’t want the look of white.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10 and why?\u003c/strong\u003e I’d give it a solid 9.

It is worth the price if you’re looking for a well-constructed and durable piece of furniture with a seamless delivery and assembly process. (And who isn’t looking for those factors when it comes to a bed frame purchase?) There are various options if you have size specifications (twin, full, queen, king); color options of white oak, white, and walnut; and various headboard designs. And, for some who may have smaller spaces, storage underneath the bed is a welcome option. Overall, it’s a stylish bed that comes with a great shopping

size for my son’s bed, he currently has a midcentury-modern style twin bed from Crate \u0026amp; Kids and I liked the walnut look of the Buhr style. I appreciated that the images show the grain variation and its rich color. I also really liked that the headboard is adjustable and can go up and down depending on the depth of the mattress. This was important to me because I would hate to have a gap between the mattress and the frame.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like?\u003c/strong\u003e The delivery was within two days—I was super impressed how quickly it came—just in time for me to put it together over the weekend. In terms of packaging, I liked that the styrofoam was wrapped in plastic so it did not crumble all over the place. All the pieces were well-wrapped, so nothing got scratched or dented en route. The instructions were generally okay, but my husband and I did have trouble figuring out the direction of the headboard and the directions of the legs. The images were pretty small and hard to see and there was minimal verbal instruction. Also, I think the actual pieces could have been labeled better. It took us about two hours to put it together because of the headboard debacle. Once we figured all that out, it was easy to assemble and straightforward. I also LOVED that the wooden slats just rolled out on Velco strips that connected to part of the frame.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations?\u003c/strong\u003e It is what I would expect and more out of a $350 bed frame. I once ordered a different bed frame from Wayfair and had to send it back because it cracked as we were putting it together and the wood looked fake. This one actually looks like real wood, because it is. I also liked that some of the screw holes had a metal thread, so it made me feel more confident about construction. My least favorite thing is that I wish the frame looked a bit more substantial. The wood headboard is a bit thin. Also, the design is a bit simplistic. While I appreciate the clean lines, I wish it had more detail around the headboard.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10?\u003c/strong\u003e 8. One thing to note: The side parts of the frame have a supporting leg in the middle. Once the bed was made, it was a bit wobbly, and we realized that these supporting legs were a bit higher than the rest of the legs. So we just unscrewed them and the bed frame is level now. So far I’ve slept on it without any issue and my two kids have slept on the bed, and it seems sturdy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould you recommend this bed frame to a friend?\u003c/strong\u003e I would recommend it to a friend who was looking for something for a kid’s room or a guest room. I would not recommend it as something for a primary bed. It’s just too simple in terms of silhouette. However, it’s a solid choice for someone on a budget. It looks substantial enough and is not flimsy upon construction. When I was sitting up and reading at night, the headboard did not hit against the wall or feel as if I was pushing it back.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv type=\"embed\"

It didn’t take long for Yoko to become my dream bed after I saw it enough times on Instagram, and then in our own meetings for home tours. I tend to avoid subscribing to specific aesthetics like \u003ca href=\"https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/japandi-style-101\"\u003eJapandi\u003c/a\u003e for example, but when it comes to setting a mood for a bedroom I’ve always leaned toward keeping things minimal because this is a space reserved for rest so you want it to feel peaceful. Sarah Ellison pulled inspiration from Japanese minimalism while conceptualizing this contemporary design.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat was the delivery and assembly like (How long did it take? Were the instructions clear?)?\u003c/strong\u003e I won’t lie, the delivery was a bit of a nightmare. DWR accidentally scheduled my delivery as curbside instead of white glove so I had to bribe the guys doing the drop-off to bring it into my apartment. (They were originally going to leave all the boxes in the entryway of my building, which would have been a disaster.) The parts for the bed frame are separated in three boxes that are very challenging to carry up the stairs because they are so heavy. I’m grateful that everything worked out in the end, but it was a really stressful experience. As for the assembly, I hired someone from TaskRabbit and he managed to put the bed frame together in under an hour all by himself even though the instructions claimed that you should have at least four people working on it. (Shoutout to Peter for being a total pro!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid the bed frame live up to your expectations (What’s your favorite element in the design?

Not only did it elevate the appearance of my bedroom, but it has reinspired me to make better use of the small space and curate it with even more intention. While some people gawk at the idea of a bed taking up most of the room, when you’re sleeping in a bed like this it feels like a luxury. I currently have a full size mattress and I like that it leaves some room around the perimeter of the bed which I use as a surface for bedside books and beverages. It makes me feel like I’m on a private island where no one can disturb my peace for hours on end—I’ve never slept better in my life.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow would you rate the sturdiness of this bed frame on a scale of 1–10 and why?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e10/10, no notes.

To identify which of these bed frames types best suits your lifestyle, think about both the aesthetic of your room and what you want out of a bed frame. If you want a frame with built in drawers to tuck things away, a storage bed is probably your move. If drawers aren’t an absolute necessity for you but you still want some space to put containers or boxes, get a platform bed. If you want a big statement headboard that makes a room feel cozy or more dramatic, an upholstered frame.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo headboard or not to headboard?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThat is the question.
