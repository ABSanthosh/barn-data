  "text": "SAKO Architects unveils assisted living facility in japanArchitecture firm SAKO Architects presents MONOLITH, an assisted living facility, accompanied with a pavilion, located in Fukuoka, Japan. Its exposed concrete exterior shows the ability of the building to withstand earthquakes and other disasters. Custom formwork creates a textured, striped grid on the facade, which helps hide dirt and reduce maintenance. The use of fly ash concrete further strengthens the structure, preventing cracking over time.Material choices inside complete the welcoming atmosphere, with wood used in handrails and handles, adding warmth often lacking in similar settings. The combination of texture and openings transforms the concrete forms of the main building and pavilion into inviting spaces that bring peace to residents and visitors alike. The interior palette of warm whites and browns contributes to a tranquil atmosphere, with wood finishes in the entrance hall echoing the striped pattern of the exterior, unifying the design. Principal architect at SAKO, Keiichiro Sako shares: ‘I believe I have successfully achieved my goal: creating an assisted living facility where I would feel comfortable entrusting my own parent.’all images by Tetsuya Yashiro, courtesy of SAKO ArchitectsMONOLITH ensures easy access with various means of transportWithin a six-minute walk from Kurume Station, the Chinese firm SAKO Architects ensures access from the facility to public transportation, medical services, and community connections. On the southern side of an L-shaped site, MONOLITH features a one-way traffic flow for easy vehicle access, with an eleven-by-six-meter canopy providing sheltered entry for residents and visitors. Open areas on the site offer ample parking and garden space that invites the surrounding community to interact with the landscape of the facility. The garden itself is an interactive landscape composed of 36 squares of varying sizes, from 1.6 to 4.6 meters on each side. Designed to engage the senses, these spaces incorporate decks, lawns, flower beds, benches, water features, and a cube-shaped pavilion where residents can experience the changing seasons. With carefully placed openings, the pavilion creates rhythmic shadows that animate the garden.SAKO Architects presents MONOLITH, an assisted living facility, accompanied with a pavilionopenings transform the concrete forms of the main building and pavilionwood finishes in the entrance hall echo the striped pattern of the facade",
