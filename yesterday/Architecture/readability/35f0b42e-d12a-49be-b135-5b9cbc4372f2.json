  "text": "Guided by the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi, homeowner and interior designer Divya Panwar transformed this 730-square-foot home into a serene retreat away from the city of Pune’s hustle. The warm, natural tones and earthen textures that envelope the home embrace an imperfect minimalism. “Minimalism and asymmetry were at the core while designing the apartment,” Panwar explains. The private spaces are tucked off the central space—arched openings run across the home, softening thresholds between main spaces.A small foyer leads to the central living area. The home is characterized by satin-finished beige walls, curved ceilings, and wooden flooring. Full-height windows flood the Pune home with natural light, offering picturesque views of parks and the open fields below. Furniture has also been limited to key pieces—a custom white cloud sofa and solid wood coffee table—acting as sculptural artworks. A window seat was built into the space, forming the perfect nook to curl up with a cup of coffee and book, watching the tops of coconut palms gently swaying in the wind. The visual connection between the living, dining, and kitchen spaces creates an increased illusion of space, while privacy and separated functions are maintained.“To open up the space, the studio took down a wall in the former L-shaped kitchen, freeing up the compact kitchen,” Panwar explains. Organic forms lend softness—through furniture, rounded ceilings, and arched elements. Spatially, the living and dining areas are interconnected to maximize the limited space. Sitting under a pendant light is a four-seater dining table. A narrow passage from the living area terminates at the primary and children’s bedrooms. Linen curtains, crisp bedding, well-crafted solid wood furniture, and a cloud bed add to the soft, soothing aesthetic of the home. Muted pinks, bright whites, and pale wood harmonize in the children’s bedroom.The primary bedroom is a soothing place in the already peaceful home. Panwar beautifully carries the principles of wabi-sabi and minimalism into this restrained interior. Playing with natural materials and organically shaped objects and furniture, they have crafted a pocket of quiet in one of the busiest cities in India.This 730-square-foot home was originally published in AD Middle East.",
