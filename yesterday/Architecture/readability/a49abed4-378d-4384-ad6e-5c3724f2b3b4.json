According to the study, 52% of hiring managers believed their recent hires fully comprehended the terms of their employment, while only 20% of employees felt the same. In a recent Harvard Business Review article, study authors Rachel Schlund (University of Chicago) and Vanessa Bohns (Cornell University) argue that their findings highlight a gap between legal consent and employees' true understanding of workplace policies. While the study did not specifically target the design profession, the issue is particularly relevant in architecture firms, where new hires often not only sign complex agreements, but are introduced to firm-specific approaches to software, file management, and design workflows. “Several psychological biases point to the mistakes we make when assessing others’ subjective experiences,” Schlund and Bohns write. “For one, we tend to gauge people’s internal states from their observable behaviors, even though the two are not always aligned. This means that when we observe someone’s behavioral agreement, as we do when we see them sign a document, we assume a corresponding psychological agreement.” The authors add that if managers understand and agree with the workplace policies of their office, they assume others do too, even if their employees' knowledge and experience are not as high. As a result, managers can overestimate how informed new hires are about workplace agreements and policies. Related on Archinect: Retaining architectural staff begins with effective onboarding. Image credit: Pete MolickIn an architectural setting, such policies might include non-compete clauses, intellectual property agreements, or provisions allowing the firm to use an employee’s designs for firm-wide promotional purposes. Contractual agreements are also likely to include stipulations on overtime and weekend work, and the extent to which they are compensated; issues often highlighted by labor union groups in architecture. Driven by enthusiasm and a desire to impress, many employees sign without comprehending the full ramifications. Over time, however, they may feel misled, which can erode trust and commitment to the firm. The authors subsequently found that employees who felt uninformed at the outset of their roles were more likely to “disengage, perceive their workplace as unfair, and develop strained relationships with supervisors,” and ultimately more likely to consider quitting their roles. According to the study, firms can mitigate the issue by ensuring policies are communicated in clear, accessible language and allowing time for discussion. Regular check-ins and an open-door policy for questions can also help employees feel more informed and valued. Furthermore, when certain terms may seem restrictive, firms should provide context and rationale, enabling employees to make truly informed decisions.
