  "text": "Mizzi Studio leads co-learning space design in baliGreen School Bali opens The Living Bridge, a co-learning space designed by Jonathan Mizzi of Mizzi Studio in collaboration with students, educators, and parents. The project is the result of two years’ work as part of the school’s Jalan Jalan program, which encourages students to take part in real-world, hands-on learning experiences. Together, they transformed the original Bridge, a community hub for parents, into a structure made from over 300 locally harvested bamboo poles, shaped using advanced heat-bending techniques developed with local craftspeople, Bamboo Pure.The Bridge’s design responds to the indoor-outdoor lifestyle of the school and includes sustainable materials such as terrazzo made from crushed glass, eco-crete bricks using industrial waste ash, lime plaster, and mycelium acoustic panels. The large curved roof shading the building is supported by eight bamboo arches and finished with pelupuh, traditional flattened bamboo shingles. It sits at the entrance of the campus, welcoming students and visitors into a shared space that will host talks, workshops, and parent-led programs.images by Mizzi Studio, unless stating otherwiseThe Living Bridge connects community and creativityThe project began in 2023 when Jonathan Mizzi, also a Green School parent, worked with teachers to guide students aged 15 to 18 through a full design process. From initial sketches and community pitches to workshops, model-making, and on-site construction, students were involved at every stage. ‘The Living Bridge Project shows how architecture can grow out of education,’ says Mizzi, director of the architectural practice Mizzi Studio. ‘What started as a request to mentor one student became a co-created journey where students led the way.’ For many, the experience was transformative. ‘We weren’t just students—we were designers, decision-makers, and changemakers,’ says Eden Rice, one of the student participants.Before its opening, The Living Bridge was featured at ChangeNOW 2025, a global event for climate solutions held in Paris. Alongside the physical structure, students also created a digital platform to help connect alumni, students, and parents for future collaboration and mentoring.Green School Bali opens The Living Bridge, a co-learning space designed by Jonathan Mizzi of Mizzi Studiothe large curved roof shading the building is supported by eight bamboo archeswelcoming students and visitors into a shared spacethe project is the result of two years’ work as part of the school’s Jalan Jalan program",
