The best Mexico City Airbnbs get you up close and personal with all of its earthly delights and exquisite interiors, plus help you skip the sprawling resorts and big-name hotels for homegrown charm.From a two-bedroom apartment inspired by traditional artists’ residences to an artfully renovated biblioteca, to a 1950s bungalow with a 40-foot-long pool, these Airbnb rentals are havens of Mexican culture and artistry. After all, few countries do transitional indoor-outdoor living spaces quite like Mexico does, which is why design enthusiasts, digital nomads, and jet-setters head below the border in droves whenever the need for sun and visual inspiration strikes. That, and carne asada tacos and spicy margaritas taste so much better on a terrace overlooking Bosque de Chapultepec than they do when Seamless-ed to your apartment. Here, some of the dreamiest Mexico City Airbnbs to book rapido before someone else gets the same idea.Courtesy of AirbnbDesigned by Atelier Zuniga López and architecture firm Jsa, this one-bedroom in one of the city’s most popular neighborhoods is a deep, healing breath manifested. Inside, the kitchen is stocked for simple meals—best for visitors looking to explore the city’s deep culinary scene. Take coffee on the plant-covered balcony, and retreat to the cove of a bedroom at the end of the day, where the rich color palette and soft textiles exude relaxing vibes. Another hidden perk? A free parking space for guests. Other amenities include an in-unit washer and dryer, a Bluetooth system, dedicated workspace, a coffeemaker, and building staff that can help you access the space 24/7. From $141 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbFor an upscale, no-holds-barred vacation, head to Mexico City’s Polanco neighborhood, where designer stores jostle for real estate space with world-class restaurants and attractions such as Pujol and the Museo Jumex. At this swanky two-bedroom in the heart of it all, light floods in from big windows surrounding the open living area, and the views get even better from the open terrace that overlooks the surrounding treetops. Technically a penthouse, there are three different floors to this loft with a bedroom on the first two. The top floor is packed with a family room, a half-kitchen, a laundry room, a full bathroom, and access to the terrace. It’s a great pick if you’re traveling with a small crew and want some privacy—or more than a few nooks to tuck yourself away when you need some solo time. From $582 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThe two-bedroom—managed by a Superhost—lives in a historic home that was built in 1910 but the vibe is 100% minimalist. Blonde wood informs the loft's muted interiors that are graced with Teka appliances and giant windows. Another perk that city dwellers will appreciate is the closet space. Other amenities include a a 24-hour doorman to let you in no matter what time of night or day you return, daily room cleaning so you never have to lift a finger on you stay, plus air conditioning to insulate yourself from the heat. Located in the Roma Norte neighborhood, there’s plenty of street art to be seen, historic architecture to tour (Casa Museo Guillermo Tovar de Teresa is a good place to start), and parks to stroll (Parque España). From $196 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbLocated in a former hotel, this one-bedroom apartment is a jewel-toned retreat from the noise of the city streets. And if proximity to historic sights and cultural institutions is high on your checklist, you’ll be delighted to hear that it’s just a stone’s throw away from the Palacio de Bellas Artes, Zócalo (Plaza de la Constitucion), and Museo Nacional De Arte (MUNAL). There are two beds—one is situated adjacent to the living space so this rental is best for a tight-knit group of buddies, a duo, solo travelers, or family. From $53 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbIf you’re renting a car and hope to juggle some city landmarks plus sights off the beaten path, book into this cabin an hour’s drive away from the city in Cañada De Alferes. The Brutalist vibes are strong here, from the concrete interiors to the sky-high ceilings. But there are plenty of soft moments to break it all up: a forest-green conversation pit forms the centerpiece of the living area, competing only with the wall-length window opening the view to the tree-lined backyard. Wood tones warm up the dining space, while an outdoor fire pit helps you transition the party into the late hours of the night as you recount the day’s adventures. From $213 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbIf you want to feel like you’re taking over a hotel with your closest friends, Casa Wynwood has your name written on it. It’s easy to get (blissfully) lost here: The common spaces feel never-ending and you’ll have a great time winding your way through the maze. Between the four bedrooms at your disposal, there’s plenty of space for a small group to rest up. Avid readers will also waste no time settling into the leather couch in the bookshelf-lined library to flip through novels. Antiques are tucked into corners and the art feels thoughtfully curated—much like walking into your most creative friend’s home. Furry felines and pooches are also allowed, if you want to save money on that pet hotel. Guests can even drop off their luggage before the official check-in time, and there’s a private patio for kicking your feet up when the weather is nice (and it usually is). From $1,567 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThe minimalist, two-bedroom Casa Teo revolves around an open concept floor plan that mimics artist residences. The host encourages his guests to participate in the active artistic and cultural programs so that they can contribute to Mexico’s unique cultural exchange. Plus, its soothing palette of pale woods, creamy whites, and heather grays certainly doesn’t get in the way of creativity. Best of all, the home is owned by uber-chef Enrique Olivera and formerly housed his iconic restaurant Pujol before it moved to a newer location, also in Polanco. Accordingly, expect to be well-fed on your stay, as the casa comes well-stocked with homemade breads, local fruits, spreads, and juices. From $395 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThough Casa Metl accomodates three bedrooms across three floors, its most impressive space is the shaded patio that sits just beyond a giant sliding glass door. Though the home is right smack dab in the middle of the charismatic Roma Sur neighborhood, the more low-key and easygoing counterpart to Roma Norte is a few minutes north. The patio is a tranquil haven that feels miles away from the traditional street food stalls, noisy cafes, and always-busy Mercado de Medellín just below it. That kind of quiet serenity is what the homeowners were going for when they designed their space, which is why they handpicked art by Mexican painters and decorated with a warm, gentle palette. Plus, they were heavily inspired by mezcaleria culture, which explains the abundance of organic materials throughout the home. From $317 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbCoyoacán is the place to be for any free-spirited creatives who want to explore Mexico City’s most bohemian quarter. Its cobblestone avenues and Colonial architecture lead the way to the municipality’s eccentric art galleries, artisan markets, and charming sidewalk cafes. This three-bedroom dwelling is right in the middle of it all. Plus, it’s only a few blocks away from La Casa Azul, Frida Kahlo’s museum. The famed self-portraitist isn’t the villa’s only connection to Mexican art: It’s named after painter and muralist José Clemente Orozco, who designed and built what would become his studio between 1921 and 1923. From $171 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThough a clean and neutral palette is on-trend these days, Casa Condesa makes a case for bringing bright color back into the mix. Constructed in the mid-1920s, the six-bedroom mansion celebrates traditional Mexican interiors with clever use of color, texture, and, of course, intricate tile patterns. The pièce de résistance, however, is the private garden, accessible through a set of double glass-paned doors. The courtyard-like space of this Mexico City Airbnb is complete with a vintage wooden table and two matching chairs whose colorful cushions practically beg guests to take a seat. From $414 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThis 19th-century three-bedroom cottage is a shining example of Colonial architecture that prioritizes indoor-outdoor design with two outdoor terraces, a sweeping backyard, and an outdoor living area equipped with a firepit. Enclosed within one tall concrete wall donning dark leafy ivy and micro-lights and four wooden ones, the garden is as much an oasis as any place—especially for indulging in a nightcap and scintillating conversation after sunset. From $225 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbStep back in time with this 1940’s Art Deco luxury apartment in the perfect location: the Santa Maria La Ribera neighborhood of Mexico City, just above the bustling historic center of town, Centro Histórico. Beautiful exposed brick lines the ceilings and the walls in the living room, while one of its walls is full of floor-to-ceiling windows that illuminate the dining and lounge areas. The elevated private terrace opens up into a courtyard with a fountain so you can sip on tea or coffee before starting your day in the city. The unit comes with one private bedroom with a queen-size bed as well as a full bright kitchen for taking meals during the day. From $78 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbSometimes all you need is a bit of color to feel right at home in a space. If you’re headed to Mexico City, consider staying in this two-bedroom Airbnb rental, which makes great use of accent walls and prints. Take the emerald green couch and blue and purple throw pillows as evidence, or the thoughtful bursts of pastels found in the kitchen backsplash, bedroom wallpapering, wall mirror, and outdoor space. The neighborhood itself is a great location for anyone seeking great dining and nightlife, shopping, and art gallery options. And when you return after a long day of trekking, don’t forget to soak your muscles in the unit’s bathtub that has room for two. From $94 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbThis one goes out to the bibliophiles. Nestled inside a 1940s mansion within the Roma Norte neighborhood is this private library that’s been thoughtfully renovated into a one-bedroom apartment. What it lacks in books now, it more than makes up for in trailing vines, restored wood floors, a plush king-size bed, stained glass details, and an abundance of windows. The biblioteca boasts a fully equipped kitchen and dining area for the days you want to make your own cuisine, plus an office space for anyone working from home. The midcentury-inspired furniture and decor are all sourced from Mexican designers, carpenters, and artisans. From $94 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbHere's a breathtaking contemporary Art Deco penthouse, designed by famed CDMX architectural firm Atelier Zúñiga López. You won't find much in the way of decor, which is intentional, as the design elements speak for themselves. Case in point: The vaulted ceilings littered with skylights, striking window frames and room dividers, a walnut walk-in closet, and the inviting outdoor dining room. Of course, there are also plenty of modern indulgences, like a smart TV for catching up on your Netflix shows, a washer and dryer, speedy Wi-Fi, and a bluetooth sound system. From $142 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbSleep (almost) among the trees in this slab concrete beauty, situated in quiet Roma Sur. Take a walk around the neighborhood to enjoy the Art Deco mansions, quirky galleries, street art, and hidden-away cafés before returning to this artfully designed loft. Each design element was sourced around Mexico by the host, from the woven textiles to the plant pots. The one-bedroom space has a full bathroom, roof garden, and comes equipped with a kitchenette that’s ideal for anyone who plans on eating their way through la ciuidad. From $139 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbStep inside the Terrace of Orchids, an eclectic open-layout condo, and you might consider canceling that return ticket. The comfortable apartment is littered with so many paneled frosted windows that they quickly become the focal point of the space. On the bottom floor are the living, dining, and kitchen areas, plus a private outdoor terrace. Each piece of furniture feels intentionally chosen for the space; it's not crowded with decor or pieces you'll find everywhere. The upstairs loft space is where you'll find the bedroom area and walk-in closets. This apartment is a hop, skip, and a jump away from Chapultepec Park, placed right in between the Condesa and Roma Norte neighborhoods. From $166 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbQuetzalcoatl’s Nest, an earthship-style home, is more than just one of Mexico City’s top-rated vacation rentals—it’s a design and sustainability masterpiece. Architect Javier Senosiain designed the small apartment complex so that the natural world is amplified through the living spaces. So no, this isn’t your typical Mexico City Airbnb, but it’s perfect for anyone who’s seeking a quiet oasis to reset. The apartment itself has all of the characteristics of a classic, futuristic earthship: rounded windows, organic shapes, and curved walls. Each fixture and floor is made with natural, upcycled materials, and blessedly, these homes are naturally cool even in the summer. The Nest is situated on acres of gardens filled with lush flora, ponds, and trees. As a guest, you'll also have the opportunity to receive a guided tour of the architect's neighborhood project, Parque Quetzalcoatl. From $452 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbDesigned using the principles of Porfirian architecture (a French-Mexican fusion), Casa de 1905 houses a number of beautiful, moody apartments right in the middle of Juarez, which is known for its numerous, exciting restaurants and coffee shops. The apartment itself has a large romantic balcony, spa-like bathroom (with a tub), a green terrace accessed via said bathroom, and an eat-in kitchenette that overlooks the street. It’s decorated with midcentury-modern furniture, all sourced from antique dealers across the city. From $82 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbBy stripping the paint from the 19-foot walls in this Porfirian masterpiece, the host uncovered a beautiful Impressionist texture, which he sealed with a glaze—and that's just the backdrop. The rest of this castle-like, two-bedroom apartment is a marvel too. Think: a spacious roof deck for greeting the day and soaking in the sunset, rich hardwood floors, intricately carved Mexican furniture, and huge French doors that lead out to Juliet balconies. Even better, your vacation rental is also close to the Bellas Artes and the Alameda so you can partake in some theater and people watching. From $84 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbHere’s a real charmer of a vacation rental right in La Condesa that combines the design styles of CDMX, New York City, and Amsterdam into one vibrant, Barragán-esque space for anyone in need of a visual reset. Sunshine combines with Barbie pink and lemon meringue walls to brighten up the space, while tasteful midcentury-modern furniture keeps it from leaning too hard into the Instagram aesthetic. The reading nook is ideal for a siesta after a long day of walking through the city, while the spacious dining room has everything you need for a festive dinner or a remote work day. From $225 per night.",

The famed self-portraitist isn’t the villa’s only connection to Mexican art: It’s named after painter and muralist José Clemente Orozco, who designed and built what would become his studio between 1921 and 1923. \u003cem\u003eFrom $171 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"RowWrapper\" data-page-value=\"6\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThough a clean and neutral palette is on-trend these days, Casa Condesa makes a case for bringing bright color back into the mix. Constructed in the mid-1920s, the six-bedroom mansion celebrates traditional Mexican interiors with clever use of color, texture, and, of course, intricate tile patterns. The pièce de résistance, however, is the private garden, accessible through a set of double glass-paned doors. The courtyard-like space of this Mexico City Airbnb is complete with a vintage wooden table and two matching chairs whose colorful cushions practically beg guests to take a seat. \u003cem\u003eFrom $414 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis 19th-century three-bedroom cottage is a shining example of Colonial architecture that prioritizes indoor-outdoor design with two outdoor terraces, a sweeping backyard, and an outdoor living area equipped with a firepit.

Beautiful exposed brick lines the ceilings and the walls in the living room, while one of its walls is full of floor-to-ceiling windows that illuminate the dining and lounge areas. The elevated private terrace opens up into a courtyard with a fountain so you can sip on tea or coffee before starting your day in the city. The unit comes with one private bedroom with a queen-size bed as well as a full bright kitchen for taking meals during the day. \u003cem\u003eFrom $78 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eSometimes all you need is a bit of color to feel right at home in a space. If you’re headed to Mexico City, consider staying in this two-bedroom Airbnb rental, which makes great use of accent walls and prints. Take the emerald green couch and blue and purple throw pillows as evidence, or the thoughtful bursts of pastels found in the kitchen backsplash, bedroom wallpapering, wall mirror, and outdoor space. The neighborhood itself is a great location for anyone seeking great dining and nightlife, shopping, and art gallery options. And when you return after a long day of trekking, don’t forget to soak your muscles in the unit’s bathtub that has room for two. \u003cem\u003eFrom $94 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"RowWrapper\" data-page-value=\"8\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis one goes out to the bibliophiles. Nestled inside a 1940s mansion within the Roma Norte neighborhood is this private library that’s been thoughtfully renovated into a one-bedroom apartment. What it lacks in books now, it more than makes up for in trailing vines, restored wood floors, a plush king-size bed, stained glass details, and an abundance of windows. The biblioteca boasts a fully equipped kitchen and dining area for the days you want to make your own cuisine, plus an office space for anyone working from home. The midcentury-inspired furniture and decor are all sourced from Mexican designers, carpenters, and artisans. \u003cem\u003eFrom $94 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eHere\u0026#39;s a breathtaking contemporary Art Deco penthouse, designed by famed CDMX architectural firm Atelier Zúñiga López. You won\u0026#39;t find much in the way of decor, which is intentional, as the design elements speak for themselves. Case in point: The vaulted ceilings littered with skylights, striking window frames and room dividers, a walnut walk-in closet, and the inviting outdoor dining room. Of course, there are also plenty of modern indulgences, like a smart TV for catching up on your Netflix shows, a washer and dryer, speedy Wi-Fi, and a bluetooth sound system. \u003cem\u003eFrom $142 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"RowWrapper\" data-page-value=\"9\"\u003e\u003cp\u003eSleep (almost) among the trees in this slab concrete beauty, situated in quiet Roma Sur.

Each piece of furniture feels intentionally chosen for the space; it\u0026#39;s not crowded with decor or pieces you\u0026#39;ll find everywhere. The upstairs loft space is where you\u0026#39;ll find the bedroom area and walk-in closets.

Architect Javier Senosiain designed the small apartment complex so that the natural world is amplified through the living spaces. So no, this isn’t your typical Mexico City Airbnb, but it’s perfect for anyone who’s seeking a quiet oasis to reset. The apartment itself has all of the characteristics of a classic, futuristic earthship: rounded windows, organic shapes, and curved walls. Each fixture and floor is made with natural, upcycled materials, and blessedly, these homes are naturally cool even in the summer. The Nest is situated on acres of gardens filled with lush flora, ponds, and trees. As a guest, you\u0026#39;ll also have the opportunity to receive a guided tour of the architect\u0026#39;s neighborhood project, Parque Quetzalcoatl. \u003cem\u003eFrom $452 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003eDesigned using the principles of Porfirian architecture (a French-Mexican fusion), Casa de 1905 houses a number of beautiful, moody apartments right in the middle of Juarez, which is known for its numerous, exciting restaurants and coffee shops.

Think: a spacious roof deck for greeting the day and soaking in the sunset, rich hardwood floors, intricately carved Mexican furniture, and huge French doors that lead out to Juliet balconies.
