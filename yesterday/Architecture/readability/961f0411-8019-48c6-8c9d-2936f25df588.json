  "text": "“The best color for the outside of a house depends on the style, location, and personal preference,” Lichtenstein echoes. Overall, she, like other designers we tapped, believes that neutral tones like soft grays, whites, and beige tend to be the safest bets. “These colors create a timeless look, enhance curb appeal, and are generally appealing to a broad range of potential buyers,” she says. “Neutrals also provide a great backdrop for bolder accent colors, allowing for flexibility in how you style the exterior with doors, shutters, or landscaping. Additionally, these shades reflect light, making homes look larger and more inviting.”Lindsell Andersen suggests “neutral colors that are appropriate to your particular region.” To that point, she believes warm beiges with brick or stone accents, soft charcoals, and greens are always a beautiful choice. From a practical perspective, Kantz notes that homeowners who live in warm climates year-round might consider going for lighter colors to avoid heat retention that could make the interior of a home warmer and result in higher cooling costs. In general, Kantz also recommends sticking to neutrals, such as whites, grays, and blacks when it comes to exteriors, and adding a touch of your own personality through trims, front doors, and outside decor.What exterior colors last the longest?Another case for applying whites or lighter neutral colors to your home’s exterior: “White paint colors have the longest longevity for exteriors,” says Kantz. “With its ability to coordinate with a variety of architectural styles from modern to traditional, white exteriors have an almost chameleon quality to them because they work with so many different exterior finishes and just about any color combination.” White exterior colors such as Pure White SW 7005, Alabaster SW 7008, or Snowbound SW 7004 are often preferred colors of many that live in the sunnier climates due to the constant sun exposure, she adds.Neutrals have staying powers too. “The lighter colors reflect light and tend to hold up better, whereas a darker color absorbs heat and will fade and age faster than a lighter one,” says Lindsell Andersen. “Darker colors show more pollen and dirt and have to be cleaned more frequently.” Talk with your contractor about any specific concerns various paint colors may present in your area and to get a sense of what hues may have the best durability.What exterior colors increase home value?A classic white or other neutral may be the safer bet when it comes to resale value. Jennifer Patchen, a broker at Opendoor, shares with AD that “neutral and warm tones” are preferred exterior shades right now for houses on the market. “As a general rule, the exterior color of the home should complement other homes in the neighborhood,” she says. “Otherwise, it might stick out like a sore thumb!” For those looking to sell, she suggests opting for a beige, tan, or camel color that will act as a neutral canvas that can create a positive first impression for buyers. And according to data from Opendoor, the preference for subdued shades extends to the front door as well, with 44% of homeowners valuing white, gray, gray-blue, and gray-green at an entrance.What exterior paint colors should you avoid?Again, that’s a matter of personal style preferences so there’s no hard and fast rule for house paint colors that are off the table.Still, paint experts like Kantz recommends keeping this important guideline in mind: “Since exterior painting projects often take up a lot more time, effort, and resources than an interior project, I would recommend homeowners avoid picking colors that they aren’t 100% sure they can see themselves enjoying for more than a few years,” says Kantz. “For this reason, I’d steer clear of colors that seem too trendy at the moment, such as bold or bright shades, and stick to those that have stood the test of time,” she elaborates. If someone feels strongly about adding a bright color to their exterior or one they’re less confident it, she suggests saving that for the front door, which can easily be swapped out over a shorter period.",
