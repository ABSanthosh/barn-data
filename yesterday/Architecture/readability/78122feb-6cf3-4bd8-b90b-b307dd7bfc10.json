  "text": "Linsey Dunn tried to find a silver lining for tariffs. Some like John Parman and Thayer-D agreed and appreciated the optimism. Yet edwardsinger’s \"main issue is that in the context of our current situation, there is no point in debating possible benefits of a tool that will never be used to those ends. Perhaps our time should be spent looking for achievable results rather than speculative fantasies.\" Linsey responded, \"Just to be clear, I’m not a fan of tariffs. My intention was only to provide a perspective that I felt wasn't being talked about…to add depth to the issue. I wrote this piece not as a defense of policy, but as a way to explore how we might still find opportunities to shift our industry in a more sustainable direction, even in the face of seemingly flawed political decisions.\" Archinect City Guide: Explore Boston with Eric Höweler of Höweler + YoonPlus a new series, Archinect City Guide, was launched and Archinect Meets (last seen in 2019) was reintroduced with @ninosbuildings. News Alexandra Lange won this year's Pulitzer Prize in the Criticism category, which, as Donna Sink noted, is \"So well deserved!!\" Zaha Hadid Architects shared photos of their completed Shenzhen Science \u0026 Technology Museum. sameolddoctor and Old_Crow were both on the same page, wondering \"where are the exhibition spaces in this gargantuan building. It looks and feels like a hollow sculpture.\" Photo by Virgile Simon BertrandThe National Gallery released a first glimpse inside Annabelle Selldorf's Sainsbury Wing renovation. reallynotmyname was first out of the gate: \"Slapping a sign on a Venturi building is kind of bonkers.\" It made haruki sad: \"Venturi and Scott Brown were the misfits who made it. Their work was brilliant, idiosyncratic, and deeply intelligent. They made architecture that reached the level of art.  The Selldorf product is always just so darn well behaved and bland and very much isn't art.\" Image: © The National Gallery, London. Photo: Edmund SumnerCoStar reported that plans for a new Louis Vuitton flagship in Beverly Hills, designed by Frank Gehry and Peter Marino, are moving forward, yet \"nobody's talking about the Richard Meier and Allen Greenberg buildings that will be demolished for this somewhat derivative Gehry design that is arguably over-scaled for the neighborhood.\" Pratt School of Architecture Class of 2025 M.Arch Genevieve Garlock and her research into fire mitigation strategies using the Sea Ranch as a case study generated lots of dialogue. OddArchitect felt something was missing: \"Respectfully, nothing about this design promotes wildfire protection or defense\". While ‘Nectors seemed to agree they were \"Beautiful models\" and the design was \"nice formally\", some also identified a failure to communicate \"how the building attempts to respond to it's thesis\". Photo by Taiyo WatanabeYunomi in Los Angeles, CA by Design Opera Architects and Grass House in Washington, DC by BLDUS are just two of the latest top images (in no particular order) from the Archinect Pinterest board Details. Photo by Ty ColeBlogs/Firms/Work Updates French architect Jean-Pierre HEIM’s new exhibition of architectural drawings, ‘Travelling is an Art’ at the Didier Aaron Gallery in New York, is on view until June 20, 2025. Looking for work? Do you have five to ten years of experience and are looking for something new? In Atlanta, Houser Walker Architecture is seeking to add an experienced Project Architect. As is Washington DC based StudioMB. Otherwise, in the Tampa/Sarasota area, Halflants + Pichette has two openings for Project Architects.Continuing his long-running series of artistic explorations, Span Partner and Design Director John Pobojewski’s latest piece “Pillage Purge Plunder” is a collection of 360 AI visualizations displayed as triptychs. Schools ICYMI Archinect back in March launched a survey, to gain further insights from M.Arch 2025 applicants and then shared 7 takeaways in May. Responding to some criticism Alvin Huang, AIA, NOMA defended the M.Arch \"I’ve seen a lot of people take both routes, and I think the real difference isn’t just time. It’s who the student is when they start…the name reflects the depth and intensity of a graduate-level education—not some claim to total mastery. If you want to compare the quality of the work - I would say our three year students are able to produce work that is as good as or better than students in the 5-year B.Arch.\" The University of Sharjah shared “Al Hayaal” a vision for \"a futuristic mixed-use underwater townscape located off the coast of Fujairah.\" by Shahad Ibrahim Mohammad, Manal Hamad Lootah, and Ghaya Bader Al MansooriMeanwhile, in hiring news, Stuckeman School’s architecture department is getting three new faculty members, UB School of Architecture and Planning named Emmanuel Frimpong Boamah as chair of the Department of Urban and Regional Planning, and at Cooper Union, Benjamin Aranda is the new Acting Dean of The Irwin S. Chanin School of Architecture. Looking for a new gig? Temple University's Planning and Capitol Projects Department is searching for a Project Architect Manager! Discussion/Threads Seth Bouman kicked off \"5 major interconnected renovation projects on 5 different buildings in a pretty local downtown core\" and has questions about using \"a single CMaR delivery method\". After learning more details folks thought it sounded a \"nightmare\", \"hella complicated\" and recommended staying on top of basics like \"weekly OAC meetings with the design team.\" graphemic added \"You should make sure your fee covers a very extremely large amount of coordination. You shouldn't expect the architects to coordinate with each other. I hope you have staff to do multiple rounds of QAQC between their sets.\" BluecornGroup was looking for insight into Architects Developing CD's for Modular Projects. bowling_ball offered some thoughts \"As it happens, I'm working with an established prefab company who's in the same boat - doesn't understand why he's losing bids. We're going to guide him on how to better approach larger (non-SFH) bids/projects, and in exchange he'll feed us work.\" JG agreed \"an integrated relationship is...valuable...possible with an alternate contract structure (IPD, CM, or other) but requires a different approach to getting work, value proposition, connections, marketing etc\". Non Sequitur kept it simple \"we never, ever, double ever, take on liability for the shop drawings. We verify conformance with design intent and review finishes but the responsibility remains between the GC and the trade producing the shops.\" Some referenced the \"weasel words\" of AIA B101. Lefranc wanted thoughts on an opportunity to be an AOR. Will Galloway had an aha moment after reading some initial responses \"does explain why there are also a few international practices setting up local offices in Toronto though. I had thought they were ambitious and optimistic, but sounds like there is an additional calculus at work.\" OddArchitect emphasized \"The AOR is responsible for everything and as such I've found it to be SD: 10% AOR, DD: 70% AOR, CD: 90% AOR, CA: 95% AOR. For more complex projects these number will change.\" CrazyHouseCat went further there is no \"rule of thumb\" for percentages as \"From the AOR side, fee tend to be effort driven (the amount of work required and risk associated)\". Finally, Archinect HQ dropped into Thread Central with details on the recent introduction of moderated (sometimes) comments after taz received their first \"comment moderation pop-up notification\". \"In moderated articles, all comments need to be approved, specifically for the purpose of keeping comments civil and thoughtful. It's not user-specific…This moderation feature will also be added to a discussion forum thread that goes off the rails.\" Additionally Back in March, Alfred Twu wrote about 5-over-1s vs the xiaoqu and how \"The cities of China and the United States look very different. The tall residential towers typical of Beijing or Chongqing have little in common with the squat mid-rise apartments preferred across the United States…US apartment urbanism is closer to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macau than Chinese apartments are. Rather than reflecting consumer preferences or a unique aesthetic heritage, the answer seems to mostly come down to zoning rules and building codes.\"",
