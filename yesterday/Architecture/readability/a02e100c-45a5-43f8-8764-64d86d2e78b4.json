From a young age, we’re told, “Never judge a book by its cover.” Solid advice when talking about the downstairs neighbor who notoriously never smiles, the local Dobermann everyone crosses the street to avoid, or that blackened banana that’s unexpectedly perfect when peeled. When it comes to architecture, however, not so much. In architecture, the outside is just as important as the inside. A well-designed exterior can be so much more than a pretty face; it is a key component in realizing how a building interacts with its environment. Curb appeal is one of a building’s key selling points, attracting attention and driving interest. But a well-designed exterior can do so much more than just boost property value; it can improve energy efficiency, transform underused spaces and even enhance occupant well-being. With that in mind, these twelve products, winners of this year’s A+Product Awards, are designed to elevate exteriors by reviving façades, illuminating lawns and increasing outdoor functionality. Whether through bold lighting designs, ingenious cladding systems or ingenious glazing solutions, each of these innovations demonstrates how considered choices can take an exterior from ok to outstanding. Enter A+Product Awards Obi By Expormim USA LLC Jury Winner, Outdoor Furniture, 2024 A+Product Awards Inspired by Japanese tradition, Obi’s elastic band detail brings a bold, graphic edge to its elegant design. This seemingly simple feature adds a layer of sophistication, echoing the “obi” sash that adorns traditional kimonos. With an aluminum frame and indoor-level comfort, Obi is a modern outdoor seating collection that perfectly balances simplicity with style, making it ideal for terraces or garden spaces. Outdoor Coral By David Trubridge Lighting Popular Choice Winner, Exterior Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Marking 20 years of design excellence, Outdoor Coral combines geometric beauty with eco-conscious materials. Inspired by nature’s intricate forms, its Panelex construction ensures both visual and environmental longevity. Whether installed as a statement piece or in clusters, Outdoor Coral is perfect for outdoor spaces, casting intricate shadows that add texture and mood to any setting. DesignRail Modern By Feeney Popular Choice Winner, Best of the Year, Residential Design, 2024 A+Product Awards This cable railing system is engineered specifically for unobstructed views and contemporary appeal, with hidden fasteners and a minimalist aesthetic. Its modular design allows for long spans, reducing the need for additional posts and, in turn, opening up vistas. Optional features like LED-ready rails and DrinkRail enhance both practicality and evening ambiance, making it an exceptional choice for patios, balconies and other outdoor living areas. COASTAL METAL SCULPTURE By BELT Metal Art+Design Studio Popular Choice Winner, Best of the Year, Architectural Design, 2024 A+Product Awards Combining Art Deco aesthetics with cutting-edge craftsmanship, Coastal Metal Sculpture uses stainless steel and dynamic LED lighting to animate facades and railings. Each piece is meticulously designed using both traditional and innovative techniques. Its bold lines and striking mirror finish bring a sculptural element to exterior spaces, elevating them into visual landmarks. Northport Lighting By Landscape Forms Jury Winner, Exterior Lighting, 2024 A+Product Awards Northport reinvents traditional acorn street lamps with a refined, minimalist approach. Its subtle negative-space design evokes nostalgia while remaining contemporary, offering versatility for parks, promenades, and historic streetscapes. Combined with adjustable LED technology, Northport Lighting balances heritage and innovation, creating exteriors that feel timeless yet firmly rooted in the present. CUPACLAD By CUPA PIZARRAS S.A. Popular Choice Winner, Building Envelopes, Cladding, \u0026 Roofing, 2024 A+Product Awards CUPACLAD’s natural slate façade offers a durability that will last for over a century, with no maintenance required. The carbon-neutral production process reflects CUPA’s commitment to sustainability, while its versatility allows architects to experiment with both traditional and modern compositions. Whether used for residential or commercial projects, CUPACLAD exemplifies the strength and beauty of natural materials. Redwood Timbers \u0026 Uppers By HUMBOLDT SAWMILL COMPANY Popular Choice Winner, Best of the Year,  Positive Impact, 2024 A+Product Awards Harvested sustainably in FSC-certified forests, Humboldt’s redwood timbers bring natural strength and warmth to outdoor structures. Ideal for everything from exposed beams to elegant cladding, its rich tones and inherent durability make it a highly versatile choice for all exteriors. Redwood’s natural resistance to decay and pests further underscores its enduring appeal for both architects and homeowners. VITAE By THE CUT Jury Winner, Cabinetry \u0026 Millwork, 2024 A+Product Awards Outdoor kitchens seldom reach the craftsmanship of a product like Vitae, where natural stone and timber meet modular precision. Designed to adapt seamlessly to indoor or outdoor spaces, the kitchen embodies versatility with striking materials that turn a functional cooking area into a truly unique design statement. Universal Series™ Window Wall By Cascadia Windows \u0026 Doors Popular Choice Winner, Glass \u0026 Glazing, 2024 A+Product Awards Combining expansive glazing with top-tier thermal performance, the Universal Series™ Window Wall creates striking façades that improve energy efficiency. Its fiberglass frame, customizable to project specifications, offers a perfect balance of form and function. Evo-Flex By Evo-Doors by Renlita Jury Winner, Best of the Year, Architectural Design, 2024 A+Product Awards Evo-Flex transforms exterior spaces with its gas strut window system, which is ideal for pass-through bar tops and outdoor kitchens. Its sleek, self-lifting aluminum frame is designed for immense durability and ease of use, creating seamless transitions between indoor and outdoor living areas. RE/8 Bio-circular Architectural Mesh By Kaynemaile Popular Choice Winner, Best of the Year, Sustainable Design, 2024 A+Product Awards Jury Winner, Building Envelopes, Cladding, \u0026 Roofing, 2024 A+Product Awards This 3D mesh offers an innovative approach to shading and façades, crafted from bio-based polymers that reduce carbon footprints by 80%. With its ability to provide solar reduction and airflow, RE/8 combines functionality with sustainability, making it an essential choice for environmentally conscious design. VetraSpan-L By Sentech Architectural Systems Jury Winner, Glass \u0026 Glazing, 2024 A+Product Awards VetraSpan-L delivers 50-foot spans of uninterrupted glass, creating exteriors with unparalleled transparency. Its advanced structural system eliminates vertical joints, providing a seamless connection to the surrounding landscape and elevating modern façade design to new heights. The Final Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, January 24. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today.",
