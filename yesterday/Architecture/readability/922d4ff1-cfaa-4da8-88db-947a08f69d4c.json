  "text": "Amy Schumer is leaving the Brooklyn life behind after three years. She is selling her Brooklyn Heights town house for $14 million, the Wall Street Journal reports.The historic dwelling was initially built in 1829. It was catapulted into the spotlight after its exteriors appeared in Moonstruck, a 1987 rom-com starring Cher and Nicholas Cage. The Kinda Pregnant star and her family snagged the famous home in 2022 for $12.25 million. They previously lived in a $13 million Upper West Side apartment, which they parted ways with in 2023.The Federal-style town house features five bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths. Its old-world charm—including the original 1800s exterior, high ceiling, crown moldings, vintage wood cabinets, and fireplace with grand marble mantels—remains largely intact. The kitchen is outfitted with Gaggenau appliances and a three-oven LaCanche range—which tracks given her husband Chris Fischer is a chef. Other amenities include a gym and a custom wine cellar in the basement, as well as a backyard that offers private parking. Schumer tapped landscape architect Michael Van Valkenburg to add more space to their then-brick patio and set up a swing and play structure for her five-year-old son, Gene. “We loved what we moved into,” she told the Wall Street Journal. “But we’ve definitely made it our own.”Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.ArrowSchumer and Fischer plan to move back to Manhattan to be closer to their son’s school, per the WSJ. “We’re too lazy to commute 45 minutes to take our son to school every day,” she said, adding that the abode’s spacious 5,600 square feet felt too roomy for their family of three. “This is a home that is just ready for more people.”",
