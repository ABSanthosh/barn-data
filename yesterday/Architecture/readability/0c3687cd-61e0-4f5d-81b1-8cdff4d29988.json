However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Travel is an opportunity to explore new places, experience new cultures, and create lifelong memories—which won’t be a stretch if your vacation destination is any of these unique Airbnbs where the accommodation is the destination. After all, why post up in a hotel room, however luxe, when you could spend your nights stargazing (off-grid) from a porch of a tiny house in the American Southwest or take in the Azores vistas via your very own lighthouse?For a truly unforgettable vacation, we scoured Airbnb to surface rentals where panoramic views, outdoor showers, saunas, and soaking tubs play supporting roles to the otherworldly design: ones hewn into rock and carved into hillsides, located in the remote tundra or desert, and others made by the hand of celebrated architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.So whether you think your next vacation calls for palatial or humbly remote, take a look at some of the world’s most architecturally—and geographically—unique Airbnbs. From 10th-century castles in the Catalonian countryside to handmade hillside homes in British Columbia, there’s something fit for every itinerary and imagination.Perks: Room-darkening shades, hot tub, on-site washer and dryer, Wi-Fi, air conditioningBuilt into the surrounding rock, this home is a true bunker but without the doom-and-gloom vibes of an apocalyptic movie. Guests staying in this hideaway are treated to views of the surrounding Mackenzie Basin via floor-to-ceiling windows running the entirety of the home that make the stay feel otherworldly. The whole three-bedroom, two-bath home is a thing of beauty, but the circular entryway into the third bedroom in particular is a highlight. The outdoor textures and tones are reflected (quite literally) in the interiors, as well, whose luxe Scandi style is expressed via a moody color palette, plush furniture, and a wood-burning stove. From $634 per night.Perks: Ski and snowshoe rental, mountain views, lake access, crib, resort access, outdoor dining areaWhen it comes to tiny homes, this one bedroom is a gem best suited for someone who isn’t afraid of a little adventure. Getting to this rental is an expedition. First, you’ll drive to Langeland Ski Resort from the town of Førde, (where you’ll want to stock up on groceries), and then you and the host will hike 45 minutes to get to the aptly named Birdbox. Natural light floods in from the key-shaped portal, and the lounge space is situated right in front of a stunning view of the surrounding fjord. It’s ideal for those who love hiking, skiing, swimming, or snowshoeing. If you’re up for some cardio, this might be the coolest home you’ll ever sleep in. From $270 per night.Perks: Pet-friendly, lake access, indoor fireplace, games, kayaksHistory lovers will delight in this quintessentially Icelandic turf home made in the style of traditional architecture that’s rare in other places of the world. The one-bedroom earthen home is basic in the best way since it functions as a museum between noon and 5 p.m., so don’t expect a spa or modern amenities like, uh, electricity with this one (it’s really, really off-grid). Still, consider it an opportunity to live as people did generations ago. The beds are located in a lofted space over the kitchen, and rooms are lit by candles, with a wooden stove to keep you cozy when temperatures drop. Guests can also book breakfast and dinner with a two-day notice.Perks: Pool, midcentury furniture, dedicated workspace, Smart TVs, on-site washer and dryerThe Norman Lykes House is one of 14 circular homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. Intended to blend with the curves of the surrounding mountain, the exterior is a system of overlapping circles. Inside, the floorplan flows circuitously, creating an open plan filled with natural light. The walls are clad in mahogany, and the common spaces filled with the architect’s iconic woodwork and shelving. The full kitchen is also circular, an unexpected break from the usual rectangles in everyday kitchens. Pay special attention to the way the architectural details guide you through the rooms—ceiling lines delineate spaces for lounging and function, and the narrow, sliced windows in the bedroom and living spaces frame painting-like views of the landscape. The crescent-shaped pool is the real cherry on top for taking dips in the desert heat. Should you need a change of scenery, Palm Canyon is a short drive away. From $2,495 per night.Perks: Terrace, luggage drop-off, Smart TV, backyard, air conditioningThis one-bedroom rental really doesn’t look like much from the outside. At first glance, it’s simply a door jutting out of what seems to be a wood-plank deck—and that’s not entirely incorrect. But that deck is also a roof, topping a fairy tale-like space for design enthusiasts. Once you enter the main door, a spiral staircase leads guests to the main floor, which is flanked with a massive window overlooking the meadows. A Murphy bed pulls down from a bookcase, making the most of the home’s small footprint. This weekend getaway spot is great for couples who love unique stays and want to start the day with a hike and end it with a glass of wine on the private terrace. The surrounding area is great for biking, hiking, and anyone else who needs a dose of medicine in the form of expansive countryside. The local arboretum is a 2-minute walk away, and the cities of Brussels, Leuven, and Wavre are a 20-minute drive when you crave a restaurant dinner. From $163 per night.Perks: Patio, on-site washer and dryer, sound system, crib, Wi-FiQuetzalcoatl’s Nest isn’t the hideout of the eponymous Aztec god, but a jaw-dropping complex of apartments in a private park 15 miles outside Mexico City. Inspired equally by Antoni Gaudí and Frank Lloyd Wright, this bejeweled behemoth is the work of Javier Senosiain, a famed Mexican architect whose awe-inspiring architecture finds mankind yielding to nature. That’s just as true for its interiors, where organic shapes replace hard angles evident in the soft contours of chairs and couches, as well as the windows looking out on Senosiain’s serpentine structure and other natural wonders of this 1.2-acre park. From $406 per night.Perks: EV charger, sound system, patio, BBQ grill, gymSituated between Brazil’s economic epicenter of São Paulo and its cultural capital of Rio de Janeiro, Paraty’s proximity to the Atlantic Forest means trading commotion for calm. This iF Design Award–winning listing leans into the lushness of the surrounding fauna, thanks to extensive wood paneling and floor-to-ceiling living room windows, which make guests feel like they’re staying inside a greenhouse. Easy access to a private waterfall and natural swimming pool further serve to make Paraty feel like paradise. From $142 per night.Perks: Indoor fireplace, bathtub, dishwasher, patioFor Provençal history and charm, it’s hard to beat this faithfully restored 12th-century apartment situated in the walled village of Saint Paul de Vence. Its design offers a mix of Old World idiosyncrasy and modern luxury, best exemplified by the tunneled entrance leading to its vaulted-ceiling bathroom. As if the architecture alone is not enough to book this listing, its status as the former home of French poet and screenwriter Jacques Prévert adds an aura of literary mystique. Though Nice and other Côte d’Azur hotspots aren’t far away, there’s nothing better than soaking up summer rays on the jasmine-lined terrace to, perhaps, indulge in a bit of poetic inspiration. From $499 per night.Perks: Pet-friendly, patio, washer, BBQ grill, outdoor dining space, private backyardIf a 12th-century French apartment feels too cramped and modern, how about a 10th-century castle just across the border in Catalan? Located in the idyllic region of Ripollès, the ramparts of castle Llaés look out upon both the Pyrenees and bucolic hillsides where goats graze. With reviews lauding this fortified Romanesque structure’s sense of living history and eight bedrooms, it has the makings of a getaway fit for royalty—or a small wedding party. From $664 per night.Perks: Outdoor shower, Wi-Fi, BBQ grill, desert views, self check-inThough not found in a galaxy far, far away, this adobe dome may be a Star Wars fan’s new dream destination. Located near Big Bend National Park, the earthen structure is remote and subsequently lacks light pollution, which makes it a haven for stargazers. Though the place relies on solar power and lacks indoor plumbing, these minor inconveniences are a small price to pay for the chance to commune with the cosmos. From $128 per night.Perks: Breakfast included, patio, hammock, free parking, forest viewsIf accommodations located on solid ground simply won’t do, scamper up to this French treehouse located about an hour’s drive west of Basel, Switzerland. A cozy spot perfect for curling up with a good book, this treehouse features a living room and a terrace with an inviting hammock. Just across a suspension bridge is the rest of this skyward suite, with a bedroom in an acorn-like structure. Whether you’re after a meditative retreat among the birds or an intimate getaway, there’s nowhere to go but up. From $244 per night.Perks: Pool, backyard, air conditioning, ocean views, room-darkening shadesFans of seaside splendor will fall in love with this 19th-century windmill on the western coast of São Miguel, the biggest island in Portugal’s beautiful Azores. Behind the white façade, the interiors are fit for a Wes Anderson film. There’s a surprising amount of space for a kitchenette and well-appointed living room. A spiral staircase leads up to a king-size bedroom, featuring sweeping, endless views of the Atlantic Ocean. The grounds also feature an expansive garden full of fruit trees and flowers, plus additional housing for up to seven more guests. There’s no better base for exploring everything on this Hawaii of the Atlantic archipelago. From $206 per night.Perks: Outdoor shower, jacuzzi, patio, Egyptian cotton linens, indoor fireplaceIn the wilds of South Africa’s Western Cape, this 272-acre property at the foothills of the Langeberg mountain range is a chance to escape and unplug without leaving luxury behind. The open-floor plan cottage lets you sleep, sit, and even soak (in a wood-fired hot tub, no less) against the backdrop of sweeping vistas and starry skies. Reviewers praise its beautiful design and peaceful setting, making it one of the best options for an eco lodge on the African continent. From $160 per night.Perks: Patio, air conditioning, dishwasher, outdoor shower, BBQ grillThese days, Austin’s newest residential high-rises are probably making the Texan capital less weird, but this mind-bending bungalow is a throwback fighting the good fight. Described in its listing as “a giant seashell unicorn,” the Bloomhouse is the brainchild of two University of Texas architecture students who were hell-bent on breaking free from the oppressive requirement for corners and straight lines. Prepare to “leave behind the confines of modernity and the rules of logic, to live only in whimsy” as you take in the meringue-like fireplace and the surrealistic white staircase with sinuous wood accents. So if you come back from a night out on Sixth Street and your Airbnb looks a little wavy, it’s not just your imagination. From $478 per night.Perks: Pool, sauna, indoor fireplace, luggage drop-off, backyardWith so much history and color around every corner in Marrakesh, why stay somewhere boring? This Riad is an oasis from the Moroccan city’s heat and hustle, offering a chance to step into a swimming pool and the region’s aesthetic history. The grand columns, arches, and intricate tilework in the courtyard bestow a palatial impression, while little flourishes of local style lurk in every bedroom—there are seven. You’d hardly need to walk out the front door to get a feel for Moroccan design, but proximity to Jemaa el-Fnaa, the Medina, and many a souk means you’ll have easy access to all sorts of artisanal souvenirs. From $569 per night.Perks: Breakfast included, indoor fireplace, backyard, desert viewsFound on Navajo land in Arizona, Shash Dine’ draws visitors thanks to its stargazing opportunities, as well as its reverent efforts to keep indigenous culture and tradition alive. The most compelling residence at this self-described “glamping hotel” has to be The Kyo͞ob, which balances impeccable design with easy access to ranch ruggedness. Here, you can start your day by watching a desert sunrise from the backseat of a convertible (should you book a tour), and end it by sipping Navajo tea made from roasted greenthread as you gaze up at a million stars overhead. From $293 per night.Perks: Indoor fireplace, luggage drop-off, backyard, Wi-Fi, fire pitBritish Columbia’s Mayne Island may not be Middle Earth, but you might think otherwise after a few nights in Cob Cottage. Though, thankfully, not hobbit-sized, this home is hand-sculpted from local, sustainable materials, making it a truly one-of-a-kind property. The interior features unexpected flourishes that’ll make you feel like you’re living in a fantasy novel, and you’ll find plenty of nooks perfect for reading one. Add in a wilderness setting to explore, and it’s no wonder why words like “magical” frequently pop up in reviews. From $153 per night.Photo: Lauren ArzbaecherCraving an escape?

Behind the white façade, the interiors are fit for a Wes Anderson film. There’s a surprising amount of space for a kitchenette and well-appointed living room. A spiral staircase leads up to a king-size bedroom, featuring sweeping, endless views of the Atlantic Ocean. The grounds also feature an expansive garden full of fruit trees and flowers, plus additional housing for up to seven more guests. There’s no better base for exploring everything on this Hawaii of the Atlantic archipelago. \u003cem\u003eFrom $206 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks:\u003c/strong\u003e Outdoor shower, jacuzzi, patio, Egyptian cotton linens, indoor fireplace\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn the wilds of South Africa’s Western Cape, this 272-acre property at the foothills of the Langeberg mountain range is a chance to escape and unplug without leaving luxury behind. The open-floor plan cottage lets you sleep, sit, and even soak (in a wood-fired hot tub, no less) against the backdrop of sweeping vistas and starry skies.

Described in its listing as “a giant seashell unicorn,” the Bloomhouse is the brainchild of two University of Texas architecture students who were hell-bent on breaking free from the oppressive requirement for corners and straight lines. Prepare to “leave behind the confines of modernity and the rules of logic, to live only in whimsy” as you take in the meringue-like fireplace and the surrealistic white staircase with sinuous wood accents. So if you come back from a night out on Sixth Street and your Airbnb looks a little wavy, it’s not just your imagination. \u003cem\u003eFrom $478 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks:\u003c/strong\u003e Pool, sauna, indoor fireplace, luggage drop-off, backyard\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWith so much history and color around every corner in Marrakesh, why stay somewhere boring? This Riad is an oasis from the Moroccan city’s heat and hustle, offering a chance to step into a swimming pool and the region’s aesthetic history. The grand columns, arches, and intricate tilework in the courtyard bestow a palatial impression, while little flourishes of local style lurk in every bedroom—there are seven. You’d hardly need to walk out the front door to get a feel for Moroccan design, but proximity to Jemaa el-Fnaa, the Medina, and many a souk means you’ll have easy access to all sorts of artisanal souvenirs. \u003cem\u003eFrom $569 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks:\u003c/strong\u003e Breakfast included, indoor fireplace, backyard, desert views\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFound on Navajo land in Arizona, Shash Dine’ draws visitors thanks to its stargazing opportunities, as well as its reverent efforts to keep indigenous culture and tradition alive. The most compelling residence at this self-described “glamping hotel” has to be The Kyo͞ob, which balances impeccable design with easy access to ranch ruggedness. Here, you can start your day by watching a desert sunrise from the backseat of a convertible (should you book a tour), and end it by sipping Navajo tea made from roasted greenthread as you gaze up at a million stars overhead. \u003cem\u003eFrom $293 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks:\u003c/strong\u003e Indoor fireplace, luggage drop-off, backyard, Wi-Fi, fire pit\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eBritish Columbia’s Mayne Island may not be Middle Earth, but you might think otherwise after a few nights in Cob Cottage. Though, thankfully, not hobbit-sized, this home is hand-sculpted from local, sustainable materials, making it a truly one-of-a-kind property. The interior features unexpected flourishes that’ll make you feel like you’re living in a fantasy novel, and you’ll find plenty of nooks perfect for reading one. Add in a wilderness setting to explore, and it’s no wonder why words like “magical” frequently pop up in reviews. \u003cem\u003eFrom $153 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli id=\"65d24c4d3a55d4892d6e1669\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-in-view=\"{\u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;variation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide.ItemLeftCaptionAboveMultipleButtons\u0026#34;}\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;variation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide.ItemLeftCaptionAboveMultipleButtons\u0026#34;}\" orientation=\"landscape\" data-item=\"{\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;65d24c4d3a55d4892d6e1669\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:0,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;externallink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;offers\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;gallery_slide_component\u0026#34;}\" data-testid=\"GallerySlideWrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhoto: Lauren Arzbaecher\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"GallerySlideCaptionDekContainer\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCraving an escape?
