  "text": "Serge Schoemaker Architects breathes new life into Utrecht villa Serge Schoemaker Architects undertook a three-year transformation of a detached country villa in Tienhoven, a Dutch village near Utrecht, preserving its original rural character. The renovation included the main house and its outbuildings, with updates such as replacing outdated dormer windows, renewing the thatched roofs, and applying a warm grey lime plaster to the yellow brick facades, giving the property a fresh look. Additionally, a two-story extension connects the main house to a guesthouse, while a single-story addition expands the living area. A boathouse was also added, and a hay barn was repurposed as a workspace.all images by Max Hart Nibbrig, courtesy of Serge Schoemaker Architects | header image by Jaro van Meertenthe renovation connects the residence with its polder landscapeThe interventions by Serge Schoemaker Architects’ Amsterdam-based team were aimed at improving the functionality of the Tienhoven Country Villa and its relationship with the surroundings. Large facade openings were introduced to connect the indoor spaces with views of the surrounding polder landscape, while a new open floor plan replaced the previously closed layout. Inside, modern design elements were employed, such as a double-height entrance and a prominent white spiral staircase leading to the upper-floor bedrooms. These updates, characterized by anthracite tones, breathe a contemporary aesthetic into the villa’s traditional rural architecture.large facade openings connect the indoor spaces with the surrounding polder landscape |  image by Jaro van MeertenSerge Schoemaker Architects undertook a three-year transformation of a detached country villa in Tienhoventhe renovation included the main house and its outbuildingsreplacing outdated dormer windows and renewing the thatched roofs give the property a fresh looka two-story extension connects the main house to a guesthouse",
