  "text": "ROOVICE revives wooden two-story house as pet-friendly spaceJapanese architectural studio ROOVICE breathes new life into a 1970s wooden two-story home in Fueda, Kamakura, transforming it into a modern, pet-friendly space for a young couple. The renovation emphasizes comfort, and aesthetics, accommodating both human and pet lifestyles. The redesign blends practicality with smart design choices, retaining the home’s character while prioritizing functionality. The house features walls finished with a mix of textures—spray-textured coatings that mimic exterior walls paired with sections left in their original state. This subtle ‘mismatched’ approach preserves the home’s charm while avoiding over-standardization.The previously compact kitchen was expanded into an L-shaped layout, enhancing functionality for daily use. A durable hard-plaster countertop was chosen for its practicality and timeless appeal. For the living-dining-kitchen (LDK) area, PVC long sheet flooring ensures easy maintenance—an essential feature for pet owners.all images by Akira NakamuraFueda House boasts vertical play walls and hiding spots for catsThe renovation emphasizes openness, with a standout double-height lightwell in the living room flooding the space with daylight through narrow windows. Walls on the first floor were removed to connect the living room, kitchen, and former tatami room, creating spatial fluidity.
