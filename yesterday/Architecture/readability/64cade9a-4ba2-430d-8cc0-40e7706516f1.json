However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.The kitchen and bath often serve as the culmination points to clients’ big requests—from integrating wellness design to whole-home tech. Thus the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show (KBIS), a trade show that covers these themes and so much more, is a core event in many kitchen and bath designers’ annual agendas.Presented by the National Kitchen and Bath Association (NKBA), KBIS is the point of discovery for new products and features for the hubs of the home, including home appliances, plumbing fixtures, countertops, and more. Because let’s face it: Talking one-on-one with the team of designers and engineers behind modern appliances is much more interesting than deciphering their instruction manuals. Learn everything you need to know about the annual show below.What, when, and whereAn anchor event of Design \u0026 Construction Week, KBIS coincides with the International Builders’ Show (IBS), presented by the National Association of Home Builders. The combined annual shows draw more than 90,000 professionals to the Las Vegas Convention Center, including kitchen and bath designers, architects, custom builders and remodelers, and trade dealers.Hundreds of kitchen, bath, and home building exhibitors will be in attendance for this year’s event, held from February 25–27. It’s the place to scope out the latest product debuts and technological enhancements within such categories as home appliances, cabinetry, countertops, flooring, plumbing fixtures, ventilation, and more from some of the industry’s biggest players. Care for a namedrop? Cosentino, Brizo, Kohler, Dacor, Fisher \u0026 Paykel, and House of Rohl are among the industry manufacturers you know and love that will be in attendance.KBIS draws nearly 90,000 professionals each year. Photography courtesy KBISWhat to know about the fairTicketed registration to KBIS is required. The event offers reduced pricing to those who buy ahead of time, though passes can be purchased on site. Registration for the event will also grant you access to the show floors of IBS, as well as the co-dated National Hardware Show (NHS), Las Vegas Winter Market, and the International Surface Event (TISE).The Las Vegas Convention Center is located about a 10-minute drive northeast of the Las Vegas Strip. Taxis and ride-sharing apps (such as Uber or Lyft) are commonly used for transportation at the show, although—and we speak from experience here—traffic during each day’s closing can get sluggishly backed up. We recommend calling your ride ahead of rush hour or preparing for long wait times. The trade show has also worked with its partner hotel network to organize a shuttle service, which will run 6:30 a.m to 6:00 p.m. every day of the show. Public transportation is available via the Las Vegas Monorail, which is about a 15-minute commute from downtown Las Vegas. Attendees can also access the newly unveiled Vegas Loop at Las Vegas Convention Center, which quickly and efficiently connects the new West Hall with the North, Central, and South Halls.First-time show attendees may also find the KBIS mobile app to be beneficial: It allows users to access show maps and search and bookmark exhibitors, educational talks, and keynote events. It also features KBIS Match, a connection tool to communicate with exhibitors, network with other industry professionals, and schedule meetings on the show floor. To download, search “KBIS 2025” in the Apple or Android store, or scan this code.Where to eat, drink, and stayWhen looking for a city’s coolest digs, we often turn to the travel experts at Condé Nast Traveler, which recently honored the NoMad Las Vegas with a spot on its Gold List. The title’s Reader’s Choice honorees also name Nobu Hotel Caesars Palace, Bellagio, and the Venetian Resort at the top of Las Vegas’s hospitality scene. For trade show attendees and exhibitors, KBIS negotiates hotel blocks to make accommodations a bit more wallet-friendly.

And for those wanting to venture off of the main drag, Esther’s Kitchen, chef James Trees’ intimate Italian spot in the Las Vegas Arts District, and Herbs \u0026 Rye, a speakeasy, vibin’ steakhouse with a renowned cocktail list by award-winning mixologist Nectaly Mendoza, are good places to start.Where to spot AD editorsOn Tuesday, AD PRO associate director Lila Allen will be toasting to the Brizo 2025 releases at an exclusive happy hour event. A celebration of craftsmanship and design, the one-hour féte will offer a lens into the highly refined future of the kitchen and bath (N1139).Design happenings not to missFair first-timersMore than 100 exhibitors—some fresh-faced brands, others market mainstays—will be making their first appearance at KBIS this year. Among the splashiest arrivals? Artisanal surfaces maker Antique Mirror (Booth SL9164), British hardware label Hendel \u0026 Hendel (N2476), and Brazilian luxury cabinetry maker Idélli (SL3075) are on the top of our visit list for new discoveries. Minimalism devotees will want to star newcomers Simplehuman (SL4159) and Tutti (SL8115), both specialists of function-forward accessories and storage solutions. Other notables include wood-heating appliance designer La Nordica (W1184) and Ceramics of Italy, which will bring some 15 brands and their surfaces—from tiles to large slabs—into its own pavilion in the North Hall.Neolith taps Vanessa DeLeon for a special Edit at the fair.

Neolith will introduce a quartet of sustainable stone products made without resins, plastics, or crystalline silica, while its brand ambassador, Vanessa DeLeon, will unveil her Vanessa DeLeon Edit of products (N3427). Meanwhile, Artistic Tile will reimagine the regal patterns and fabrics of legendary label Donghia into a new line of tile (N1673). And Kohler has partnered with Remedy Place social wellness clubs for an ergonomic ice bath sized for the home (N1105).The Holographic electric fireplace by Ortal. Next-level techEach year, KBIS promises a few you’ve-got-to-see-it-to-believe-it moments that offer a lens into the kitchen and bath of the future. Among the frontrunners? Laufen is radically rethinking the shower—its Cleanet collection of shower toilets offers hygienic self-care and aesthetic appeal, plus self-clean after each use—and the lou, with a new gravity-flushing toilet created in collaboration with EOOS (N317). Kohler will show off its Anthem+ smart showering system, including water, steam, light, and sound controls in a single digital interface (N1105). And luxury gas fireplace and flame technologist Ortal comes into the electric fireplace market hot with Holographic, comprising energy-efficient, dual OLED-screen projections of lifelike 3D flames (IBS, W3801).Kast Concrete Basins, a Kohler portfolio brand, reemphasizes traditional techniques with the Orme pedestal basin, which will be introduced at the fair (N1105). The sculptural furnishing is handcrafted in Nottinghamshire with Derbyshire limestone aggregates in more than two dozen hues. And beloved Italian brand Smeg is swinging big, introducing more than 50 new products, including a dishwasher lineup and a built-in electric barbecue grill that’s become a Best of KBIS Awards finalist (W2122).Kast Concrete Basins will unveil the Orme pedestal basin at KBIS 2025.

It will commence at 4 p.m. at the NEXtStage, South Hall, followed by the Best of KBIS Happy Hour. Or feed your brain at one of the fair’s extensive list of talks. On Tuesday, NKBA introduces its 2025 class of 30 Under 30 designers on the NEXTStage, along with panel discussions on the fair’s legacy, sustainability and nutrition in the kitchen, and new European environmental efforts. Wednesday brings a pair of discussions around reducing waste in design, as well as how to get projects published. And Thursday wraps things up with the Booth Awards ceremony and a forecast of the trends on the horizon for next year’s KBIS.",

Kohler will show off its Anthem+ smart showering system, including water, steam, light, and sound controls in a single digital interface (N1105).
