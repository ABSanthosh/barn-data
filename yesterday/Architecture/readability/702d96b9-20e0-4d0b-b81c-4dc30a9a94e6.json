  "text": "anchor This post is brought to you by LAGI 2025 Fiji The Land Art Generator Initiative (LAGI) 2025 competition officially launches today, inviting architects, designers, and innovators worldwide to contribute to a groundbreaking vision for Marou Village, Fiji. This is your chance to design a permanent destination artwork that not only captivates but also transforms—a creative installation that generates clean energy, provides drinking water, supports local tourism, and fosters a sustainable future for this coastal village. A Unique Opportunity to Make an Impact The competition challenges participants to integrate regenerative energy and water systems in a way that harmonizes with Fiji’s breathtaking landscapes and cultural heritage. Submissions are due by May 5, 2025, and participation is free and open to all. Two winning teams will each receive a $100,000 USD stipend to refine their designs and develop functioning prototypes in Fiji. Winning concepts will also be celebrated in an international publication, exhibitions, and community engagement events in partnership with the Fiji Arts Council, inspiring audiences around the globe to imagine a world beyond carbon. Why Fiji? Fiji, like many island nations, faces the dual pressures of climate change and economic reliance on imported fossil fuels. The LAGI 2025 competition offers a platform to reimagine renewable energy and water systems that respect the unique challenges and opportunities of the region, such as limited land availability and the growing volatility of rainfall patterns. The project site, Marou Village on Naviti Island, is home to 67 households whose needs include reliable electricity and freshwater access. This competition asks designers to innovate practical, scalable solutions that integrate seamlessly into the community's natural and cultural environment. Resources to Support Your Vision Participants will have access to a robust set of supplementary materials, including the newly released Field Guide to Regenerative Water Technologies, developed in collaboration with project partners like the University of Fiji and Arizona State University. Click here for competition resources. Meet the Jurors The jury includes leaders in architecture, energy, climate activism, and local community representatives. Together, they will evaluate submissions for their creativity, feasibility, and alignment with Fiji’s national development goals. View the jurors here.
