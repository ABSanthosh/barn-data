From built-in walkways to custom furniture, these four homes show how thoughtful design can create spaces where cats thrive and aesthetics remain intact. Whether it’s climbing, hiding, or simply observing from above, each project offers creative solutions for living stylishly with feline companions. 1. This Glass And Wood Suspended Cat Enclosure Was Custom Designed Just For The Family’s Cats Interior design firm INDOT created a custom built-in cat enclosure for a couple and their four adopted cats. Suspended off the ground and framed in glass with warm wood slats, the enclosure is supported by slim iron pipes and positioned to give the cats a view of the window and balcony beyond. A small glass pod juts out from one end, offering a cozy perch with panoramic views. The thoughtful design gives the cats a private retreat, especially useful when the household puppy gets a little too playful. Photography by Hey!Cheese Photography 2. An Apartment Designed With Cats In Mind AODA Interior Design Co. completed an apartment in Taiwan for a couple with four cats and two medium-to-large dogs. Their goal was to create a peaceful, pet-friendly space with clear separation between species. Vertical elements like cat trees, walkways, and platforms let the cats climb and explore. A custom wall unit frames the TV and includes built-in shelves and bubble windows for the cats to perch and observe. Durable, pet-safe materials were used throughout, including scratch-resistant floors and non-toxic, washable finishes. Natural wood and stone add warmth, while privacy screens, hidden cutouts, and a concealed litter box give the cats quiet places to retreat. Photography by Studio YHLAA 3. The Custom Shelving In This Home Keeps The Cat Happy Taiwanese firm Thinking Design created a custom cat-friendly feature for a client’s home by integrating a ‘catwalk’ into the bookshelf. The seamless design doubles as storage while giving the cat elevated pathways throughout the living space. A wooden scratching post in the corner acts as a cat tree and climbing aid, connecting to shelves set at varied heights for exploration and high-up views. The design also includes a discreet litter box tucked into the sideboard and desk area. Photography by Hey ! Cheese|Luo Ren Yi 4. A Built-In Bookcase Designed For Cats Lines An Entire Wall In This Home While renovating a Brooklyn row house, BFDO Architects designed an interior that celebrates their clients’ love of books and cats. A custom bookcase runs from the front living room to the back dining area, serving both as storage and a climbing route for the cats. Some shelves extend outward to form steps, leading to an open ledge where the cats can watch from above. Hidden trap doors at each end give them access to the upstairs rooms, blending playful design with practical function. Photography by Francis Dzikowski These homes prove that good design doesn’t have to come at the expense of your pets’ comfort. By blending architecture with animal behavior, the designers behind each project have created spaces where cats can explore freely without disrupting the flow or look of the home. It’s a reminder that designing with pets in mind isn’t a compromise, it’s an opportunity for creativity.",
