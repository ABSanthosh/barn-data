The design balances communal living with individual privacy through a carefully planned spatial arrangement and volumetric composition.The project’s emphasis on internal circulation drove the design process, adopting a sculptural tectonic approach reflected in the volumetric massing of the final structure. The resulting curvilinear formal language imparts a sense of dynamism and motion to the living spaces. The house gives the impression of heading in two opposite directions. The house is located at the rear of a corner plot, forming an L-shaped plan, leaving the front part as open space. Spatial organization is guided by internal horizontal and vertical circulation, with sequential layouts aligning spaces based on functional dependence. The site allowed for a maximum of 40% plot coverage from which only 27% was built. This planning approach shows an environmentally conscious approach to architecture while allowing space for external communal areas for socialization as well as greenery.all images by NaaroDirection Architects shapes sculptural ribbon-like geometryThe residences, while appearing to move in opposite directions, share a continuous formal language within a single building mass. The volumetric displacement of facades generates balconies and cantilevers, strategically limiting visual contact between interiors and creating secluded outdoor spaces. A sculptural ribbon-like geometry on the front inner facade creates an impression of a moving structure. Following the principles of green design, the architectural team prioritizes sustainability by optimizing building orientation to maximize sunlight exposure. Its green roof in combination with the garden, accounting for 75% of the overall site coverage, reflects a commitment to environmentally conscious practices.The building utilizes renewable energy sources, incorporating geothermal energy for heating and cooling, along with photovoltaics to balance electricity consumption. House Symbiosis distinguishes itself by introducing an architectural interplay between motion and static elements. It caters to the cultural context of Greek families desiring close proximity to their children while addressing the shifting paradigms of post-pandemic residential preferences.
