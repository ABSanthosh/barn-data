  "text": "In AD’s exploration of beautiful homes across the world, one common thread is a statement Moroccan rug anchoring the living spaces. Beni Rugs has specialized in this very same style since launching their brand of fair trade rugs in 2018—each one a celebration of artisanal traditions in Morocco, where pieces are handwoven by local craftspeople.The blue and green TIM-0312 creates a neutral foundation for cognac leather office furniture. The COV-0702 drapes over a desk, onto the PRO-0220. The founders, Robert Wright and Tiberio Lobo-Navia, are especially interested in Moroccan rugs as canvases for storytelling and cultural representation. So when considering how they might approach a new collection, they searched for designers with the same ethos and eventually tapped Paris- and Marrakech-based Studio KO for the job, the architecture firm AD previously named “the architecture firm everyone will be talking about” for their design of the Musée Yves Saint Laurent in Marrakech.PRO-0220 hangs as an office backdrop. As a firm, they’ve become known for what we’ve called their sumptuous and minimalist style, which organically feature lots of Berber rugs in their interiors so they certainly understood the assignment here. “With Beni,” says Studio KO’s Karl Fournier, “we share a common love for Morocco’s exceptional and vibrant craftsmanship. The fact that both of us are foreigners in an unfamiliar land has brought us closer together.”LIN-0244 hangs above paper debris. ROMAIN LAPRADECEN-0124 is draped over a lacquered desk. ROMAIN LAPRADEThe collaboration, named Intersection, considers these Beni Ourain rugs as cultural recordings, or artifacts of a specific time and place, in the same way that spreadsheets or a weathered journal entry might convey meaning and cultural context within each individual page.The campaign for the collection depicts the rugs in a dilapidated officecpapers askew, cabinets ajar—as if to show their permanence despite the passing of time. Fournier told AD the collection demonstrates the intersection, hence the name, of certain Western archetypes with traditional Moroccan craftsmanship. “We wanted to illustrate the encounter between our two cultures and how they can communicate, how something utilitarian here can become an abstract pattern over there.”The beige and deep reds of the LIN-0244 are shown alongside an industrial grid. ROMAIN LAPRADEThe collection encompasses 10 designs, incorporating contemporary details like abstract lines and grids into traditional Moroccan designs. The rugs were made using five different weaving techniques, including Beni’s debut of the Rabat method—characterized by fine knotting and low pile for elegant, exacting detail. Each piece also combines a complex palette of colors, like splashes of terra-cotta, forest green, and black on a neutral base of beige, taupe, or tan.“We enjoy working with what’s already there, reshuffling the cards in a different order, turning things upside down or backwards, so here we were in our element,” Fournier says. He sees the collection as enduringly modern, which he defines in less of a futuristic, avant-garde sense and more of a timelessness informed by the past. “That which comes from the past still speaks to our senses, to our eye today.” It makes sense, then, that the collection would feel right at home in many contexts, from a bohemian home flooded with plants and vintage pieces to a more minimalist space.The collection will launch April 7 in Milan, at Salone del Mobile. All styles, made from 100% live wool, will be available online at Beni Rugs on the same day.",
