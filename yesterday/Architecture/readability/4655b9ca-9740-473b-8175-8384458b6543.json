Spanning 253 square meters, the home features seven interconnected courtyards that bring green spaces into the home, and serve as focal points for both the architectural layout and the residents’ daily lives.The name originates from the owner’s passion for planting, with trees playing an essential role in the project from design to construction. Some were planted during the building phase, growing alongside the house itself and becoming essentially the primary inhabitants of the space. Their branches filter sunlight throughout the day, casting shadows and light within, creating a dynamic interplay between indoor and outdoor environments.all images courtesy of Studio Bewellwinding corridors connect communal and private zonesThailand-based Studio Bewell has divided the house into two zones — public and private — with a dark grey brick wall and a central courtyard, providing a natural transition between spaces. The bedrooms and kitchen, located on the private side, each open onto their own green courtyards, offering privacy while maintaining an airy, sunlit atmosphere. The central corridor connects these spaces and wraps around the main courtyard, acting as both a passageway and as a continuous connection to nature throughout the interiors.In the public zone, the design emphasizes harmony between indoor living spaces and the outdoors. A trapezoid-shaped wooden-patterned fabric is exposed to the skylight, allowing natural light to filter through while highlighting the surrounding courtyards. These elements then create a fluid relationship between the living areas and the garden courts, ensuring the greenery is visible from every angle of the house.Tree’s House’s name originates from the owner’s passion for plantingStudio Bewell creates a quiet verdant home in Bangkokthe center courtyard allows noteworthy scenery that can be admired everywhere in the housethe wooden-pattern trapezoid fabric exposed to the upper skylight helps highlight the public zoneseven interconnected courtyards bring green spaces into the homea dark grey brick wall separates public and private spacescorridors ensure connectivity as the central passageway in the housethe design ensures a fluid relationship between living areas and the garden courtsproject info:name: Tree’s House architect: Studio Bewelllocation: Bangkok, Thailanddesignboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here.edited by: ravail khan | designboom",
