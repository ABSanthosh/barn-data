  "text": "Tucked into a residential lot in Victoria, Australia, Palm House demonstrates how an outdated home can be sensitively reimagined to meet the evolving needs of contemporary family life – without erasing its history. Designed by Leeton Pointon Architects + Interiors, the project breathes new life into a post-war 1940s suburban dwelling that had grown tired, dark, and disconnected from the outdoors. At the heart of the project is a core belief in working with what exists. Rather than resorting to complete demolition, the architects chose to retain the majority of the original structure. This choice not only reduced environmental impact but also allowed the design team to allocate resources strategically – enhancing key functional spaces like the kitchen, pantry, laundry, and communal living zones. By doing so, the new intervention becomes a focused, high-quality addition rather than a sprawling overhaul. The new extension, aptly described as a “garden room,” serves as the heart of the home. Set within a carefully curated landscape, the addition embraces its environment through expansive glazing, creating a seamless transition between interior and exterior. As one moves through the original portion of the house, a framed view through an arched portal gradually reveals the light-filled pavilion and the lush garden beyond. This newly established relationship with the outdoors marks a shift from the house’s original inward-facing character. Natural light, previously absent, now floods the living areas. Garden views extend in all directions, and ventilation flows with ease – qualities that significantly enhance the comfort, wellness, and joy of daily life. Despite the complex spatial language of Palm House, its material palette remains refreshingly simple. Concrete, glass, and wood work in harmony to create a contemporary yet calming environment. These materials were chosen for their enduring qualities, while adding a modern layer to the original historic home. Internally, the layout allows for easy movement throughout while creating nuanced distinctions between spaces. Generous open-plan areas encourage connection, along with gentle curves and changes in ceiling height that form more intimate nooks for retreat. The modern furnishings curated by Karyne Murphy Studio lean toward soft textures, natural hues, and minimalist compositions, reinforcing the calm and contemplative atmosphere throughout. A defining element of the extension is its sculptural concrete roof. Its sweeping curves create a rhythm and softness not typically associated with the material. This roof not only defines the architectural character but also serves practical functions: shielding the home from excessive summer heat, providing thermal mass for energy efficiency, and framing views both upward and outward. The expressive oculus skylights punctuating the roofline act as dramatic light sources. They direct shifting patterns of sunlight throughout the day, animating the interior with shadows and reflections. Sustainability is a core principle in Palm House’s design and addition. By reusing the existing building structure and focusing new construction on essential areas, the architects dramatically reduced material waste and reduced costs. Passive design strategies – including orientation, shading, thermal mass, and natural ventilation – were integrated from the outset. Solar panels are concealed within the roofline, water tanks are hidden yet accessible, and the landscaping supports food production and biodiversity without compromising aesthetics.

By reusing the existing building structure and focusing new construction on essential areas, the architects dramatically reduced material waste and reduced costs. Passive design strategies – including orientation, shading, thermal mass, and natural ventilation – were integrated from the outset. Solar panels are concealed within the roofline, water tanks are hidden yet accessible, and the landscaping supports food production and biodiversity without compromising aesthetics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://design-milk.com/?attachment_id=577061\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-577061\" data-wpel-link=\"internal\"\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\"
