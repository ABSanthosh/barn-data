  "text": "estudio-casa: A place to Inspire CreativityThe newly completed Estudio-Casa for Spanish interior designer Isern Serra in the Poble Nou neighborhood of Barcelona embodies a vision of creating a studio environment that feels as welcoming and comfortable as a home. Serra’s concept, STUDIO_HOME, reflects a deliberate effort to design a space that balances functionality with the warmth and humanity of a home.Estudio-Casa was designed to capture the essence of humanity — creating an environment that fosters creativity and comfort. The goal was to establish a studio where ideas could flow naturally, encouraging reflection and inspiration. The space is carefully curated to make creative work feel deeply personal, with each element selected to evoke a sense of ease and familiarity.images © Salva Lópeza curated Space to reflect isern serra’s design identityEvery object in Estudio-Casa, from design pieces to custom-made studio furniture, has been thoughtfully chosen by Barcelona-based Isern Serra and the design team led by Aasheen Mittal. More than just decorative, these objects serve to represent the identity and values of the designer. The space combines functionality with personal meaning, creating an environment where every detail contributes to the overall atmosphere.The design of the space draws inspiration from domestic spaces. The layout is intentionally free of rigid divisions, fluidly blending the studio’s work and living areas. By structuring the space as one might design a home, the studio offers inviting corners where comfort and inspiration can be found. The work and living areas are divided subtly, with each zone encouraging a sense of relaxation and creativity.Estudio-Casa blends work and home for Isern Serra in Poble NouAn Ever-Evolving, Gallery-Like AtmosphereEstudio-Casa was conceived as both a workspace studio for Isern Serra and as an open venue for hosting intimate gatherings, talks, and events in Barcelona. The space is designed to facilitate the exchange of ideas, providing a platform for creative dialogue that leaves guests with new insights. With its welcoming atmosphere, Estudio-Casa allows visitors to engage with the studio and its projects as active participants.One of the most distinctive aspects of Estudio-Casa is its transformation into a dynamic gallery space. The studio is carefully curated to feature a rotating collection of artwork, design pieces, and brand elements that tell a broader story about identity, innovation, and creativity. This gallery-like atmosphere blends the intimacy of a home with the professional polish of an exhibition space, making every corner a point of visual interest.the space is designed to inspire creativity and personal reflectionThe studio is located on the fourth floor of a 1960s industrial building in Poble Nou. The space is divided by an elevated platform, separating the closed areas (such as the meeting room, bathrooms, and storage) from the open living and working areas. Above the platform, the kitchen and living spaces act as the studio’s communal areas, while the workspaces are positioned closer to the natural light on the lower level.Visitors are welcomed into Estudio-Casa through a small entrance marked by a step and a change in level. The curved walls immediately set a soft, inviting tone. On the left, an arched meeting room with a custom cream-colored lacquered table greets guests, while on the right, an arched tunnel leads to the bathroom, illuminated by an alabaster lamp. These architectural details lend a sculptural quality to the entrance.each element in the studio is carefully chosen for its meaning and connectionAt the heart of the studio lies the living room and kitchen, spaces designed for gathering and conversation. The living room features custom-made furniture, including a red travertine stone table and a vintage FM60 armchair, all illuminated by soft lighting that enhances the warm, monochromatic tones of the space. Across from the living area, the kitchen and dining room create a central hub for the studio, where a large lacquered table and sculptural lighting elements contribute to the overall feeling of peace and calm.Stepping down from the living area, two large concrete tables anchor the studio’s workspaces. These sculptural pieces, designed to appear almost floating, are essential to the design’s overall aesthetic. Behind them, built-in shelves display materials, books, and objects that further infuse the space with life and personality. The studio’s gallery-like atmosphere is maintained here, with soft lighting and art objects enhancing the workspace.the layout blurs the boundaries between living and working areas",
