  "text": "Just a few days after announcing his departure from CNN, broadcaster Chris Wallace is listing his Washington, D.C. home of 27 years for $6.4 million, the Wall Street Journal reports. The anchor and his wife bought the Georgian Revival residence for $1.1 million in 1997, around the time they got married.The dwelling sports a stately brick façade, a columned entrance, and slate roof tiles. It is located in the capital city’s tony Kalorama neighborhood, which has drawn the likes of Jeff Bezos, the Obamas, and Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner in recent years. Former presidents Woodrow Wilson, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Warren Harding, and Herbert Hoover have all been residents of Kalorama.The abode, which dates to 1929, has four bedrooms and five bathrooms across nearly 5,000 square feet of living space. The main level features formal areas with arched doorways, hardwood floors, and elegant crown molding. A cozy wood-paneled study and a living room complete with an 18th-century marble fireplace are among the pad’s most welcoming spaces. The couple made a number of small remodels to the house over the years, the most notable of which being the home’s updated all-white kitchen; the space is where Wallace’s wife, Lorraine, tested recipes for her cookbooks, including Mr. Sunday’s Saturday Night Chicken. Wallace told WSJ that the late senator Ted Kennedy, late Supreme Court justice Antonin Scalia, and George Clooney (with a bottle of red wine in tow, no less) were among the guests he and Lorraine entertained during their tenure at the residence.Register TodayAD PRO's 2025 Interior Design Forecast is almost hereArrowWallace also told the WSJ that this next era of his career will involve making the move from cable to podcasts and streaming. He shared that he and Lorraine will downsize to a smaller abode in D.C. and spend most of their time in Annapolis, Maryland, where she owns a small business selling produce to local restaurants.",
