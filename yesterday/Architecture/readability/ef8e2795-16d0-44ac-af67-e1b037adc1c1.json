Lindor, a shortstop for the New York Mets, is reportedly under contract to purchase a roughly $20 million penthouse in the uptown Manhattan neighborhood, multiple sources close to the matter told the Wall Street Journal. The apartment, initially priced at $22.95 million, is one of 36 units under construction in an 18-story boutique condo building slated for completion in 2025, though the exact timeline has yet to be revealed.Lindor’s lavish pad will span 5,000 square feet and is expected to feature six bedrooms, multiple terraces, and 11-foot ceilings. The unit will be outfitted with arched windows, a kitchen lined with Italian marble finishes, and ​a garden. The building also plans to offer amenities including a children’s playroom, an outdoor fireplace, a movie theater, and a virtual sports room.The Puerto Rico-born, Florida-raised baseball star is quickly amassing an impressive real estate portfolio. He also owns a $2.9 million waterfront mansion in Montverde, Florida—the same neighborhood he resided in after moving from Puerto Rico at 12 years old.
