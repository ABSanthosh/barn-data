  "text": "fabian tan architect completes cc houseIn the lively neighborhood of Bangsar, Kuala Lumpur, Fabian Tan Architect’s CC House reimagines a corner terrace home with an interplay of openness and privacy. The minimalist white facade is accented by high, curved garden walls, that above are matched with metal elements that allude to the design’s main feature awaiting within: pivoting ‘moon doors’ that bathe the interiors in abundant natural light.Acting as a portal to the sky, the doors transform the spatial quality of the split-level volume, offering unconventional perspectives of the residence. Throughout, the Malaysian studio’s renovation maintains much of the original structure, while thoughtfully adapting it to meet the owner’s new needs and creating a seamless connection with the surrounding garden.all images courtesy of Fabian Tan Architectthe ‘moon doors’ transition from openness to privacyUpon entering CC House, a walkway leads to a guest bedroom and bathroom on the left, before ascending to an open-plan dining and kitchen area. Here, sliding glass doors fully retract, opening the home to the adjacent corner garden. The existing staircase, which now features widened steps, enhances the sense of flow between spaces while also providing built-in seating and garden views. Fabian Tan Architect extends the living room from the original structure to the side, creating a double-height space that forms an intimate garden room and serves as the house’s main feature. Its rectangular base appears to hover over the sloping garden, topped by a semi-circular upper level visible from the street.The architects clad this portion of the home in corrugated galvanized metal, presenting an imposing yet elegant presence punctuated by two pivoting quarter-circle moon doors. From the interior, the moon doors can be adjusted to control the opening, light, and ventilation using a custom-made lever handle that locks into various positions. When fully opened, the ground floor is fully illuminated, while the family room on the first floor is shielded for privacy.CC House reimagines a corner terrace home with an interplay of openness and privacya minimalist white profileaccented by high, curved garden wallsthe pivoting ‘moon doors’ bathe the interiors in abundant natural lightthe moon doors open as a portal to the sky",
