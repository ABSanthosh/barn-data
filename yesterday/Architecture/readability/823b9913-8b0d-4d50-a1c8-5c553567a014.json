  "text": "thegoodviewloo becomes at one with its natural setting in spainDesigned by Nico Goebel, thegoodviewloo is a countryside bathroom offering scenic views of Cantabria, Spain’s, unspoiled landscape. It sits near a barn currently being converted into a residential building, providing a composting toilet and shower during the construction period and beyond. The wooden structure’s secluded location and subtle presence allow the design to play with the qualities of the translucent corrugated polycarbonate sheets, with the facade shifting with varying weather and light conditions. With a slender form and gently arched roof that creates an organic silhouette, thegoodviewloo sits in harmony with its surrounding landscape, its partial transparency allowing natural light, foliage, and wildlife to be perceived at all times.  all images courtesy of Nico Goebelnico goebel wraps timber in corrugated polycarbonate sheetsWithin, a panoramic window offers expansive views of the rolling green hills, enhancing thegoodviewloo’s connection to the surroundings. Two zones divide the bathroom: one side contains the toilet with a washbasin, while the shower is located at the back. The latter is designed as an open space that cannot be seen from the street due to the natural topography.German architect Nico Goebel emphasizes cost-effective construction that can be easily and inexpensively realized by self builders with minimal environmental impact. Polycarbonate sheets curve smoothly around the timber frame, which together with gable-end overhangs provide weather protection while showcasing the structure’s craftsmanship. This seamless design eliminates the need for traditional roof-to-wall transitions. The frame, mounted on small metal foundations, can also be completely disassembled if necessary for adaptable future use. For energy, water is sourced from a nearby stream and heated with a gas-powered instantaneous water heater.Nico Goebel completes thegoodviewloooffering scenic views of Cantabria’s unspoiled landscapean arched roof creates a gentle, organic silhouette in harmony with the surrounding landscapetranslucent corrugated polycarbonate sheets allow the facade to shift with varying weather and light conditionsproviding a composting toilet and showerbetween transparency and translucencythe simple wooden frame can be completely disassembled if necessary for adaptable future usea panoramic window offers expansive views of the rolling green hillswater is sourced from a nearby stream and heated with a gas-powered instantaneous water heaterthegoodviewloo illuminated at night1/2project info:name: thegoodviewloo architect: Nico Goebellocation: Cantabria, Spaindesignboom has received this project from our DIY submissions feature, where we welcome our readers to submit their own work for publication. see more project submissions from our readers here.edited by: ravail khan | designboom",
