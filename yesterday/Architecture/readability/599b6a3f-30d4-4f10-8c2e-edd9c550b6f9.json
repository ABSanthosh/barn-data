  "text": "a monumental opera house fans open in shanghaiWith construction advancing toward its planned opening in 2025, fresh photographs by StudioSZ document the evolving presence of Snøhetta‘s Shanghai Grand Opera House in the city’s Expo Houtan neighborhood. Designed in collaboration with ECADI, the project introduces a monumental cultural landmark along the Huangpu River, where its spiraling roofline rises in a steady gesture above the waterfront.The opera house takes shape as a broad, gently rotating form, expressed in layered terraces and sweeping contours that convey a sense of movement anchored in place. At ground level, the structure meets its surroundings through a generous plaza and landscaped edges, drawing visitors toward a continuous, climbable roof that functions as a civic promenade. This rooftop, which will be open throughout the year, establishes a public destination as much as an architectural feature, creating varied vantage points over the river and the city skyline.images © StudioSZsnøhetta designs with contextual motifsThe design by Snøhetta references the image of a traditional folding fan, a motif repeated across the project’s interiors and circulation spaces. The architects have described this gesture as evoking the dynamic energy of dance while underscoring a commitment to public ownership. Inside, the composition unfolds in a sequence of overlapping volumes, where lobbies and halls merge with interstitial gathering areas to promote fluid movement among audiences.Three auditoriums of different capacities are positioned to accommodate a spectrum of performances, ranging from traditional Chinese opera to contemporary experimental productions. The main hall, configured for opera and symphonic work, is complemented by smaller venues for recitals and immersive shows. Warm finishes and measured lighting define the interior palette, supporting an atmosphere that balances clarity with intimacy.the Shanghai Grand Opera House is nearing completion along the Huangpu River in the Expo Houtan neighborhoodmateriality: translucent, smooth and whiteSnøhetta’s scope encompasses architecture, landscape, interior, and graphic design, reinforcing coherence across scales throughout the Shanghai Grand Opera Hall.
