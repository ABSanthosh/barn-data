Start your entry today, and take advantage of the Main Entry prices! As artificial intelligence continues to reshape the creative industries, Architizer’s Vision Awards jury reflects the design world’s most forward-thinking voices. This year’s panel includes pioneering architects, educators, researchers, and visual storytellers at the forefront of generative design. From fostering ethical innovation in global practice to exploring the cultural implications of machine intelligence, each juror brings a unique perspective on how AI, computation, and creativity intersect. Start Vision Awards Entry Collectively, they represent a paradigm shift in architecture — one in which designers are not just users of new technologies, but active participants in defining their purpose. Their influence spans continents and disciplines, proving that the tools of tomorrow can still be wielded with vision, intention, and humanity. Niknaz Aftahi Founder of aecplustech Niknaz Aftahi is the CEO and founder of aec+tech, an all-in-one innovation platform and community that connects professionals in Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AEC/O) with cutting-edge tools and technologies.
