The Shelter sleeper sofa doubles as a day-to-day piece with a convenient pull-out option for overnight guests. The true-to-form sleeper comes with a gel memory foam mattress that is on par with a comfy bed.Before DeliveryPrice: How much does it cost? Are there payment plans available?Pricing starts at $2,499, and varies based on size and choice of upholstery. Opening the West Elm credit card gives you 10% back on rewards or zero-interest promo financing on orders of $750 or more with 12-monthly payments. Affirm offers $122/month or 0% APR.What are the upholstery or customization options? Did you choose any?At the time of ordering the Shelter sleeper, all three couches in my house were gray, so I was not going to opt for the in-stock graphite yarn dyed linen weave. Instead, I wanted something plush and had my eye on performance velvet. While I have successfully ordered upholstery swatches from West Elm in the past, I went into the nearby store to see the colors on a larger scale—we actually draped the samples over existing couches in the store. My husband and I settled on olive green because it works as a neutral but isn’t as expected. While we ended up with the plushier performance velvet, the performance distressed velvet was a close second because it had more depth of color.What is the lead time for customization, manufacturing, and delivery?The couch was ordered in March and was ready in about eight weeks, mid-May. As I was in the middle of some home renovation projects, I had to hold my delivery for a few weeks, which was an easy enough process by calling customer service. Once I was ready for the couch, it only took a few days to have it delivered to my house. I was pleased with the flexibility because as anyone undergoing renovation knows, delays are inevitable.Delivery + AssemblyWhat was the delivery process like?Once the white-glove delivery was set up, I received a two-hour window. Mine started at 7 a.m., and even though I was still in pj’s when the two-person team arrived, I was glad to have it done and over with and not mess up the rest of my schedule. The two men unloaded the couch, which was wrapped in a moving blanket. They had to take it up a flight of stairs, which was a slight challenge because the couch was heavy. I was extremely grateful that I did not have to maneuver the piece up and around a corner.Because I live in a house that’s almost 90 years old, I was very nervous about having the couch fit through the 29-inch doorway. I did call the customer service before ordering the couch to confirm that it should fit—but you never know.What was the assembly process like? How long did it take and how many people?The sleeper came fully assembled. We actually have to take off the legs, which are screwed on to the base of the couch, to fit it through the bedroom doorway. Adding the legs back took less than two minutes.Is the sleeper sofa suitable for particular decor styles, and if so, which?The sleek silhouette of the Shelter sleeper will fit any house aesthetic. You certainly can’t go wrong with placing it in a contemporary space, especially if you go for the woven upholstery and neutral colorways. In my case, the olive green velvet definitely elevates the look, and while I have this sleeper in the guest room, I would be proud to showcase it in my living room, which is more upscale and has some gilded elements. Adding a few decorative throw pillows will certainly drive the decor factor upward. My advice: Select the upholstery and colorways you like, and design the rest of the room around it.Is it durable/practical in a modern home?Absolutely. I was incredibly impressed by the plush factor of the sofa. I am usually skeptical about couches with pillows because they can end up looking slouchy. I’ve had this couch for a month and it looks exactly the same, even with two boys climbing on it every once in a while. The upholstery feels durable and sturdy as well—the fabric is said to have 100,000 rubs.In terms of being practical, I love that even though it is a sleeper, you’d never guess it, so I can place it in any room.After DeliveryWhat are the dimensions (both regular and pull out)? How does it fit in your space when it’s not expanded vs when it is? Would it be better-suited for a different type of home?Regular: 31\" H x 80\" W x 38\" DExpanded: 31\" H x 80\" W x 90\" DPart of the appeal of the Shelter style is that it is only 80 inches wide, so I can place it against a wall without taking up precious real estate space of a room. This works especially well because I still have space to put a side table and some shelves around it. The footprint it takes up is small, even when the queen-size sleeper is expanded.Sit Test: Is it comfortable? Does it feel well made? Does the couch have a tendency to sag?The Shelter sleeper is the softest, cushiest couch in my house. I am now wondering if I should look into getting a Shelter sectional for my family room. The cushions are plush, but have enough give and resilience to keep them from feeling like you’re sitting in quicksand. The main seat padding, which is thinner than the cushions has zero sagging and when I get up, it doesn’t leave a tell-tale seat spot.West Elm ranks it as a two for softness, with five being the firmest. I would agree with this assessment.Is it kid- and/or pet-friendly?One of the reasons I opted for velvet upholstery is because it is supposed to be an unappealing clawing spot for cats. So far, my cat has not been tempted to dig his claws into the sides of the sleeper.In terms of being kid-proof, I am optimistic that it is going to hold up two rowdy boys, who I expect will use the pillows to make a fort or two. I like that I don’t have to treat this piece of furniture as something precious and we can lead our daily routines as usual. The olive green color way also looks pretty forgiving for both my kids’ grimy hands and against my cat’s gray fur.Do the photos do this product justice? Was there anything you were surprised to see IRL?The photos online are pretty much identical to what the couch looks like in real life. The only difference is that performance velvet does leave lines as you move around the seat and cushions—though these are easily smoothed out. I tend to be on the perfectionist side, and I am fine with it, if anything, these give it a more lived-in feel and texture.What are the care and cleaning instructions? Do you think stains could be easily removed?The short pile and matte finish of performance velvet give this polyester fabric upward 100,000 rubs, so I am hoping that it will not look worn any time soon. I plan to vacuum the crevices regularly and the benefit of this couch being a sleeper is that any crumbs will fall through the crevices onto the floor below, and, if I am lucky, I will not be sitting on Cheerios.In terms of stains, West Elm recommends spot cleaning and blotting spills with a clean towel as soon as they happen. A sponge can help absorb extra liquids. So far, we have not had any spills on this sleeper (fingers crossed).Sleep TestWhat type of mattress does your sofa have? Materials? How plush/firm is it?A gel memory foam mattress does lean toward the firm side. My bedroom mattress is a Nectar Classic memory foam and while initially, the Shelter sleeper mattress feels a tad softer, it ends up feeling firmer overnight. This makes sense though as the Nectar is 12 inches, and this one is only four inches high.The cover has a pretty floral pattern, which adds to the overall West Elm ethos of paying attention to details.Lay test (pulled out): Does the couch easily convert into sleeper mode? How many people are needed to convert the sofa? How many people can sleep on the sofa at once?Operating the Shelter sleeper is standard to what you’d expect in a pullout couch. All you need to do is take off the cushions and seat, then use the handle to pull up the leg and fold it down onto the floor. I can do this on my own without jiggering the couch or working up a sweat.Two people can certainly sleep on the queen sleeper, but one would be more comfortable. I am five feet four, and my toes were hanging off the mattress a bit. If I had to share this with my husband, who is six feet tall, he would definitely want to kick me out so he could stretch more. The purpose of this sleeper is to have it for when grandma comes to stay or for sleepovers with my kids’ friends.Comfort: Is it comfortable? Does it feel well-made? How does it compare to the traditional mattresses you’ve slept on?I have somewhat sensitive hips and could feel that this bed did not give me as much pressure point relief as I had hoped, given the fact that it was also memory foam and not a sad innerspring mattress that my old sleeper had. Still, this mattress is definitely a few steps up from a sleeper that uses folded-out seat cushions as a mattress. My own bed has a Brooklinen down alternative mattress topper that gives it an extra, cushy layer. I think buying another one for this sleeper will make it more comfortable.In terms of the overall setup, I put the larger cushions behind and the smaller cushions on the side. Essentially, it looks as it did, except it has the bed extension. I like this setup a lot because I can still recline and use the couch during the day—if I make the bed, that is.Did you put sheets on the sleeper sofa? Was it easy to put them on?To make the bed, I used ​​Ettitude CleanBamboo Hemp Linen sheet set. The fitted sheet in this set has deep pockets (it’s made to fit mattresses up to 17 inches), so the sides were a little baggy, but it ended up working out because the draping covered the metal folding mechanism. Since there is more clearance in the front, the sheet lays smooth and tucks neatly under the mattress platform.Sofa GradesComfort: A-Value: B+Delivery and assembly: A+Style: AOverall couch rating: A",

All you need to do is take off the cushions and seat, then use the handle to pull up the leg and fold it down onto the floor. I can do this on my own without jiggering the couch or working up a sweat.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTwo people can certainly sleep on the queen sleeper, but one would be more comfortable. I am five feet four, and my toes were hanging off the mattress a bit. If I had to share this with my husband, who is six feet tall, he would definitely want to kick me out so he could stretch more. The purpose of this sleeper is to have it for when grandma comes to stay or for sleepovers with my kids’ friends.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComfort: Is it comfortable?
