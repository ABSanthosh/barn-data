Photo: Center for Architecture A multitude of public-facing projects spanning the entire range of architectural research and practice across the United States are under threat from the Trump Administration's recent shock cancellation of millions worth of grant funding distributed through the National Endowment for the Arts.  The concern was highlighted recently by public statements issued by the Center for Architecture, Architectural League of New York, The Cultural Landscape Foundation, and BOFFO, each of whom lost at least $30,000.  That includes funding for the League's prospective \"Working Communities, Working Architecture\" series, a multiyear effort focused on questioning the industry's priorities and ability to serve clients with fewer resources economically. The Center for Architecture lost funding for its educational outreach program that engages learners in New York City public schools.  \"Late last Friday, the Center for Architecture received notification from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) that our grant funding, which supports our hands-on architecture and design residency programs in public schools across New York City, has been terminated. [...] We were anticipating this news, and our team is working hard to plug the gap that the loss of $30,000 in grant funding creates,\" the CFA's statement reads. The administration's threats to defund the 60-year-old Endowment, however, are not an entirely new endeavor. In 2017, President Trump made inroads towards its elimination. Those were later stymied by a bipartisan coalition. The back-and-forth, which once again threatens its elimination altogether, is reminiscent of the \"Culture Wars\" fought over the NEA in the late-80s and early-90s.  Previously on Archinect (from 2017): Trump may eliminate the National Endowment for the Arts — here's why that matters for architecture\"The reasons given will be familiar to anyone who has been following the news, and we are still assessing whether any of the planned funds for the advisors, editors, and event participants from around the country who were being called into action will still be accessible, as well as whether the NEA will continue as a supporter of our work in the future,\" Architectural League director Jacob Moore said in an email announcement. \"The NEA has long been a unique and crucial source of funding for us, as it has for many of our peers who also lost grants.\" As the Architectural League's announcement mentions, their loss amounts to $30,000 over two years. Charles A. Birnbaum, the President \u0026 CEO of The Cultural Landscape Foundation, told Archinect: \"The NEA has supported TCLF’s work repeatedly over the past two decades, through multiple administrations; indeed, they have been a vital partner, which has inspired others to give. But, they dumped us. Now, TCLF and many other organizations nationwide can no longer count on federal support.\" Archinect is interested in gathering feedback from our community to assess the impact these funding cuts are having on other organizations, collectives, nonprofits, and cultural spaces.
