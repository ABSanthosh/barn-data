  "text": "bomun house: a new home to contrast its surroundingsWith its glimmering facade of corrugated steel, this Bomun House by Atelier ITCH is located in a densely packed residential alley in Seoul. The neighborhood is characterized by three- to four-story red brick multi-family houses, nearly identical in design and finish. Positioned in the middle of a narrow street barely accessible by vehicles, the building initially had a cluttered appearance due to an external staircase on the southern side. This staircase blocked natural light from entering the interior, while neighboring buildings just one meter away on the east and west sides further restricted both sunlight and views.The building’s fourth floor was the primary reason the owners chose it for their residence. The terrace offered a rare opportunity to enjoy an open view of the sky despite the limited overall space. The plan was for the owners to occupy the third and fourth floors while renting out the first and second levels. A key design challenge was creating a sense of openness despite the compact living space, with the fourth-floor terrace serving as a focal point for relief and ventilation.images © Joel Moritzthe minimalistic facade by atelier itchTo mask the Bomun House’s road-facing external staircase, the design team at Atelier ITCH crafts a minimalistic facade for a presence that is both clean and impactful. The strategy allows for the home to stand out from its nearly identical neighbors. Budget constraints led the architects to select cost-effective materials that contrasted with the surrounding red brick buildings, effectively achieving the desired visual impact without overspending.The fluid integration of the fourth floor with the terrace was the defining feature of the interior layout. This open space at the top of the narrow building provided much-needed ventilation and a sense of openness. Although the surrounding structures limited external views, the architects extended the exterior material to the terrace railing, blocking unsightly surroundings while maintaining an open view of the sky.atelier ITCH completes Bomun House in Seoul, overcoming tight site constraintsthe rooftop terraceA standout design decision by Atelier ITCH was organizing the bathroom of Bomun House adjacent to its fourth-floor terrace. With natural greenery on the terrace and an open, sky-facing shower experience, the architects created a space that encourages relaxation and daily rejuvenation.The limited access to natural light and poor ventilation conditions posed significant challenges. An early design concept included an atrium-like space on the third floor to enhance airflow. However, this was abandoned due to the loss of practical storage and usable area. Despite these constraints, both the architects and the owners insisted on maintaining the spacious fourth-floor bathroom with a terrace view, prioritizing it as an essential feature for creating a distinctive living experience.the building sits in a dense neighborhood of red brick multi-family housesan external staircase originally blocked natural light from the interior spacesthe owners occupy the upper floors while renting out the first and second floors",
