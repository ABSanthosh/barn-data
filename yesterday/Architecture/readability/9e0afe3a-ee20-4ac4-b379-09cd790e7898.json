However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.With its staggering natural beauty, storybook history, and elegant villas, Lake Como is a place that fully embodies la dolce vita. The best Airbnbs in the area can streamline a sun-soaked trip of easy living and dreamy landscapes, especially since the lake’s soaring popularity means its famously grand hotels are increasingly booked out in advance. To spend your days sipping Aperol spritz on your own private porch rather than dealing with crowds of tourists, a rental home is a neat solution that offers a more authentic side of the lake. From restored villas to hillside chalets with mountain views, book here for a glimpse of Como’s most enchanting sights.Perks: High chair and crib, private fenced yard, indoor fireplace, outdoor dining area, barbecueTucked into the village of Sopravilla, a maze of ancient houses and stairs, this one-bedroom stone house is secluded from Como’s tourist centers yet is just a five-minute stroll from the lake. Its private garden, complete with sun loungers and an outdoor dining set—not to mention stellar lake views—mean you’ll probably be spending most of your time here outside. But inside is equally as charming with original stone walls and wooden beams that bring real character to the space, while the minimalist cream-and-white decor keep things airy and bright. This is a romantic, tucked away spot for a couple or a perfect place if traveling with a baby, thanks for the provided crib and high chair. From $348 for two nights, with a two-night minimum.Perks: Original wall frescos, backyard, travel crib, antique furnishings and Murano glass chandeliersIt feels a little bit like sleeping in a palace at Villa Emma thanks to the home’s preserved wall frescos, muraled ceilings, original tile flooring, Murano glass chandeliers, and wealth of antique furnishings. The spacious two-bedroom space, which is an apartment within a larger 19th-century villa, would be ideal for a family or set of friends thanks to the large central living room and outdoor seating area. Located in the small village of Argegno, this rental is located on the piazza right on the lake, complete with a mosaiced fountain and cobblestone courtyard. We’re pretty sure a novel is waiting to be written about someone who stays here. From $800 for three nights, with a three-night minimum.Perks: Lake views, a fully equipped kitchen, near mountain trailsThis two-bedroom stunner of an apartment feels like it could have a starring role in a Fellini film. With vintage terrazzo flooring, coffered ceilings, built in clean-line wooden wardrobes, and minimalist decor, this spot is a midcentury Italian dream, softened by the country charm of its setting, not far from the historic village of Gravedona. The space can easily sleep up to five thanks to two double bedrooms and a sleeper couch in the living room, and with a fully equipped kitchen this is a place to arrive with a small crowd. You might not find yourself doing much sleeping thanks to the multiple windows showcasing the lake and mountains in the ever-changing light. From $344 for two nights, with a two-night minimum.Perks: Backyard and barbecue, pool, hot tub, gym equipment, washer and dryerThis Scandi-inspired duplex feels more like a modern mountain chalet than a lakeside villa thanks to its bare wood walls and oversized picture windows. The clean lines and minimalist aesthetic allow the property to speak for itself, and with a private lawn, pool, outdoor dining area, and mountain views, you won’t even mind that you’re not right on the lake. The five-bedroom home sleeps a total of twelve guests making this a great option for a group of friends—although we wouldn’t recommend it for families due to the lack of cribs, high chairs, and general childproofing. Near the town of Colico, on the northern end of Lake Como, you’re just a five-minute drive from the lake, cafes, and restaurants. From $5,746 for seven nights, with a week minimum.Perks: Lake access, terrace with outdoor furniture and a hammock,It might be in Italy, not Greece, but scenes of Mamma Mia! might come to mind when you see the long stone staircase that leads to Villa Giuditta Pasta, a villa dating back to the 13th century. The villa was purchased in the early 1800s by Italian soprano Giuditta Pasta, from which it gets its name. This one-bedroom Airbnb is on the ground floor of the villa and showcases the building’s original soaring stone arches and curved ceilings that evoke an ancient grotto. A lovely, landscaped terrace has plenty of sun loungers to go around and direct access to the lake, should you fancy a swim or arrive with your boat. For town access, Villa Giuditta Pasta is only five kilometers from the town of Como. From $1,039 for two nights, with a two-night minimum.Perks: Lake views, balcony and terrace, indoor fireplace and outdoor firepit, outdoor showerThis 18th century home is perched in the hills above the lake near the small village of Nobiallo. There are nearly 170 steps leading up to the home, so keep that in mind when packing your bags! Those who make the climb will be charmed by the privacy of the home and its blend of rustic and refinement with stone walls, exposed wooden ceilings, modern minimalist furnishings, with some added romantic touches like a clawfoot tub, a fireplace, and outdoor shower. A small upstairs balcony and a larger ground level terrace is stocked with outdoor seating and an outdoor firepit. The owner keeps a goat on the property, for some added charm, but you’re not so far removed from city life—the larger town of Menaggio is only a few minutes away. From $923 per night, with a three-night minimum.Perks: Terrace overlooking the lake, in a village center, bright and sunny, bidetYou can’t get much closer to the lake than at this sunny apartment in the center of the village of Carate Urio. Located on the ground floor of a 19th-century villa, the studio apartment is simple and modern, with minimal but tasteful furnishings. But the real reason you stay here is for the terrace, almost another room in itself, with a sun lounger and a small table for two. You’re so close to the lake you almost feel like you’re floating on its surface. From $1,090 for four nights, with a four-night minimum.",
