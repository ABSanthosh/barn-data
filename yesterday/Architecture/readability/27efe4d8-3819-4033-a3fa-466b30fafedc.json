With millions of followers and countless hours of educational content, they’ve turned platforms into launchpads, opening up architecture to a global, diverse, and increasingly digital audience. Together, these jurors are expanding the impact of architectural ideas beyond the studio or the screen — and they’ll be instrumental in helping us identify this year’s most visionary creators across the Architizer Vision Awards‘ categories.
