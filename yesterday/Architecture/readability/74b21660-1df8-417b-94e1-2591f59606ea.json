  "text": "anchor Image: CAL FIRE via Flickr (CC BY-NC 2.0) The devastating wildfires that gripped Los Angeles in the past week have prompted local architects to look to each other for ways to galvanize rebuilding efforts and muster their expertise in the interest of serving the public in whichever ways they can. Two of the organizers behind Design for LA—arts and design publicist Meara Daly and Populous architect Joanna Grant—have been accessible about the effort that went into creating the new free public directory that includes offices like Assembledge+, Bestor, RIOS, WXY Architecture + Urban Design, RIOS, MILLIØNS, and Morphosis. As of right now, more than 300 architects, interior designers, landscape architects, engineers, and contractors from across Southern California have signed up to share their guidance.  Speaking to the vetting process and the need to ensure that all who do sign up are doing so sans consideration for their immediate self-interest, Daly said: \"We are verifying information as we go but the conversations about scope, budget, and fees or pro bono/discounted work must be done between the home/business owner and the architect/designer/contractor. More than 12,000 structures burned in these fires - some will require a complete rebuilding, some remediation, and some renovation [so] every scope is individual.\"Related on Archinect: Here’s how architects can help LA's fire recovery efforts nowAdditionally, she cautions: \"We urge people to do their due diligence and speak to as many people as possible, we have added an email link to report any price gouging, and as we build the site we are collaborating with places like UCLA's Citylab and the AIA to provide resources on the rebuilding process (that page is coming soon).\"Finally, Daly says the community’s response thus far has been \"completely overwhelming and 99% supportive.\" She also shared her personal view that rebuilding can and should bring about an influx of more resilient structures and be anchored by an acknowledgment that the built environment must be responsive to the shifts in weather events initiated by climate change. Be sure to check back for more updates as the architectural professionals come together surrounding local disaster response and recovery causes.",
