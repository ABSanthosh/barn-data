  "text": "Textured plaster intended to mimic nearby rocky outcrops coats the thick walls of Hytte Riverview, a house overlooking an estuary in South Africa by local studio KLG Architects. The 110-square-metre home is nestled into the rocky, sloping landscape of Rooi Els in the Western Cape, enjoying views of the Rooi Els River flowing into False Bay and the sea beyond. Responding to this setting, KLG Architects combined thick, rough walls that shelter from the weather with expanses of full-height glazing, \"striking a delicate balance between refuge and prospect\", the studio said. KLG Architects has completed house overlooking an estuary in South Africa\"The design's dual nature – open and outward-facing on one side, solid and sheltered on the other – ensures that the home provides comfort, serenity, and a deep connection to the distinctive environment,\" director Jan Douglas told Dezeen. \"It offers a sanctuary where residents can feel both protected and connected to the landscape,\" he added. The compact, single-storey home is organised based on this \"dual nature\", with a large living area projecting out northwards towards the sea with full-height sliding glass doors and decked wooden terraces including a swimming pool on either side. The home's central space is flanked by a pair of bedroom wingsThis central space is flanked by a pair of bedroom wings overlooking an enclosed, stone-paved entrance courtyard to the south, which is sheltered by a wooden pergola. The different areas of Hytte Riverview are connected by a central spine, along which runs a narrow kitchen that steps up from the living area. \"The solid southern facade encloses the entrance courtyard, creating a sheltered space for enjoying cold winter evenings around an open central fire,\" explained Douglas. \"The northern facade is predominantly glazed to maximise the spectacular view and enhance solar gain during winter,\" he continued. The living area faces out towards the seaThe mono-pitched roof of Hytte Riverview slopes upwards towards the rocky rear of the site. This creates space for clerestory windows that illuminate the bedrooms without disrupting the feeling of \"sanctuary\" created by their white-rendered and bagged-brick walls. KLG Architects described the interior palette as one of \"durability and economy\", with dark slate flooring, pale timber ceilings and plywood carpentry. Slate flooring and timber ceilings feature insideBased in Cape Town, KLG Architects is led by Douglas alongside co-directors Geoff George and Tyrone Block. It was founded out of the Köper Levin George architectural practice originally established in the 1930s. Other homes in South Africa recently featured on Dezeen include a dwelling in Johannesburg by Gregory Katz that is defined by its clashing geometric forms and a minimalist retreat by Chris van Niekerk in Cape Town's Steenberg mountains.
