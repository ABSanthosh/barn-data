  "text": "anchor Studio cohort in hardhats in front of the completed prototype core With catastrophic floods battering Appalachia in 2022 and again this winter, housing insecurity in Eastern Kentucky has become an urgent architectural problem. A design-build studio at the UK College of Design has responded by delivering a full-scale, truck-deployable emergency-housing core that can expand into permanent dwellings as families recover. Students assemble the prototype core module outside UK’s Gray Design Building Guided by professor Bruce Swetnam, 14 third- and fourth-year architecture students opened the semester with a field visit to Breathitt County—one of the hardest-hit floodplains in 2022. Conversations with residents and officials framed the brief: create a low-cost structure that could ride a flat-bed into the hollers yet feel like home. Back in Lexington, the team erected a 400 ft² “core” module outside the new Gray Design Building. The steep-pitched roof sheds runoff; a centralized kitchen anchors family life; a wet-room bath, loft sleeping deck, and generous daylighting round out the essentials. Additional bedrooms or porches can be plugged in later, allowing the starter unit to evolve from crisis shelter to long-term house. Professor Swetnam reviews measurements with studentsUnlike many studio projects that end at schematic design, Swetnam insisted students swing hammers—framing walls, setting windows, and installing rainscreens donated by industry partner Gray AES. Alumnus Ron Jackson (’94) returned as a critic, noting, “Understanding why a paper detail fails on site is career-changing when you’re still in school.” The finished prototype and full drawing set will relocate to the UK Robinson Center this summer, where Cooperative Extension agents will field-test the design with local builders and residents. The open-source approach echoes precedents such as Auburn’s Rural Studio but centers disaster response rather than rural infill. “For us, this is reciprocity made tangible—listening first, then co-building solutions,” said Laura Stephenson, UK’s vice-president for land-grant engagement. Swetnam adds, “Design-build is the fastest way to teach that architecture is service.” This effort was made possible through Gray Construction, Gray AES, and collaboration between the College of Design and UK Cooperative Extension.",
