  "text": "Following last week’s visit to Halflants + Pichette, we are moving our Meet Your Next Employer series to New York this week, where we meet Downey. A multidisciplinary design firm founded and led by Alison Downey, the studio has built a portfolio spanning interior and exterior design projects for new construction, renovation projects, and reimagining existing spaces. Prior to founding Downey, Alison led the interior design program at global luxury furnishings brand RH, prior to which she was a senior designer at Jennifer Post. Over on Archinect Jobs, the firm is currently hiring for its New York office. For candidates interested in applying for a position, or anybody interested in learning more about life at a design studio, we spoke with Alison Downey for a behind-the-scenes look at the firm. Image credit: DowneyHow did Downey get started? Downey was founded just over seven years ago after I left my role at RH, where I had the opportunity to establish and lead their interior design division. While launching my own firm had always been a personal goal, the experience I gained, both in building and scaling a business and in honing my design expertise with the firm I worked for prior, was invaluable in shaping the foundation of Downey. How big is your team? It’s a team of 7, including myself. Describe the area of New York your office is located in. We are fortunate to have a special office in a special area. I wanted a UES “jewel box” space and happened upon a former art gallery in a townhouse. It’s located on E. 71st between 5th and Madison, next to the Frick Museum. Image credit: DowneyWhat is your favorite thing about working in New York? Access, bar none. Are you and your team working fully in the office, or on a hybrid/varied schedule? Hybrid. Part of that is because the “jewel box” office is not a huge studio space, and I find when the team is working on drawing,s for example, if they are comfortable set up at home, there is no need to make the commute. We typically do 3 days in the office a week. Is your office open-plan or subdivided? Open plan for the most part. Image credit: DowneyWhat is one book (design or non-design related) that you would recommend to our audience? I recently started The Bonfire of the Vanities by Tom Wolfe. I don’t typically read fiction, but I’m enjoying it. Part of it is set on the Upper East Side, it offers a satirical take on New York society, and while it was written in 1987, so much of it still feels relevant today. I’ve been listening to it on Audible during my walks to the office, passing many of the landmarks mentioned in the book. What is your favorite piece of architecture or interior design in or around New York? I don’t have one favorite, but rather an appreciation for the many styles and periods represented in the townhomes on the Upper East Side. You can find a bit of everything, and I like to notice new things like iron work details, front door designs, etc. What does your office ‘sound’ like? Do you listen to music or radio at work, can you hear the city life outside, or is it a place of quiet work? All of the above. You hear traffic on Madison Ave or the occasional traffic jam on 71st when one delivery truck holds up the street. We play classical piano in the office for the most part. Image credit: DowneyWhere is the most popular lunch spot in or around the office? It’s a tough area for food because rent is so pricey and it’s mostly high-end retail. Bel Ami café is reopening on 71st \u0026 Lex after having closed their other location nearby so that will be the spot. You can always order in and eat in the park! What is the most popular design tool in the office? Probably Keynote. We use it for our presentations as a living document where we keep everything from design inspiration to sketches, storyboards, and technical drawings.  Tell us about a project you are proud of, whether completed or in progress. We recently completed a ground-up new construction project in Greenwich, designing both the interiors and exteriors. Collaborating closely with the architect and builder, we brought a shared vision to life; creating a new home that feels timeless, with a stone façade and Tudor-inspired details. It’s rare to see new builds with this level of character and craftsmanship, and the result is a residence that both elevates and seamlessly complements the surrounding neighborhood. Image credit: DowneyWhat position(s) are you currently hiring for? All! What we care most about is finding the right person to fit within our team and then matching them in the right role. I have a position posted on Archinect for a Senior Designer. That person would have experience with large-scale construction and the ability to manage those projects end-to-end. I am also interested in finding a studio assistant, interior designers, etc. What project(s) are the new team members likely to be working on? Mostly custom, large-scale residential projects in the Hamptons, South Florida, NYC, and beyond. In three words, how would you sum up DOWNEY’s ethos? Client centric, always Image credit: DowneyMeet Your Next Employer is one of a number of ongoing weekly series showcasing the opportunities available on our industry-leading job board. Our Job Highlights series looks at intriguing and topical employment opportunities currently available on Archinect Jobs, while our weekly roundups curate job opportunities by location, career level, and job description.",
