For more than a decade, this landmark awards program has honored the products elevate the built environment — from lighting and furniture to architectural components and sustainable materials — helping architects bring their visions to life. The 2025 A+Product Awards attracted outstanding entries from top brands around the globe, each demonstrating exceptional quality, performance and design impact. After a rigorous judging process conducted by an esteemed jury of more than 200 architects, designers and industry thought leaders, alongside a global public vote, this year’s winning products represent the cutting edge of material innovation and sustainable thinking.

Many winning products demonstrated advancements in low-carbon materials, recycled content, bio-derived composites and energy-efficient systems — all key to reducing the environmental footprint of buildings worldwide. Jurors praised the program’s forward-thinking submissions. Architect Daniel Joseph Chenin of Daniel Joseph Chenin Ltd. observed: “This year, the most compelling trends in materials design emphasized sustainability and bio-derived innovation … designers are clearly prioritizing environmental responsibility without compromising performance or aesthetics.” Similarly, Isabel Castilla, Associate Partner at Field Operations, noted the shift in emphasis among leading product manufacturers: “Interior furnishings stood out for their strong focus on sustainability, prioritizing eco-friendly materials, recycled elements, and low-carbon manufacturing … highlighting a growing industry focus on sustainability over technical innovation.” Meanwhile, Radek Wakulik, Associate at JNS Architecture + Interior Design, also applauded the bold material innovations that are helping to make sustainable design more accessible for both architects and their clients: “The quality of the products this year has been phenomenal … it is clear that low-impact solutions to unique designs are quite achievable. We can see it in these products.” This year’s winning products prove that design excellence and environmental stewardship can go hand-in-hand, offering architects the materials they need to help realize a more sustainable built environment. View Winners’ Gallery Feature A+Product Award Winners: Gather and Tiers by Foster + Partners, Jury Winner, Outdoor Furniture; Ben Lamp by Matthew McCormick Studio, Jury Winner, Decorative \u0026 Free Standing Lighting; Maximo Thermo Clear Radiata by Maximo, Popular Choice Winner, Building Envelopes, Cladding, \u0026 Roofing; Lokum by Acerbis, Jury Winner, Residential Furniture Celebrating Industry-Leading Product Design Architects and designers across the jury were inspired by the caliber of innovation on display this season. Renowned architect Sanjay Puri of Sanjay Puri Architects reflected on the diversity of ideas across the categories: “It is interesting and informative to see and study the innovations taking place across the product design industry. Overall the quality of the work was very high with some exceptional product designs.” Juror Benjamin G. Saxe, founding principal of Costa Rica-based firm Studio Saxe, highlighted the deeper resonance of the most impactful entries: “Many entries showed a thoughtful integration of function, beauty, and environmental responsibility. The most memorable pieces weren’t just well-designed — they felt connected to something deeper, reminding us that design can bring us closer to nature when it’s approached with care and intention.” Meanwhile, Alan Maskin, principal at Olson Kundig, emphasized the practical relevance of this year’s entries for practicing architects: “I was impressed with the breadth of ideas in the submittals … and found some submittals I could immediately refer to my project teams that reflect interesting product exploration.” Entries that showcased flexibility, system thinking, and integration with architectural workflows stood out to jurors this year — a testament to the increasing sophistication of product design as it responds to modern building challenges.
