However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.An out-of-this-world jewelry designer, Alina Abegg has been known at times to live in her own world, which sits a little bit apart from ours. That being said, she was only too happy to open the door to her home to AD Germany—though perhaps spacecraft would be a more fitting label, in this case. This apartment in the Berlin neighborhood of Charlottenburg and is also her showroom, which you too can visit by appointment if you want to dive into the designer’s playful world. Abegg has lived in Berlin since 2017, and for the last four years, this 1,800-square-foot apartment has been “where inspiration comes to life.” AD Germany spoke to her about how moving frequently can shape one’s individual style, about the memories that a sofa can hold, and whether you can capture feelings in a piece of jewelry.A Noguchi coffee table for Vitra sits in front of a sofa that Abegg has owned since she lived in London. “I asked for the painting above the sofa for my 30th birthday. It’s called New Beginnings and it’s by the artist Melike Kara. Looking back, the title applies perfectly to the new phase of life that I had embarked on back then.” Art: Melike Kara and Arcadia Missa, LondonAD Germany: Alina, if your apartment were one of your jewelry designs, which one would it be?Alina Abegg: Definitely the Alien Ring. Like that ring, my home is a mixture of playful and surprising elements with a touch of nostalgia. It’s unconventional, it tells a story, and it’s full of little details that only reveal themselves over time. Both my apartment and the ring have something quirky about them that’s not necessarily to everyone’s taste. I think that’s what makes them unique.How would you describe the personality of your apartment?The most important thing for me honestly was that the apartment be warm and cozy, a place I could always feel content especially during Berlin’s long, gray winters. I wanted to introduce some color into the apartment, so I began by giving all the walls a bright coat of fresh paint. For example, I chose an apple green for the kitchen that reminds me of chrysoprase, my favorite gemstone and one that I love to use in my jewelry designs. Green inspires me creatively and in a way it perfectly matches my personality, which I think is a bit spirited, gentle, and playful. I think the color also gives the room a certain energy that both inspires and puts you in a good mood, which is important to me in my home. The style itself is quite eclectic. A lot of pieces of furniture come with a history; some I’ve collected over the years, others are family heirlooms. and some were custom designed for me.What brought you to Berlin in the first place?My mother is German, and my father is half-Swiss, half-Canadian. I grew up in both Switzerland and London, where I spent most of my life. I was drawn to Berlin for a long time, but it took me a while to take the plunge. In the end, I had a boyfriend who was living here and he was the ultimate impetus for the move. Ironically, that relationship ended shortly after I moved. But I still wanted to stay and discover the city—if only for a year, I thought. It’s now been seven.For the renovation and interior work, you enlisted the help of an architecture firm and your sister who is a designer. How did the team work together?Amazingly well! Probably because my sister Marsha knows my taste and my vision so well. She always knew right away what I wanted. Even though she actually prefers a more classical style, she managed to create a symbiosis of my ideas and her approach. It was really fun to work with her on this project. Together with the interior architecture duo Irina Kromayer and Etienne Descloux, I further designed custom-made installations such as the kitchen, the showroom and office cabinets, and the dressing room.What made you decide to go with these bigger elements?I think it’s in collaboration that such larger creative concepts emerge. A perfect example of that is the banquette, which can also be turned into a guest bed. It mattered to me that the apartment not only be aesthetically pleasing, but also practical for everyday use since I often entertain and host friends and family.\"I started collecting art in my late 20s, a passion that has grown ever since. The chair is a work by the artist Pedro Reyes, known for his unique combinations of art, design, and social themes. For me, the chair is not just a piece of furniture, but a real art object that enlivens the room with its clear, sculptural form. I gave myself Cosima von Bonin’s glowing cigarette when I gave up smoking. It reminds me of the importance of making decisions that are good for us and keeping a sense of humor along the way.” Installation: Courtesy of Cosima von Bonin and Petzel Gallery. SMOKE (Black), 2008/ Chair: Pedro Reyes/© VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2024Do you have a favorite room?If I had to choose, it would be the eat-in kitchen. The kitchen being open to the dining room makes the whole place feel lively and inviting. I spend most of my time here, working, cooking, or relaxing. When friends come to visit, we end up here too. The kitchen is simply the coziest place in the apartment.The apartment is both your showroom and your home. Have you ever regretted so closely integrating your personal and professional lives?Sometimes I do find it difficult to separate my private and professional lives completely. I think if my showroom or office were in a different place, it would be easier to set clear boundaries and separate my work hours from my free time. On the other hand, my job is also my passion.Where does your enthusiasm for interior design come from?I’ve been creative since I was a child. Just like my sister, my mother is also a trained interior designer. We moved a lot as a family. Our houses were always lovely, but they often started out as real wrecks that my parents would then completely renovate and furnish with a lot of love. Their interior design approach was always very eclectic, sometimes even a bit crazy, but that fascinated me. For example, my parents would always collect and store furniture that they’d eventually use somewhere. I learned that with the courage to rearrange things and a good eye for detail, you can always come up with your very own look. If you have the means to store things and bring them together later, you can create incredibly interesting spaces.What helped you quickly feel at home over the many moves?My parents always made sure right away to find a place in our new homes for certain pieces of furniture, photos, and decorative elements that were most important to us. No matter how chaotic things often were right after a move, these touches always helped make me quickly feel at home. And, of course, it helped that my mother has a real talent for turning a house into a place that feels special. Even before everything was finished, she would have created a cozy atmosphere. It is one of many things my parents taught me that makes me grateful for them.“The picture by Tracey Emin is one of my favorite pieces,” Abegg says, and adds about chest of drawers she found on 1stDibs: “its colorful accents add a feeling of lightness.” Art: Tracey Emin/© VG Bild-Kunst, Bonn 2024You have said that you process memories with your jewelry. What do you mean by that?Ever since I was little, I’ve been collecting objects, books, and little treasures. My sister had the great idea of building shelves in the open-plan kitchen, my favorite room, where I can store and look at all these things. It’s almost like a little cabinet of curiosities, from crystals and gemstones that I have received as gifts from dear friends or bought on my travels to a small illustrated book of Swiss landscapes that reminds me of my homeland. In this meshing of experiences with family, friends, and guests against the backdrop of my very personal collection, stories and memories emerge. And that’s where I get ideas for my designs. Where the present meets the past, I find leisure and inspiration.Is it possible to capture a feeling in a piece of jewelry?For me, it’s about creating memories, dreams, and emotions in a tangible form. Capturing a feeling in a piece of jewelry means much more than just producing an aesthetically pleasing design. My Alina Abegg label lets us be inspired by the imaginations of children. Each piece of jewelry is meant to unlock the memory of one’s own childhood, a light-hearted time when imaginations can run free. Each piece should be a kind of token that reminds the wearer to look at the world with the curiosity and joy of a child. My creations are symbolic of love and self-acceptance, of the freedom and also the courage to truly embrace all parts of oneself—the playful, the sensitive, and the bold. In a way, the jewelry possesses a double meaning: It’s an internal process that I go through again and again and that I want other people to be encouraged to do as well. Stay true to yourself. Go your own way. If it feels light and liberating, it’s good.Did you work that way when furnishing the apartment?Intuitively, exactly. I follow my gut and collect things that inspire me and let everything come together organically. That always happens quite by impulse with me. It’s intuitively that a mood is created that speaks to me, similar with my jewelry designs. I love creating pieces that have a story and surprising details, but I never strictly plan things. It’s instead more of a journey where everything somehow finds its place.Which piece of furniture could you never part with?Even though it’s bulky, my sofa has been with me since London and it has a special significance for me. It carries so many memories of laughing with friends, meditating, dealing with break-ups—it’s all happened on this sofa. It was my dog Nugget’s favorite place and we spent many wonderful moments together there. Sadly, Nuggy passed away this summer, but the sofa always reminds me of our years together and the carefree times we spent on it. It was his absolute favorite place, and every time I sit there, I feel like a part of him is still with me.This interview with jewelry designer Alina Abegg was originally published by AD Germany. It was translated by John Oseid.A painting by Swedish artist Camilla Engström that Abegg discovered on Instagram hangs in the entrance.

A favorite Abegg leitmotif, green can be found all over the apartment. Robert RiegerAbegg came across an old Bavarian farmhouse chair in the classified ads. “It reminds me of my school days in Bavaria and brings a piece of my past into my present home.” Abegg calls the alcove her retreat. “The wardrobe was custom-made by Irina Kromayer and Etienne Descloux, and my sister chose the matching fabric Le Manach by Pierre Frey. I love this alcove because it’s not only cozy, but also practical. My dressing room is hidden behind the wardrobe and the banquette also serves as a guest bed. I can tune out, read, or simply daydream here in my favorite place to relax.” The designer sometimes work at her desk too—Abegg is currently planning pop-ups in various cities outside Germany. Eye for detail: Cabinet handles by AD100 designer Beata Heuman. Alina Abegg’s showroom was designed by Irina Kromayer and Etienne Descloux. Abegg’s showroom jewelry drawer. Alina Abegg believes that “true individuality should be celebrated in all its facets and hidden elements,” and her designs are the results of an almost childlike imagination. “For me, luxury doesn't just mean using high-quality materials, but also having the freedom to express yourself, to be playful, and to wear something unique that tells a story.” The guest bathroom is also open to customers who visit the showroom by appointment. The wallpaper’s shapes represent gemstones and it was custom made by designer Anna Glover.",

My sister had the great idea of building shelves in the open-plan kitchen, my favorite room, where I can store and look at all these things. It’s almost like a little cabinet of curiosities, from crystals and gemstones that I have received as gifts from dear friends or bought on my travels to a small illustrated book of Swiss landscapes that reminds me of my homeland. In this meshing of experiences with family, friends, and guests against the backdrop of my very personal collection, stories and memories emerge. And that’s where I get ideas for my designs. Where the present meets the past, I find leisure and inspiration.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it possible to capture a feeling in a piece of jewelry?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eFor me, it’s about creating memories, dreams, and emotions in a tangible form. Capturing a feeling in a piece of jewelry means much more than just producing an aesthetically pleasing design. My Alina Abegg label lets us be inspired by the imaginations of children. Each piece of jewelry is meant to unlock the memory of one’s own childhood, a light-hearted time when imaginations can run free. Each piece should be a kind of token that reminds the wearer to look at the world with the curiosity and joy of a child. My creations are symbolic of love and self-acceptance, of the freedom and also the courage to truly embrace all parts of oneself—the playful, the sensitive, and the bold. In a way, the jewelry possesses a double meaning: It’s an internal process that I go through again and again and that I want other people to be encouraged to do as well. Stay true to yourself. Go your own way. If it feels light and liberating, it’s good.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDid you work that way when furnishing the apartment?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIntuitively, exactly. I follow my gut and collect things that inspire me and let everything come together organically. That always happens quite by impulse with me. It’s intuitively that a mood is created that speaks to me, similar with my jewelry designs. I love creating pieces that have a story and surprising details, but I never strictly plan things. It’s instead more of a journey where everything somehow finds its place.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich piece of furniture could you never part with?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEven though it’s bulky, my sofa has been with me since London and it has a special significance for me. It carries so many memories of laughing with friends, meditating, dealing with break-ups—it’s all happened on this sofa. It was my dog Nugget’s favorite place and we spent many wonderful moments together there. Sadly, Nuggy passed away this summer, but the sofa always reminds me of our years together and the carefree times we spent on it. It was his absolute favorite place, and every time I sit there, I feel like a part of him is still with me.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003eThis interview with jewelry designer Alina Abegg was originally published by\u003c/em\u003e AD Germany. \u003cem\u003eIt was translated by John Oseid.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eA painting by Swedish artist Camilla Engström that Abegg discovered on Instagram hangs in the entrance.
