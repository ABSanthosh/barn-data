  "text": "The famous Full House dwelling, featured in the iconic ’90s sitcom and its 2016 spinoff series Fuller House, has sold for $6 million, per TMZ. The residence was at one time owned by Full House creator Jeff Franklin, who purchased it in 2016 for $4 million. He offloaded the four-bedroom, three-and-a-half bath home in 2020 for $5.35 million. It was returned to the market in June 2024 for $6.5 million.The quintessential San Francisco abode was used for exterior shots of the Tanner family home in Full House and its reboot, while interior scenes for both shows were filmed at the Warner Bros. Studio in Los Angeles. The 3,737-square-foot property is located in Lower Pacific Heights, an affluent San Francisco neighborhood near the Golden Gate Bridge. The house was built by architect Charles Lewis Hinkel in 1883.The town house was renovated in 2019 by architect Richard Landry of Landry Design Group, though its original Victorian moldings, bay windows, and charming brick stoop remain. The three-story pad boasts a top floor primary bedroom complete with a fireplace, a spa-inspired bathroom, walk-in closet, and sweeping views of the San Francisco Bay. The chef’s kitchen is outfitted with custom cabinetry, Calacatta Oro countertops, Viking appliances, and a wine fridge. An English garden in the backyard features concrete slabs with the handprints and signatures of the Full House cast, including John Stamos and the late Bob Saget.Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.Arrow“The fact that the front [of the home] is so iconic due to eight years of being flashed on TV screens around the world made it especially fun to be a part of the project,” William Mungall, an architect with Landry Design Group, told AD in 2024. “We were inspired by the show for the interior as well, opening up the living space to feature the staircase for dramatic entrances and combining several small rooms into a large kitchen featuring a walk-around island similar to the show.”",
