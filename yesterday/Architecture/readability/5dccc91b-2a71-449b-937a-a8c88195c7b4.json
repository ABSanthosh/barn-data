  "text": "Sher Maker revitalizes a family’s teak garden lodge in thailandSher Maker transforms a family-owned teak garden lodge into Red Riding Wood, a multi-purpose retreat in Thailand that fosters intergenerational connections. Nestled within a lush teak forest, the project preserves the legacy of the original retreat, concerning the natural surroundings. A vibrant red circular pathway connects a cluster of spaces—including two renovated pool villas, a reclaimed wood pavilion, an elevated Red Cabin, and a children’s playground. The use of bold red accents throughout the project—from entrance gates to seating areas and the playground—contrasts with the natural green hues of the rainy season and the earthy tones of the dry season. These colors, inspired by the red flat-backed millipedes native to the teak forest, symbolize vitality and provide a unifying visual identity for the retreat. Red Riding Wood’s construction relied on locally sourced materials and craftsmanship. Recycled wood from the dismantled pavilion was a key resource, and additional materials were procured from nearby suppliers. This approach reduced costs, minimized environmental impact, and supported the local community.all images courtesy of Sher MakerRed Riding Wood combines old structures with newOriginally conceived as a family business, the teak garden retreat had long served as a cherished space for gathering and reflection. However, as the buildings aged, the surrounding teak landscape flourished into a vibrant ecosystem. Sher Maker’s team aims to harmonize the built environment with the forest, with its renovation combining old and new structures into a sustainable sanctuary. The two existing pool villas, inspired by traditional Lanna architectural styles, were carefully revamped to become more practical while retaining their structural frameworks. An old wooden pavilion was dismantled, and its reclaimed wood was repurposed to construct a compact, multi-purpose pavilion near the playground. The newly added Red Cabin introduces a contemporary element to the retreat, offering elevated living spaces on the second and third floors. This design sets the privacy of the guests as the main priority while immersing them in the beauty of the teak canopy. The cabin’s facade, featuring frosted glass and a staircase grid, balances openness with privacy, allowing for panoramic views of the surrounding forest while shielding more public-facing areas.Sher Maker transforms a family-owned teak garden lodge into a multi-purpose retreat in Thailandnestled within a lush teak forestthe project preserves the legacy of the original retreat",
