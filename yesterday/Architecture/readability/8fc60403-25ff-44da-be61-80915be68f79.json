However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.If you’re looking for super soft bedding that mirrors the look and feel of silk—without the price tag—the best Cozy Earth sheets literally have you covered. Our editors have been fans of the Utah-based brand for years, testing everything from pajamas to duvet covers to comforters, all made of their signature breathable bamboo fibers. After all, we didn’t name them our favorite cooling bedding brand for nothing. Out of all of their best sellers, the Cozy Earth Bamboo sheet set has been a standout for our team. Contributor Megan Wahn and commerce editor Audrey Lee both have these luxury sheets in their bedrooms and can testify that they’re worth the hype.Cozy Earth Bamboo Sheet Set“I first got introduced to the brand by way of the brand’s pajamas—which quickly became a nightly staple for me throughout the winter,” says Wahn. “While I had faith the sheets would live up to the bar set by Cozy Earth’s pajamas, I’d already found an unexpected forever love in the Big Blanket Co. sateen dreams sheets and was wary of anything else living up to that standard. But, something about how the Cozy Earth sheets unravelled like a babbling stream of water as I took them out of their wrapping made me think, Hmmm, maybe I should give these a shot?”Wahn reported back that the fitted sheet’s deep pocket design fits just right—even after many months of use—it’s especially apropos for sleepers with a grand mattress. While she noted that the top sheet runs on the large side, she does some tucking between her mattress and bed frame to make sure it doesn’t drape too low to the floor. It’s the same story with the pillowcases, as she says there’s a swath of extra fabric that sort of drapes off my pillows, so these are likely best for king-size pillows.At the end of the day, the hand feel of the fabric is the true selling point: “I honestly thought these sheets were silk when I first laid on them, that’s how smooth and buttery soft they feel.” Lee agrees, noting that she immediately appreciated their plush feel straight out of the box. And while they do have a nice weight to them, she adds that the bamboo fabric is still thin enough for air to pass through the layer and keep her comfortable all night long.Great for hot sleepers, Lee can’t stop talking about how these cooling sheets can keep her dry “during a string of mid-90-degree days when I’d normally resort to using a fan to stay comfortable (which I prefer not to because of the noise).” Even if you don’t typically suffer from night sweats, this bedding is a must-have. On the flip side, Wahn primarily uses her sheet set in the winter, and they not only keep her warm but they offer a smooth, satiny look to elevate her bedscape.After testing these sheets for years, we can attest that Cozy Earth stands the test of time, as they can handle machine wash after machine without any pilling or wear in sight. And unlike rayon or other synthetic materials, this high-quality bedding is made with viscose from bamboo to ensure ultimate breathability and some of the softest sheets imaginable. Plus, this set of sheets is made with sensitive skin in mind, as they are hypoallergenic and moisture-wicking, as mentioned, to keep you comfortable night after night.If you’re on the fence about these sheets ahead of checkout, they've not only gotten the AD stamp of approval, they’ve also made their way onto Oprah’s Favorite Things list for several years running—she describes them as the “softest bedding ever.” Plus, the brand allows returns and exchanges within 100 days, plus an additional 10-year warranty in case of any fraying or color fading.",
