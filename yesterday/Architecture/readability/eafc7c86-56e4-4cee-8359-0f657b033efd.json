Preregistration is now open — click here to receive program updates. China’s real estate boom has allowed architects worldwide to push design boundaries, resulting in buildings with sleek, futuristic forms. Beyond their fluid curves and dynamic massing, many of these projects share a deeper connection to nature. They create harmony — a core pillar of Chinese tradition by emphasizing balance and a relationship between humans and nature. Whether through undulating facades, sweeping rooflines or organic silhouettes, each of these ten projects in China embraces motion. Courtyard 35 – Hutong Cloudscape By WAY Studio, Beijing, China WAY Studio introduced a statement “cloudscape” bridge to Courtyard 35 as part of the renovation project. This floating corridor, with its twisted mirror soffits hovers within the courtyard embracing two towering ancient trees. The design creates a visual separation between the ground and sky reinforcing the relationship between natural and man-made spaces. The cloud-like form shifts with perspective and reflects the ever-changing environment while adding a poetic sense of movement to the historic courtyard. Longquan Mountain Observatory By BUZZ / Büro Ziyu Zhuang, Chengdu, China As part of the developing scape of Chengdu, the mountain observatory reinterprets the Eastern philosophy of mountains – not as rigid, immovable structures, but as fluid forms that grow and change with time and weather. BUZZ designed the building to adapt to the terrain, offering an observation space that feels like an extension of nature itself. Hangzhou Flows Villa Experience Centre By Hangzhou 9M Architectural Design, China This building follows the contours of a nearby lake and resembles the natural hillsides along the shore. The curves and splines throughout the exterior and interior create a continuous visual path that integrates with the natural surroundings. This flowing character creates an idea of movement that will guide visitors through the space in a way that mirrors the gentle flow of water. Zhuhai Jinwan Civic Art Centre By Zaha Hadid Architects, Zhuhai, China Zaha Hadid Architects designed this civic art center with sweeping steel canopies that resemble the flight patterns of migratory birds. The rhythmic, chevron-like structures echo the flight formations of the birds in the sky above southern China. They were configured and installed through repetition, symmetry and scale variation that optimize natural light. The Planning Exhibition Center of Liangjiang Collaborative Innovation Zone By Tanghua Architects, Chongqing, China This exhibition center is inspired by the confluence of the Jailing and Yangtze Rivers. The designers overlapped its circular plan with a three-way spline form that represents the meeting of the two waterways. It not only acknowledges the geography of Chongqing but also creates a sense of movement within a static structure. Birch Forest By Kris Lin International Design, China This project brings the essence of “forest” into an urban setting. The architect designed the building to mimic the canopy of the birch trees surrounding the site. This created an immersive experience where visitors feel as though they are “walking in the forest”. Traditional Chinese mortise-and-tenon techniques were used to assemble the structure to blend ancient craftmanship and contemporary organic design. Uniview Headquarters By GOA (Group of Architects), Zhejiang, China The sweeping western façade of the Uniview Headquarters curves inward, mirroring the radial center of the surrounding landscape. Inside, this curvature continues with cascading corridors that curve around an atrium creating an interplay of light and movement. International Digital Sea Investment and Exhibition Center By Hatch Architects, Shangai, China To create a sense of lightness and fluidity, HATCH Architects introduced the “Cloud Isle” concept for the business investment center. They designed a free-flowing, parametric roof that appears to hover above the ultra-clear glass façade. The transparency of the structure makes the white roof look as if it is floating like a cloud amid the surrounding greenery. The Metal Metal Pavilion Atelier Zeros, Shanghai, China This pavilion was designed to capture the fleeting beauty of frozen water. Its undulating form was inspired by melting ice and was created from ultra-thin 0.4mm steel sheets, bent and shaped to resemble air bubbles trapped within ice blocks. RL Metals used algorithmic modeling to simulate the natural melting process, resulting in a rippling, textured surface that shifts in appearance with changes in light. Xi’an Lovi Center By Aedas, Xi’An, China Aedas designed the center as a people-centric mixed-use development that introduces an organic, petal-like facade that breathes life into the urban fabric of Xi’an. Instead of straight edges, they incorporated a soft wavy form that looks like the gentle undulations of flower petals. In addition, a cascading glass funnel in the atrium was added to enhance the sense of fluidity, allowing natural light to enter freely through the space. Architizer’s Vision Awards are back!
