  "text": "Pepe Giner Arquitectos’ CTZ2 house overlooks Portixol BayPepe Giner Arquitectos’ CTZ2, featured in the Netflix series Breathless, is characterized by sinuous terraces wrapping around glass-enclosed interiors. Set on a dramatic hillside overlooking the Portixol Bay in Jávea, Alicante, the house offers uninterrupted views of the Mediterranean, blending seamlessly with its rugged surroundings. The horizontal platforms adapt to the steep terrain in staggered expressions to follow the natural gradient. These platforms extend outwards from the stone core to create terraces. Overlapping, they appear to levitate above the landscape, emphasizing the fluidity between indoor and outdoor spaces. On the ground floor, the terrace winds and narrows as it merges visually with an infinity pool, while featuring a Mediterranean garden where tall cypress trees punctuate the platforms.all images by Diego Opazothe house adapts to the sloped terrain with staggered platformsCTZ2 is framed by the Portixol Island to the north and the Cap Negre viewpoint to the south, sited on a slope that descends towards the southeast. Pepe Giner Arquitectos’ design approach centers on adapting to the orientation, geometry, and slope of the plot, while elevating the day area including the terrace and the pool. In this way, the south orientation is optimized, which coincides with the optimal views towards the Mediterranean Sea. The rugged topography means that what initially seems like a disadvantage ends up decisively shaping the architectural morphology of the project.Additionally, the house’s structural elements emphasize contrast and harmony. Dry stone walls anchor the platforms to the hillside, while slender metal pillars support the horizontal layers, creating a visual lightness that contrasts with the robust, earthbound base. The upper floor houses the entrance hall and three bedrooms which open onto terraces that function as elevated viewpoints, enjoying panoramic views of the bay. Articulating the space, the Spanish studio integrates a sculptural staircase of black Marquina marble, which acquires great visibility from many points of the house.Pepe Giner Arquitectos completes CTZ2the house is featured in the Netflix series Breathlessset on a dramatic hillside overlooking the Portixol Bay in Jáveathe horizontal platforms adapt to the steep terrain in staggered expressions to follow the natural gradient",
