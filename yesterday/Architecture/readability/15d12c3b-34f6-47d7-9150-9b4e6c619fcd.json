Inspired by her global experiences, she shares captivating insights into the world’s most extraordinary cities and buildings and provides travel tips on her blog, The Travel Album. Choosing the right architecture firm to start or advance your career can feel like choosing between two distinct worlds. Small firms and large firms each offer unique environments, opportunities and challenges; deciding between them often depends on your personal and professional aspirations. But the differences go far beyond just size — it’s about the kind of architect you want to become and the experiences you seek along the way. In a Small Firm Image generated by Ema Bakalova via DALL·E In a small architecture firm, there’s an undeniable intimacy to the work. Team members know each other well, and the office often feels like an extended family. You’re not confined to a single role; instead, you’re likely to find yourself immersed in all stages of the architectural process. One day you might be sketching initial designs, the next you’re sitting in on client meetings or even overseeing construction on-site. This kind of environment is perfect for architects who thrive on variety and want to see the big picture. I’ve head many of my fellow coworkers and architects who begun their career in a boutique studio, recall how transformative this experience was for them. “In a small firm, you’re not just designing in isolation,” they explained. “You’re part of every step, which means you learn to connect the dots between design, clients and construction.” That close involvement can be especially rewarding for young professionals eager to develop a broad skill set early in their careers. In my opinion, starting at a large firm allows you to hone your hard skills in a more forgiving environment, while transitioning to a small firm later can provide the focus and specificity needed to truly master your craft. I find small firms to be more fulfilling, offering the opportunity to engage deeply with projects, take on greater responsibilities, and make impactful day-to-day decisions. In my experience, small firms often handle projects of manageable size, allowing me to see the entire design process — from concept to completion — while ensuring the work feels meaningful and rewarding. Mentorship vs Prestige Image generated by Ema Bakalova via DALL·E The mentorship in small firms is another significant advantage. With fewer employees, senior architects often have the bandwidth to guide junior team members closely. Feedback flows naturally in this environment, allowing for rapid skill-building and personal growth. Sometimes there are trade-offs. Like I previously mentioned, small firms typically work on smaller-scale projects, and their budgets might not allow for the use of advanced technology or tools. If your ambitions lean toward designing skyscrapers or city-wide master plans, this setting might feel limiting over time. On the other end of the spectrum, large architecture firms represent a completely different reality. These firms, often with hundreds or thousands of employees, handle projects that shape city skylines and define urban experiences. Working for a globally recognized name carries a certain prestige. It’s the chance to be part of something monumental, whether it’s a cutting-edge airport terminal or a world-class cultural institution. Early in your career, working at a large firm can offer exposure to an incredible breadth of experiences — the work, the people, the projects and the clients. Even if your role feels small amidst hundreds of employees, you gain invaluable insights and learn a great deal by observing and collaborating with others. In a Large Firm Image generated by Ema Bakalova via DALL·E Many large firms thrive on specialization. Within these organizations, architects often focus deeply on specific aspects of a project, such as sustainable design, façade engineering or parametric modeling. While this can feel narrow to some, it’s also an opportunity to become an expert in your chosen niche. A friend of mine, an architect with a decade of experience at a global firm, speaks to the scale of opportunities. “I’ve collaborated with teams from across the world, from Tokyo to Dubai,” he shares. “The exposure to diverse cultures and innovative approaches has been invaluable.” Beyond the projects themselves, large firms boast impressive resources. State-of-the-art software, research divisions and generous budgets enable architects to push boundaries in ways smaller firms often can’t. Structured professional development programs and clear career progression paths are common, offering stability and long-term growth. Yet, working in such a vast organization can have its downsides. Bureaucracy and slower decision-making processes can frustrate architects who value creative autonomy. Additionally, it’s easy to feel like a small cog in a massive machine, where individual contributions might not always feel visible. Experiencing Both Environments Image generated by Ema Bakalova via DALL·E Deciding between small and large firms ultimately comes down to personal preference and career goals. If you dream of designing homes or intimate community spaces, a small firm may be the perfect match. If you envision your designs having a global impact or want to delve into large-scale infrastructure, a big firm could be your ideal fit. Your learning style might also guide your choice. Some architects thrive in a small firm’s hands-on, generalist environment, while others prefer the structured, specialized learning opportunities of a large firm. Work-life balance is another factor to consider. Small firms might offer flexibility but often require longer hours due to tighter resources. Large firms, on the other hand, tend to have well-defined boundaries and comprehensive benefits, though the pressure of high-profile projects can be intense. These are generalizations and examples, but they can vary significantly depending on the specific company and team dynamics. Many architects find that experiencing both environments over the course of their careers brings the best of both worlds. Starting in a small firm can provide a strong foundation in practical skills and project management, while transitioning to a large firm later can open doors to advanced tools and global exposure. Conversely, architects who begin in large firms might eventually move to smaller practices to regain creative freedom and a sense of ownership over their work (as this is what I observe most often). Navigating your career in architecture is rarely a linear path. It requires reflection and flexibility, as your goals and circumstances may evolve over time. Researching firms thoroughly, attending industry events and connecting with professionals who have worked in various settings can provide valuable insights as you make your decision. Ultimately, whether you choose a small or large architecture firm, the goal is to align your choice with your ambitions and values. Each type of firm offers unique lessons and opportunities, and both can contribute meaningfully to your growth as an architect. By understanding the dynamics of these two worlds, you’ll be better equipped to craft a fulfilling and purposeful career in architecture. Architects: Want to have your project featured?
