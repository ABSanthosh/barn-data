  "text": "MNAC Lisbon Blends Historic and Contemporary Design in ChiadoThe winning proposal for the refurbishment and extension of the National Museum of Contemporary Art (MNAC) in Lisbon revitalizes the museum located in the historic Chiado district. The design integrates the museum’s existing historical buildings with a new volume, balancing historical heritage with contemporary architectural elements. Designed by Baile Menduiña, delmedio atelier, and Luis Manuel Pereira, this new structure serves as a bridge between the historic fabric of the district and modern design, maintaining continuity with the city while establishing a cultural and architectural landmark.The building’s base is clad in lioz stone, a material symbolic of Lisbon’s heritage, creating a respectful presence rooted in tradition. On the upper levels, rustic ceramic mosaics introduce a modern texture, enhancing the visual profile and contributing to the harmony between past and present. The design maintains a clear connection between the museum and its surroundings, particularly through its outdoor sculpture garden, which serves as a public space and strengthens the museum’s role as an accessible cultural hub.all visuals by Baile MenduiñaMNAC’s redesigned spatial layout enhances Visitor FlowThe collaborative team between design studio Baile Menduiña, interdisciplinary practice delmedio atelier, and architect Luis Manuel Pereira arranges the museum’s layout in a manner that facilitates a fluid visitor experience with a linear tour system. The permanent exhibition is housed on the lower level, while temporary exhibition rooms and the library occupy the upper floors, establishing a spatial hierarchy. The top level includes a longitudinal terrace offering panoramic views of Lisbon, providing a symbolic conclusion to the museum tour and encouraging reflection on the connection between the museum, the city, and the river.The facade is designed to maximize natural light, reducing the reliance on artificial lighting, while passive thermal control systems help regulate temperature, improving energy efficiency. The building’s underground floors contain technical and storage areas, ensuring efficient operations without disrupting public spaces. The ground level features a lobby with a shop and café, offering direct access to the sculpture garden, thus integrating these amenities into the neighborhood. To promote accessibility, the museum is fully equipped for visitors with reduced mobility, with ramps, elevators, and clear signage. Additionally, a visible restoration space allows visitors to observe conservation processes, adding educational value to the experience. The design reflects a commitment to sustainability, cultural integration, and innovation, ensuring that MNAC remains a dynamic cultural landmark in Chiado for years to come.the extension of MNAC serves as a bridge between historical heritage and contemporary design | Serpa Pinto Streetclad in iconic lioz stone, the building’s base honors Lisbon’s traditional materials and cultural heritage | patiothe museum merges past and present through balanced architectural elements | historical buildings’ joints",
