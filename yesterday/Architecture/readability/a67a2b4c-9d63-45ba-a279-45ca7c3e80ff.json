  "text": "saudi arabia’s linear megacity, the line, is underwaySince it was first announced in 2021, Saudi Arabia’s THE LINE has sparked intense global discussions. A radical experiment in urban form, the project reimagines the traditional city as a 170-kilometer-long, 500-meter-high mirrored community running through the desert of Tabuk. Part of the larger NEOM gigacity, THE LINE promises to condense life into a narrow vertical corridor, eliminating cars, streets, and urban sprawl in favor of AI-powered transit and renewable energy. Conceived as a ‘gravity-free’ city with stacked infrastructure, the proposal ambitiously claims that all amenities will be within a five-minute walk, with nature integrated throughout and accessible at every turn.Over the past few years, NEOM has continued to refine both its rhetoric and its roadmap, encountering adjustments according to construction developments and financial concerns. Some early milestones have already been reached, with substantial groundwork already laid, and global design firms Gensler and Delugan Meissl Associated Architects continuing to design and implement the facets of Phase One. Satellite images and renders also reveal that early construction has already begun on much-anticipated signature features such as the upcoming World Cup’s NEOM Stadium and the Hidden Marina development. While questions remain about feasibility, scale, and ambition, development presses on. As of late 2024, Saudi officials confirmed that the first 5 kilometers are targeted for completion by 2030, with the full vision stretching out to 2045.all images courtesy of NEOM unless stated otherwiseneom announces steady progress on construction activitiesConstruction activities have been progressing steadily. Initial activities, including earthworks and piling, commenced in late 2022, and by March 2023, over 4,500 piles had been driven into the ground, forming the structural base for early modules. Early updates last year stated that millions of cubic meters of water and earth were also being moved each week. The construction strategy, the authorities explained, involves building the city in these 800-meter modular segments to facilitate phased development. In October 2024, Saudi Arabia announced plans to complete a central 5-kilometer stretch by 2030.Key design and engineering partners were also appointed towards the end of the year to shape the first phase. Delugan Meissl Associated Architects leads urban design and masterplanning, while global design firm Gensler is handling city planning and coordination. Mott MacDonald has been brought on to oversee infrastructure, with a focus on sustainability, efficiency, and integrated systems.a 170-kilometer-long, 500-meter-high mirrored communityhidden marina and neom stadium: new landmarksSatellite imagery has confirmed the early construction progress of the futuristic port — Hidden Marina. This vast mirrored hub, rising 500 meters tall, is expected to house 200,000 residents alongside retail, hospitality, and education spaces along the waterfront. It is anticipated to stretch 350,000 square meters, segmented into various modules that host its mixed-use program while allowing for flexibility.Additionally, THE LINE is expected to play a role in Saudi Arabia’s hosting of the 2034 FIFA World Cup. With a football pitch located more than 350 meters above ground and integrated into the roof of the linear city, NEOM Stadium will run entirely on renewable energy from wind and solar sources. It is expected to anchor a new sports-focused neighborhood adjacent to the Health and Well-Being District and the University. Construction is expected to begin in 2027, and following the festivities, it will become home to the local football team.NEOM Stadium | image courtesy of Saudi Arabia FIFA World Cup™ 2034 bidthe line is slated for 2045 completionReports in early 2024 hinted at a potential downscaling of the first phase from the original target of 1.5 million residents by 2030 to a smaller 2.4-kilometer segment housing around 300,000 people. Saudi officials have refuted these claims, asserting that though the timeline and scope have experienced adjustments the project’s scale remains unchanged.The next major milestone will be the launch of vertical construction, scheduled for late 2025. This will mark a crucial step in the development of this futuristic city, aligning with its vision of a car-free, sustainable metropolis.
