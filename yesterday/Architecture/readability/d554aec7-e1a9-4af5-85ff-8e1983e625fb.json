Architizer is thrilled to announce that, addition to a host of other prizes, select winners in the “Best of the Year” categories in the 2025 Vision Awards will be featured in Metropolis Magazine’s print edition later this year, placing the work of today’s most visionary architects, designers and creative professionals in front of a truly global audience. Start Vision Awards Entry This prestigious collaboration marks a major milestone in the growth of the Vision Awards, which celebrates the radical ideas and visual creativity shaping the future of architecture.
