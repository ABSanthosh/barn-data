  "text": "pena viewpoint: a cliffside intervention by pekubePena Viewpoint, a competition-winning project by architecture studio pekube, is a minimalist intervention that will enhance the visitor experience while respecting the natural character of its coastal site in Portugal. The design prioritizes a transition between austere, built space and the rugged landscape, ensuring that the viewpoint stands in dialogue with its surroundings.The project will be built at Ponta da Serreta, a recognized geosite on Terceira Island, one of the nine islands of the Azores. It will offer visitors the opportunity to observe and appreciate Portugal’s dramatic coastal scenery. The ocean’s ever-changing conditions — ranging from calm to stormy — will be magnified by the strategic positioning of the structure. The design of the viewpoint enhances the spatial uniqueness of the site, providing a safe and comfortable setting to take in one of the island’s most iconic landscapes.images © pekubethe lightweight structure contrasts with volcanic rockThe architects at pekube envision the Pena viewpoint to stand in stark contrast with the landscape. Ponta da Serreta is characterized by thick sloping trachytic lava formations, shaped by fractures from the Santa Bárbara volcano and the Terceira rift. The area holds significant natural, material, and immaterial heritage. The route leading to the viewpoint from the lighthouse narrates this geological history, incorporating locally sourced lava stones as paving materials. This path, designed with accessibility in mind, follows an organic pattern and visually aligns with the lighthouse, establishing a strong focal point along the journey.Midway along the route, a circular ramp integrates a resting area into the forested landscape. This gradual, four percent sloped ramp ensures accessibility while offering visitors a moment of pause and reflection. The design intentionally contrasts the materiality of the pathway with that of the viewpoint — where the heavy, dark tones of the ground give way to a light and airy structure overlooking the cliff’s edge.an upward-curving entrance frames the ocean view, drawing visitors forwardthe catenary-shaped concrete shellPena viewpoint’s defining element is its white-painted concrete form, which pekube designs to contrast against the natural terrain. The entrance frames the ocean view, drawing visitors forward. A catenary-shaped concrete shell provides structural integrity, with its upward curve counterbalancing gravity and load forces, allowing for minimal support and a visually striking, weightless appearance. From a distance, the slender profile of the viewpoint gives the impression of a floating platform, lightly suspended over the cliff’s edge.The illumination strategy employs a series of LED fixtures with integrated solar panels, strategically hung from trees to cast a soft, indirect glow over the pathway and viewpoint. This subtle lighting approach enhances both safety and atmosphere, ensuring the site remains a compelling destination even after sunset.from a distance, the slender profile of the viewpoint gives the impression of a floating platform1/5site planaxonometricsection, plancross sectionslong sectionproject info:name: Pena: An Azorean Viewpointarchitect: pekube | @pekube_architecturelocation: Ponta da Serreta, Terceira Island, Portugaldesign team: Beatriz de Una Boveda, Pej Gombert, Kuba Kolecstatus: competition winner",
