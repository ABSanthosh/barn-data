  "text": "Raised Cabin of Sails covers minimal footprint on Wuhan’s islandWiki World’s Cabin of Sails is located in Wuhan Ganlushan Culture Creativity City, China, a large-scale cultural and tourism complex with an emphasis on ‘ice and snow+’ programming. This project marks the architectural practice’s first venture beyond remote wilderness contexts into an integrated urban tourism development. Within this framework, the design objective remains focused on creating spatial experiences that are visually and functionally distinct from urban environments. As part of the ‘Island Living Plan,’ the cabin is one of a series intended to explore spatial isolation and environmental integration through compact architectural interventions.The cabin is designed with a width of only two meters, equivalent to the dimensions of a double bed, and takes inspiration from the form of a sailboat. Positioned above a raised terrace, the structure is elevated to create a sheltered outdoor area beneath. The spatial arrangement includes a narrow entrance bridge, a compact indoor area, and an upper loft accessed by a steep staircase. The loft serves as the bedroom. The cabins are situated on an island and accessed exclusively by boat, with each unit having its own small dock.all images courtesy of Wiki Worldwiki world’s Sailboat Cabins use prefabricated laminated timberIn response to the surrounding forest environment, the design team at Wiki World intentionally minimizes the structure’s footprint. By reducing the size of the dwelling, the structure limits its physical impact and allows for more direct interaction with the surrounding landscape. The narrow form and elevated placement minimize ground disturbance and integrate with the site’s natural conditions. The terrace provides open views of the surrounding water and landscape, and its adjacency to the shoreline allows for recreational activities such as fishing.Constructed using prefabricated glued laminated timber, all structural components were digitally modeled and customized to ensure precision and efficiency. Each element is designed for prefabrication and assembly, allowing for rapid on-site construction with minimal environmental disruption. The construction process preserved the existing vegetation, including trees and bamboo, and maintained the original topography and pathways. The cabins are supported by independent foundations and do not rely on continuous slabs or artificial landscaping. The facade uses carbonized wood cladding, treated through a manual charring process. All joints and connections utilize a system of reusable metal components, enabling repeatable assembly and disassembly. The cabin system aligns with Wiki World’s broader design approach focused on prefabrication, modular construction, and ecological sensitivity. The project continues the studio’s exploration of compact, adaptable architecture that engages with natural contexts through minimal means and intentional spatial restraint.designed by Wiki World, this compact retreat explores minimal architectural interventions in a natural settinginspired by the form of a sailboat, the design references ideas of movement and anchored solitudeeach cabin is only two meters wide, matching the width of a standard double bed",
