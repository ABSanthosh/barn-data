  "text": "kitchen, dining, living, and workspace merge within RV HOUSERV House is a renovation project by BIAN that transforms a compartmentalized 1930s apartment into a flexible, sea-facing residence in Cantabria, Spain. Located along the Bay of Santander, the intervention reconfigures a 120 sqm layout to establish a spatial strategy centered on openness and adaptability.The original 1932 structure featured long hallways and enclosed rooms that restricted natural light and view corridors. The redesign removes internal partitions to create a central, non-hierarchical core that functions as a multi-use area, combining kitchen, dining, living, and workspace zones into a single, continuous volume. This central zone establishes direct visual and spatial relationships with the bay, while the surrounding bedrooms form a peripheral arrangement that maintains connection to the maritime context.all images by HiperfocalBIAN employs a limited color palette of blue and whiteMaterially, the project team at BIAN employs a limited palette to emphasize surface integrity and spatial continuity. A linoleum floor unifies the interiors with a consistent tone, blending with raw finishes such as exposed concrete elements. Blue, a color associated with Santander’s identity, is introduced through custom cabinetry and furniture to anchor the design to its geographic setting.
