  "text": "Studio NEiDA curates Togo Pavilion in Biennale Architettura 2025The Republic of Togo participates for the first time in the 19th International Architecture Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia in 2025 with an exhibition titled Considering Togo’s Architectural Heritage. The pavilion is commissioned by Sonia Lawson, Founding Director of Palais de Lomé, and curated by Studio NEiDA, an architecture and research practice co-founded by Jeanne Autran-Edorh and Fabiola Büchele.The exhibition presents a detailed study of architectural developments in Togo from the early 20th century to the present, focusing on themes of conservation and transformation. It documents a range of building typologies and construction methods, establishing a comparative framework between traditional and modernist architectural practices. Through this approach, the exhibition aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the spatial and material evolution of the built environment in Togo.BIA Bank | all images by Wody Yawo unless stated otherwiseTogo’s Architectural evolution from 20th century to todayThe curatorial focus includes vernacular structures such as the Nôk cave dwellings and the fortified clay houses known as Tatas Tamberma in northern Togo. Studio NEiDA’s design team also examines Afro-Brazilian architectural forms developed between the mid-1800s and mid-1900s by returnees from Brazil. The exhibition extends to post-independence modernist architecture, highlighting civic and commercial buildings such as the Hotel Sarakawa, Hedzranawoe market, and the ECOWAS and BOAD banks.The pavilion addresses the current condition of these architectural sites, contrasting deteriorated examples like the Hôtel de la Paix and the Bourse du Travail with buildings that have undergone recent restoration, including Hotel 2 Février and the Palais des Congrès. The exhibition positions these sites within ongoing discussions about architectural preservation and adaptation in West Africa.Hôtel de la PaixPavilion uses design Heritage in Togo as exhibition’s Framework‘Togo’s architectural heritage, which spans ancient clay structures to complex histories and outlandish modernist experiments, is an incredible source of inspiration for our work. This built legacy, at times ingenious, at times eccentric, is a powerful guide for future architectural approaches that are contextual and climate compatible,’ comment Studio NEiDA’s designers on accepting the commission.Founding Director of Palais de Lomé, Sonia Lawson, shares, ‘I am delighted to commission the first Togolese Pavilion at the International Architecture Exhibition of La Biennale di Venezia. It is a milestone to showcase Togo’s diverse architectural heritage to a large number of visitors from across the world. The Palais de Lomé is a landmark architectural venue in Togo. Once a place of colonial exclusion, the institution’s program engages in a dialogue of contemporary issues relating to culture, architecture and the environment. I hope the pavilion furthers the conversations on the future and preservation of architectural heritage in West Africa.’ The Togo Pavilion is organised by the Ministry of Digital Economy and Digital Transformation of the Republic of Togo. The exhibition is designed in collaboration with Zuecca Projects, Venice.Hôtel de la PaixBOAD Bank",
