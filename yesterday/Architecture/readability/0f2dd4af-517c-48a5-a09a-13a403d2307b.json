  "text": "KO/OK Reconstructs semi-detached houseKO/OK Architektur BDA’s DOPPELGIEBEL project reconstructs the missing half of a semi-detached house in Leipzig, maintaining the historical character of the property. In accordance with current urban development regulations, the new construction reflects the architectural design of the surrounding structures while preserving the gabled house’s original shape and volume.During the 1930s, several housing estates were developed on the outskirts of Leipzig, featuring basic semi-detached and terraced houses combined with agricultural stalls and large plots for self-sufficiency. Over time, these estates have been significantly altered, with structural adaptations that obscure their original forms. The ‘Thomas-Müntzer-Siedlung’ in Leipzig’s Knauthain district is one such example, where the built environment has evolved with varied extensions and modifications. In response to this context, the project reconstructs the missing half of a semi-detached house while introducing changes to ceiling heights and floor levels. Additionally, a secondary structure, set slightly back with a recessed gable, was incorporated to serve as a living and dining area, extending towards the garden under a curved roof. Circulation is organized at the junction of the two structures, where private rooms and bathrooms on two levels connect to the central, double-height living space.all images by Sebastian Schelsdark wooden facade wraps DOPPELGIEBELThe new house, DOPPELGIEBEL, introduces a contrasting material palette within the estate, featuring a dark wooden facade that distinguishes it from the surrounding buildings. While aligning with the existing structures, the design also offers a reinterpretation of the heterogeneous architectural landscape.For KO/OK Architektur BDA’s design team, sustainability was a key consideration in the selection of building materials. The structure is constructed from Cross-Laminated Timber (CLT) with wood wool insulation applied to floors, walls, and the roof. The wooden facade is treated with a silica-based coating, and natural wax is used for the flooring. A wood-burning stove with a wet heating system provides thermal comfort. The spatial composition, defined by the intersecting gabled volumes, is particularly evident in the central living area. This space opens on three sides to views of the surrounding greenery, framed beneath the curved roof, reinforcing the connection between interior and exterior environments.KO/OK Architektur BDA reconstructs a semi-detached house, preserving historical continuitya recessed gable creates spatial contrast within the compositionthe secondary structure extends towards the garden under a curved roof",
