  "text": "California governor Gavin Newsom and his wife, documentary filmmaker Jennifer Siebel Newsom, are the new owners of a $9.1 million Bay Area home, according to Robb Report. The outlet claims that the couple bought the Marin County property from Hyatt Hotels heir Daniel Pritzker, who originally listed the midcentury modern house for $11.5 million in 2023. At the time of Newsom’s purchase, the roughly 5,600-square-foot dwelling was priced at $8.5 million—meaning the governor ended up shelling out about $600,000 over the asking price.Nestled on a nearly one-acre plot about 20 miles north of San Francisco, the six-bedroom and six-bathroom manse boasts views of Mount Tamalpais through oversized windows and glass doors that spill out onto spacious balconies and patios. Verdant lawns, a fire pit, a swimming pool with an inset spa, and numerous spots to lounge or dine alfresco round out the outdoor amenities. A guest house is also located on the premises.The main residence dates back to 1948 and features wood siding, tiered flat roofing, and three levels of living space. An attached garage offers three parking spots. Dark hardwood floors unite the interior spaces, which include a sunken living room outfitted with a fireplace and a wet bar, a well-equipped kitchen with a massive marble-topped island, and a spacious primary suite that has a private balcony, a bespoke walk-in closet, and a serene ensuite bathroom—which is complete with a soaking tub, a sleek glass-walled shower, and a long double sink vanity. Floor-to-ceiling glass features heavily in the bedrooms, which all face the home’s lush backyard.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per monthArrowNewsom sold another Marin County home for $6 million in 2021.
