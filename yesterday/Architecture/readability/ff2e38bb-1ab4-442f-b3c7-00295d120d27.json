Originally constructed in 1922, the structure has long been a cultural emblem of Shanghai, now revitalized as an experiential retail space for optical brand Liangcai Wu.Drawing inspiration from mechanical eyeglasses with a traditional Chinese flair, the concept infuses this venerable ‘elder’ with a touch of contemporary playfulness. Along with a rich array of eyewear-related art installations, the space also incorporates flexible display cabinets and furniture, breaking through spatial constraints and opening up possibilities for future diverse transformations.all images by YUUUUNSTUDIOdayuan design merges retail and art installationsIn this building steeped in history — once a social hub for the city’s elite — Liangcai Wu, a brand with over 300 years of craftsmanship and tradition, has reshaped itself as a vibrant Liangcai Factory. This tangible scene of new productive power merges with the brand’s deep-rooted Chinese aesthetic, showcasing a vitality that’s uniquely its own. This curatorial retail space welcomes visitors with an air-shower art installation, gently blowing away any dust and creating the feeling of stepping into a sterile factory environment, and setting the tone for what the team at Dayuan Design calls the ‘Factory Journey.’To the right, the Thousand Mirrors installation composed of optical lenses creates dynamic light refractions that guide guests toward the atrium. Here, a conveyor belt showcases both Liangcai Wu’s latest products and its historical roots. Visitors are invited to explore at their own pace, moving clockwise for modern innovations and counterclockwise for displays of ancient grinding tools and vintage eyewear. The exhibition’s centerpiece, inspired by jade-carving workshops of the ancient Yangshao culture, pays homage to founder Wu Liangcai and his devotion to craftsmanship.via·1719 Wu Liangcai New Vision Fieldfusing art deco and local aesthetics with industrial elementsThroughout, the design employs a mix of fabric, wood, perforated metal, and scaffolding, blending Chinese aesthetics with industrial elements. This layered approach creates a flexible, modular display space capable of hosting various events and exhibitions, transitioning seamlessly between tea breaks, pop-up events, and lectures. Here, a highlight is the Project 1719 art installation, which simulates the visual experience of myopia.

Dayuan Design uses industrial pipes as light fixtures, with light flowing through the pipes to convey a dynamic sense of factory production. The lights, like electric currents, flow from outside into the entrance, drawing attention.
