Olivier Garcé and Clio Dimofski, however, chose a different route. The French couple, who are both life and business partners, met studying interior design in Paris and then together embarked on careers in the field. Today, they live and work side by side, and the Lisbon apartment they share with their kid and dog is also their showroom. The couple is creating their own path, making up the rules as they go. Garcé and Dimofski may be interior designers, but they’re also gallery owners who curate exhibitions, they design their own furniture collections, and they are intensely engaged with their artisan partners.After working with various firms at the beginnings of their careers, the two eventually went to New York where they were employed by the celebrated interior designer Pierre Yovanovitch. After learning from this master of the profession during a key period, they felt it was time to build something of their own. And thus came the decision to set up their own studio in Lisbon where the climate, the relaxed attitude toward life, and the local craft traditions all appealed to the couple. Their creative endeavors are rooted, after all, in the crafts.“We work closely with ceramists, carpenters, upholsterers, and metal, iron, and glass workers,” says Garcé. “Every project is a dialogue between us and them, which makes our aesthetic uniquely our own.” Among other collaborations, they designed the tiles made for their showroom apartment, which a young international couple happened to read about in AD Germany. That same couple reached out after they had decided to make Porto their main home and found a fantastic 5,400-square-foot town house that had extraordinary architectural details, but which had sat empty for a long time in part because of extensive water damage.The freshly restored street façade of the 1893 urban villa with its custard-colored bricks. The art- and design-loving couple were sure that Garcé \u0026 Dimofski would be the right firm to renovate and design the interiors of their home. “I think they liked that we had emphasized the preservation of historical interiors in our earlier Portugal projects,” says Dimofski. “And we then rounded out the spaces with our eclectic pieces.” The villa is located in the lively Cedofeita neighborhood, which is full of restaurants and shops sitting on charming, narrow alleys that are wonderful to explore on foot. Typical of houses in the area, the 1893 building is clad in granite and has an extended garden in the back. Unlike many houses in this part of Lisbon, however, the rooms are not long and narrow and instead have high ceilings and generous dimensions. Both the principal bedroom and the living room form almost perfect squares. “There’s a great sense of balance among the rooms here,” says Garcé. “We were able to play around a lot and easily find the right spot for each piece of furniture.”The bedroom with fireplace and finely paneled ceiling. The Monte bouclé armchair was designed by Garcé \u0026 Dimofski. Art: Ana Malta and Robert Janitz.Before the designers could start figuring out where to place furniture, however, the impressive town house had to be restored. The pair needed to seek out the right artisans who could return the elaborate plaster elements, decorative details, and wood paneling to their former glory. The unmistakable artistic influence of the Belgian architect and sculptor Paul Hankar is seen in the distinctive decorative elements. Hankar was an Art Nouveau innovator whose style is characterized by rich details and organic forms. The original decorative ornaments have been preserved in the staircase and a bronze female Art Nouveau nude still crowns it. In restoring all these historical elements, the pair chose plaster and wall colors so skillfully that you might assume things have always looked the way they do now.The furniture and works of art that the duo selected in close consultation with the owners are decidedly contemporary: “We introduce radical design elements into classic interiors,” say the designers. An aluminum armchair by Studio Haos has “a bold, striking aesthetic, while at the same time appearing soft and smooth with the special way that it reflects light,” explains Garcé. The armchair can be found in the office, which along with a library and the principal bedroom with its luxurious bathroom, is located on the second floor.The spacious dining room with a table by Studio Haos and Fred chairs by Garcé \u0026 Dimofski. Chair I and Chair II by Minjae Kim bracket the entrance. Garcé and Dimofski have created a home as timeless as it is contemporary, and true both to their clients’ vision and to its architectural roots. And with its ample first floor space, the villa provides a perfect setting to entertain guests. Spaces as well-designed as those in this town house definitely need to be shared.This story was originally published in AD Germany. It was translated by John Oseid.Art: Constanza Vallese.
