  "text": "a coastal restaurant for bali’s intaaya retreatDrawing from the organic form of a clam shell, Pablo Luna Studio completes a sculptural restaurant as a key feature of the Intaaya Retreat in Bali. The design-minded place is located on the cliffs of Diamond Beach, on Indonesia‘s island of Nusa Penida. With its expressive rooftop and bamboo construction, the structure exemplifies the studio’s architectural response to its natural surroundings, opening broadly toward the coastal landscape and maintaining a strong commitment to sustainability. Every aspect of the design and construction process reflects a focus on minimizing environmental impact, with an emphasis on utilizing locally sourced materials and adapting the building to the terrain.The design team demonstrates its dedication to environmental stewardship with the restaurant project — at the heart of the project is its self-sufficiency. The Intaaya Retreat is entirely self-sufficient in water, using a deep well and incorporating a comprehensive rainwater collection system. It also includes efficient water appliances and low-irrigation landscaping to reduce overall water consumption. A collaboration with the Biosphere Foundation resulted in Waste Water Gardens that treat wastewater on-site, reusing it for garden irrigation. The studio’s Sustainable Construction Plan ensured pollution prevention, erosion control, and effective waste management throughout the building process. Solar photovoltaic panels meet a significant portion of the energy needs, further reducing the retreat’s ecological footprint.images © Tommaso Rivapablo luna studio draws from its island contextWith the design of its Shell Restaurant at Bali’s Intaaya Retreat, the architects at Pablo Luna Studio draw inspiration directly from the surrounding ocean and marine life. The concept mirrors the forms of marine shells and the fluidity of waves, resulting in an organic structure that feels both protective and inviting. The curved bamboo roof echoes the shape of a shell, while thirteen bamboo trusses form the building’s structural backbone. The alternating heights of these trusses add to the dynamic visual appeal of the roof. Complemented by a hand-woven bamboo weave and wood shingles, the roof maintains the natural materiality that defines the entire design.The design of the Shell Restaurant prioritizes both aesthetics and functionality. At the front of the building, the bamboo trusses extend outward and are supported by steel pillars and tree-like columns made of paired bamboo poles. While this series of columns provides necessary structural support, it further allow natural light to filter into the space. The structure gradually expands in both vertical and horizontal directions as it approaches the front, creating a sense of openness and guiding visitors through the space.the Shell Restaurant is a key part of Intaaya Retreat on Bali’s Nusa Penida islanda rhythmic, flexible structureThe Shell Restaurant’s bamboo trusses enable an interior layout that is both open and flexible, which Pablo Luna Studio ensures is free from intermediate supports. This design choice optimizes the space for functionality while encouraging interaction between visitors and the surrounding natural environment. The tree-like columns, spaced along the front of the restaurant, establish a rhythmic architectural pattern that connects the structure to its natural surroundings. This thoughtful design is a reflection of the broader principles of Intaaya Retreat, where sustainable materials and innovative architectural strategies work together to harmonize the built environment with the natural landscape.Pablo Luna Studio was guided by the vision of connecting people with the natural world. ‘Our inspiration for creating this restaurant in Nusa Penida stemmed from the majestic giant clamshell,’ The studio notes, reflecting on the inspiration for the project. ‘This remarkable creature’s curvilinear exoskeleton, with its strong and rigid outer covering, acts as both a defense mechanism against predators and a secure anchor for its muscles and organs. In essence, it serves the dual purpose of protection and support. Our vision was to seamlessly blend individuals with the embracing embrace of the ocean, blurring boundaries and accentuating the profound connections that bind us all.’Pablo Luna Studio designs the restaurant to respond to its coastal landscapesustainability is a priority with local materials and minimal environmental impactthe design of the Shell Restaurant is inspired by marine shells and ocean waves",
