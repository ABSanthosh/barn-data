  "text": "Situated high above Newport Beach in Sydney, Australia, LA Cool is a outdoor living space that completes the original vision of Newport House, a 2015 project by Carter Williamson Architects. This addition transforms the property into a seamless blend of indoor and outdoor luxury, creating an environment that feels equally inviting throughout all seasons. Designed with a deep understanding of the coastal landscape and inspired by the sleek, understated elegance of Californian modernism, LA Cool celebrates natural beauty while enhancing functionality and comfort for year-round enjoyment. The project embodies the essence of indoor-outdoor living – a concept synonymous with the laid-back lifestyle of the Southern California coast. Drawing influence from iconic mid-century designs that emerged in Palm Springs and Los Angeles during the 1950s and 60s, the space adopts the philosophy of creating fluid transitions between indoor and outdoor areas. Just like the low-slung, minimalist pavilions that dotted the Californian landscape, LA Cool prioritizes openness, blurring the boundaries between home and nature. These iconic Californian designs, pioneered by architects such as Richard Neutra and Pierre Koenig, emphasized simple, geometric forms and expansive glass walls that dissolved the line between indoors and outdoors. Similarly, LA Cool channels this spirit with its open-plan design and expansive pavilion that invites the surrounding landscape into the living space. Positioned to maximize panoramic views of Newport Beach and Pittwater, the addition takes full advantage of its elevated position, offering breathtaking vistas that become an integral part of everyday life. The design pays homage to the principles of California modernism by embracing a minimalist aesthetic that prioritizes clean lines and simplicity. The pavilion’s low-profile structure allows it to sit unobtrusively within its coastal surroundings, ensuring the focus remains on the breathtaking 180-degree views that envelop the site. By using a pure, natural material palette that mirrors the existing Newport House, LA Cool maintains a balance between indoor and outdoor spaces, reinforcing a sense of cohesion. A hallmark of LA Cool is its adaptable pavilion, meticulously crafted to suit the ever-changing Australian climate. Unlike traditional outdoor spaces that are limited to summer use, this pavilion offers both covered and uncovered sections, ensuring it remains functional and comfortable regardless of the season. A series of strategically placed skylights punctuate the roof, flooding the space with natural light while maintaining a sense of openness and connection to the outdoors. Equipped with thoughtful amenities, LA Cool transforms outdoor living into a year-round experience. A cozy fireplace warms the pavilion during cooler months, creating an inviting atmosphere perfect for gathering with family and friends. Meanwhile, the fully equipped outdoor kitchen, complete with a woodfire pizza oven, encourages leisurely al fresco dining. The selection of materials, including natural stone, timber, and neutral hues, reflects a deep respect for the surrounding landscape. These elements echo the tactile qualities of California’s desert modernism while simultaneously celebrating the coastal textures and tones of Sydney’s Northern Beaches. The result is a space that feels effortlessly integrated into its environment, where every element has been carefully curated to enhance the experience of living by the sea. Drawing inspiration from the play of light and shadow in California’s desert homes, the design incorporates sculptural cut-outs in the pavilion’s western wall, allowing the golden hues of the evening sun to filter through the living space. This careful interplay of light creates a dynamic, ever-changing atmosphere that shifts with the time of day and the seasons.
