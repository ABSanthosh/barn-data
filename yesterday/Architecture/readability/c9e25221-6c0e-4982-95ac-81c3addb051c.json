  "text": "Es Devlin, renowned for her work in stage design and public sculpture, has been awarded the 2025 Eugene McDermott Award in the Arts at MIT. This honor celebrates innovative artists across various fields and interdisciplinary practices. In the past it has recognized the work of architects, composers, sculptors, and other creatives. Along with a $100,000 prize, Devlin will participate in an artist residency at MIT in spring 2025, culminating in a gala. The Eugene McDermott Award honors individuals whose artistic careers demonstrate the highest distinction. This award embodies MIT’s commitment to innovation, problem-solving, and fostering creative connections across disciplines.” Devlin’s work stands out because of its cross-disciplinary nature. The London-born artist and stage designer, has completed works for a range of settings and large-scale events, among these the traditional museum gallery and over-the-top global showcases. Installations and curated set design by Devlin have appeared at the Tate Modern, the United Nations General Assembly, and Lincoln Center, as well as in shows for the National Theatre, Olympic ceremonies, and Super Bowl. Through design, construction, and technology Devlin’s work continuously examines themes such as biodiversity, linguistic diversity, and artificial intelligence. Her work was recently the subject of a retrospective exhibition at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum in New York. “We look forward to presenting Es Devlin with MIT’s highest award in the arts. Her work will be an inspiration for our students studying the visual arts, theater, media, and design,” said MIT vice provost Philip S. Khoury in a statement. “Her interest in AI and the arts dovetails with a major initiative at MIT to address the societal impact of GenAI. With a new performing arts center opening this winter and a campus-wide arts festival taking place this spring, there could not be a better moment to expose MIT’s creative community to Es Devlin’s extraordinary artistic practice.” To support Devlin’s practice, the campus residency program—an integral part of the Eugene McDermott Award—will feature a public presentation of her work. This programming will include a lecture open to the public on May 1, 2025, as well as a gala gathering of prominent artists. Devlin joins a long list of creative individuals who have received the Eugene McDermott Award. They include visual artist Olafur Eliasson, architects Diller + Scofidio, I. M. Pei., and Thomas Heatherwick. Find out more information about the Eugene McDermott Award here.",
