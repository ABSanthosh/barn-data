  "text": "zayed national museum will open doors in december 2025The anticipated Zayed National Museum is set to open in December 2025 in the Saadiyat Cultural District, joining a growing network of landmark institutions such as the Louvre Abu Dhabi, teamLab Phenomena, and the upcoming Guggenheim Abu Dhabi. Designed by Foster + Partners, the museum anchors the island with a bold sculpted form that draws deeply from Emirati heritage while incorporating advanced sustainable technologies. The architecture is defined by five steel arching towers that rise above the galleries like falcon wings, a nod to the cultural importance of falconry in the UAE. Beyond this symbolism, each tower functions as a solar thermal chimney, drawing hot air out of the building through natural convection. Below, a landscaped garden traces a timeline of Sheikh Zayed’s life, while the main exhibition spaces are embedded within a gently contoured mound, abstracted from the topography of the Emirates. These six permanent pod-shaped galleries and a temporary exhibition space will present a comprehensive narrative of the UAE’s cultural, environmental, and social history.all images © Department of Culture and Tourism – Abu Dhabifoster + partners’ sculpted design at saadiyat Cultural DistrictCommissioned as a tribute to the UAE’s Founding Father, the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the UAE’s new national museum will be split across two levels, supported by a dynamic programme of exhibitions, public events, and research initiatives. Highlights of the collection will include artefacts from the UAE’s earliest human settlements, a rare ancient Magan Boat reconstruction, the Blue Quran manuscript, and the Abu Dhabi Pearl — believed to be one of the world’s oldest natural pearls. The museum builds on Sheikh Zayed’s vision and values to form part of a broader cultural strategy shared by its neighboring institutions on Saadiyat Island, home to one of the world’s densest clusters of cultural venues. Zayed National Museum’s permanent galleries will span archaeology, biodiversity, urban development, and Emirati traditions, drawing connections between local heritage and global narratives to celebrate the region’s identity. The collection also includes major archaeological finds dating back to the Palaeolithic era, including early irrigation systems and traces of Bronze Age copper mining, and these histories are presented alongside contemporary research and public programming, reflecting a commitment to making culture accessible across generations. With dedicated spaces for youth, senior citizens, and People of Determination, the museum seeks to foster inclusive engagement and shared learning.Zayed National Museum is set to open in December 2025Foster + Partners anchors Saadiyat Cultural District with a bold sculpted form",
