The name has been around since 1909, weaving up iconic woolen and jacquard designs first for Indigenous communities and later for the masses. But it’s a shame to only admire the final products of a textile company synonymous with so many interior spaces without knowing the history. To best understand Pendleton’s role in American textile history, it’s also important to take the time and space to dig into some of the controversies the brand has faced throughout its generations-long lifetime.To help paint the full picture of this heirloom brand, AD PRO is going deep into the history, community connection, and long-lasting inspiration Pendleton introduced to the world.Pendleton blankets lend themselves well to rustic and even industrial aesthetics, as evidenced in this modern hotel room. Peggy WongWhat is Pendleton?For the uninitiated, Pendleton is an American clothing and textile brand known for putting prints inspired by Native American design front and center. While the brand helped raise awareness of the art and culture of the American Southwest’s Indigenous communities, it also provided value back to the tribal communities, playing an important role in “trade blanket” culture. At the turn of the 20th century, the company produced textiles that were used to trade with the Indigenous communities. These blankets became important heirlooms, often used as gifts for important life moments.Pendleton is a Pacific Northwest–based business with hundreds of designs and patterns that span wool blankets, shirts, towels, socks, outerwear, and so much more (it is, in fact, possible to dress in head-to-toe Pendleton). The company is still serving up new designs, but the vintage trade blankets are highly sought after—the going rate for rare editions can creep toward $1,000 and well beyond. You can currently find examples of these high-dollar vintage designs on eBay (such as this Grand Canyon blanket, which dates back to the 1920s).A weaver at work in the Pendleton mill Bloomberg/Getty ImagesHistory of the Pendleton BlanketPendleton’s story begins in the early days of the American West, in Oregon, 1863, with a single weaver named Thomas Kay. Though the craft started to take form with him, it would be his daughter, Fannie, and her husband, C.P. Bishop, that elevated the weavings into a real business: The couple manifested their combined skills in wool manufacturing and specialty retail by opening a mill in Pendleton, Oregon, in 1909. Another mill followed three years later, in Washougal, Washington. Both are still in operation today, and you can request a Pendleton woolen mills tour to see the magic in person.Fannie and C.P.’s three sons went on to attend the Philadelphia Textile School and soon joined the business themselves. Blankets were the first goods they produced; men’s shirts trailed behind in 1924, and women’s styles emerged in 1949. The look caught on and stayed popular—Pendleton made its mark on Disneyland’s Frontierland with a store (Pendleton Dry Goods Mercantile) opening in 1955 and the Beach Boys donned matching Original Surf Plaid shirts on the cover of the “Surfer Girl” album in 1961. (Fun fact: The band was originally named the Pendletones after the brand—the shirts were popular surf attire at the time.)Pendleton earned its first loyal following among Indigenous communities—a fact that sets it apart from many other modern-day textile businesses.Pendleton and Indigenous CommunitiesThe relationship between the Pendleton company—specifically the Bishop family—and Native American communities began shortly after the business set up shop. At this time, trading posts dotted the American West, offering an opportunity for tribes to exchange their animal hides, textiles, and other handicrafts for food, living essentials, and the aforementioned trade blankets. Native Americans would wear Pendleton textiles to keep warm during cold nights, but the designs also served as signifiers of status. Pendleton blankets quickly became sought-after items for trading—due largely to their high-quality construction—and have since maintained their covetable role among Indigenous peoples as heirlooms.But it wasn’t a one-way conversation: The company enlisted people such as Joe Rawnsley, a British textile designer, to create work that would speak to this audience. Task in hand, he spent six months living in the Southwest in the early 1900s, specifically with the Hopi, Navajo, and Zuni people. During this time, he worked to understand and appreciate patterns and colors he saw adorning homes and clothing, eventually translating them into blanket designs. This immersion resulted in two iconic editions: the Chief Joseph and Harding blankets. Building on the brand’s early connection with Indigenous communities, the Pendleton Legendary Blanket Collection was introduced in 1976 to help tell Native American stories and celebrate symbols important to these communities with new designs.The brand has not come through the years without controversy. In 2013, Pendleton settled a claim that they violated the Indian Arts and Crafts Act, which ensures non-Natives can’t sell goods labeled with tribal names or market them as Native American–made. Specifically, this centered around the Sioux Star blanket, which was renamed the Plains Star blanket. In addition, Pendleton donated $41,000 to the Red Cloud Indian Heritage Center and did a bit of website redesigning to remove the Native American category and add a new section dedicated to designs made by Native American artists.Pendleton National Park BlanketsOne of the brand’s most successful collections has been the ongoing National Park series. First launched in 1916 with the Glacier National Park Blanket, each one of the 16 subsequent designs highlights one of the country’s great parks. Each edition has a color scheme and design elements that speak to unique aspects of each natural space. For example, the Zion National Park blanket, released in 2020, is made up of various stripes representing the rusty rock formations and the bright blue afternoon sky. Another favorite is the White Sands National Park blanket, which is made of 100% pure virgin wool and a blue-and-brown hued design inspired by the change in light as day heads into twilight over the sand and flora.Understandably, these have become collector's items and adoring fans anticipate new announcements.AD100 designer Ken Fulk used Pendleton blankets to form these game-room curtains at Instagram founder Kevin and Nicole Systrom’s Lake Tahoe home. Douglas FriedmanPendleton Blankets in Design TodayPendleton has been woven into the costumes of your favorite film stars (think The Dude’s full-zip Westerley Men’s Sweater in The Big Lebowski). Spend even a little bit of time scrolling through page after page of vintage Pendletons on Etsy and you’ll start noticing them everywhere. And you can certainly find them on the pages of AD: Take Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom’s home, for example—his Lake Tahoe manse has a game table surrounded by curtains made from vintage Pendleton blankets. Another creative use can be seen in this Aspen house, where the textiles serve as curtains for a set of bunk beds. Pendleton blankets have a place far outside the stretches of the home, as well. For example, glass artist Dale Chihuly’s “Blanket Cylinders” series was inspired by Pendleton and Indigenous textiles—a collection that he spent 20 years collecting blankets for.How to Find Vintage Pendleton BlanketsIt can be surprisingly tricky to figure out whether your Pendleton blanket is vintage or not—it’s about far more than finding examples that look old or worn in. The secret lies in the brand tag: Like most brands, Pendleton updated its branding from time to time, and the product tags reflect this. For example, they began using a “Woolmark” to highlight products made with 100% virgin wool around 1965, but stopped in 1994.Looking to pinpoint the age on that Pendleton blanket you scored at the flea market? Start with the tag. Bloomberg/Getty ImagesAside from the tags, the stitching can give you a clue. According to a blog on the Pendleton website, the company made the move from satin stitching to overstitched binding in the 1960s, with the color of the latter being stronger. Between 1994 and 2009, the typeface on the tags became a bit more streamlined and utilitarian in vibe, and a yellow box in the design was removed. The most recent change happened in 2009 when the name “Pendleton” was taken off its angle and the typeface got a slight modernization. The National Park blankets also feature fun Easter eggs on the tags, oftentimes featuring park-specific wildlife or flora.Keep in mind that many of the really popular designs have gone through periods of hibernation before being re-introduced. This can cause some confusion if you don’t know what to look for, but taking careful note of the product tag should let you know if you have a new or vintage Pendleton wool blanket. Whatever you do, don’t throw them in the washing machine—only the (newer) Pendleton Eco-Wise Wool designs are washable. When in doubt, bring it to the dry cleaner.",

The secret lies in the brand tag: Like most brands, Pendleton updated its branding from time to time, and the product tags reflect this. For example, they began using a “Woolmark” to highlight products made with 100% virgin wool around 1965, but stopped in 1994.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"GenericCallout\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cp\u003eLooking to pinpoint the age on that Pendleton blanket you scored at the flea market?

Between 1994 and 2009, the typeface on the tags became a bit more streamlined and utilitarian in vibe, and a yellow box in the design was removed. The most recent change happened in 2009 when the name “Pendleton” was taken off its angle and the typeface got a slight modernization. The National Park blankets also feature fun Easter eggs on the tags, oftentimes featuring park-specific wildlife or flora.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eKeep in mind that many of the really popular designs have gone through periods of hibernation before being re-introduced. This can cause some confusion if you don’t know what to look for, but taking careful note of the product tag should let you know if you have a new or vintage Pendleton wool blanket. Whatever you do, don’t throw them in the washing machine—only the (newer) Pendleton Eco-Wise Wool designs are washable. When in doubt, bring it to the dry cleaner.\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
