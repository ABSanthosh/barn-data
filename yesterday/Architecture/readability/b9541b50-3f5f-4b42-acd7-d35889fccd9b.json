  "text": "Traveling by train may seem like a thing of the past, but Belmond is singlehandedly keeping luxury sleeper train experiences alive. The Britannic Explorer, the first luxury sleeper train in England and Wales, is next in its very stylish lineup. (Earlier this fall, Belmond unveiled its L’Observatoire Suite—conceived by artist JR, the experience spans across an entire car of the Venice Simplon-Orient-Express.) The Britannic Explorer will begin operating in July 2025, offering three-night journeys departing from London. Itineraries include Wales, Cornwall, and the Lake District. On board, there will be a bar serving curated cocktails with botanical influences and 18 cabins—three spacious grand suites and 15 other suites, all designed by the London studio Albion Nord.The double suite cabins, pictured above, reflect British landscapes through a mossy color scheme. The suites have a double bed set-up with an en-suite bathroom. The bespoke decor is inspired by visions of landscapes that travelers may encounter on their journey, with mythological frescoes, striped walls, and floral motifs common to much of the furniture. Just as the interiors are an invitation to escape from our daily lives, equally transportive are the dishes created by chef Simon Rogan, whose restaurants around the world have racked up eight Michelin stars. An early leader of the farm-to-table movement in the UK, he has embraced the challenge of developing recipes that both highlight local ingredients and have to be prepared in small kitchens. Regarding an ideal luxury sleeper train menu, he explains: “For me, true luxury lies in humble ingredients, grown with care and respect for their surroundings, and harvested at their peak. I am very excited to bring this approach to the launch of the Britannic Explorer, where each plate will reflect Britain’s diverse landscapes. I hope every passenger not only enjoys the flavors but also feels a connection between the dishes and the journey, making their time on board truly memorable.”In addition to the aforementioned cocktail bar inspired by the world of Victorian apothecaries, passengers will be able to enjoy spa treatments on board. Fittingly, afternoon tea service is provided as well. Each menu is tailored with regional ingredients to the route travelled on—from mint cake on Lake District routes to the classic Welsh Bara Brith. While we’ll have to wait until next summer to discover all of the details of the Britannic Explorer, it promises to be one of the most beautiful sleeper trains in the world.Fares for the Britannic Explorer start from $6,000 per person, or $11,500 for a double suite. The price includes a three-night itinerary, excursions, as well as meals and wines and alcoholic beverages on board.The blues of the twin suites reflect British shores, and feature twin beds, ceramic shelving, an en-suite bathroom, and a fold-out work area.
