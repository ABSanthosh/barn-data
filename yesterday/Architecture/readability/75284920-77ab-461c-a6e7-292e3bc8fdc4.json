  "text": "Gensler and SWA Group are among the architecture studios that have completed a 142-hectare Walmart headquarters in Bentonville, Arkansas that includes mass-timber office buildings and two artificial lakes. The Home Office campus includes over 30 buildings, including parking garages, shops, a hotel and a fitness distributed across a sprawling campus designed by landscape architect SWA Group to reflect the local Arkansas environment. Walmart has opened a new HQ in Bentonville designed by Gensler, SWA and othersWalmart announced last year it would be relocating its remote office staff to the Bentonville, Arkansas headquarters, where the brand was founded in 1962. Gensler was tasked with the overall campus design and its twelve office buildings, while architecture studios such as Duda|Paine Architect and Page designed the on-site Walton Family Whole Health \u0026 Fitness centre and a childcare facility, respectively. The campus contains more than 30 buildings across 142 hectaresThe numerous buildings are grouped closely together, interlaced with walking paths and pedestrian bridges. Courtyards sit between some, while a large amphitheatre is located at the \"heart\" of the campus. On either end of the campus, two large water bodies capture stormwater for irrigation, while a thin stream snakes through a far corner. The south lake, the larger of the two, is located in a large greenspace, while the north lake sits in front of the fitness centre. Its landscape design reflects Arkansas's native topology. The photo is courtesy of WalmartAccording to Gensler, the campus was organised into four distinct quads or \"neighbourhoods\", a core tenant of Walmart's desire to create a headquarters that prioritized responsibility to staff, neighbours, and the land. \"A neighbourhood planning approach arranges the site into four distinct quads that evolved naturally from site configuration, land typology, and internal roads,\" said Gensler principal Johnny Kousparis. \"Each quad has a unique identity that shapes its landscape, building expression, and experience.\" The campus was divided into \"neighborhoods\"However, certain similarities can be found throughout the project. All buildings were kept to four or five stories to \"reinforce the human-centric scale and community-minded atmosphere\", and primary materials include brick, glass and metal panel exteriors and interiors made of concrete, metal, wood and tile. A mass timber structure was used throughout many of the buildings1.5 million cubic feet of locally fabricated mass timber was also used to construct the buildings' structures as part of an overall commitment to sustainability. \"Walmart's new Home Office is an expression of their culture, values, and identity, which also lies at the heart of their decision to use mass timber at an unprecedented scale across their campus,\" said Kousparis. This resulted in a 15 per cent reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional materials, according to the team. Additional sustainable design strategies include biophilic design, natural ventilation systems and a kit-of-parts building strategy to speed up construction and reduce cost. Employees will be relocated to the new headquarters throughout 2025. The photo is courtesy of WalmartEmployees are also highly encouraged to connect with the campus's landscape, a swath of greenspace with 115 acres of native and adapted plantings, trees and walking paths that connect to surrounding Bentonville. \"The main planning principles influencing campus design were ecological sensitivity, mobility, and community orientation,\" said SWA Associate principal Jana Wehby. It features amenities such as a fitness centre. The photo is courtesy of WalmartAccording to Walmart, parts of the campus are now open, including its fitness centre, and some employees have begun the transition to the new headquarters. The campus will eventually serve 15,000 employees in total, with the campus opening in phases over 2025. \"This isn't just a workplace; it's a nod to our proud past and our bright future, sparking innovation and community,\" said Walmart Corporate real estate senior vice president Cindi Marsiglio \"It's a world-class campus, Walmart-style.\" The retailer also recently unveiled a new logo and branding.
