  "text": "Looks like it’s “About Damn Time” for Lizzo to move on from her modern 90210 pad. The Grammy-winning musician has put her Beverly Hills property on the market for $15.99 million, per Mansion Global. The news comes after she reportedly scooped up Jeremy Renner’s renovated Los Angeles home in October for $12.4 million.The “Truth Hurts” singer initially purchased the Beverly Hills mansion in 2022 for $15 million. Her friend, singer Harry Styles, resided at the same address from 2014 to 2016 before Sam Gnatovich and Alexi Rennalls of SIMO design bought and demolished the original home. The duo upgraded the estate into a luxury treehouse-inspired structure dubbed Oak Pass. After the project was completed in 2019, the couple offloaded the property for $11 million to Warner Records CEO Aaron Bay-Schuck, who sold it to Lizzo three years later.The Oak Pass abode—frequently featured in Lizzo’s Instagram posts—spans 5,400 square feet on a .32-acre lot. The contemporary sanctuary is tucked away in a gated enclave and is described as a “rare synergy of architecture and nature,” in the home’s official listing on Carolwood Estates’s website. True to that description, the L-shaped dwelling does appear to integrate natural elements into its exteriors to achieve a zen-like atmosphere, from wooden panels to floor-to-ceiling glass windows. It also features a two-story atrium, a suspended garden, and terraces that boast panoramic views of the backyard, the nearby canyons, and surrounding mountains.Join NowHoliday Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowThe home hosts three bedrooms and five bathrooms, with the primary suite situated above a saltwater infinity pool and two guest bedrooms sitting under the canopy of a century-old oak tree. Highlights include a formal dining room and a dual-sided fireplace that separates the kitchen and open living room. The property also features an abundance of luxury amenities including a gym, a private studio-slash-office, and a movie theater.",
