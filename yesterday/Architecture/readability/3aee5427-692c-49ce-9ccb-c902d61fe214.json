  "text": "Final Roof Panel Installed on Sydney Fish MarketThe new Sydney Fish Market by 3XN Architects, BVN, and Aspect Studio has reached a major milestone with the completion of its 200-meter-long floating roof canopy. Designed in collaboration with BVN, the sculptural roof is expected to redefine Australian city’s skyline, much like the Opera House did in 1973. With the completion of the fish market’s roof, the project shifts its focus from structural elements to internal finishes.The monumental rooftop is designed to resemble the texture of fish scales with its rhythmic patterning and organic surface. A supporting framework consists of 594 timber beams, some extending up to 32 meters in length, completed in December 2024. The final phase of roofing includes waterproofing, scheduled to be completed in the coming weeks.image © Multiplex ConstructionMassive Roof Structure of over 400 panelsDesigned by Danish practice 3XN Architects in association with BVN and landscape architects Aspect Studio, the Sydney Fish Market features a newly completed roof incorporating over 400 panels. Together, these contribute to a total weight of 2,500 tonnes. This significant engineering feat underscores the project’s complexity and scale. The proposal was first unveiled in June 2017 before the rooftop design was revised in November 2018 to its current iteration.Since the construction of the Sydney Fish Market began, the project has provided a substantial boost to the local economy. Delivery partner Multiplex has awarded over $670 million in contracts to Australian suppliers, covering services such as maritime piling, steel reinforcement, and the installation of roof cassettes.the Sydney Fish Market’s new roof designed by 3XN is now complete | image © Multiplex Construction3xn architects transforms Blackwattle BayThe new Sydney Fish Market, designed by 3XN, will feature an expansive retail and dining space, including a fresh seafood market, restaurants, and a seafood school. This development is set to enhance Sydney’s global reputation as a premier seafood destination, attracting both residents and tourists. The Sydney Fish Market is a cornerstone of the broader Blackwattle Bay redevelopment. The project will create a connected waterfront promenade linking Rozelle Bay to Woolloomooloo, introduce 1,100 new homes on the former fish market site, and provide over 6,000 square meters of public space. These improvements will enhance pedestrian and cycling infrastructure along the bay.NSW Premier Chris Minns emphasized the significance of the project, stating, ‘The revamped market will be truly spectacular, offering world-class, authentic seafood for an expected 6 million annual local and international visitors — ensuring it remains one of the most popular tourist destinations on offer in our harbour city.’the 200-meter-long floating roof canopy marks a major construction milestone | image © Multiplex Constructionstructural work is finished and internal finishes are now the focus | image © Multiplex Constructionthe roof consists of 594 timber beams with some reaching 32 meters in length | image © Multiplex Construction",
