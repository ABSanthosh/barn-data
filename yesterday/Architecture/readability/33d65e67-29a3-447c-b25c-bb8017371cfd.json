  "text": "muka arquitectura’s Casa Roble integrates two existing oak treesCasa Roble by muka arquitectura is designed in response to its natural surroundings, integrating two existing oak trees and the Pedrezuela Reservoir, Madrid, into its spatial configuration. The structure adapts to these elements through distinct facade treatments: a compressed, single-height access on the south side and a double-height glazed facade on the north. The internal layout follows an ascending spiral, transitioning from social to private spaces while maximizing natural light penetration. The use of concrete and a double structural skin establishes continuity between interior and exterior spaces, maintaining a restrained and functional aesthetic.The placement of the house is determined by three pre-existing elements: the oak trees, a sheet of water, and the horizon. These features influence the building’s geometry, shaping its response to the landscape. On the south facade, the entrance is designed as a continuous curve that adapts to the terrain. In contrast, the north facade incorporates a double-height glass opening where the presence of an oak tree redirects the structure inward, creating a slight inflection in the building’s form. The design establishes a dialogue between the pre-existing natural environment and the built intervention, emphasizing its integration with the site.all images by Adrià Goulamuka arquitectura shapes interior sequence of floating levelsThe north facade is oriented toward the Pedrezuela Reservoir, framing views and accommodating the site’s natural slope. The architectural team organizes a diagonal spatial arrangement to ensure light distribution across all levels, reinforcing the relationship between the house and its environment. A concrete framework allows flexibility in the placement of structural supports, shaping an interior sequence of floating levels. These levels create a spatial transition from communal to private areas, following an ascending circulation path that connects reception areas, a study gallery, shower and bathtub zones, bedroom, and walk-in closet.A double structural skin, composed of concrete with integrated insulation, enhances thermal performance while maintaining a cohesive material language. This construction method minimizes the distinction between structure, enclosure, and interior finishes, incorporating essential systems within the concrete framework. The material’s inherent qualities contribute to the residence’s restrained and durable character, emphasizing a design approach that prioritizes spatial efficiency and long-term adaptability.Casa Roble by Muka Arquitectura integrates with its natural surroundingsthe residence is designed around two oak trees and views of the Pedrezuela Reservoirdistinct facade treatments respond to the site’s topography and orientation",
