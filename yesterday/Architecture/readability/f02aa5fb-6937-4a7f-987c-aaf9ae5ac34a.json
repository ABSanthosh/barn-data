  "text": "the tradition cabin reimagined in valle de bravoLocated in the dense forest of San Simón el Alto, just 2.5 hours from Mexico City, San Simón House by Vasconcelos Arquitectura reinterprets the traditional timber cabin as a modern family retreat. Situated on a 10,000 square-meter plot surrounded by towering trees, the project is designed to offer an escape from urban life while encouraging a deep connection with nature and family.The design of the house prioritizes adaptation to the existing environment rather than imposing upon it. Every tree on the site was preserved, and twelve additional species were planted to enhance the local ecosystem. Positioned to be invisible from both the street and neighboring properties, the house provides complete privacy and an immersive experience in nature.Vasconcelos Arquitectura’s San Simón house is a modern family retreat in the forest | image © Camila CossíoVasconcelos Arquitectura’s modular san simón houseThe San Simón house consists of two main volumes, which the architects at Vasconcelos Arquitectura design to separate public and private spaces. These volumes are connected by a hallway and transparent staircases that maximize views of the surrounding landscape. Its central placement within the site allows for panoramic forest views, reinforcing the idea that nature is the dominant element of the space.Each room is designed to open directly to the forest, with large windows framing the views like works of art. The use of natural materials — wood and stone — establishes a raw yet refined aesthetic. All materials were sourced within Mexico, chosen for their ability to age gracefully over time. The modular structure, with proportions ranging from 1 to 18 feet, ensures flexibility and adaptability to the family’s evolving needs.A covered terrace at the front of the house functions as an outdoor living and dining area, complemented by a heated pool. Elevated on a concrete platform supported by columns, the house minimizes environmental impact by allowing water, flora, and fauna to flow freely beneath it. Its southwest orientation maximizes natural light while leveraging the surrounding trees to provide shade in the afternoon.the home consists of two main volumes connected by transparent staircases | image © Fabian Martinezinteriors curated with local mexican artworkThe interior of Vasconcelos Arquitectura’s San Simón house is curated by design studio Espacio Tangible to be both functional and child-friendly, allowing for freedom of movement and play. Ninety percent of the furniture was made in Mexico in collaboration with local artisans. Rugs were handwoven in Oaxaca using the pre-Hispanic ‘telar de cintura’ weaving technique, while custom carpentry was crafted in a workshop in nearby Toluca. The design reflects the family’s lifestyle, with elements tailored to their preferences, such as personalized color schemes in the daughters’ room and custom furniture in the sons’ space to promote reading and imaginative play.Handcrafted pieces and artwork by emerging Mexican artists, including Diego Ascencio, are integrated throughout the home, adding layers of cultural authenticity. Each element contributes to a narrative that reflects the personal story of the inhabitants.all existing trees on the site have been preserved | image © Fabian Martinez90% of the furniture was crafted in Mexico in collaboration with artisans and carpenters | image © Fabian Martinezthe structure is elevated on columns to minimize impact and maintain natural water flow | image © Camila Cossío",
