  "text": "Hengqin Culture \u0026 Art Complex: A Focal Point for the areaThe Hengqin Culture \u0026 Art Complex, designed by Yunchao Xu/Atelier Apeiron, now stands as a new cultural landmark in one of China‘s fastest-growing regions. Located in Hengqin, Zhuhai, the complex is poised to become a vital center for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area.The project marks a significant milestone in the broader development of Hengqin Island, an area that has seen rapid urban growth over the past decade. Positioned strategically at the crossroads of the Pearl River and South China, Hengqin has attracted billions in investment and is emerging as a hub for culture, creativity, and knowledge industries. The complex sits at the heart of this development, reinforcing the island’s role as a cultural beacon. See designboom’s previous coverage here!Innovative Responses to Complex ChallengesYunchao Xu/Atelier Apeiron won a competition to design the Hengqin Culture \u0026 Art Complex in 2018. The firm‘s vision for the nine-block development focused on creating a cohesive yet flexible structure. The project aimed to integrate nine independent functions into a unified complex, accommodating the varied and sometimes conflicting needs of each department while maintaining the energy of a public space.Designing the Hengqin Culture \u0026 Art Complex presented several challenges, including the region’s susceptibility to typhoons. To address this, the architects selected a lightweight, flexible suspended glass curtain wall to withstand high winds. What’s more, the complex’s foundations required special attention due to the island’s silt layer, leading to the creation of a sealed basement with anchor points to ensure structural stability.the Hengqin Culture \u0026 Art Complex is a new cultural center in ChinaA Diversity of AtmospheresThe Hengqin Culture \u0026 Art Complex sits between residential towers and a city park, with Atelier Apeiron designing the structure to reflect openness and flexibility. The building takes shape with three large arches, each with a unique shape and function, which serve as gateways to different halls within the complex. These arches allow natural light to flow into the space, aided by skylights and reflective materials that distribute sunlight throughout.Nine distinct functions are housed within the complex, including a library, archives center, concert hall, art gallery, and several activity centers. The design divides these functions into three main ‘urban living rooms’: the Knowledge Hall, Performance Hall, and Exhibition Hall. Each space is designed to provide a unique experience while fostering a communal atmosphere. The Knowledge Hall, inspired by Finland’s Oodi library, features vertical stacks of books, while the Performance Hall and Exhibition Hall offer spaces for arts, culture, and scientific exhibitions.three large arches act as gateways to different halls, allowing natural light to enter the spaceit is located on Hengqin Island, a developing area between the Pearl River and South ChinaYunchao Xu/Atelier Apeiron designed the complex after winning a 2018 competition",
