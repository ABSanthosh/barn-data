  "text": "opened for the third time at New York’s hudson yardsNow open once more with a steel net covering, New York City‘s 150-foot, honeycomb-like structure, the Vessel, was designed by Heatherwick Studio, and has been a point of controversy since its debut in March 2019. Its ‘alien’ form has been met with mixed reactions, at once being described as Escher-esque with its dizzying maze of stairs, and being likened to a larger-than-life shawarma. Thomas Heatherwick intended for the place to be a public climbing experience, inviting visitors to ascend more than 2,500 steps to experience a spiraling, ever-changing view of the city.In a short film released upon the project’s opening, Heatherwick described it as an amphitheater for the people, and revisited precedents including the complex stepwells of India with their criss-crossing stairways. Regardless of its varied critiques by New Yorkers, the intricate network of staircases and landings quickly became a popular tourist destination in the growing neighborhood.images © Paul Clemence / ARCHI-PHOTONew photographs captured by paul clemenceIt wasn’t aesthetic qualms which caused the Vessel’s closings. Four young people under the age of twenty-five have committed suicide from the Vessel during its short run. This time around, Hudson Yards developer Related Companies is even more optimistic as physical safety barriers have been put in place — a measure encouraged by the community in the past. According to a spokesperson for the developer, these barriers include ‘cut-resistant’ steel-mesh nets on ‘several’ of its twisting stairways and platforms. The structure’s top level has been closed to visitors. Architectural photographer Paul Clemence has climbed the honeycomb structure to capture views inside the newly netted landmark.‘I was curious to see how that solution looked in person, how it affected the design. The net itself is quite subtle, and its perception depends a lot on the light,’ comments photographer Paul Clemence, describing his impressions of the new safety measure. ‘But the structure supporting it I feel interferes a bit with the design. Not all of the Vessel features the net, but the areas without it are now no longer accessible to the public. It’s shame, but at least it is a solution for visitors to enjoy the Vessel experience safely.’the Vessel in new york city reopened with new steel net safety barriersthe vessel’s timelineUnfortunately the Vessel’s open design by Heatherwick Studio presented safety challenges in New York before it was draped in its new steel net. In January 2021, the structure was closed after a third suicide in less than a year. It reopened in May 2021 with new measures in place to deter self-harm attempts — this meant that visitors to New York’s Hudson Yards were only be permitted in pairs or groups in a bid to increase safety. Notably, after months of consultation with experts, developers had decided against raising the height of the barriers. Although solo visits were banned, it was a teen visiting with his family that became the fourth to commit suicide. Thus, these measures proved insufficient and the Vessel was closed again in August 2021. At last, the landmark reopened for the third time on Monday, October 21st, 2024.designed by Heatherwick Studio, it has been both celebrated and criticized since 2019now wrapped in steel netThe news of the Vessel’s reopening in New York, even with its new wrapping, has been met with mixed reactions. Some are hopeful that the new safety measures will ensure that it will remain an enjoyable experience, secure for all visitors. Others remain concerned about the ethics of reopening a structure that has been associated with multiple suicides.Chair of the Manhattan community board Jessica Chait comments: ‘While we think it took Related four lives too many to make these physical adjustments, these are the changes we requested, which will allow for prioritizing the safety of everyone who visits the Vessel.‘Of course, the Vessel is not unique. It’s important to remember that suicide can occur at any place. This attraction is just one example of a high place that has been involved in suicides. Bridges and tall buildings are also unfortunately common locations, which generally can not be closed to the public. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that approximately 1,660 deaths by suicide occurred in New York State in 2021.the structure’s intricate stairs and height offer changing views, but have posed safety risksthe Vessel faced multiple closures due to suicides, leading to calls for improved safety",
