In a shocking and disheartening turn of events, the African-American owner of a local construction company finds himself and his company on the brink of forced closure because of racial discrimination by the structural engineer. — ENR A $40 million federal lawsuit has been filed against Thornton Tomasetti, the structural engineering firm overseeing the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago. The suit, brought by II in One Concrete, a Black-owned subcontractor, claims that the firm imposed excessive and non-standard scrutiny on their work, resulting in severe financial strain. II in One owner Robert McGee argues that his company was unfairly targeted while non-minority-owned subcontractors faced fewer obstacles. Thornton Tomasetti denies the allegations, pointing to documented construction issues as the reason for additional oversight. The Obama Foundation has stated that they see no evidence of racial discrimination. The case adds to ongoing conversations about equity and inclusion in large-scale public projects.",
