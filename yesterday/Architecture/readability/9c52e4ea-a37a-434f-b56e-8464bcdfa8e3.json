As technology, digital solutions and artificial intelligence continue to reshape the AEC sector, a unique event like RELEASE [AEC] is more essential than ever. The inaugural edition will be held in Paris on November 17, 2025. The event is 100% free for AEC practitioners: register today! A multinational 250-person interior design firm I worked with (let’s call them ‘Designers Inc.’) saved $4.5 million USD by implementing a firm-wide AI solution. Designers Inc. has offices all around the world and has followed my 9-step AI roadmap, which I will now outline later in this article. It can be utilized by any AEC firm to ensure the success of their own AI implementation. But first, a little background on the implementation plan that I developed… Our story starts when the firm’s CEO returned from a few tech conferences in early 2024. He was tired of answering “We’re looking into it” whenever investors asked what the firm was doing about artificial intelligence. He handed his IT Director a single-line brief: figure out AI, fast. The IT Director’s role, hence, evolved from managing licenses and securing servers to overseeing the entire firm’s AI implementation. Soon after he began researching online for solutions, he felt incredibly overwhelmed by the number of AI apps available, which discouraged him from making a choice due to the numerous questions and uncertainty associated with them. Luckily, his research led him to take my flagship course, Mastering AI in AEC, which covers over 150 AI use cases and teaches advanced methods for implementing AI. The IT Director knew he had struck gold by taking the course and decided to reach out directly to me to ask for further help. Unlike most firms that believe ‘they can do a full-scale AI implementation with internal talent’, Designers Inc. realized that they need an AI expert to guide them on their way, so they can spend more time serving their own clients and less time on wondering if the AI they’re implementing is the best out there and eliminating some typical downfalls from the get-go. After meeting the IT Director and the CEO, we agreed that I’d visit their headquarters in Dubai for an ‘AI Implementation Week’, filled with AI exploration, training, and creating a practical step-by-step plan for Designers Inc. Our goal was to develop a practical AI Implementation Plan for all their offices. Still, the reality was about to kick in. Upon arriving in Dubai, I realized the firm has the following problems: After all, the firm designs stores, restaurants, hotels, and more all around the world, so there isn’t a ‘one-size-fits-all’ AI app (besides ChatGPT Team) that could help all their teams at once. On the first day of our AI Implementation Week, the firm’s staff had dozens of questions about AI implementation, stemming from what they had heard in the news or seen on social media. These are some of the questions they were asking: Typically rooted in fear and uncertainty, most AEC firms are asking the same or similar questions. One of the crucial steps we took was having the CEO reassure the staff before my arrival that the goal of AI implementation was not to replace anyone, but to make their jobs easier. Your First Step Starts Now: The 9 Steps That Changed Everything Today, 6 months after we started working together, they complete projects faster than ever before. They’re not working longer hours. They didn’t hire an army of new people. They don’t add software to their tech stack based on trends. They just learned to work with AI instead of against it. But just a few months earlier, they were drowning in tedious tasks, having all the described problems, and were feeling overwhelmed by AI. My firm and I helped Designers Inc. transition to a technology-optimized firm, using our 9-step process that any AEC firm can follow: Step 1: AI Education First, we ran short and friendly sessions about AI. We told real stories about how AI helps save hours on tedious tasks. This made everyone feel less scared and more curious. The fact I loved most about the whole week is that the CEO led by example – he sat beside me the entire time, learning as much as he could about AI. Step 2: Tech Stack Assessment We didn’t guess. We spent time watching how teams actually worked. We asked questions like, “Where do you get stuck?” and “What slows you down?” The main exercise was to map out their current software and identify ways to optimize existing technology first. Step 3: Process Mapping Instead of adding AI randomly, we drew each step of their daily work. We identified areas where AI can perform tasks more efficiently and deliver high-quality outcomes. Our primary focus was asking about people’s headaches and time thieves – functions that are either annoying to do or that take more time than they should. Step 4: Pain-Point Identification We didn’t try to fix everything at once. We picked a few tasks that annoyed people the most. We asked team members who were excited about AI to test the tools first. These AI Champions helped teach others and made change easier. We used the HotBet framework, taught within my courses, to outline quick wins to get the ball rolling. Step 5: App Testing and Evaluation We let teams test different AI tools to see what really worked. Soon, people stopped asking, “How do I finish this task?” and started asking, “How can AI do most of this so I can focus on the important parts?” Step 6: AI Implementation Plan Once tools proved useful, we changed our old ways of working. Tasks such as transcribing feedback or checking PDFs have become automated. Work that used to take days now takes only hours. We then developed a clear plan to utilize AI daily. Step 7: ROI Analysis We checked how much time, money, and effort they saved. People felt happier because they spent more time designing and less time doing tedious work. Here’s a simple ROI measurement approach: Time-Tracking Pilots: Have pilot teams log hours spent “before” vs. “after” AI adoption on critical tasks (Drawing tagging, QA model audits, etc.) Software Cost vs. Savings: Compare any newly introduced AI tool’s subscription fee vs. labor savings or replaced license fees. Avoided Overtime/New Hires: If specific tasks that used to require overtime or new hires are now handled faster, factor that into ROI. Here are the results and math: 10 hours/employee saved × 45 weeks a year = 450 hours saved a year (per employee). Now, calculate that for 100 employees paid $100 per hour. That’s $4,500,000 saved in a single year. Even beyond the numbers, the team started doing their best work and enjoying it. Step 8: New Tech Stack Proposal After small teams achieved success, we shared AI tools with the entire company and even created a knowledge-sharing hub for the entire firm. Because they saw real results, everyone wanted to use the AI tools, and change began to spread faster. Step 9: Digital Transformation Continuation Finally, we set up training sessions and regular check-ins to keep the AI system running smoothly. This way, AI didn’t fade away after the first excitement. It became a regular part of their work. The journey we’re on is currently 6 months long, but the firm knows that the ‘complete AI implementation’ may take 2–3 years, depending on their workload and the development of AI. The key is to get on board early; the sooner you start, the greater the long-term advantage. Your First Step Starts Now Maybe you’re thinking, “That’s great, Stjepan, but my firm is different. We’re smaller. We’re not like them. We’re too busy. We don’t have tech people.” I’ve heard every excuse. The firms that succeed with AI aren’t the ones with the most resources. It’s the ones who take a step back to examine their workflows from a distance and put them back together with AI. So if I should suggest anything, it’s to look at your next project and ask: What part makes you annoyed just thinking about it? What process eats up time but doesn’t require creativity? What would you do with an extra 10-12 hours each week? Start there. Pick one small thing. Try one AI tool. Ask a “why” question. This is how you implement AI the right way. (I’d like you to please reach out if you need any help.)
