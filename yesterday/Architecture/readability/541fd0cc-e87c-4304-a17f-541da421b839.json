  "text": "atelier boter carves sunken circular room in Taiwanese schoolIn response to the request of a school in Pingtung, Taiwan, for a space where children can slow down and reconnect with themselves, Atelier Boter introduces À Raum, a sunken, circular room intended for stillness and introspection. Completed within a school that promotes learning through movement, the project offers a spatial pause that aims to support presence, calm, and reflection, without being a classroom or a corridor.The design introduces a soft asymmetry, with the circular room slightly offset to form a gentle arc that naturally guides entry. A curved curtain follows this line, turning the simple act of entering into a quiet ritual. At the center, a square platform is recessed into the floor, creating a gathering place defined by presence, where children are free to sit, lie down, or gather.images courtesy of Atelier BoterÀ Raum allows for solitude by holding spacePingtung-based Atelier Boter surrounds this central square with deep-set window alcoves, shaped as a small personal retreat. These nooks allow for solitude without full separation so that kids can be alone while still feeling connected to the group.
