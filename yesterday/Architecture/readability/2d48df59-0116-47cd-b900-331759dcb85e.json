Image via Cranbrook Center for Collection and Research The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation has entered into a partnership with Victory Cruise Lines to launch educational programming of Wright’s projects close to the Great Lakes. The series, taking place on board the cruise line’s ships, will encompass buildings across Chicago, Detroit, and Grand Rapids, and include discussions on Wright’s approach, life, and principles. In addition to on-board experiences, the operator will host three shore excursions to visit buildings by Wright. The operator’s Chicago tour will include visits to the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, while the Detroit tour will include a visit to the Cranbrook Center for Collections and Research which oversees Wright’s Smith House. The Grand Rapids tour will include a visit to the architect’s Amberg House. “Frank Lloyd Wright left a beautiful legacy of architectural marvels across the Great Lakes, including two sites on the UNESCO World Heritage List and our guests will appreciate exploring his vision through his designs and learning so much along the way,” Victory Cruise Lines founder John Waggoner said about the partnerships. “We know learning is a priority of Victory Cruise Lines guests and this partnership with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation offers opportunities to participate in onboard enrichment programs created and presented by Taliesin Institute.”",
