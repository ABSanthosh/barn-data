  "text": "jahn/’s State-of-the-Art Hub for Preserving Military HistoryJahn/ has completed the Pritzker Military Archives Center, a state-of-the-art facility designed to house and expand the collections of the Pritzker Military Museum \u0026 Library. Relocated from Chicago to Somers, a village in Kenosha County, about 30 miles outside of Milwaukee, the 15,000-square-foot facility features exhibition space and below-grade archival storage, providing an immersive museum experience for Wisconsin visitors and residents alike. The center supports the organization’s mission to enhance public understanding of military history, celebrate the role of citizen-soldiers, and strengthen the connection between the armed forces and the people they protect. ‘We are proud to have been part of the collaborative team that brought our client’s vision for the Pritzker Military Archives Center to life,’ said Evan Jahn, President of Jahn. ‘From start to finish, our design has been shaped and informed by our shared commitment to the center’s mission of learning from past conflicts so we can help prevent future ones.’the cantilevered roof frames an outdoor exhibit space | all images by ©Tom Rossitersteel and high-performance glass wrap Pritzker Archives CenterThe Pritzker Military Archives Center employs a 36-foot structural grid system where 390-foot trusses act as bearing walls, providing roof support and lateral stability. The cantilevered roof frames an outdoor exhibit space, creating an open and inviting presence that stands out in the landscape. The elevated roof and expansive interior maximize both functional efficiency and visual impact, providing optimal working conditions for staff and an inspiring environment for visitors. The structure’s design, inspired by World War II landing craft, features a bright red steel frame symbolizing courage and is clad in high-performance glass.Inside, a partial-height glass partition allows the public to observe the work of curators and archivists, offering a rare view into the preservation of military history. Spanning 17.5 acres, the grounds of the Pritzker Military Archives Center reflect a deep commitment to environmental preservation, with less than 4% dedicated to structures. The surrounding landscape, designed by O2 Design, includes green walking and biking trails and dedicated picnic spots while ensuring the protection of nearby wetlands. Sustainability is central to the project. Rainwater is harvested for irrigation and a 50,561 kWh solar field provides electricity for the entire site. Chicago-based firm Jahn/ collaborated with consultants at Cyclone Energy Group and contractors at Pepper-Riley Construction to achieve a high-performance building that not only serves as a repository of military history but also demonstrates the close integration of architecture and engineering, which has defined Jahn through its 60-year legacy.390-foot trusses act as bearing walls to support the roof and provide lateral stabilitythe building demonstrates the close integration of architecture and engineeringthe exterior presents an open and inviting image to visitors, creating a striking presence in the landscape",
