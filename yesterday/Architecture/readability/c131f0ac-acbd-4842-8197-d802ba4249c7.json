  "text": "Imagine celebrating the holiday season in the picturesque home where Bing Crosby himself gathered with his family around the piano to sing carols, including his famed “White Christmas.” That could be reality for the French chateau-style estate’s new owner, who just dropped $25 million for the privilege, Mansion Global reports.Crosby, the iconic 20th century actor, singer, and comedian, lived in the Hillsborough, California, residence from December 1965 until his 1977 death. Following the passing of his second wife, Kathryn (Grant) Crosby, the couple’s children listed the 5.38-acre property for $40 million in February. Though the buyers scored a deep discount, the eight-figure sale remains one of the top five most expensive on record in the Bay Area town.Inside a palatial white and gray brick façade, the 13,600-square-foot mansion houses 11 bedrooms, 10 full bathrooms, five half-baths, and ornate living areas that include a smoking room with a built-in bar, a wood-paneled library, and a dining room lined with rose bushes painted by San Francisco artist Al Proom. Grand fireplaces and intricate woodwork are found throughout the home. After moving in, the Crosby family renovated the stately 1920s abode with 17th century antiques from the collection of publishing magnate and family friend William Randolph Hearst, including a wooden banister and wood paneling sourced from an old English manor.Join NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

A year later, that abode sold again for $35 million. “If the product that a buyer is looking for is there, it is going fast,” local luxury realtor Jennifer Gilson said of the area’s high-end market, per Mansion Global.",
