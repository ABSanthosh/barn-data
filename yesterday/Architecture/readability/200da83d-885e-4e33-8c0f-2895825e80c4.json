Out of the Valley’s new Tyto sauna brings home the restorative magic of Nordic sauna culture, offering immediate access to relaxation and wellness. Measuring just 2.5 feet by 8.5 feet, this compact, beautifully crafted retreat fits effortlessly into smaller outdoor spaces, delivering big on design, comfort, and therapeutic benefits. With Tyto, escaping the demands of daily life has never been easier – or closer. While saunas are deeply rooted in Nordic culture, serving as spaces for both relaxation and social connection, their popularity has transcended borders. In the United Kingdom where Out of the Valley is based, the allure of sauna living has grown rapidly. “It is now rapidly becoming a normal part of our everyday wellness routine,” shares Chris Selman, co-founder of Out of the Valley. The brand’s bespoke saunas seamlessly complement a variety of landscapes, from charming gardens in Notting Hill to the shores of a remote Scottish loch. With Tyto, Out of the Valley is making this timeless tradition even more accessible for those limited on backyard space. “We have created a sauna small enough to be tucked into the corner of any urban garden, so fans of heat therapy can be just steps away from this immersive and therapeutic healing experience,” Selman explains. Each Tyto is made to order and handcrafted in the brand’s Devon workshop, ensuring the highest level craftsmanship. The sauna boasts a brushed and oiled black larch exterior, reminiscent of alpine cabins, and an interior of smooth aspen wood for a calming atmosphere. A striking edge-to-edge panoramic window offers expansive views while maintaining a sense of connection to the outdoors, with optional privacy glass available for added seclusion. The sauna houses a floor-mounted heater – available in wood-burning or electric options – surrounded by rocks for practicing löyly, the Finnish tradition of pouring water onto the hot rocks to create steam and increase humidity. Thoughtful features like adjustable LED lighting, an outdoor deck, and hooks for robes and towels add convenience and comfort. Optional add-ons, such as an outdoor shower, plunge pool, bench seating, extended deck, sauna heater Wi-Fi, and log storage, allow users to tailor their Tyto to their personal wellness needs. These days, the stresses of daily life are mounting, and it’s become more important than ever to prioritize wellness. “An outdoor sauna is a place where you can escape the pressures of modern living through a soothing heat ritual, either on your own or with friends,” Selman notes. With the Tyto’s harmonious blend of contemporary design, traditional craftsmanship, and thoughtful details, it’s the perfect elegant addition to any backyard oasis.
