  "text": "A doughnut-shaped meteorological balloon and woven timber tunnel have been completed by architecture practice Line+ Studio in rural area in Zhejiang, China. Named Woven Gateway and Sky Ring, the two structures were commissioned as part of the enhancement of the Chuan Yan Nineteen Peaks Scenic Area. Line+ Studio designed the  structures to be minimal but impactful, seeking to improve the visitor experience through simple gestures that would not detract from the natural setting. Line+ Studio has added two new landmarks in Zhejiang\"Xiayanbei Village, located on a Ridgeline in eastern Zhejiang, is surrounded by misty mountains and scenic views, making it a popular destination for outdoor activities,\" explained the studio. \"However, the village faces challenges like limited infrastructure and carrying capacity,\" it continued. \"The design strategy tackles these by reusing existing land and introducing new experiences without consuming additional land.\" The tunnel is clad in locally-sourced black slate tilesThe Woven Passage is a 20-metre-long tunnel that frames the main entrance road leading into the village. Made from a curved structure of interlocking timber elements, it was informed by the area's history of bamboo weaving. As well as framing the landscape, this tunnel was also designed to protect the road from further erosion that had been occurring during heavy rains. The roof of the tunnel has been clad in locally-sourced black slate tiles, intended to appear as what the practice term a \"natural extension of the landscape\". \"This design evokes a spatial experience similar to discovering a hidden mountain passage, where a confined space suddenly opens up, creating a sense of surprise and clarity,\" said the studio. \"The passage design aims not only to create an iconic entrance but also to restore the landscape.\" Interlocking timber elements form the tunnel's structureLocated in a nearby field is the Sky Ring, a donut-shaped balloon tethered above an outdoor gathering area that was designed to be a \"public symbol\" and is illuminated at night by colour-changing lights. It also functions as a meteorological balloon, informed by the fact that many of the activities that take place in the scenic area – such as hiking, camping and farming – are highly dependant on the weather. A donut-shaped structure functions as a meteorological balloon\"When wind speeds are below eight metres-per-second, it ascends to 25 meters, tethered by 16 evenly distributed cables,\" explained the studio. \"In harsh weather, it retracts and anchors securely to the ground using six inner and eight outer cables.\" \"This approach brings visual and experiential novelty to visitors while offering new development opportunities for the village, making Xiayanbei a distinctive and memorable addition to the increasingly standardised rural tourism landscape,\" it added. The balloon is illuminated at night by colour-changing lightsLine+ Studio, formerly known as Gad Line+ Studio, is an architecture firm based in Hangzhou, China, founded by Meng Fanhao and Zhu Peidong. The studio recently completed another landscape-focused project in Shenzhen, where it perched curvaceous viewpoint atop Maluan Mountain. The photography is courtesy of Line+ Studio.
