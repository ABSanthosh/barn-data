The design concept reimagines how multiple companies can share a compact work space, incorporating faux beams and a column to organize the office while maintaining and open, collaborative environment. Facing the greenery of the neighboring Akasaka Imperial Villa, the layout maximizes functionality and comfort within a distorted triangular floor plan.all images by Tomoyuki Kusunoseintersecting beams create distorted divisionsThe office is located on the fourth floor of a multi-tenant building, featuring windows on the longest side that overlooks the gardens. Within, ULTRA STUDIO sought to maximize functionality within the small floor space — hosting four different companies — ensuring that different activities can coexist without affecting comfort of the users.Originally, the space featured an RC beam on the ceiling, visually dividing the room into two sections: one facing the windows and one towards the entrance. The Japanese Studio introduced an additional perpendicular beam, effectively creating four loosely defined zones. The design solution then centered around a square desk, three meters on each side, which allows for adequate distance between occupants while still fostering a shared workspace. The intersection of the four beams and the center of the desk are slightly offset, which the team connected with a fake pillar. The role of this element, which is non-structural and slightly tilted, remains essentially ambiguous, reintegrating the space by giving it a centripetal character.ULTRA STUDIO transforms cramped, shared office spacea large table that divides the space while allowing workers to convene and work togetherthe space is shared by four different companiesfaux beams and a column to organize the office while maintaining and open, collaborative environmentan irregular triangular floor plan",
