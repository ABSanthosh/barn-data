  "text": "Kalbod Design Studio turns Ernan Castle into a Boutique HotelKalbod Design Studio’s concept reimagines the Ernan Castle in Mehriz, Iran, reviving the historical structure as a contemporary boutique hotel. The Ernan Boutique Hotel reinterprets the conventional approach to boutique hotel design by integrating renovation as part of the architectural process rather than solely focusing on historical restoration. The existing castle structure has been preserved and selectively restored, while a distinct roof structure has been introduced above. These two independent elements—the historical castle and the new roof—define the spatial composition. The roof extends inward where the castle has deteriorated, while it recedes in areas where the structure remains intact, creating a contrast between past and present without merging them. This approach establishes a juxtaposition of positive and negative spaces, maintaining clear spatial boundaries.all visuals by Ziba Baghban, courtesy of Kalbod Design Studiocurated sequence of spaces enhances sensory engagementThe architectural team at Kalbod Design Studio conceptualizes the hotel as a curated journey, structured around four thematic sections—Earth, Fire, Water, and Air—each offering distinct spatial and sensory experiences. These elements shape the visitor’s engagement with the environment, aligning architecture with an immersive experience that extends beyond traditional hospitality. The sequence of movement within the hotel is carefully orchestrated, guiding guests through varying atmospheres designed to enhance interaction with the surroundings.Since their emergence in the 1980s, boutique hotels have been defined by their emphasis on unique experiences, transforming the accommodation into a destination itself. The Ernan Boutique Hotel builds on this principle by prioritizing spatial design as the core of the visitor experience. Rather than focusing solely on the recreation of historical elements, the project introduces contemporary architectural interventions that respond to the existing structure while maintaining its integrity.a contemporary roof structure redefines the historic Ernan Castleperforated roof creates shifting patterns of light and shadowSignificant structural damage to Ernan Castle, including the collapse of its roof and sections of its walls, required strategic reconstruction. The design process by Kalbod Design Studio explored alternatives to replicating the lost roof, instead proposing a new architectural element that complements the preserved structure. The design is based on two primary components: the castle, restored with minimal intervention, and the new roof, conceived as an autonomous structure.The roof interacts with the castle dynamically—receding where the original structure remains and extending inward where deterioration has occurred. This spatial interplay generates a layered experience, reinforcing the distinction between historical and contemporary elements. The perforated lattice of the roof filters natural light, mitigating the intense desert sunlight and enabling functional use of the rooftop throughout the day. The rooftop, inspired by the traditional stepped rooftops of Yazd, is designed as an accessible terrace, with staircases integrated to enhance vertical circulation. Additionally, a series of red architectural interventions highlight the circulation pathways within the hotel. These elements introduce a contemporary layer that contrasts with the historic fabric, emphasizing the spatial sequence and enhancing wayfinding.the perforated roof filters sunlight, creating shifting patterns of light and shadowhotel’s architecture unfolds as an evolving spatial narrativeThe hotel is structured as an experiential sequence where movement through the spaces forms part of the guest’s journey. The four thematic sections—Earth, Fire, Water, and Air—serve as sensory environments, engaging visitors through interactive programs such as meditation and workshops. Guests follow a rotational itinerary, beginning their stay in one section and progressing through the remaining spaces over two days.
