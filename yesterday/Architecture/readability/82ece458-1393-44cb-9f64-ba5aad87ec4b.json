Located in the Cerrado region of Minas Gerais, the space utilizes a modular grid and natural materials to create flexible and engaging educational environments, exploring the role of the physical environment in pedagogical practice. Founded in 2017, the non-profit social initiative sits within a protected environmental area, and operates based on four pillars: educating children, strengthening families, transforming communities, and multiplying efficient organizations.Since 2018, the school has occupied a 14,000 square meter plot in Lagoa Santa, where the first physical structures were installed, including the Galpão João de Barro. With classrooms, administrative spaces, and support areas already established, the school has begun a planned expansion process commencing from 2024. Its first phase provided capacity for up to 20 students each, along with a connecting module featuring a covered patio with a pergola, altogether composed of wood, glass, polycarbonate, dry-wall, and industrialized systems. With the use of wood, too, parents and guardians are enabled to contribute to the construction.all images courtesy of BIRIthe modular vila ninho school invites community participationBIRI (see more here) and MACH arquitetos’ (see more here) design concept for the Vila Ninho School is guided by principles of sustainability, integration with the environment, and pedagogical innovation, seeking to transform the built environment into an active agent in the education of children. The architectural proposal is based on a modular grid of 2×2 meters and construction modules of 36 square meters, allowing flexibility and adaptation of spaces over time. The design of the space takes into account the environmental comfort and sensory experience of the students. Natural lighting is enhanced by skylights and overhead lights, while soft colors and suitable materials contribute to well-being and energy efficiency. The school uses artificial lighting systems with LED technology and high-performance thermal insulation on roofs and walls to further optimize energy use and foster ideal learning conditions. The implementation of rainwater harvesting and the reuse of gray water are also planned, demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability.NINHO — João de Barro Module at a children’s school by BIRI and MACH arquitetosBIRI and MACH arquitetos seek to integrate the school infrastructure with the local ecosystem. This involves the progressive reconstruction of the native flora of the Gallery Forest, which divides the land and forms the Permanent Preservation Area, fully respecting the buffer distances from each bank of the Capão da Onça Stream. Through a Technical Flora Reconstitution Project seeds will be collected, and seedlings of regional species will be produced in a nursery with a capacity for 1,072 seedlings. Students, parents, and teachers will actively participate in planting an area of 0.67 hectares, fostering environmental education and a sense of belonging.The school expansion is organized into distinct sectors, including the João de Barro Warehouse Sector, which will be renovated with thermal and accessibility improvements. New single-story buildings will be constructed near the vegetable garden in the Woods and APP Sector, housing educational and cultural modules such as a library, technology lab, music room, and dance and theater rooms, all carefully installed among the existing vegetation. Accessibility will also be ensured by elevated walkways, stairs, and slides. Meanwhile, the sports court, changing rooms, cafeteria, and accommodation for researchers will also feature appropriate structural solutions, such as metal trusses and ribbed slabs with skylights.utilizing a modular grid and natural materials to create flexible and engaging educational environmentAll physical interventions are designed to minimize environmental impacts and respect the topography and natural characteristics of the terrain. The pre-existing nature serves as a starting point for the development of the project, guiding everything from the implementation of the buildings to the choice of materials. The school space is conceived not merely as a place of teaching but as an educational tool in itself, where each element of the environment can become an agent of learning and social transformation. By combining conscious architecture, sustainable practices, quality education, and community involvement, the Vila Ninho School project exemplifies how the physical environment can assume an essential educational role in contemporary pedagogical practice, promoting not only knowledge but also citizenship, care for the environment, and social responsibility.since 2018, the school has occupied a 14,000 square meter plot in Lagoa Santathe design concept is guided by principles of integration with the environment and pedagogical innovationinside the classroomsthe architects seek to integrate the school infrastructure with the local ecosystem",
