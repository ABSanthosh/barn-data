  "text": "Selena Gomez and Benny Blanco are making big moves together in the City of Angels. Per TMZ, the engaged couple said “I do” to a seven-bedroom manse for $35 million in December 2024, marking one of Beverly Hills’ biggest real estate transactions of the year. It was also reported that a famous Hollywood director was a previous resident of the Spanish-style home, though their identity has not yet been revealed.The abode features a total of seven bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. It also boasts luxury amenities including a library, a grand spiral staircase, a greenhouse, a fitness center, and a pool.The news of Gomez and Blanco’s eight-figure splurge comes days after the couple announced their joint album, I Said I Love You First, out March 21. The entire project was reportedly recorded in Blanco’s cozy and “kooky” Los Angeles pad. In a March cover story for Interview, the Rare Beauty founder and the award-winning music producer dished on their home life together in Blanco’s 1930s-style dwelling, which he bought in 2019. The two shared that they recorded their collaborative album, which explores their relationship, in one of the upstairs bedrooms.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month + receive an exclusive toteArrow“So many times it was so hodgepodge. It was like two hours here, two hours there,” Blanco told the outlet. “I’d never worked that way with someone. Usually I work that way if I’m by myself, but it was so cool to be able to do that with her.” Gomez also shared that the process was so laidback, she sometimes recorded songs literally laid back on the bed or lounging around the room. “Normally I’m on this little chair and I have a thousand blankets on me,” she said. “I loved it. It felt very easy.”",
