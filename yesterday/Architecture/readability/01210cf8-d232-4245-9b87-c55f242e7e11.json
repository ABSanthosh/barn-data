  "text": "wooden sheep house in kyoto, japan by studio 2m26Architecture studio 2m26 shapes a wooden sheep house in Kyoto, Japan using rice straws and sewn bamboo nets. Named Hitsujigoya, the Kyoto-based studio uses the materials growing around the farmland for the project. It adopts the traditional roofing technique for the surface of the wooden sheep house using layers of rice straws. The team attaches these materials to bamboo nets, which are sewn together with ropes made of rice straws as well. Then, the studio says that layers of cedar leaves, cedar bark, and planted soil cover the surface of the wooden sheep house in Kyoto. The team adds that in Japan and western France, iris flowers are historically planted to help stabilize soil since their root systems create a network that holds the soil together. The flora appears in the project to aid the planted soil on the surface and avoid erosion from spreading throughout over time.all images courtesy of 2m26 | photos by Yuya MikiHitsujigoya main structure made of natural cypress logsFor the wooden sheep house ‘Hitsujigoya’ in Kyoto, the architecture studio 2m26 constructs the main structure from natural cypress logs. Even these grow on site naturally alongside the other materials used for the project. The studio harves the logs in summertime to remove the bark easily. The team then dries it by the nearby rivers to push the sap out of the cypress. After that, they forge the wooden pillars, retaining their natural properties.The base of the wooden sheep house in Kyoto is made of stone, adding a robust foundation to the architecture. The studio team says that because of the limited walkable access on site, they have to construct the project by hand instead of using some machinery help. For this reason, they also turn to traditional Japanese carpentry and tools to fully realize building. The last touch to the wooden sheep house in Kyoto is the large doors that open widely. It divides the land in two in order for the shepherd to identify the sheep’s genetics easily. studio 2m26 shapes the roof of a wooden sheep house in Kyoto, Japan using rice straws and bamboo netsnamed Hitsujigoya, the Kyoto-based studio significantly uses materials growing around the farmlandnatural Hinoki logs and planed boards compose the main structure altogetherthe pillars are set on top of stones overallthe roof structure comprises a net of bamboo and rice straw sewn on it with rope",
