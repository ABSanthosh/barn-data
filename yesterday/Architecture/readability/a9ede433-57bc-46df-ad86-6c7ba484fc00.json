  "text": "After 26 years, Liam Neeson is looking to offload his New York apartment. The Taken star listed his Manhattan pad for $10.75 million. The uptown property was originally listed in 2024 for $12.75 million; Neeson later pulled the listing before dropping it back onto the market with a reduced price tag and a different brokerage.The actor has maintained the Upper West Side home since 1999, when he purchased it for $4 million. Built in 1994, the condo contains 56 floors, with the Oscar winner’s residence situated on the 28th. The 4,524-square-foot apartment hosts five bedrooms and five bathrooms. Neeson assembled the large footprint by merging three separate units into one. His pieced-together luxury space features floor-to-ceiling windows with sweeping 360-degree views of the Manhattan skyline. The dwelling boasts an open concept chef’s kitchen, a foyer that leads to a corner family room, and a large dining area. The primary suite has two spa-like baths, a gym, and views of Central Park. The rest of the abode is outfitted with built-ins to showcase his extensive art collection. General building amenities include access to an Equinox gym, a pool, and a basketball court.A bedroom in the unit. Photo: Krisztina CraneNeeson has kept a modest real estate portfolio over the years. He’s been splitting his time between two upscale properties throughout his career: the now-for-sale Upper West Side condo and a 6,000-square-foot country home in Millbrook, New York. It has not yet been confirmed if Neeson plans to reside at the 37-acre upstate property full-time—especially in light of his recent comments about retiring from Hollywood in the near future, per People. Neeson purchased the upstate property in 1994 right before marrying his late wife, English actor Natasha Richardson. The Millbrook estate features a swimming pool, a courtyard, and a tennis court.Join NowFlash Sale: Become an AD PRO member today and unlock your design potential.ArrowMatthew Coleman of Coleman Real Estate Group has the listing.",
