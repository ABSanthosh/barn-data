  "text": "Unformed Design unveils design for not a hotel house in japanUnformed Design introduces Nature Within, a residence that embraces dramatic rock formations and forested terrain in its architectural concept. Set to break ground in 2026 in Kitakaruizawa, Japan, the project transforms the natural landscape into a fundamental part of the design. This approach earned Unformed Design first prize in the NOT A HOTEL international design competition for architects and creators under 40.Rather than treating the rugged terrain as a challenge, Unformed Design embraces it as the foundation of their concept. The residence incorporates weathered rock formations as structural and aesthetic elements, leaving them in their original positions to preserve the integrity of the site. These rocks form the foundation and support key areas of the home, eliminating the need for artificial bases. Nature Within’s form follows the natural slope of the land with an imperfect elliptical form that mirrors the contours of the terrain. This organic geometry allows the structure to nestle into the site, giving the impression that it has emerged naturally from the earth. The pitched roof extends beyond the walls, forming sheltered outdoor spaces that transition into the landscape, while a rear terrace hugs the terrain to provide a private retreat immersed in nature.images courtesy of Unformed Design and NOT A HOTELrock formations anchor the interior of nature within residenceInside, the rocks become central to the layout by the Milan-based practice Unformed Design.
