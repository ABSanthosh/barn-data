  "text": "It might seem straight out of a fantasy novel, but this Surrealist cob house in Kazakhstan is far from fiction; in fact, it lays down a blueprint for reimagining ancient building techniques for present day sustainable architecture. “When people first encounter our house, they struggle to believe it’s a residence,” says Dilyara Mazhitova. “Most assume it’s a public space—a restaurant or a retreat. People simply don’t build homes like this.” Nestled against a mountainside in the rugged Alatau region surrounding Almaty, Kazakhstan, Mazhitova’s home is indeed singular, bringing to mind the cavelike villas designed by maverick French architect Jacques Couëlle in the 1950s and ’60s, or the rustic dwellings of Tolkien’s Middle-earth.Almaty, Kazakhstan’s largest metropolis, is set in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau mountains. This house is nestled into Almaty’s naturally breathtaking landscape. The couple that occupies this house conceived it sustainably with the help of a construction team and interior designer. In fact, the house’s inspiration lies entirely elsewhere. Mazhitova and her husband, Vladimir Radostovets, designed and built it themselves, with the help of a hand-picked construction team and an interior designer. The couple were originally lawyers, but that represents only a fraction of their talents: Mazhitova has since turned entrepreneur, project manager, and art dealer, while Radostovets is also a builder and inventor, notably in the field of sound engineering. The couple has even built a factory that specializes in geosynthetic materials. Many of these creative strands proved vital when, one day, Radostovets had a radical idea: to build a cob house from scratch.Inside, organic materials and textures reign. As do curves and other organic forms. Both the color palette and shapes represent the Kazakh couple’s organic design philosophy. What is a Cob House?Cob houses are an ancient form of adobe construction used all over the world, constructed primarily from locally sourced natural materials such as clay, sand, straw and water. They are highly ecologically efficient, generating little waste and possessing natural insulation properties that reduce energy consumption. Durable enough to last centuries, they can be quick to build: the initial plan was for this home to be constructed over three months. However, this wasn’t how things panned out. “Vladimir bought several books on cob construction and began studying the subject,” remembers Mazhitova. “In the end, the project stretched over 10 years, as the house transformed into an art piece that we sculpted, modified and perfected.”Sound horns, which the Radostovets designed for the family spaces, are featured throughout the home. When the couple began the project in 2012, they were living in another log cabin–style house they had previously built on the same site. Since then, they’ve had three children, and the cob house has evolved alongside their family. “We built this house as an experiment, and took our time,” says Mazhitova. “We drew inspiration from nature’s organic forms, aiming to integrate the house seamlessly into the landscape rather than imposing an artificial structure upon it.”The hydroponic wall near the kitchen, where edible herbs and other botanicals are grown. How do you build a Cob House?The inspirations for the one-story dwelling’s undulating forms and rippling roofline were ocean waves and desert dunes. “The space transitions organically from one room to another—there are no thresholds, no baseboards, no chandeliers,” says Mazhitova. “It functions as a single, cohesive organism.” The building is arranged almost like a medieval hall, with a communal dining area at its heart, a family relaxation zone on one side and a sleeping area and bathhouse on the other; each of the five inhabitants has their own bedroom and bathroom. There’s not a sharp angle to be seen anywhere.The material used to construct the house is highly durable. Skylights were a solution given the one side of the house built into the side of the mountain. And in other parts of the home, windows and curtains were able to be installed. Decorative recesses also function as careful disguises for embedded lighting. The design was conceived by sketching shapes on paper. “Then we outlined the walls on site with stones from the river that flow through the property,” explains Mazhitova. The framework went up quickly, but sculpting the interior proved to be a long, experimental process. “One challenge was that the house is embedded into the mountainside, so one side has no windows. We solved this by putting skylights in the ceiling and decorative recesses in the corridor to create the illusion of windows.”A further run of windows is embedded below the roofline, spanning the entire length of the house. The interior surface finish, which is painted and wax-coated for a matte, velvety look, did not permit the hanging of normal lights and curtains; instead, lights were recessed behind ceiling beams, lending an ethereal glow by night. “Cob walls do not tolerate nails or heavy attachments, so we designed a bespoke macramé curtain system using branches as curtain rods,” adds Mazhitova.Lighting was also installed ingeniously behind beams. Wood details throughout the home are in part provided by fir trees toppled nearby. In a stroke of luck, a storm toppled several old fir trees nearby, which the couple repurposed for the roof. Exposed throughout the rooms like an elegant spine, they complement numerous wooden details. While most of the furniture is sculpted from cob and appears to grow organically from the walls, there are a few freestanding pieces from local brands; there’s even the odd IKEA dining chair, hand-stained for a unique look. Mazhitova and Radostovets worked with interior designer Elena Plaskina to ensure that all the furnishings were “as comfortable as they were visually harmonious,” cladding many pieces in karagach wood, which is a native elm variety. “It’s durable and has a beautiful grain,” says Mazhitova. The house’s smooth backdrop was softened with natural, neutral textiles: primarily Belarusian linens and Turkish cottons, as well as rugs and hanging baskets by local artisans.Sound horns are both free-standing and built into the cob house. In a home where every element is handcrafted, there were challenges aplenty. All the doors, for example, were custom-made, each one unique in shape and size; a long time was spent deciding on the wall colors, which were eventually calibrated to evoke “sand, deserts, and cliffs.” The couple’s own expertise in geomaterials came in handy for the roof, which was constructed using a waterproof recycled-plastic membrane topped with earth and a grid-like reinforcing layer. As well as creating a wavy shape, this helps the house blend into the landscape and allows vegetation to grow, preventing erosion. There is more greenery inside, in the form of a hydroponic wall beside the kitchen. “The idea was to grow edible herbs and reinforce the home’s cyclical ethos,” says Mazhitova. “We designed the water circulation system to sustain the plants efficiently.”A hearth built into the home, pictured right. Perhaps the most striking feature of all is a series of massive sound horns that Radostovets designed for the family spaces. Experiments for the couple’s next project, an audio theatre, they are both sculptural and functional. “They produce an extraordinary sound—we’ve positioned a screen and projector beneath them in the lounge so we can watch films,” enthuses Mazhitova. There are also custom-made speakers in the bathrooms for a multi-sensory experience. The building continues to evolve and is as much a symbol of a shared journey as it is a home. Mazhitova sees it as a place to “escape the chaos of modern life” and reconnect with nature. “We incorporated all four natural elements—there are three fireplaces, a pool, the structure is made of earth and the sound horns represent air,” she muses. “It’s a house where conflict seems impossible.”This Cob House was originally published in AD Middle East.",
