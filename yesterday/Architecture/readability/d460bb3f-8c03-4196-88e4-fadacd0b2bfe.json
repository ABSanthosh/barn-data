Jacob BrinthEveryone could benefit from a little more balance and harmony in their lives, and this is exactly what Japandi-inspired living rooms provide; often seen as embodying the essence of a home, living areas are where many people spend most of their time. It makes sense that Japandi interiors as a whole are increasing in popularity—especially in spaces designed for relaxation, where the mind can stop racing and simply rest. The aesthetic is both elegant and surprising, simple and unpretentious, like the sculptures and vases by Japanese artist Toru Kurokawa (right), or the tables and armchairs from the Karimoku brand.In recent years, no other fusion in the design world has captured the imagination of so many people as this mix of Japanese aesthetics with Scandinavian minimalism. The Scandinavian influence can be seen in Japandi’s clean lines, natural materials, and a light palette. The Japanese contribution is reflected in Zen influences, traditional design elements like tatami mats, and minimalist accessories. It’s a design approach that truly embodies the best of both worlds. Here, we take you on a journey to five of our favorite apartments with beautiful Japandi-inspired living rooms.1. Classic Japandi, with curves in all the right placesIn this case study home by Karimoku Case, the eye is encouraged to come to a rest. Photo: Tomooki KengakuKarimoku Case, a Japanese lifestyle brand, knows all about designing Japandi interiors. To demonstrate their expertise, they’ve created 10 case study homes—and what is striking about one of them, the Azabu Hills Residence in Tokyo, is that everything here has a sense of flow and motion. Specifically, all the furniture, from the sofa to the coffee table, has rounded edges and forms and the different pieces are all in a palette of earthy colors. The zelkova wood used for many pieces, which looks similar to beech, is a traditional building material for temples in Japan.2. Mahogany paired with colorful accentsThe living room looks out at the home’s peaceful 161-square-foot private terrace. Photo: Hervé GoluzaThe architect chose a straightforward and simple design for the living and sleeping areas. Photo: Hervé GoluzaThis 323-square-foot apartment in Paris wasn’t the most practical space—until architect Hélène Lacombe intervened. She created an inviting home by skillfully combining waxed concrete, mahogany elements, and light colors to create a completely Japandi look. There’s also a small garden that continues the combination of Scandinavian chic with a Japanese sensibility.3. Small wonderA light palette is paired with art from China and Japan in this apartment in London. Photo: Vigo JansonsEven if you only have limited space to work with, small rooms can embrace the Japandi aesthetic too—you just need to know some of the right design moves to make. One of them is to create niches with seating and corners that invite you to make yourself comfortable with a good book. This is how interior designer Tom Lawrence-Levy created this Zen-inspired and inviting resting place in a London apartment.4. Add some wabi-sabiLight, matte walls and plenty of natural light give this living room a calm and cheerful atmosphere. Photo: Yadnyesh JoshiThe Japandi style, with its muted colors and use of natural materials, can occasionally run the risk of feeling a little too restrained. One way to avoid this is by introducing some variety into your design by turning to related aesthetic concepts. By integrating the imperfect and impermanent approach known as wabi-sabi, designer Divya Panwar gave this 732-square-foot apartment in Pune, India, a sensual touch.5. Knock on woodThe living room has a minimalist style, and incorporates wood and sand tones that allude to the landscape of Cap Ferret. Photo: Agnès ClotisFor this bungalow, the architecture firm b2p Architecture was inspired by its location in France’s Cap Ferret and its sandy landscapes. Different types of wood create an intentional mix of textures and tones in the dining and living areas. There is also a sustainable angle to the design: the project was designed with an innovative approach to construction that used CLT (cross-laminated timber), allowing the home to be built at a more rapid rate.",
