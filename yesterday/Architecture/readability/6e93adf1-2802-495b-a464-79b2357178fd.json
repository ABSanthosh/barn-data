Inspired by her global experiences, she shares captivating insights into the world’s most extraordinary cities and buildings and provides travel tips on her blog, The Travel Album. When we think of architecture, the mind often conjures images of towering structures, intricate façades and innovative forms. But beyond the physical structure lies an often-overlooked element that profoundly shapes the experience of these buildings: the landscape. In modern design, landscape architecture should not be an afterthought; it should be an integral component of the overall project that creates harmony between the built spaces and the natural environment. Through careful planning and intentional design, landscapes enhance the architecture they surround, transforming structures into places that tell stories, evoke emotions and encourage engagement. Landscape as an Extension of the Building Narrative Landscape design acts as a critical architectural element, extending the building’s design language into its surrounding environment and embedding it within its site. A carefully designed landscape doesn’t just frame the building, it amplifies its narrative. For example, a cultural center inspired by local traditions might use native plants, pathways mimicking historical trade routes or water features that reflect regional ecosystems, grounding the architecture in its context. Similarly, a modernist home with sharp angles and minimalist aesthetics might extend its story through a landscape of linear paving patterns, structured hedges and sculptural trees that echo its form. The landscape becomes an active participant in the architecture, reinforcing its themes and ensuring that the story the building tells is fully realized in the interplay between structure and site. Imagine this approach applied to the design of a boutique winery nestled in a rolling hillside — a project that I previously tackled. The building’s architecture was inspired by the region’s heritage, with a roofline echoing the undulating terrain and materials sourced locally to reflect the earthiness of winemaking. The landscape was deliberately crafted to enhance this narrative, transforming the site into an experiential journey through the story of wine production. We designed terraced vineyards that wrapped around the building, not only for function but to symbolize the layering of time and tradition. A winding pathway was carved into the landscape, guiding visitors through rows of vines before arriving at the tasting room — a subtle nod to the journey from grape to glass. Native grasses and wildflowers bordered the site, creating a transition between cultivated land and the surrounding natural landscape, while strategically placed oak trees referenced the barrels used in wine aging. Every element of the landscape was intentional, amplifying the building’s story and immersing visitors in the region’s culture and craft. Storytelling Through Landscape: A Cultural and Environmental Dialogue Landscape design serves as a powerful storytelling tool, allowing architects and designers to weave narratives into the fabric of a place. Through plant selection, materials and spatial organization, landscape design can reflect local history, culture or ecology. For example, the incorporation of native plants not only supports local biodiversity but also anchors the building within its geographical and cultural context. The Japanese tea garden is a classic example of landscape telling a cultural story. Paths, ponds, and plantings guide visitors through a sequence of views and experiences that represent themes of tranquility, harmony, and mindfulness. Each turn in the path, each carefully placed rock or tree, is imbued with cultural symbolism. This storytelling aspect of landscape design enhances the building it surrounds, adding layers of meaning and resonance that connect visitors to a deeper understanding of place. An exemplary project that embodies the storytelling power of landscape design is the Naturpark Amager in Copenhagen, Denmark. This project activates a unique landscape through clear storytelling and subtle architecture that highlights natural qualities, activities and communities. A series of new visitor points ensure visual links throughout the park and make the protected landscape more accessible to its visitors. The landmark design creates an easily recognizable architecture that establishes a strong identity firmly anchored in the context. Each visitor point is located at a transformation pivot — from urban condition to nature or from land to water — framing the landscape and creating new experiences by breaking down its enormous scale into smaller spaces and stories. The individual designs enhance unique landscape characters and activities, using a simple design vocabulary that strengthens the existing character. The points not only create new experiences for visitors but also stage the landscape and provide a versatile framework for future development in the park. Crafting Visual Harmony: The Landscape-Architecture Connection The relationship between a building and its surrounding landscape is one of visual dialogue. Landscape design has the power to ground a structure within its context, creating a sense of place that feels intentional and complete. A building with sharp, modern lines might benefit from soft, flowing greenery to create balance, while a minimalist, open form might be enhanced by a landscape of simple, clean lines that mirrors its aesthetic. Consider The Vals Thermal Spa by Peter Zumthor. This project exemplifies the profound dialogue between architecture and its surrounding landscape. Nestled within the Swiss Alps, the spa is seamlessly carved into the mountainside, achieving a remarkable integration with its natural surroundings. The design uses locally quarried Valser quartzite, grounding the building in the region’s geological identity while reflecting the rugged textures of the surrounding terrain. The spa’s linear forms and subterranean design create a harmonious interplay between built and natural elements, blending into the topography rather than dominating it. The landscape further enhances this connection, with reflective pools and open-air spaces that frame breathtaking alpine views, inviting visitors to experience the synergy between architecture and nature. This thoughtful integration creates a sense of place that feels both intentional and timeless, where the building and landscape together evoke a dialogue of tranquility and balance. The Experience Factor: How Landscape Shapes Human Interaction One of the most profound effects of landscape design is its ability to shape how people experience and interact with architecture. Landscape acts as a transitional space, guiding people from the public realm to the private sanctuary of a building. Pathways, for example, can gently lead visitors through a series of environments that prepare them for the experience ahead, whether a quiet garden leading to a meditation center or an expansive plaza framing a museum entrance. Landscape architecture not only shapes physical movement but also evokes emotional responses. A well-designed garden or outdoor courtyard can inspire curiosity, encourage contemplation, or invite relaxation, shaping how people engage with the built environment. Pathways, plantings, seating areas, and interactive elements create moments of pause and reflection, allowing visitors to appreciate the architecture from various perspectives and at different paces. This carefully curated journey through a landscape often transforms a building into a multidimensional experience rather than just a static object. Complementing the Building’s Form and Materials Landscape design enhances architecture not only through aesthetics but also by complementing a building’s physical attributes. Different architectural forms call for different landscaping approaches. A towering skyscraper might feel cold and imposing, but the addition of green spaces at its base, such as gardens or tree-lined plazas, humanizes its scale and invites people to linger. Similarly, materials like stone, glass and concrete are softened by the organic textures of plants, creating a sensory balance that makes a space more approachable and engaging. Water features, garden walls and textured plantings can emphasize architectural elements, adding visual weight to certain areas or drawing attention to specific design details. Situated on a steep hillside, the Art House project in San Francisco is designed to have a terraced garden that mirrors the natural topography while creating a series of intimate, flexible outdoor spaces. This thoughtful design extends the living areas into the landscape, carving out a tranquil connection to nature amidst the dense cityscape and integrating the building with its surroundings. The terraces not only enhance the aesthetic appeal of the structure but also address the functional challenge of the steep slope, stabilizing the site and making it usable. By integrating the architecture with its environment, the landscape design reinforces the physical attributes of the building, creating a cohesive and harmonious experience. Framing Architecture as Art Through Landscape Design Just as a frame enhances a painting, a well-designed landscape elevates a building, positioning it as the centerpiece of a curated setting. Landscape design can be used to control sightlines, directing viewers to appreciate certain architectural features or views. For instance, a winding path or strategically placed trees can create a “reveal” effect, guiding visitors toward an entrance or framing a stunning view of the structure. The landscape thus becomes a canvas upon which architecture is displayed, encouraging people to view it as a work of art. In historic preservation, landscape design also serves to highlight architectural heritage. At Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s residence, the landscape is designed to evoke the agricultural identity of the era, with orchards, gardens, and fields that frame the house within its historical context. By restoring and preserving the landscape, the architectural history is both honored and amplified, creating a harmonious composition that celebrates the site’s legacy. The 901 Fairfax Hunters View project embodies how a well-designed landscape can elevate architecture, positioning the building as the centerpiece of a curated setting. This project’s landscape is meticulously designed to guide sightlines, framing key architectural elements and creating intentional connections between the built environment and its surroundings. Pathways and plantings are strategically placed to lead visitors through the space, unveiling architectural details and framing views of the structure as though unveiling a work of art. The interplay of greenery, open spaces and hardscaping not only enhances the building’s aesthetic appeal but also creates moments of discovery, encouraging visitors to engage with the architecture as part of an integrated, living composition. Here, the landscape becomes more than a backdrop — it is a dynamic canvas that enriches the building’s presence and reinforces its visual and cultural significance. Landscape as an Integral Part of Architecture Landscape design is not simply an accessory to architecture — it is an art form that completes the story, transforming buildings into immersive environments that resonate with every visitor. By uniting architecture with its surroundings, landscape design creates harmony, tells stories and enhances experiences, turning spaces into living, breathing works of art. In a world where architecture and design are increasingly intertwined with sustainability, culture and human experience, landscape architecture plays an indispensable role. It is the bridge between the built and natural environments, enhancing not only the aesthetic qualities of a structure but also its sustainability, functionality and emotional impact. For architects and designers committed to creating spaces that inspire, engage, and endure, landscape design is an invaluable tool — a transformative force that brings architecture to life.

Here, the landscape becomes more than a backdrop — it is a dynamic canvas that enriches the building’s presence and reinforces its visual and cultural significance.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLandscape as an Integral Part of Architecture\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d.jpg\" alt=\"Seattle Art Museum: Olympic Sculpture park Seattle, WA, United States by WEISS/MANFREDI Architecture/Landscape/Urbanism\" width=\"1700\" height=\"992\" srcset=\"https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d.jpg 1700w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d-300x175.jpg 300w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d-1024x598.jpg 1024w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d-768x448.jpg 768w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d-1536x896.jpg 1536w, https://blog.architizer.com/wp-content/uploads/cbd8498d-400x233.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1700px) 100vw, 1700px\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eLandscape design is not simply an accessory to architecture — it is an art form that completes the story, transforming buildings into immersive environments that resonate with every visitor. By uniting architecture with its surroundings, landscape design creates harmony, tells stories and enhances experiences, turning spaces into living, breathing works of art. In a world where architecture and design are increasingly intertwined with sustainability, culture and human experience, landscape architecture plays an indispensable role. It is the bridge between the built and natural environments, enhancing not only the aesthetic qualities of a structure but also its sustainability, functionality and emotional impact. For architects and designers committed to creating spaces that inspire, engage, and endure, landscape design is an invaluable tool — a transformative force that brings architecture to life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://enter.architizer.com/?utm_source=architizer\u0026amp;utm_medium=blog\u0026amp;utm_campaign=nav\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eArchitizer\u0026#39;s 13th A+Awards\u003c/a\u003e features a suite of sustainability-focused categories recognizing designers that are building a greener industry — and a better future. \u003ca href=\"https://awards.architizer.com/a/organizations/main/submissions/submissionnotcompleted?solicitationId=22\u0026amp;utm_source=architizer\u0026amp;utm_medium=blog\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eStart your entry\u003c/a\u003e to receive global recognition for your work!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e",
