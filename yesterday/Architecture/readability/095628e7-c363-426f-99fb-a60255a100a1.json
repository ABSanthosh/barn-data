Start your entry to receive global recognition for your work! What would our world look like without architects? As we enter the season of Thanksgiving, it’s worth considering just how much these visionary professionals contribute to our lives. The 13th A+Awards, now open for entries with a Main Entry Deadline of December 6, forms a thanksgiving celebration for our industry: It is dedicated to architects who go beyond the ordinary to redefine what’s possible. For proof, look no further than last season’s winners, which exemplify the extraordinary power of architecture to respond to today’s complex challenges and transform lives. These projects, and the people that brought them to life, are featured daily on Architizer as a continual reminder of the positive impact of good architects and designers worldwide. Among recent winners, Michael Green Architecture’s Google Borregas in Sunnyvale, California, stands out as a model of sustainable workspace design. Built using advanced mass timber construction and expansive windows that introduce natural light deep into each space, Google Borregas connects people to nature while prioritizing environmental responsibility. The exposed wood structure reduces the building’s carbon footprint and adds warmth, proving that sustainable design can be as inspiring as it is functional. In Toronto, MJMA Architecture \u0026 Design’s John Innes Community Recreation Centre exemplifies architecture’s potential to serve as a community anchor. This recreation center seamlessly combines athletic facilities with spaces for social gathering, creating a welcoming environment that supports both physical and social well-being. Its glass façades connect the interior to the neighborhood, inviting residents into a shared space where everyone feels they belong. MJMA’s design reminds us of how public architecture can foster community pride and unity. In Amsterdam, VenhoevenCS architecture+urbanism’s Bike Parking IJboulevard reimagines what urban infrastructure can be. This underwater bike parking facility, 2024 winner in the Transportation Interiors category, accommodates Amsterdam’s many cyclists while preserving waterfront views. Its sleek, minimalist design meets practical needs while catalyzing movement around the neighborhood, setting a new standard for sustainable urban transit solutions. The project is a compelling reminder that, like architecture, infrastructure can be transformed through thoughtful design, supporting the needs of a growing, environmentally conscious urban population. On the other side of the world, the Prepared Rehmannia Root Crafts Exhibition Hall, designed by LUO studio in Henan Province, China, is another exemplar in material detailing. This exhibition hall demonstrates the beauty of craftsmanship and sustainability, with wood forming the primary structure in a striking, circular form. The design celebrates local heritage, using sustainable materials and techniques to create an enduring space that connects visitors with the craft traditions of the region. LUO studio’s work exemplifies how architecture can honor cultural identity while advancing ecological responsibility. Meanwhile, in Merida, Yucatan, Veinte Diezz Arquitectos brought new life to a forgotten space with the stunning Casa Lohr, winner in the Residential Renovations and Additions category. This restoration project, a reimagining of an abandoned 19th-century colonial house, uses raw, natural materials while preserving original features. By celebrating the “concept of time” and the resilience of existing elements, Veinte Diezz Arquitectos’ thoughtful work exemplifies how thoughtful residential renovation can honor history and adapt to modern needs. These winning projects remind us why we’re so grateful for the architects who bring their vision, creativity, and commitment to every project. From sustainable workspaces to community centers, cultural landmarks to educational buildings and public parks to urban infrastructure, architects and designers devote their careers to creating spaces that inspire, connect and enrich our lives. At their best, they reveal architecture’s immense potential to respond to pressing societal needs, creating environments that uplift communities. As the 13th A+Awards season continues, we look forward to discovering more innovative projects that push the boundaries of design. The A+Awards celebrate architectural achievements on a global scale, inviting architects everywhere to submit their work and join the movement toward a more inclusive, sustainable and inspiring built environment. This Thanksgiving, we give thanks for architects who shape our world for the better, reminding us that great architecture has the power to improve lives, one project at a time. The latest edition of “Architizer: The World’s Best Architecture” — a stunning, hardbound book celebrating the most inspiring contemporary architecture from around the globe — is now available.
