  "text": "314 Architecture Studio sculpts fluid facade for dessert shopIn a lively corner of Psyrri, one of Athens’ most characterful and fast-changing neighborhoods, 314 Architecture Studio introduces EteroLukumas, a compact dessert shop that feels more like a sculptural installation than a typical storefront. Just 20 square meters in size, the space serves Greek donuts, known as ‘loukoumades’ and ice cream, behind a facade lined with ceramic tiles.images courtesy of 314 Architecture StudioEteroLukumas channels mid-century athenian homesThe shop sits in a spot that’s tucked away and highly visible at the same time. Rather than competing with the noise and texture of the area, a mix of small shops, bars, workshops, and pedestrian routes, the Athens-based architects introduce soft, curved forms that feel calming. Materials were chosen with care and memory in mind. The ceramic tiles, for example, echo those found in many Athenian homes from the 1950s and ’60s. That nod to the past is intentional, a way of quietly honoring the city’s built heritage, especially the handmade details that are becoming rarer in new construction.314 Architecture Studio draws loosely from the flowing lines of Art Nouveau as a starting point for shaping the space. Inside, there are no hard corners or partitions, with a central column blending into the ceiling and walls, creating a fluid surface that feels carved. From the street, EteroLukumas‘ openings are shaped in such a way that they invite people in without fully revealing the interior.This small project puts emphasis on mood, texture, and atmosphere over big gestures, offering a soft counterpoint to the city’s usual intensity.314 Architecture Studio introduces EteroLukumasa compact dessert shop that feels more like a sculptural installation than a typical storefrontjust 20 square meters in size, the space serves Greek donuts314 Architecture Studio draws loosely from the flowing lines of Art Nouveaumaterials were chosen with care and memory in mind",
