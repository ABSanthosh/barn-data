But how does this impact you? What are the biggest challenges you face in your role? And where do you see the future of architectural practice heading? Architizer is launching the State of Architecture Survey 2025, an in-depth global study designed to capture the insights, frustrations and aspirations of architects, designers, marketers, project managers, business developers and other industry professionals. This is your opportunity to share your perspective and contribute to a broader understanding of the state of the industry today.
