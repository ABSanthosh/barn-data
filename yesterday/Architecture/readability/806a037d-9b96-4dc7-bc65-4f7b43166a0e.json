Photo: Royal Thai Army - 1st Development Division, Sarakadee Magazine, Mr.Srirath Somsawat Project Description: \"Benjakitti Park, an urban oasis in Bangkok, was developed on the site of a former tobacco factory, spanning 720,000 sq.m. It serves as an educational hub focused on ecology, hydrology, and the environment. The park retains 128,000 cu.m. of rainwater, the urban runoff and sewage purified through bioremediation, producing 1,600 cu.m. of clean water daily. Addressing floods and droughts using nature-based solutions and inspired by traditional Thai agricultural wisdom, it acts as a 'sponge,' absorbing and releasing water as needed. The park provides a thriving wildlife habitat, housing 360 tree species and attracting over 169 bird species and various insects, transforming former swampland into a rich ecosystem. Sustainable techniques are incorporated throughout, including the reuse of materials and the repurposing of old factory buildings for museums and sports centers. Benjakitti Forest Park exemplifies sustainable design and construction practices, setting a model for urban development while creating a safe and vibrant space for the community and its wildlife. Accessible to all, it offers a diverse, nature-centric experience, functioning as a biodiverse classroom for city dwellers.\"Emerging Landscape Architect of the Year: Cheng-Wei LeeConstruction Product Design of the Year: System 02 by The Backcountry Hut Company Construction Product Design of the Year: System 02​ by The Backcountry Hut Company.

It serves as an educational hub focused on ecology, hydrology, and the environment. The park retains 128,000 cu.m. of rainwater, the urban runoff and sewage purified through bioremediation, producing 1,600 cu.m. of clean water daily. Addressing floods and droughts using nature-based solutions and inspired by traditional Thai agricultural wisdom, it acts as a \u0026#39;sponge,\u0026#39; absorbing and releasing water as needed.\nThe park provides a thriving wildlife habitat, housing 360 tree species and attracting over 169 bird species and various insects, transforming former swampland into a rich ecosystem. Sustainable techniques are incorporated throughout, including the reuse of materials and the repurposing of old factory buildings for museums and sports centers.\nBenjakitti Forest Park exemplifies sustainable design and construction practices, setting a model for urban development while creating a safe and vibrant space for the community and its wildlife. Accessible to all, it offers a diverse, nature-centric experience, functioning as a biodiverse classroom for city dwellers.\u0026#34;\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eEmerging Landscape Architect of the Year: Cheng-Wei Lee\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConstruction Product Design of the Year: System 02 by The Backcountry Hut Company\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://archinect.gumlet.io/uploads/we/weqqtjez4qtih4nx.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat\" title=\"Construction Product Design of the Year: System 02​ by The Backcountry Hut Company.
