  "text": "Fumiaso Architect and Associates renovates 80-year-old houseFumiaso Architect and Associates transforms an 80-year-old traditional house near the summit of Kamiyama Town, Japan, into Homarenomori, a resort that connects the surrounding mountains with the city below. This project repurposes the main house, retaining its central structure while demolishing and reusing materials from adjacent livestock barns and other extensions. ‘When I thought about the construction, I couldn’t help but feel that it was a lot of trouble to transport materials to such a remote mountain area and go to town to dump the garbage,’ shares Fumi Aso, lead architect at Fumiaso Architect and Associates. ‘So we thought that we should consider the demolished buildings other than the main house as resources for this place and reuse them as much as possible without throwing them away.’  all images by Yousuke Ohtake, courtesy of Fumiaso Architect and Associatesreusing materials and elements from the original structuresLocated about 30 minutes by car from Kamiyama Town’s center, a winding path surrounded by lush forest, plum groves, and expansive views of the sky and mountains leads to the site. Japanese firm Fumiaso Architect and Associates respects the existing architecture by reusing earth, wood, and metal from the original structures. Key elements, like beams and pillars from the cowshed, are cut and reinforced to support the main house, while floorboards are cleaned, sanded, and used for ceilings and stairs. Galvalume sheets from the old buildings are repurposed to encourage new interactions within the site.In keeping with a minimalist approach, the team adds new walls only where necessary to enhance structural strength. The original exterior walls of the main house are reinforced to maintain stability, while interior walls are intentionally thin, creating fluid transitions that connect spaces while subtly distinguishing quiet from lively areas. The design flows effortlessly from indoor to outdoor spaces, creating a natural connection between everyday life and the remarkable surroundings. This setup encourages easy interaction, offers a unique sense of time and season specific to the area, and invites visitors to connect with the landscape and the local community.Fumiaso Architect and Associates transforms an 80-year-old traditional houseHomarenomori is located amid a verdant area in japanHomarenomori began when the client shared a vision of creating a place that bridges the upstream and downstream areas of Tokushima, though the exact location was initially undetermined. Three years later, they found the site in Kamiyama, an hour from Tokushima City. Kamiyama, a town gaining a unique mix of rural and urban appeal, hosts various co-working spaces, tech offices, and accommodations, drawing young professionals and combining traditional and contemporary cultures. The site lies deep in Kamiyama, accessible by a small road from the national highway. Visitors pass through a gate into dense greenery, with coniferous forests giving way to sunny spaces framed by the plum groves along the road. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a breathtaking view of mountains and sky, setting the scene for a retreat that harmonizes with its natural surroundings. The original house was dim and smoky due to years of use, with soot-darkened interiors and structural pillars resting on stones instead of foundations, providing a rustic, grounded character that the renovation aims to honor and refine.Homarenomori is a resort that connects the surrounding mountains with the town belowthis project repurposes the main house, retaining its central structuredemolishing and reusing materials from adjacent livestock barns and other extensionsreusing earth, wood, and metal from the original structures",
