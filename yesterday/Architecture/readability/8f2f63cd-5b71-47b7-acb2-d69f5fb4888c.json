  "text": "This week, the Sarasota Orchestra’s Board of Directors named William Rawn Associates (WRA) as the architect for the forthcoming Music Center. WRA was selected following a search that invited architecture firms to submit their qualifications to design the new arts venue. The Sarasota Orchestra’s Music Center will be located at 5701 Fruitville Road east of downtown Sarasota, Florida. Boston-based firm, William Rawn Associates, will collaborate closely with executive architect HKS and Stages Consultants, who will handle acoustics and theater planning. In April last year, Sarasota Orchestra acquired the 32-acre site valued at $14 million to establish a new music and arts location. The property, located just off Fruitville Road, lies within a bustling commercial area. Initially, the orchestra explored building a new facility in Payne Park, near downtown; however, when that option proved unfeasible, it began searching for an alternative site. “There were several criteria. One was to be able to have enough acreage to achieve long-term goals,” said Sarasota Orchestra President and CEO Joe McKenna in Observer. “Another was the ability to build up to 110 feet in order to create a concert hall. You need cubic volume of space to create that acoustic, and that’s really done by the width and height of the building.” Plans for the center include an 1,800-seat main performance hall, a 700-seat flexible space for chamber music and special events, and multiple rehearsal rooms. A reception area for donor and community events, administrative offices, and are also part of the vision. The Music Center will be one of only four dedicated acoustic concert halls in Florida. Also in Sarasota design work is underway on the Sarasota Performing Arts Center. The waterfront building will be designed by Renzo Piano. In its architecture selection process for Music Center, the Sarasota Orchestra’s Board of Directors said it was looking for an architecture firm with a “collaborative spirit,” an exemplary portfolio of past experience, the commitment to “an artistic vision,” and the ability and capacity to deliver the project on time and within budget. The orchestra’s board and the owner’s representative, Garfield Public/Private, invited architectural firms that met these standards to submit proposals for the project. “This decision was made with the utmost care from our Board and marks a defining moment in the realization of our Music Center,” said Sarasota Orchestra Board Chair Tom Koski. “With William Rawn Associates as our design architect, we can now truly begin to picture what this space will look and feel like for our community.” William Rawn Associates has a demonstrated record designing notable performing arts venues, among these Boston Symphony Orchestra’s Seiji Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood, the Music Center at Strathmore, and more. Work is already underway on the concept development phase. William Rawn Associates has attended concerts and events and met with the orchestra board, senior staff, local arts leaders, and other key stakeholders. Input from Sarasota Orchestra musicians will also play a crucial role as planning continues. In the early design stages, William Rawn Associates will develop the overall direction and visual identity for the Music Center, while HKS, the executive architect, will oversee the transition from design to construction. Sarasota Orchestra hopes to have an initial design concept in early 2025.",
