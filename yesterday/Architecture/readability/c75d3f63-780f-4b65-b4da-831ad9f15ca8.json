However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links.Airbnbs with indoor pools (especially the heated kind) are the kinds of “needle in a haystack” rentals that can save a vacation from feeling completely miserable on the coldest months of the year, or heighten the excitement of the enclave you’ve secured for a week of summer bliss. And though any of your standard Airbnb rentals will offer guests some generous amenities—a plush bed, a functional kitchen, and a high-pressure shower immediately come to mind—only a very select few allow you to book a pool that's all yours (not shared, or fought over, by a bunch of resort guests).Needless to say, a sheltered swimming pool surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows is even better for locking in this vacation and tuning everything else out. And you might be surprised to know this, but there’s a decent range of Airbnbs around the country with indoor pool options—from East Coast cabins to Southern cabanas—for you to retreat to all year-round.We can’t think of a better way to spend summer Fridays than soaking in a heated saltwater pool with a scenic backdrop and some of your nearest and dearest, can you? Without further ado, the best Airbnbs with indoor pools (i.e., where we are mentally right this moment).Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Mountain and vineyard views, outdoor diningWhile many people head straight to Napa Valley to sip and swill at the wineries there, real oenophiles know that on the East Coast, Virginia’s wine country is one of the next big up and coming destinations for first-class vino. If you appreciate architecture as much as sipping on a Cabernet Franc, this modern beauty designed by award-winning architect Hugh Newell Jacobsen is a beautiful place to call home for a weekend. Light streams in from every angle thanks to skylights and floor-to-ceiling windows throughout, which also provide views of the Blue Ridge Mountains and Veritas Vineyard. Clean-lined furnishings and palettes of soft neutrals also combine with the stunning vistas on all sides to soothe the senses. From $1,256 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Waterfront, private dock, chef’s kitchenSet along South Carolina’s Intracoastal Waterway, this abode offers visitors the opportunity to take a dip both inside and out, thanks to its waterfront location and indoor pool with wide French doors that open onto the patio. The sprawling Lowcountry style has three stories of quintessentially Southern wraparound porches for taking in panoramic views of the water, while the interiors offer a host of amenities including a bar, billiards table, and a luxurious kitchen complete with an oversize island for cheffing up a giant meal (this place sleeps 13, so multiple guests are more than welcome). While you’re here, you may as well make the most of the location, and your very own private dock, by renting a boat and spending a day out on the water. From $2,408 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Hot tub, home gym, kid-friendly bunk roomWho said a family-friendly vacation and an elegantly designed landing pad can’t go hand in hand? This luxurious mansion’s serene décor in nautical shades of blue and white sets the backdrop for an escape that both children and adults will love. With four bedrooms on the property, including a bunk room that sleeps five kids, you might consider asking another family or two to join in on the fun. The indoor pool and hot tub, high-end kitchen, home gym, and home theater-esque living room ensure everyone will find a way to stay busy. Beyond games of Marco Polo in the roomy indoor pool illuminated by skylights, outdoor games and meals can be enjoyed in the massive backyard with a charming pond. From $1,868 per night.Perks: Mountain views, electric car charger, laundryColorado is a state known for its epic ski resorts and wintery locales, but in the city of Colorado Springs, all kinds of adventures await you when you book into this Southwestern-style home that feels all but plucked out of the desert. The jewel of the home is its long stretch of indoor pool that heats up to 90 degrees Fahrenheit so you can break a sweat even when it’s in the single digits outside. Spread across multiple levels that include plenty of terraces for enjoying the great outdoors, you can also get up and close and personal with nature on any of the surrounding hiking trails (including the ones that snake through Pulpit Rock Park and Garden of the Gods). From $755 per night.Perks: Game room, community activities, fireplacesYou’d be forgiven for forgetting that you’d booked into a mountain lodge while you lay supine in the middle of its lavish heated pool and hot tub. Here, it can be summer all year round, so we’d suggest you start making enquiries to pals about who’s ready to throw down on a winter vacation. The entire home sleeps 12 people comfortably, and after you’ve enjoyed a day of skiing at the nearby Camelback resort, tee up an Xbox game or venture to the actual game room to perfect your ping-pong serve or to smoke everyone at poker. Personally, we’re placing bets on this being the kind of place you’ll want to book out every year. From $1,539 per night.Perks: Central location, bocce ball court, laundrySome East Coasters fly South for the winter to the tropics to escape the bone-chilling winters. Others, head straight to desert (and if you’ve ever booked into a sprawling adobe house with its own heated indoor pool, we’re certain that you’ll understand why). Here, you can while away the days in the water, burn through your Goodreads goal in the beautiful library that features wall-to-wall bookshelves, or enjoy some peace and quiet in the serene white-walled rooms that let you rest and recharge for another day in the desert sun. From $1,979 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Private patio, laundry, baby gatesFor New York City dwellers who are still looking for that upstate escape, look no further. At the base of the Adirondacks, about four hours north of Manhattan, an unassuming lodgelike cabin comes with a 2,000-square-foot pool house (and a cozy indoor pool dug out directly within). Stop over here for a long weekend, or if you still need to log in and make an appearance on a Zoom now and then, considering working remotely from the house’s stylish workstation complete with high-speed Wi-Fi, then retreat to the living room for some R\u0026R. From $253 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Sauna, beach and harbor views, outdoor showerWith enough space for 12 guests divided among four bedrooms, this wooded enclave along the Acushnet River is the place for going in with a large group of pals. There may be four sprawling places to sleep, but the area that will likely get the most traffic is the indoor pool and private sauna. Otherwise, park yourself in front of any of the massive windows with a cup of tea (or glass of wine) and admire either the harbor or beach views. From $913 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Sauna, hot tub, barThe biggest perk of this rustic five-bedroom chalet in Plymouth, Vermont, is its proximity to Okemo Mountain and the slopes of Killington Peak. But after a long day on the slopes, your aching limbs might need a cooldown, which is where the home’s sizable indoor pool comes in. Surrounded by stone walkways and a comfy seating area, plus accompanied by a wood-paneled sauna, the pool area offers several ways to unwind. Elsewhere, the cozy cabin invites you in with a stone fireplace and modern amenities like smart TVs and central heating. Large windows throughout the home also let you take in the stunning views of surrounding mountains as you lounge or share meals. From $1,675 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Home gym, game room, mountain and desert viewsThis amazing home in Tucson’s Catalina Foothills features an indoor pool with a second-story walking track, a home gym, and an extensive game room that encourages some healthy competitiveness. Guests have access to the entire home, which consists of four bedrooms and seven bathrooms—so go ahead and invite everyone on the group chat. When (or if) you decide to venture out, you’ll find yourself in close proximity to several great hiking trails, shops, restaurants, and golf courses that let you practice your swing. From $483 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Game room, bar, fireplaceWith seven bedrooms spread across 5,400 square feet, this Henryville, Pennsylvania, estate is the place to be for anyone who appreciates a white winter as much as Bing Crosby. Not only does it boast a full-size volleyball court, but there’s also a heated indoor pool that gazes out onto the lush Poconos just outside. The whole home was recently renovated, offering guests sweet new amenities in just about every room—one being the gourmet kitchen, which features sparkling new appliances. From $2,244 per night.On 33 private acres in Narrowsburg, New York, a historic estate features about every amenity imaginable, including an indoor pool. Photo: George HaleemPerks: Mountain views, fishing ponds, saunaThe misleading name of the town aside, there’s nothing small about this property. In fact, with 13 bedrooms, two fishing ponds, and 33 acres of land to explore, you may not even need to venture off the property. With all that space, it’s hardly surprising that this classic sideboard farmhouse even thought to include an indoor pool. There’s also a sauna and hot tub on one side and a game room complete with a slate pool table, a stylish bar, and a card table on the other. From $3,176 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Mountain views, hiking trails, pondThis custom-built lodge is situated on 19 private acres of land in the mountains of Pennsylvania, with 5,400 feet of lush wilderness to admire—including a private pond—from the heated indoor pool, which sits on the lower level of a two-story loft space clad in warm cedar wood planks. There’s even a firepit. For anyone willing to brave the cold, the private pool area houses the largest of the home’s five decks and boasts tables with room for 12 along with a collection of Adirondack chairs. Though the snowcapped mountain landscapes are quite visible from just about any of the estate’s rooms—including the six bedrooms and great room with high ceilings and a fireplace—the views are best from this particular terrace. Otherwise, immerse yourself in the surrounding nature by taking to the hiking trails. From $1,641 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Mountain views, game room, fireplaceLocated in the quaint mountain town of Sevierville, Tennessee, this stunning home includes six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms (so you won’t have to complain about anyone taking ages in the loo). It accommodates up to 24 of your nearest and dearest—with probably room to spare for some new acquaintances too. Take in breathtaking views of the Smoky Mountain range that surrounds the five-acre property from the porch. Or spend your days making like a mermaid in your very own indoor grotto complete with a waterfall and lazy-river-style shape that circulates around a picturesque center island. When you’re ready to head back to land (and venture beyond your domain), take a short car ride into town to explore all that Pigeon Forge has to offer. From $1,549 per night.Courtesy of AirbnbPerks: Fireplace, hot tub, saunaSkiers and snowboarders headed to the rugged mountains of Big Sky can enjoy a special après ski experience by way of this 25,000-square-foot estate with a 60 foot heated indoor pool, hot tub, and sauna. After working up an appetite in the deep end, you can pop over to the chef’s kitchen and adjacent dining room (which features two dining tables that seat up to 12 people each) for a recovery meal. Or, for the more traditional chalet experience, sit back and relax in front of the floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace in the living room, which is the definition of rustic coziness thanks to its beamed ceilings and warm décor. From $7,832 per night.Photo: Lauren ArzbaecherCraving an escape?

In fact, with 13 bedrooms, two fishing ponds, and 33 acres of land to explore, you may not even need to venture off the property.

There’s even a firepit. For anyone willing to brave the cold, the private pool area houses the largest of the home’s five decks and boasts tables with room for 12 along with a collection of Adirondack chairs. Though the snowcapped mountain landscapes are quite visible from just about any of the estate’s rooms—including the six bedrooms and great room with high ceilings and a fireplace—the views are best from this particular terrace. Otherwise, immerse yourself in the surrounding nature by taking to the hiking trails. \u003cem\u003eFrom $1,641 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Airbnb\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePerks:\u003c/strong\u003e Mountain views, game room, fireplace\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eLocated in the quaint mountain town of Sevierville, Tennessee, this stunning home includes six bedrooms and seven and a half bathrooms (so you won’t have to complain about anyone taking ages in the loo).

Take in breathtaking views of the Smoky Mountain range that surrounds the five-acre property from the porch. Or spend your days making like a mermaid in your very own indoor grotto complete with a waterfall and lazy-river-style shape that circulates around a picturesque center island.
