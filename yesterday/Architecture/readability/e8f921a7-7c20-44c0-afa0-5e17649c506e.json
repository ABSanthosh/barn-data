  "text": "raúl sánchez places casa magarola on a hillside in spainRaúl Sánchez Architects’ Casa Magarola set in the hills of Sant Cugat del Vallès, just outside of Barcelona, is a light-infused home perched on the side of steep terrain. The house is constructed on a slope inclined at a 45° level, and from the upper street it presents as a compact, geometric volume that is reserved, almost opaque. But as one descends, its form reveals its gentle touch on the earth at only a few points, suspended by a minimal structural system that preserves the rocky slate terrain almost entirely intact.A series of slender concrete ‘legs’ — strategically placed structural screens — anchor the house along its facades and central core, lifting it above the slope. These vertical elements carry thin, 20-centimeter concrete floor slabs, enabling a lightweight structural profile that reduces the project’s physical and environmental footprint. Access thus begins with a cantilevered staircase at the side of the house which leads to a large entry terrace doubling as an outdoor extension of the kitchen. From this point, interior and exterior spaces merge fluidly. all images courtesy of Raúl Sánchez Architectsconsidering the relationship between structure and terrainRaúl Sánchez Architects has integrated four large sliding glass panels that connect the kitchen-dining area with the balcony, and a continuous bench lines the fully glazed facade facing the valley, framing views of the surrounding trees and distant mountains. The spatial arrangement favors openness, as a central core organizes circulation and services while freeing the periphery for movement, daylight, and views. A double-height void also punctuates the plan, connecting both levels with a subtle theatricality.This relationship between structure and terrain is the most defining aspect of the project. Rather than imposing a conventional platform or cutting into the hillside, the Barcelona-based architects allow the house to hover, resulting in minimal disturbance to the site. Only two trees were removed from a densely wooded plot of more than forty, and the slope remains largely untouched despite its challenging incline.Raúl Sánchez Architects completes Casa Magarolanatural tones and materials root the house in its contextThe design also reconsiders how domestic architecture welcomes its occupants, beginning with deviating from the need for a traditional front door. Raúl Sánchez Architects fosters an approach to the house that culminates in just a spatial gesture of hospitaly. A long slab of cast concrete and ceppo di gré stone forms a communal dining table on the terrace, echoing the Scarpa-like idea of stairs and thresholds as spatial invitations.A restrained palette of colors and textures runs throughout Casa Magarola, grounded in local materials. From the earthy yellow tones of the external facades to the inward-facing balconies and shaded openings, the architecture balances exposure and enclosure. On the valley-facing side, however, the building opens fully to the landscape, distinguished by a lighter tone that contrasts gently with the rest of the volume. This careful modulation of facade expression, coupled with the golden ratio used in its proportions, achieves a sense of compositional harmony without overt formalism.Sustainability is embedded into the house at multiple levels. A radiant floor system paired with aerothermal heating and cooling, photovoltaic panels, natural cross ventilation, and thermal insulation on all surfaces, including the underside of the ground slab, combine to produce a high-performance envelope. Rainwater is collected and reused, while the use of locally sourced materials furthers the project’s environmental sensitivity.set in the hills of Sant Cugat del Vallès, just outside of Barcelonafrom the upper street it presents as a compact, geometric volume that is reserved, almost opaqueentered via the sidea long slab of cast concrete and ceppo di gré stone forms a communal dining table on the terracefour large sliding glass panels connect the kitchen-dining area with the balconya restrained palette of colors and textures runs throughout Casa Magarola, grounded in local materials.",
