  "text": "ucca: an homage to Yixing’s Pottery CultureThe UCCA ceramics museum, designed by beloved Japanese studio Kengo Kuma and Associates, is a new addition for Yixing, a city celebrated for its rich tradition in pottery, especially purple clay pottery. Known as the ‘pottery city,’ the area has a long-standing history of ceramic production, making it an ideal location for a museum dedicated to this craft. Thus, the site of the museum was once a hub for pottery culture, surrounded by numerous factories and studios. This project aligns with the broader redevelopment plan for the area, aiming to create a vibrant center for pottery culture that includes studios and workshops while preserving the remnants of former pottery factories. With its undulating rooftop clad in a skin of ceramic panels, the project stands as a sculptural landmark for the Chinese city.UCCA ceramics museum was designed by Kengo Kuma and Associates in Yixing, China | image ©︎ Tian Fangfangkengo kuma learns from the heritage of ‘pottery city’With the design of its ceramics museum UCCA, the team at Kengo Kuma and Associates take inspiration from a mountain known as Shushan. This nearby mountain is said to be cherished by Su Dongpo, which the architects describe as a prominent literary figure from the Northern Song Dynasty. What’s more, the ceramic-clad structure nods to the legacy of the dragon kiln, a climbing kiln that has been in operation for over six hundred years. The building’s sinuous, peaking form is designed to mimic the profile of a mountain range, further integrating the historical and geographic context of the region. Strategically placed openings in this mountain-shaped volume establish connections to nearby pottery factories and the canal, furthering the site’s accessibility and reinforcing its historical significance.Yixing is known for its purple clay pottery and has a rich history of ceramic production | image ©︎ Tian Fangfangdynamic interiors beneath an inverted shell roofThe UCCA museum’s structure by architect Kengo Kuma is recognized at once by its inverted shell roof, shaped by a virtual sphere and supported by four layers of wooden lattice beams. These beams are at once structural and lightweight, and create a dynamic interior space. The arrangement of the beams influences the movement and line of sight within the museum, inviting visitors to explore deeper into the building and engage with the exhibits.The museum’s facade was developed through collaboration with local craftspeople, ensuring that the design reflects the essence of Yixing’s pottery culture. As the architects note, the surface of the facade is intentionally uneven, and the glaze applied creates a gradient of color that changes with the time of day and seasons. This design approach results in a rich variety of textures and visual expressions, allowing visitors to experience the ‘temperature’ of pottery in a tangible way. The architects explain: ‘The ceramic panels, which have a warmth like Chinese tea utensils and a slightly rough texture of the clay particles, embody the history and culture of this pottery city that has been passed down for over 1,000 years.’the site was once home to pottery factories now part of a broader redevelopment plan | image ©︎ Tian Fangfangthe building’s mountain-like form was inspired by nearby Shushan mountain range | image ©︎ Eiichi Kanoopenings in the structure connect it to nearby factories and the canal | image ©︎ Eiichi Kano",
