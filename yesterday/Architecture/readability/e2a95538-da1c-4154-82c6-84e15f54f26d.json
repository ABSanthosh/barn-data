  "text": "In Almaty, the Kazakhstan city that sits in the foothills of the Trans-Ili Alatau Mountains, Fariz Mamedov of FM Interiors has reimagined a 388-square-foot apartment that’s bold, bright, and lively. While it draws on Nordic interiors for inspiration, it goes beyond any single design approach to become something truly unique.A corner of the living room with a Jaime Hayon rug for Nanimarquina, a locally made custom sofa, a Manhattan SC52 table lamp by \u0026Tradition, a La Redoute coffee table, an Ekstrem Terje Ekstrøm chair by Varier, a Tung blue table by \u0026Tradition, and an hourglass by Hay. The owner, a man who works in technology management and consulting, is passionate about travel and pop music. He regularly flies around the world to see his favorite artists in concert. A design fan to boot, he is the owner of an impressive vinyl collection, and loves to cook.A colorful corner of the dining room. Ant chairs by Fritz Hansen and Rey chairs by Bruno Rey for Hay; Hive suspension lamp by Verner Panton of Verpan; custom table made by a local plastic recycling company, RocketPlastic, from old bottle caps; Ikebana vase designed by Jaime Hayon for Fritz Hansen. “At first, the client came to me with images of traditional Japanese interiors that he had seen on Pinterest.” says Mamedov. “But during the first meeting we discovered that he was actually much closer to a more colorful and Scandinavian vision for the interiors.” The project became one of creating a cozy living space. The client also told Mamedov that “he was ready to make bold decisions,” which gave the designer some experimental freedom.In the living room lies a Jaime Hayon rug for Nanimarquina; an Am.Pm floor lamp; PH 31⁄2 table lamps by Louis Poulsen, and a Manhattan SC52 by \u0026Tradition; a La Redoute coffee table. The yellow ottoman is a vintage find. After several discussions with the client, Mamedov decided to create a soft architectural and decorative foundation for the apartment. It would serve as a backdrop for more iconic design elements—the chairs, lamps, rugs, and artwork. The architect-client collaboration was synergistic, as they studied the interior and carefully curated furniture in tandem.The hallway leading to the living area. The apartment’s small footprint presented some difficulties in the design phase. “But at the same time, the size proved to be an important advantage: It forced us to maximize the use of the space that was available,” Mamedov explains. “Also, we waited for some pieces for a long time because of the current geopolitical situation, and not everything we wanted was readily available.” For example, they waited an extra six months to get Verner Panton’s Hive lamp and install it. “We also searched for a long time for the most suitable dining table for this space,” Mamedov says.The living area features vibrant colors and designer pieces. Ant chair by Fritz Hansen; Hive hanging lamp, Verner Panton by Verpan; custom table by a local company; Ikebana vase designed by Jaime Hayon for Fritz Hansen. The space is organized with an emphasis on a functionality, with a separate sleeping area, a dedicated kitchen space, a bathroom with laundry, and storage space created to fit the client’s active lifestyle. “I divided the apartment into several ‘blocks,’ defining them with colors, furnishings, and fabrics. To soften the space, we introduced rounded walls and arched openings. We also added mirrored elements in the kitchen area and on the hidden bathroom door to amplify the rooms,” explains Mamedov.The custom kitchen in wood and white is flanked by a mirrored wall that visually amplifies the space. Through careful research, a lively, light, and colorful scene took shape. Color was introduced through textiles and furniture: a rug by Jaime Hayon, a chair by Ekstrem, and a custom dining table made from recycled plastic bottle caps. “We chose a warm shade of Jotun paint for the walls and ceiling. We decided not to use parquet or tiles, but concrete the same color as the walls. This dissolved the boundaries between the different spaces and created an overall fluid feel,” Mamedov says. The result? A cozy and comfortable atmosphere, wherein the space appears even lighter and softer. “To make the environment warmer and more appealing to the sense of touch, we made part of the kitchen out of natural solid wood,” Mamedov continues.Every corner of the house has been carefully optimized to maximize functionality and make the most of the space that was available. The bedroom opens onto the living room. On the modular nightstand by Kartell sits a Verner Panton flower vase for \u0026Tradition and a Pantop Verpan portable lamp. The Bit stool is a Simon Legald design for Normann Copenhagen. This 388-square-foot apartment was styled by Fariz Mamedov and Aigerim Mamyraliyeva. It was originally published in AD Italy.",
