  "text": "Following her May 2024 wedding to actor Jake Bongiovi (son of rockstar Jon Bon Jovi), Millie Bobby Brown has settled into an idyllic life surrounded by animals on a Georgia farm—but don’t call her a trad wife. “I’m not doing it for the aesthetic,” the Stranger Things actor said in a new interview with Vanity Fair. “I’m doing it because I love it. There are maybe some trad wives out there doing it because it seems wholesome, but it is not. If you’re not picking up horse shit or washing a cow with your bare hands, then that life is not made for you. At all.”In the cover story for the magazine’s latest issue, Brown opened up about life at her rural home, which she shares with Bongiovi, numerous dogs, sheep, goats, cows, horses, and a tuxedo cat. “You think animals are peaceful,” the Enola Holmes star told the outlet. “But there’s so much chaos. My animals are loud, and it’s messy and my dogs are crazy. And there is, you know, laughter and a lot of passion and excitement, and it is a very vibrant place. There is so much chaos, and that is where I thrive.” The actor shares glimpses of the farm on Instagram, where she has posted videos of herself happily caring for her many animals.The 20-year-old’s country lifestyle spilled over to her life on set while filming the final season of Stranger Things, which is set to come out later this year. Per VF, Brown, who is currently taking online veterinary science classes, could sometimes be found bottle-feeding a baby goat in her trailer and often had foster dogs in tow.Join NowBecome an AD PRO member for only $25 $20 per month + receive an exclusive toteArrowThe fosters are from the British actor’s animal rescue organization, Joey’s Friends, which she runs from a “she shed” on her sprawling property, according to the outlet. Elsewhere on the bucolic grounds are a stable and a “cozy barn,” the latter of which is home to dogs rescued from local kill shelters. One dog in particular, a bulldog named Mama who was transferred from actor Nicola Peltz Beckham’s animal rescue, seems to have it made with her own teensy living quarters—complete with a mini treadmill and a TV set to play a digital Yule log. “Mama got donations from Nicola’s fans,” Brown explained. Considering that even her foster dogs live in style, our fingers are crossed that Brown someday shows off how she’s decorated her own quarters.",
