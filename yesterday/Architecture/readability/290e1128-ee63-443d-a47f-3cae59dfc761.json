The property is an amalgam of lush, untamed vegetation, and is less than a half mile from the mainland. The château itself covers some 3,230 square feet, and another 2.3 acres of land can accommodate a vast garden. There are 200 different species of trees, shrubs, and flowers on the small island.The Lithuanian-Polish genius chose this island on on Brittany’s Pink Granite Coast for his home. © Bretagne Nord Sotheby's International RealtyThe island was long a meeting place for members of the Polish intelligentsia living in France and the castle was a source of inspiration for writers including Henryk Sienkiewicz, author of Quo Vadis, first published in 1895 (the year the château was constructed). This book would go on to become an international success translated into many languages. The writer was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1905. Architecturally, the Breton building is spread over four levels and a basement, with period features such as the fully preserved Knights’ Hall. An impressive reception room and a banqueting hall add to its splendor.In term so of modern amenities, the five-bedroom house also boasts a TV room, several terraces, a fitness room, a heated swimming pool with massage jets, and separate outbuildings for guests. As befits a private island, there are also two sandy beaches where you can swim in peace and quiet. Two docks make it easy to travel by boat between the island and the mainland while at low tide, the island can also be reached on foot or by 4x4 vehicles.The French private island and accompanying château at 9,500,000 euros, exclusively through Bretagne Nord Sotheby’s International Realty.Maison Trégastel, as listed on Sotheby’s, sits on over 100,00 square-feet of land. © Bretagne Nord Sotheby's International Realty",
