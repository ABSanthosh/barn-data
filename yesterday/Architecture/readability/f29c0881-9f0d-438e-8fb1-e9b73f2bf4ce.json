Repurposing a 40-year-old chemical research facility, the project converts six existing structures — formerly used as offices, warehouses, and dormitories — into a dynamic mixed-use destination. Located near university campuses and technology parks, The Yard introduces new public amenities including galleries, a library, a cinema, and retail, fostering cultural and academic engagement.The Yard by Neri\u0026Hu | all images by DONG Image unless stated otherwisethe yard: Adaptive Reuse and Urban Renewal The project centers around adaptive reuse, retaining the original U-shaped configuration of the buildings while introducing a cohesive design language. The formerly inward-facing complex, once anchored by a large parking lot, is now framed by an enclosed courtyard. Neri\u0026Hu Design and Research Office introduced a system of walls, screens, and canopies that reorients the site towards community use, reinforcing its potential as a social and cultural hub.Drawing inspiration from the spatial sequencing of Chinese gardens, the Shanghai-based team emphasized the site’s hidden, introspective character. A continuous architectural envelope creates a semi-private courtyard, wrapping the central plaza with layered screens and architectural interventions.
