However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.Ever dreamed of staying in a Frank Lloyd Wright Airbnb, Vrbo, or other rental property? Luckily for you, there are plenty. Of the 532 buildings designed and built by the great American architect Frank Lloyd Wright, a number have been demolished, others have been preserved and opened to the public, and even more are still in the hands of private owners. Many of them are available to tour—Fallingwater in Mill Run, Pennsylvania, and Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona, are two iconic sites—but far fewer are available to sleep in. While Wright’s designs pop up on the market fairly often, his homes are notoriously expensive to maintain and can be unofficial tourist attractions.If you’re not ready to make that investment, why not book a short-term stay in a Frank Lloyd Wright home for a weekend to test the waters? A number of his homes are on the rental market, whether for events or getaways. Here, we’ve rounded up 15 Frank Lloyd Wright homes—from the grand and sweeping properties to the cozy and intimate spaces—that are available to rent as vacation homes right now.Top Amenities: Wood fireplace, coffee and tea, midcentury furnitureOne of the newest rentals to the Frank Lloyd Wright market, RiverRock is extra special. As the architect’s last home designed ever—seriously, the blueprints were on his desk when he passed away—it’s a follow-up to a property he designed for artist and teacher Louis Penfield. In 2018, the current homeowner put the plans to work and the home was opened for rentals in early March 2025. Inside, you’ve got all the charm of an FLW home (warm wood paneling, iconic furniture, sweeping windows) spread between three bedrooms, and it’s a short 15-minute drive from Cleveland’s best sights. The home is surrounded by lush greenery; the 30 surrounding acres include the Chagrin River, which runs through the property, and the Metroparks system borders the home. From $800 per night.Top Amenities: Washer and dryer, sleeping porch, wood-burning fireplaceFirst off, Wright didn’t design this home…but he did grow up in it. Owned by his uncle, the architect spent summers here and found inspiration from the property’s surroundings. There are three of his projects within sight of the home: Taliesin, Unity Chapel (which houses his first project—the ceiling), and Hillside School. Five bedrooms can house up 12 people, and the massive wooden dining table seats 10. And while it wasn’t constructed by Wright himself, you can see where he might have gathered some inspiration, from its wood-paneled walls and exposed beam ceilings. From $250 per night.Top Amenities: Washer and dryer, workspace, record playerWright initially planned to build a 21-house Usonian community for a group of scientist friends who all worked at Upjohn in this town 10 miles east of Kalamazoo, Michigan, but only four homes were constructed in The Acres, including the three-bedroom Eppstein House. This home was built in 1953 for Samuel and Dorothy Eppstein. As an example of Wright’s Usonian style, the ranch-level home’s concrete and mahogany—a feature in the other three homes too—blend into the rolling landscape you can observe from one of the three terraces. Though the home spent 20 years in a state of neglect, owners Marika Broere and Tony Hillebrandt spent a year restoring it, debuting the property in 2017 and earning a spot on the National Register of Historic Places. Yet they also retained some of the roots to the original era, including a vinyl record collection and record player. From $550 per night.Top Amenities: Fast WiFi, dishwasher, fire pitThis stunning example of Wright’s Prairie Style was completed in 1911 for David and Hattie Amberg as a collaboration between Wright and Marion Mahony Griffin, the first female licensed architect in the US and an associate of Wright’s from 1896 to 1909. The home was thoroughly renovated between 2013 and 2016, with George Mann Niedecken and Stickley furnishings from the era completing the look. Overnight guests bunk in the house’s dedicated guest suite, which features a private entrance. Windows look out onto a waterfall, pond, and gardens, while a bedroom, bath, kitchen, and sitting area—as well as a dedicated workspace—are in the suite. Two blocks away is the Wright-designed Meyer May House, built in 1908-1909 and owned by Steelcase. (It’s open for tours, but not overnight stays.) The parents of Meyer May’s wife—Sophie May—commissioned Wright to design the Amberg House. From $239 per night.Top Amenities: French-press coffeemaker, beach access, dedicated workspaceIn 1938, Wright designed a “dream house” for an issue of Life magazine, which was to be built for the Blackbourne family of Minneapolis. However, the house was never realized due to a series of complications. Yet the architect was able to adapt the design with this 1940 home for Bernard Schwartz and his family, resulting in this four-bedroom Usonian home in Two Rivers, Wisconsin—about a three-hour drive from Wright’s own home, Taliesin. As seen on Netflix’s The World’s Most Amazing Vacation Rentals, it’s referred to as “Still Bend” and the “Bernard and Fern Schwartz House,” and it’s on the National Register of Historic Places. Another rare feature within Wright’s portfolio is the house’s two stories; most Usonians have one. The 63-foot-long living room features a wall of windows, plus a floor-to-ceiling fireplace and built-ins holding books. Co-owner Michael Ditmer stocked the home with period-specific decor, right down to the bar glassware. In a residential setting, the backyard faces the East Twin River and is a mile from the mighty Lake Michigan, one of the five Great Lakes. From $611 per night.Top Amenities: Patio, bathtub, backyardCrafted from brick and Wright’s signature tidewater cypress and based on an equilateral triangle design, this three-bedroom home spans two wooded acres only a mile from the University of Michigan’s campus. Completed in 1950 for William and Mary Palmer, who lived in the house until 2009, it features Wright’s signature long hipped roof boasting deep overhangs, as well as a cantilever above the terrace. Staying in this multilevel marvel is a true Wright immersion, as many Wright-designed furnishings (including four of his Origami chairs) and built-ins adorn the rooms. There’s even a typewriter in one of the bedrooms for a writer who needs a quiet retreat to pen the Great American Novel. In later years, Wright’s apprentice Jack Howe built a tea house on the property that has seasonal availability. From $800 per night.Top Amenities: Pool, Smart TV, sound systemThe house has been on and off the market for years, but you can still book a night or two at this Frank Lloyd Wright Airbnb within a rural area of Arizona’s largest city. Working with his apprentice John Rattenbury, Wright designed the three-bedroom home for Aimee and Norman Lykes just before his death in 1959, and Rattenbury shepherded the 1967 completion. As one of Wright’s 14 circular homes, the futuristic design flaunts overlapping concentric circles without compromising views of Palm Canyon. Globally sourced materials for the design include Philippine mahogany (another of Wright’s treasured woods), slate floors from India, and Italian rose marble. An outdoor pool is also included with the rental. From $2,495 per night.Top Amenities: Fireplace, BBQ grill, balconyThe only Wright house in Hawaii, this home has a unique and storied history. While the space was designed by Wright, he never actually built it. The home was completed in 1995, 36 years after his death, when Sanderson Sims partnered with the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, Taliesin Associated Architects and John Rattenbury to bring the plans to life. The home blends Wright’s style with the beauty of Hawaii through coral aggregate block in the walls or a lava-rock hot tub outside. Built into a hillside, the home offers breathtaking views of the ocean and three volcanoes. The home sleeps six comfortably, is close to a wide array of parks and beaches, and offers a spectacular view of three volcanoes. From $1,107 per night.Top Amenities: Outdoor dining space, air conditioning, WiFiEnjoy a cozy, 820-square-foot guest suite inside of one of Wright’s Usonian homes. Purchased in 1959, it was originally designed for S.P. “Pearl” Elam, a local jewelry-store owner, and his family. The guest suite includes one bedroom (with the option to add a futon or air mattress), a bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen. Guests can also tour the rest of the home with the owner and check out features like the three floor-to-ceiling fireplaces, Webster Electric Teletalk intercom system, beautiful stonework, and original plans for the home which are displayed. (Plus, the home is also located a mere five miles from the Spam museum.) From $275 per night.Top Amenities: Fitness center, BBQ grill, outdoor dining spaceOffering up the rare and wonderful opportunity to enjoy a Frank Lloyd Wright–designed home in a large city, this is one of the architect’s American System-Built homes—designed to provide beautiful housing for people with a variety of incomes. This home has three bedrooms and a sleeping porch, two and a half bathrooms, a fireplace, a lawn, and deck. The furniture is either period-appropriate or original built-ins. There are stunning stained glass and leaded windows throughout. The house is close to many of Milwaukee’s main attractions and part of a block of American System-Built Homes, which is the largest collection of this housing style in the country. From $298 per night.Top Amenities: Pets allowed, central air conditioning, Egyptian cotton linensYou can rent the entirety of this 1955 Usonian home and the grounds that surround it. Wright commissioned this home for Dr. Richard Davis, a surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, whom he met in 1950 while receiving care. With four bedrooms and four and a half baths, it is perfect for a family or group get together (not to mention pet-friendly). There have even been two weddings hosted on the property. The fireplace and firepit make it a welcoming spot in any season, and the dedicated work space means you could camp out there for quite a bit. With soaring ceilings and huge floor-to-ceiling windows, you will certainly feel connected to nature—and Frank Lloyd Wright. From $500 per night.Top Amenities: Bathtub, record player, board gamesThis two-bedroom, one-bath Usonian-style home built in 1940 is a new entry to Airbnb (it’s also open periodically for tours). Designed by Wright for two Michigan State University art professors, this property was the only one to be realized as part of a planned subdivision designed by Wright, similar to his plan for The Acres, also in Michigan. Like other Usonians, there’s a carport, fireplace, single-story layout, floor-to-ceiling windows, built-in furnishings, and heated floors. Unique to the house is that the art hung on the walls are by the home’s first owners. From $385 per night.Top Amenities: Piano, Bluetooth speaker system, indoor fireplaceTucked into The Acres subdivision and also home to Wright’s Eppstein House, this three-bedroom, 1.5-bath stay is adorned with mahogany and includes some of Wright’s furnishings designed for the house, including a dining table and built-in banquettes. While a solid example of Wright’s many Usonian-style homes, it’s also a rare Usonian Solar Hemicycle home, embodying a passive solar design that cools the structure with minimal energy use. (Another one is in Wisconsin, the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs II House.) Built between 1950 and 1951 for Curtis and Lillian Meyer, this is also larger than most Usonians, with two stories and checking in during the warmer months means a nice view of the property’s gardens. From $450 per night.Photo: Kit HoganTop Amenities: Indoor fireplace, outdoor dining area, massive windowsTucked into Mirror Lake State Park, this is Wright’s smallest residential commission, at only 880 square feet. The one-bedroom, one-bath cottage features a galley kitchen, two built-in dining tables, a stone fireplace, built-in banquette seating and a deck overlooking the park’s namesake lake. A major restoration effort during the late 1980s and early 1990s brought this cottage back to its original state, with overnight stays opening up in 1992. Three walls of windows coax in natural light and interior stone walls also seamlessly connect to the outdoors, even if it’s a cozy winter night. From $325 per night.Top Amenities: 30 wooded acres, fishing access, coffee and teaAs mentioned above, Penfield was one of Wright’s repeat clients. The three-bedroom home that inspired RiverRock is located minutes away from its sibling. This is a classic Usonian home with one special quirk—everything is a little bit taller to accommodate its six-foot-eight owner (Louis Penfield). The two-story living room windows allow a flood of light inside, overlooking the 30 acres it sits on. A special note about those windows: Wright strayed from his typical designs to craft thin, ribbon-like portals to compliment Penfield’s impressive height. From $450 per night.Courtesy of Frank Lloyd Wright OvernightTop Amenities: Patio, original built-ins, Ludowici tile roofThis stay is one part of Polymath Park, a 130-acre property where owners Tom and Heather Papinchak worked to dissemble and relocate two Wright-designed Usonians from other regions. The cantilevered roof is easily recognizable to Wright fans. The three-bedroom, two-bath home joins two other homes designed by Wright protégé Peter Berndtson, whose master plan for the Usonian-style community was unfortunately never fully realized. With a restaurant on site (Treetops Restaurant), guests can choose to eat most of their meals there or make use of the home’s kitchen. From $825 per night.Courtesy of Frank Lloyd Wright OvernightTop Amenities: WiFi, massive kitchen, indoor fireplaceAlso in Polymath Park, this Usonian was designed by Wright in 1957 for Donald and Elizabeth Duncan and remained in Lisle, Illinois, until 2004, two years after Donald’s death. Marshall Erdman, who worked on 11 of Wright’s prefab Usonians, was tapped as the builder and chose Masonite siding. With three bedrooms and two baths, guests can enjoy the home’s open layout, including cozying up in front of the stone floor-to-ceiling fireplace in an Eames-style lounge chair. Now relocated to Pennsylvania for restoration work, visitors can view the Cherokee red concrete floor and a stone fireplace, two hallmarks of Wright’s Usonian homes. From $675 per night.NNehring/Getty ImagesTop Amenities: Fitness center, pool table, free parkingThe Historic Park Inn Hotel is the last remaining hotel designed by Wright and was completed in 1910. It was originally used for multiple businesses—a bank, hotel, law office, and a handful of other commercial initiatives—before being restored in the early 2000s. Wright’s classic touches are sprinkled across 27 rooms: paneled windows, sculptural lighting, and expressive headboards. From $155 per night.Photo: Lauren ArzbaecherCraving an escape?

The house is close to many of Milwaukee’s main attractions and part of a block of American System-Built Homes, which is the largest collection of this housing style in the country. \u003cem\u003eFrom $298 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e Pets allowed, central air conditioning, Egyptian cotton linens\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eYou can rent the entirety of this 1955 Usonian home and the grounds that surround it. Wright commissioned this home for Dr. Richard Davis, a surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, whom he met in 1950 while receiving care. With four bedrooms and four and a half baths, it is perfect for a family or group get together (not to mention pet-friendly). There have even been two weddings hosted on the property. The fireplace and firepit make it a welcoming spot in any season, and the dedicated work space means you could camp out there for quite a bit. With soaring ceilings and huge floor-to-ceiling windows, you will certainly feel connected to nature—and Frank Lloyd Wright. \u003cem\u003eFrom $500 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e Bathtub, record player, board games\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis two-bedroom, one-bath Usonian-style home built in 1940 is a new entry to Airbnb (it’s also open periodically for tours). Designed by Wright for two Michigan State University art professors, this property was the only one to be realized as part of a planned subdivision designed by Wright, similar to his plan for The Acres, also in Michigan. Like other Usonians, there’s a carport, fireplace, single-story layout, floor-to-ceiling windows, built-in furnishings, and heated floors. Unique to the house is that the art hung on the walls are by the home’s first owners. \u003cem\u003eFrom $385 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e Piano, Bluetooth speaker system, indoor fireplace\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTucked into The Acres subdivision and also home to Wright’s Eppstein House, this three-bedroom, 1.5-bath stay is adorned with mahogany and includes some of Wright’s furnishings designed for the house, including a dining table and built-in banquettes. While a solid example of Wright’s many Usonian-style homes, it’s also a rare Usonian Solar Hemicycle home, embodying a passive solar design that cools the structure with minimal energy use. (Another one is in Wisconsin, the Herbert and Katherine Jacobs II House.) Built between 1950 and 1951 for Curtis and Lillian Meyer, this is also larger than most Usonians, with two stories and checking in during the warmer months means a nice view of the property’s gardens. \u003cem\u003eFrom $450 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003ePhoto: Kit Hogan\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e Indoor fireplace, outdoor dining area, massive windows\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTucked into Mirror Lake State Park, this is Wright’s smallest residential commission, at only 880 square feet. The one-bedroom, one-bath cottage features a galley kitchen, two built-in dining tables, a stone fireplace, built-in banquette seating and a deck overlooking the park’s namesake lake. A major restoration effort during the late 1980s and early 1990s brought this cottage back to its original state, with overnight stays opening up in 1992. Three walls of windows coax in natural light and interior stone walls also seamlessly connect to the outdoors, even if it’s a cozy winter night. \u003cem\u003eFrom $325 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e 30 wooded acres, fishing access, coffee and tea\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAs mentioned above, Penfield was one of Wright’s repeat clients. The three-bedroom home that inspired RiverRock is located minutes away from its sibling. This is a classic Usonian home with one special quirk—everything is a little bit taller to accommodate its six-foot-eight owner (Louis Penfield). The two-story living room windows allow a flood of light inside, overlooking the 30 acres it sits on. A special note about those windows: Wright strayed from his typical designs to craft thin, ribbon-like portals to compliment Penfield’s impressive height. \u003cem\u003eFrom $450 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Frank Lloyd Wright Overnight\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"RowWrapper\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-journey-hook=\"client-content\" data-testid=\"BodyWrapper\"\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e Patio, original built-ins, Ludowici tile roof\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThis stay is one part of Polymath Park, a 130-acre property where owners Tom and Heather Papinchak worked to dissemble and relocate two Wright-designed Usonians from other regions. The cantilevered roof is easily recognizable to Wright fans. The three-bedroom, two-bath home joins two other homes designed by Wright protégé Peter Berndtson, whose master plan for the Usonian-style community was unfortunately never fully realized. With a restaurant on site (Treetops Restaurant), guests can choose to eat most of their meals there or make use of the home’s kitchen. \u003cem\u003eFrom $825 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eCourtesy of Frank Lloyd Wright Overnight\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e WiFi, massive kitchen, indoor fireplace\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAlso in Polymath Park, this Usonian was designed by Wright in 1957 for Donald and Elizabeth Duncan and remained in Lisle, Illinois, until 2004, two years after Donald’s death. Marshall Erdman, who worked on 11 of Wright’s prefab Usonians, was tapped as the builder and chose Masonite siding. With three bedrooms and two baths, guests can enjoy the home’s open layout, including cozying up in front of the stone floor-to-ceiling fireplace in an Eames-style lounge chair. Now relocated to Pennsylvania for restoration work, visitors can view the Cherokee red concrete floor and a stone fireplace, two hallmarks of Wright’s Usonian homes. \u003cem\u003eFrom $675 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003eNNehring/Getty Images\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTop Amenities:\u003c/strong\u003e Fitness center, pool table, free parking\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe Historic Park Inn Hotel is the last remaining hotel designed by Wright and was completed in 1910. It was originally used for multiple businesses—a bank, hotel, law office, and a handful of other commercial initiatives—before being restored in the early 2000s. Wright’s classic touches are sprinkled across 27 rooms: paneled windows, sculptural lighting, and expressive headboards. \u003cem\u003eFrom $155 per night.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli id=\"65f36611cc17d6f7841dfd72\"\u003e\u003cdiv data-event-boundary=\"click\" data-in-view=\"{\u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;variation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide.ItemLeftCaptionAboveMultipleButtons\u0026#34;}\" data-event-click=\"{\u0026#34;pattern\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;variation\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;GallerySlide.ItemLeftCaptionAboveMultipleButtons\u0026#34;}\" orientation=\"landscape\" data-item=\"{\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;brand\u0026#34;:{\u0026#34;name\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#34;},\u0026#34;id\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;65f36611cc17d6f7841dfd72\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;index\u0026#34;:0,\u0026#34;contentType\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;externallink\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;offers\u0026#34;:[],\u0026#34;component\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;gallery_slide_component\u0026#34;}\" data-testid=\"GallerySlideWrapper\"\u003e\u003cfigure\u003e\u003cfigcaption\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003ePhoto: Lauren Arzbaecher\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv data-testid=\"GallerySlideCaptionDekContainer\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cp\u003eCraving an escape?
