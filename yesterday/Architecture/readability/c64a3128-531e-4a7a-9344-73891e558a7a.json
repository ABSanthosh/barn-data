  "text": "organic materials shape hungarian pavilion for expo 2025 osakaHungary introduces its pavilion for Expo 2025 Osaka, a space where nature, tradition, and architecture come together in harmony. Situated on the waterfront of the World Expo, the structure echoes Sou Fujimoto‘s circular island masterplan concept, embracing sustainability and tradition through natural materials and vernacular building techniques shared by both Hungarian and Japanese architecture. The materials and spatial design of the building reflect the heritage of both nations, shaping a space that feels deeply rooted in shared identity. This approach presents built and natural environments as a unified whole, aligning with the Expo’s theme, ‘Designing Future Society for Our Lives.’ Rather than a conventional exhibition, the pavilion delivers a multi-sensory experience rooted in the universal language of music. As visitors progress through the pavilion, they will encounter several striking features. On the right, a symbolic forest building welcomes them, while to the left stands a wooden dome shaped like a haystack—an homage to ancient Hungarian peasant life. This wooden dome houses the highlight of the pavilion: an immersive theater space accessible via a forest path. The melodies of Hungarian folk songs resonate along this path, offering symbolic representations of their cultural significance. Inside the dome, a folk song performance unfolds beneath a starry sky that feels infinite, drawing visitors into the mystical world of Hungarian legends.images courtesy of Hungarian Pavilion and Expo 2025 OsakaAn experience of national folk music and gastronomyWith its fusion of architecture, music, and cultural diplomacy, the Hungarian Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka fair embodies the deep-rooted connection of the country to nature and its forward-looking aspirations. It stands as an immersive gateway to Hungarian identity, linking past and future through design, sound, and experience. Drawing from the Kodály Method, a music education approach’s philosophy that music belongs to everyone, the main attraction of the pavilion is an immersive theater where visitors are surrounded by Hungarian folk music. The space emotionally connects to nature and heritage, transporting audiences through a live performance that captures the essence of Hungary’s landscapes and traditions.A gift shop at the end of the exhibition space presents visitors with Hungarian-made products and souvenirs, while the first floor features a bistro showcasing traditional Hungarian cuisine alongside a dedicated wine bar, offering a taste of the national gastronomic heritage.a symbolic forest building welcomes visitorsthe building includes spaces for business, culture, and diplomacyWith Expo 2025 expected to draw at least 30 million visitors, predominantly from East Asia—including South Korea and China—Hungary aims to elevate its tourism appeal while fostering diplomatic and business relations in this vital market. Designed as a cultural and economic hub, the second floor of the pavilion is dedicated to strengthening Hungary’s business presence, providing space for small and medium-sized enterprises to connect with East Asian partners. This level also hosts diplomatic engagements, reinforcing Hungary’s role as one of Japan’s key economic partners in Central Europe—an alliance underscored by significant East Asian investments in Hungary in recent years. inside the dome, a folk song performance unfolds beneath a starry skythe first floor features a bistro showcasing traditional Hungarian cuisinea dedicated wine bar offers a taste of the national gastronomic heritagethe second floor of the pavilion is dedicated to strengthening Hungary’s business presence",
