  "text": "Concrete House by Atelier García perches on Guatapé’s hillsideLocated in the mountainous region of Guatapé, Colombia, Concrete House by Atelier García is defined by a poured-in-place concrete plinth and roof. The design creates three distinct interactions with the surrounding landscape: a secluded lower level embedded in the terrain, an open upper social space framing distant views, and a rooftop terrace offering panoramic 360-degree vistas.Positioned at the edge of a hill, the structure is characterized by its triangular floor plan, which responds to the angular topography. The plinth and roof frame views of the Rock of Guatapé and the adjacent water reservoir, functioning both as a belvedere overlooking the horizon and as a protective shelter integrated into the mountain. The spatial organization follows three axes, shaping movement and interaction within the house.all Images by Mateo SotoAtelier García arranges Concrete House’s layout in three layersFor Concrete House, Atelier García’s lead architects Clara Arango and Orlando Garcia organize a compact design that unfolds in three layers. The ground level, closely integrated with the sloped gardens, serves as a private and quiet space, partially enclosed within a solid mass. In contrast, the upper floor houses the social areas in a transparent, expansive room oriented toward distant views. This level is supported by three distinct structural columns: a triangular fireplace, a rectangular hollow column containing storage and pantry space, and a circular staircase illuminated by a skylight. An organic pathway leads to a bridge that connects to the circular rooftop terrace, offering uninterrupted views of the reservoir and surrounding mountains. The rooftop serves as a habitable outdoor space, completing the spatial progression from enclosed to fully open environments.The overlapping geometries—ranging from the triangular layout to the cylindrical staircase and circular roof terrace—define the architectural composition. These intersecting forms create a variety of spatial experiences and establish unique relationships between the structure and the natural landscape. The interplay of solid and transparent elements emphasizes the connection between built and natural environments, while maintaining a functional and cohesive design language.Concrete House by Atelier García stands amidst the mountainous region of Guatapé, Colombiaoverlapping geometries create diverse spatial experiences within Concrete Housethe rooftop is a habitable open-air space, completing the transition from enclosed to open environmentsthe interplay of solid and transparent elements strengthens the connection between indoors and outdoors",
