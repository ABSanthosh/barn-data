  "text": "Nude Library: Nude Project’s streetwear store in La Roca VillageAt the heart of Nude Project’s new flagship store, Nude Library, a six-meter-high wooden bookshelf makes a striking statement. Designed by El Departamento studio, this architectural centerpiece merges display and library functions, bridging fashion and culture and capturing the brand’s essence in a space that redefines traditional retail. La Roca Village in Barcelona, now home to Nude Project’s first permanent streetwear store, introduces a 100-sqm environment that embodies both the brand’s identity and the spirit of its vibrant setting—a space where design, art, and community intersect.Drawing from La Roca Village’s distinctive character, which evokes a late 19th and early 20th-century Catalan village, El Departamento has envisioned an immersive setting in harmony with the surrounding streets, main square, theater, and commercial promenade. Studio co-founders Alberto Eltini and Marina Martín introduced a cultural focal point—the bookstore—creating Nude Library as a creative landmark. A DJ booth and the imposing wooden bookshelf highlight the brand’s connection to art and music, combining visual and material references that link architecture with culture and the creative community, reinforcing Nude Project’s philosophy: ‘By Artists, For Artists.’all images by Miguel Fernández-GalianoTowering bookshelf anchors El Departamento’s Nude LibraryEl Departamento creative design studio maximizes the store’s vertical space, constructing a towering bookshelf along the main wall, with a DJ booth integrated at its core. This feature combines visual impact with the brand’s artistic identity, inviting customers to explore and engage with the space. To enhance the experience within the 100-sqm layout and six-meter ceiling height, a mezzanine at the back provides storage and dynamic interaction of levels, further emphasizing the bookstore’s verticality and positioning the bookshelf as the store’s defining feature.Contrasting with the bookshelf’s bold centerpiece, the fitting rooms reflect Nude Project’s signature baby blue, rounded edges, and soft textures, adding a touch of warmth and balance. This flagship store, ‘Nude Library,’ marks El Departamento’s eighth collaboration with Nude Project, with locations already in Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, Valencia, Ibiza, Bilbao, and Milan. Their partnership will soon extend to Amsterdam, reinforcing a shared vision of merging retail and culture in each new European space.a six-meter-high wooden bookshelf defines the new Nude Library flagship by El Departamentodesigned by El Departamento, Nude Library blurs the line between fashion and culturethe towering bookshelf combines display and library, anchoring the space’s architectural concepta DJ booth sits within the wooden bookshelf, connecting fashion to music and art",
