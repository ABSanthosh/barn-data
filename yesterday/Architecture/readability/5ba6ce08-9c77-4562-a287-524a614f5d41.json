  "text": "Miami Heat small forward Jimmy Butler has a lavish new spot to call home. The NBA All-Star just signed the lease on a Miami Beach mansion for over $70,000 a month, the Real Deal reports. The exact price of Butler’s new rental isn’t publicly known, though the Hibiscus Island dwelling was asking $95,000 a month the last time it was listed as a rental. Should the Texas native decide to buy the place outright, it’s also for sale at $30 million.Per the listing, the 2001-built Mediterranean-style house spans about 6,100 square feet with five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. The roughly half-acre plot also hosts a sprawling backyard patio, a pool with a waterfall, a hot tub, and a boat dock—all with panoramic views of the water and the Miami skyline. The home’s great room features grand archways, a spiral staircase, and a chef’s kitchen that comes complete with a waterfall-edge stone island and bespoke wood cabinetry. Nearby, a moody, charcoal-hued den is equipped with a built-in wet bar and French doors that open to the patio.Butler also maintains an AD-featured Spanish Revival-style abode in San Diego, which he bought in 2020. “I grew up with a whole bunch of nothing, so I’ve dreamed of having a home for myself, for my family, and I put everything into this house,” the cover star told AD in October. “This is for my kids. I do this to inspire—to show that if you want something you can go get it.” That home, crafted in collaboration with AD100 designer Tiffany Brooks, is outfitted with its own coffee shop—the first iteration of Butler’s coffee brand, BIGFACE.Join NowHoliday Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowPerhaps it’s best that Butler keeps his Miami real estate a little noncommittal. The athlete, who is in his third of four years contracted by the Heat, is currently the subject of trade rumors. According to ESPN, Butler has said he is open to trading to the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, and Golden State Warriors.",
