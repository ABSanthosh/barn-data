  "text": "Whether it’s a celebrated painting, a classic song, or an iconic film, some works of art are impossible to shake. For me, one such masterpiece will forever be Mad Men, the moody period drama about the golden age of advertising, which premiered on AMC in 2007 and concluded its seven-season run in 2015. The series follows its forlorn protagonist, Don Draper (Jon Hamm), as he attempts to both make sense of and leave behind his tortured past, all while navigating the mounting expectations and tensions of modern life in postwar America.No matter what I’m doing or what’s happening in the world, there always seems to be a Mad Men quote to fit the occasion. I attribute the show’s ceaseless cultural relevance to the fact that it mostly takes place in the 1960s, an era of profound sociopolitical transformation. This year marks the 10th anniversary of its oft-discussed series finale, which left viewers wondering whether Don finally found enlightenment at a new age wellness retreat or ultimately returned to his corporate overlords to inspire one of the greatest ads of all time. In the decade since, Mad Men has appeared on several streaming platforms, where longtime fans and newcomers alike can revisit the series whenever they’re seeking a dose of stylish melodrama.As a millennial raised in a modest two-bedroom house in the Midwest, I cannot tell you when, exactly, my love affair with midcentury modern design began. Beyond sporadic antiquing outings with my father—who had a penchant for collecting anything analog, old, or both (and irrespective of its working condition)—I certainly had no substantive exposure to MCM design, nor would I have known how to spot it out in the wild in my younger years. What I do know is that my mid-mod obsession solidified around the time I started tuning into Mad Men. I had recently entered college and was living on my own. I was eager to define and refine my personal style and my understanding of what constitutes a true sense of place. Mad Men’s set design, in particular, provided a plethora of aesthetic inspiration. From the sleek, Herman Miller-appointed offices of SC\u0026P to the groovy, posh pads of Don and Megan Draper (his on Park Avenue, hers in the Hollywood Hills), I was transfixed by many of the series’ brilliantly designed midcentury modern sets—and I still am today.The sets in question seem to have a resonance rooted in their authenticity. “Almost all the furniture we used was vintage,” Claudette Didul, a set decorator on Mad Men, tells AD. “And it is evident when you watch the show. I think it has that texture to it.”Didul’s father worked in advertising for 40 years, around the same time Don would have been in the industry. That experience helped inform her design knowledge from the era. “I can remember going to see him in various advertising agencies from when I was about two or three years old,” she recalls. “I actually have a photograph of myself in an Eames chair in his office from 1964.”Ahead, Didul discusses how some of the most memorable midcentury modern sets from Mad Men came to life.Don’s apartmentBrian Markinson as Arnold Rosen, Linda Cardellini as Sylvia Rosen, Jessica Pare as Megan Draper and Jon Hamm as Don Draper in Mad Men season 6. Photo: Michael Yarish/AMC“This was an apartment that [showrunner] Matthew Weiner had thought about for a couple seasons,” explains Didul. “He knew he wanted a sunken living room. Dan Bishop, our production designer, worked with Matthew on the look. One of his reference books was The New York Times Book of Interior Design and Decoration from the mid-‘60s. When we did Don’s apartment, the year in the show was around 1966. Push button phones existed, but they didn’t have the pound key or the asterisk sign on them. My coordinator found a guy that sold phones on eBay who had a period-appropriate one. He also helped us with all the office phones and made them practical so that they could work and ring. Don’s apartment was reminiscent of the vibe—not the year, but the vibe—of The Mary Tyler Moore Show, which had the sunken living room, and Bewitched.”Howard Johnson’sJessica Pare as Megan Draper and Jon Hamm as Don Draper outside of the Howard Johnson’s in Mad Men season 5. Photo: Michael Yarish/AMC“My whole family would go to Cape Cod every summer up until I was 12. Weirdly enough, we would go to Howard Johnson’s for Fish Fry Night on Fridays, so I was very aware of the Howard Johnson’s look. Creating this set was an amazing team effort, with the prop department helping make the boxes of taffy in the hand prop room. Then we had an art department assembly line building those boxes and creating the artwork. We lucked out that we were able to film at Rod’s Diner in Arcadia, California, for the interior. They recently tore it down. It had that turquoise booth and we just added a little sprinkle of orange. Around a mile away, there was an old motel that had previously been a Howard Johnson’s. They painted the roof orange. We put a cigarette machine in the lobby. We made it all come together. That was a really beautiful episode, and I can tell you that the sherbert was a big deal. I think it had 28 flavors.”Megan’s houseMegan and Don Draper in a season 7 episode of Mad Men. Courtesy of AMC“We tried to make Megan’s home in Laurel Canyon like Joni Mitchell’s house—the one in the photo with her hanging out her window was an inspiration. [Editor’s note: The reference photo is by Joel Bernstein, circa 1970.] There was an actual house that [production designer] Dan Bishop did a location scout on, in case we had to have an exterior. The Malm fireplace I bought on Etsy; it unfortunately came crushed. I had a friend that lived in Laurel Canyon who had one and was dying to get rid of his. They were the same color, so we merged the two Malm fireplaces together. All the refrigerators had a handle on the right and a hinge on the left, which is the most difficult vintage refrigerator to find. We lucked out with two amazing vintage appliance stores in California. Megan’s [fridge] was a really cool, bluish-teal, ‘50s-looking fridge. For the rest of the house, we just tried to make it feel hippie and lived-in.”The SC\u0026P creative loungeChristina Hendricks as Joan Harris, John Slattery as Roger Sterling, Hamm as Don Draper, Kevin Rahm as Ted Chaough, and Vincent Kartheiser as Pete Campbell in Mad Men. Courtesy of AMC“This was supposed to be a space that constantly was at work. We would go down and move stuff around, possibly add pieces of art or magazine tearsheets. Every episode we tried to make it look like things were happening. [When the IBM computer moved in], we found some items on eBay and at prop houses to put that together. For some people, it was really hard to adjust to computers. It’s like, you’ve been in the business for 30 years and now got to learn something totally new, and it changed everything that was happening.”The McCann officeElisabeth Moss as Peggy Olson. Courtesy of AMC“Peggy tried to keep her personality when she moved to the new office, but the room was definitely smaller than what she had previously. It was less attractive. McCann was keeping the same type of furniture as SC\u0026P, but I did update the artwork. We actually got permission from Saul Bass’s estate to reproduce one of his posters from Lincoln Center. We put that in Peggy’s office. Also, Matthew Weiner wanted that octopus painting that had hung in Burt’s office to move to the McCann office. I had to size it down, unfortunately, to fit under Peggy’s arm while she’s walking the hallway with the cigarette hanging out of her mouth.”The wellness retreatAnna Osceola as Clementine in the series finale of Mad Men. Photo: Justina Mintz/AMC“We filmed on location in Big Sur. I never got to go on a tech scout. I only saw the house the day we had to dress it. It was based on Esalen in Central California. It had hippie cabins. We had to turn the primary bedroom into the information desk of the wellness retreat. Then, the living room of the house became where the circle of chairs were. We blocked the kitchen with tapestries to make it look like a kitchen didn’t exist. The next day, we had to be back [in LA] at 6:30 in the morning to open up the set for the last day of filming. It was Don calling Betty; Betty was in the house. It was a really fascinating day. The entire crew was on stage. Everyone just came down to watch history ending.”This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.",
