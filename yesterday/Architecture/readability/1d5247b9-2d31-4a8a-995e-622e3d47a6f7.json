Photo: Edward Menashy/Evan Joseph StudiosThough the words “New York City mansion” may sound like a tongue-in-cheek way to describe a residence that is slightly larger than the metropolis’ average—currently 737 square feet in Manhattan—they did once exist. In fact, prior to mass urbanization in the late 19th and early 20th century, mansions in the Big Apple were relatively common. And now, a surviving one from the bygone era is for sale for $59 million, reports the Wall Street Journal.Located a block from Central Park, at 4 East 80th Street on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, the home was built in 1915 for Helena Woolworth McCann, the eldest daughter of five-and-dime entrepreneur Frank Woolworth. It was one of the three homes the patriarch commissioned for his children—the two adjacent homes were for two other daughters—and together they formed a family compound with his own nearby mansion, which was demolished in the 1920s. Woolworth hired Charles P.H. Gilbert, who was known for his mansions and town house, to craft both the family residence and those for his daughters.A grand staircase defines the entrance.

Though the exterior is relatively understated, the architectural pulls inspiration from Gothic buildings, evident in the home’s tracery, finials, and exaggerated dormers. Inside, opulent touches, such as a mosaic floor, stained glass skylight, multiple working fireplaces, and intricate molding await.A sitting room in the home showcases ornamental molding. Photo: Edward Menashy/Evan Joseph StudiosLike many townhomes, the residence’s ample square footage is achieved through vertical design. Amenities such as a gym, library, billiards room, wet room, solarium, 50-person-capacity dining room, sauna, and office are spread across seven floors, all serviceable via an elevator. Additionally, the home includes nine bedrooms, 12 bathrooms, and three kitchens.The wood-paneled dinning room can seat 50 guests. Photo: Edward Menashy/Evan Joseph StudiosThe family of the late Lucille Roberts, who founded an eponymous chain of women-only gyms, are the sellers. She and her husband, Bob Roberts, purchased the New York City mansion in 1995 for $6 million, then spent many years restoring it to its original grandeur. The Robertses listed the house in 2011 for $90 million, but later took it off the market. They have since rented the home, which asked $80,000 per month, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
