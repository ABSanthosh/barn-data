The role, based in Toronto, calls for an individual who will oversee the site logistics for art projects along the soon-to-open Lassonde Art Trail. Among the requirements for the role are a minimum of 3-5 years of professional experience installing artworks in the public realm, major museum exhibitions, or festivals as well as of art fabrication methods and processes, anchoring and installation logistics. Why the role interests us The open role at the Lassonde Art Trail Foundation offers us the opportunity to take a closer look at what organizers call a “first of its kind” art trail along the Toronto waterfront. A free, open-air landscape of contemporary art, the Lassonde Art Trail will span 2.6 miles along a new island in the city’s harbor when it opens in 2026. The trail is part of the wider Ookwemin Minising development by Waterfront Toronto, which we reported on earlier this year. The $680 million plan will develop a 'city within a city' on a 1,975-acre plot on Toronto’s waterfront with 14,000 new homes. The art trail will span 15 interconnected sites across the new landscape, creating what the foundation calls a “dynamic program of permanent and rotating artworks by outstanding national and international artists.” “On pace to launch by 2026, LAT’s aim is to provide free year-round access to contemporary art in the outdoors for current and future generations to enjoy,” the foundation adds. “Part of the trail’s innovation is that it embeds infrastructure along its paths to support a wide variety of artworks, from major bronze and stone sculptures to installations that include natural materials and light, as well as ephemeral moments to appreciate artistic performance, music, and dance.” Further reading for interested candidates 2025 Winter Stations installations welcome a 'new era' for the exhibition in Toronto (March 2025)Toronto reveals $680 million plan for a 'City within a city' (February 2025)Field Operations announces new The Bentway Islands project in Toronto (September 2024)In an Ontario plaza, interactive pavements play music ‘as if by magic’ (February 2024)Archinect's ongoing coverage of public artLassonde Art Trail Foundation's Archinect profileArchinect Tips: Employment EditionJob Highlights is one of a number of ongoing weekly series showcasing the opportunities available on our industry-leading job board.
