And upgrades like the built-in bunk bed Steve and Brooke Giannetti crafted for Jennifer Garner’s sumptuous slumber party room demonstrate how much potential the model offers. Just ask AD100 interior designer and bunk bed enthusiast Ken Fulk. “The most charming part of bunk beds is the visual repetition they offer in a room,” he says, “whether it’s the repeat of patterns on bedding, the detailing in the craftsmanship, or simply the symmetry of the duplicate shapes.”Romantic patterns, retro throwbacks, and delicate details pack a punch in this LA bunk room by AD100 designer Jamie Bush. Stephen Kent JohnsonLos Angeles–based interior designer Jamie Bush also touts numerous built-in bunk beds across his portfolio. “I always find it’s a chance to be more playful and fun,” he says. The built-in bunk room is a “modern invention,” he notes: “That typology developed in the 20th century in a very natural way, when people had more free time and would have secondary homes.”Fulk concurs. “They are perfect in a vacation home, where bunking up with friends is a nostalgic throwback to summer camp or sleepovers,” he says. “They are not always ideal for a forever home where kids might outgrow them.”Bush and Fulk aren’t alone. Nate Berkus has also tried his hand at the genre, rendering an entire bedroom of bunk beds for Ray Romano’s desert hideaway. “The bunk room was designed with future grandchildren in mind,” Berkus says. “As the vision really started to take shape, excitement grew with everyone clamoring to claim a bunk.”AD100 designer Ken Fulk fashioned a rustic-style bunk room for Instagram cofounder Kevin Systrom and his wife, Nicole, befitting of the Lake Tahoe locale. Douglas FriedmanIt’s easy to find the fun in a bunk bed, but there’s no fun without function. When installing built-in units as the focal point of a children’s room in Mary Kitchen’s LA home, Bush enlisted a carpenter from a very different part of the house. “It was the cabinetmaker contractor who built this,” he says. “It matched the paneling of the room, so it really looks like these punctures in the wood wall.”Join NowHoliday Sale: Become an AD PRO member for only $20 $12 per monthArrowContractor Jon Barnett of Weatherford, Texas–based S\u0026B Construction also tapped a cabinetmaker for three built-in bunk beds for Yolanda Hadid’s modernist Texas ranch house. “Cabinet shops hire the most skilled woodworkers because cabinets obviously take a lot of skill and there’s not a lot of play. You’re playing with sixteenths and thirty-seconds of an inch,” he says. “When it comes to bunk beds, you want that accuracy.”Barnett also notes that the elevated beds designed for Hadid increase the bedroom’s possible layouts. “It gives you the ability to eliminate that fourth bed and have a full miniature walk-in closet,” Barnett adds. “It offers so many possibilities.”The efficiency of space created by bunk beds also invites ample opportunity to customize comforts. “We’ve done built-in curtains for privacy, integrated plaster stairs,” Fulk says, “and plenty of in-bed amenities like reading lamps and storage niches, little hammocks for storage, and inset bookshelves.”Storage is a big ask for Bush as well, who explains that his firm has carved out hideaway space in bunk bed stairs and added drawers beneath lower bunks. “We've had clients that have really asked to trick these things out.”AD100 firm Olson Kundig designed the bunk room's plywood beds for this sleek mountain compound. Benjamin BenschneiderIntuitive solutions like integrated outlets or bedside ledges for phones or drinks abound, but a sense of play is always at the foundation for Bush. This is best embodied by a standout project that reimagined a bed frame as a heavenly platform complete with plush, white upholstered stairs to round out the immersive design. “It had this sculpted guardrail that was more in a cloud formation,” he says. “There’s a certain type of fantasy of family and friends coming together and all sharing the same room.”APPLY NOWGrow your business with the AD PRO DirectoryArrow",
