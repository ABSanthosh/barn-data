  "text": "It only makes sense that Rafael Nadal’s house is an überluxurious place where he can decompress—because for the past two decades, he’s worked hard to cement himself as one of the biggest names in tennis. On October 10, the legendary athlete announced in a video posted on Instagram, where he has 21.8 million followers, and other social media platforms that he plans to retire from professional tennis following the Davis Cup finals in November.“The reality is that it has been some difficult years, these last two especially,” Nadal says in the video, referring to recent injuries. “I don’t think I have been able to play without limitations. It is obviously a difficult decision, one that has taken me some time to make. But in this life, everything has a beginning and an end.”Nicknamed the King of Clay, Nadal has won 92 titles in his career, including 22 Grand Slam titles. Earlier this year, he competed in the 2024 Summer Olympics on behalf of his native Spain, but he did not take home any medals and lost to his longtime rival Novak Djokovic in a highly anticipated second-round match. Paris marked Nadal’s fourth time competing in the Olympic Games; he won gold medals in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 and Beijing in 2008, and he also competed in Athens in 2004.The 38-year-old’s decision to end his tennis career after the Davis Cup, which takes place in Spain, is fitting. “I think I’ve come full circle,” he says in the video, “since one of my first great joys as a professional tennis player was the Davis Cup final in Sevilla in 2004. I feel super, super lucky for all of the things I’ve been able to experience.”Post-retirement, the champ will have more time to soak up the sun at one of his two oceanfront villas or aboard his superyacht—read on for a peek inside his properties.The portside Mallorcan oasisWhen Nadal isn’t on the court, the tennis star loves to be near the water. His main home is located in Porto Cristo, a harbor and charming fishing town in the eastern region of Mallorca, Spain. The house is situated on a 1.7 acre plot of land overlooking the crystal clear port where Nadal keeps his catamaran. The tennis legend acquired the property, along with the original Mallorcan stone villa, a decade ago and has spent that time tearing it down, designing, and building his dream home. The new modern villa was designed by Mallorcan architect Tomeu Esteva and construction began shortly after Nadal’s wedding to Maria Francisca “Xisca” Perellò in 2019, according to the Majorca Daily Bulletin. (The couple welcomed a son in 2022.) The sleek portside oasis boasts an infinity pool, large windows, and multiple terraces.The Caribbean beach villaAs previously mentioned, Nadal has an affinity for the ocean. His second home is a $2 million beach house in Playa Nueva Romana, a Caribbean dreamscape located in the Dominican Republic. The decorated tennis star acquired the two-story villa in 2012, around the time he broke records by winning his seventh French Open title and eleventh major title overall. Located in a large development complex, the vacation home has three bedrooms, a modern kitchen, a private pool, and access to a country club, beach club, tennis courts, golf course, and a private marina.The sleek superyachtA paparazzi snap of Nadal’s yacht as the tennis star and friends vacationed aboard in 2016.
