Located in Fengjing Town, Jinshan District, the first LEGOLAND resort in the country covers 318,000 square meters, with eight themed areas, more than 75 rides, shows, and attractions, plus thousands of LEGO models made from over 85 million LEGO bricks. The grand opening week spans between July 5th and 13th, 2025, and visitors during this period can watch the live daily shows that the resort hosts.A theme park with cultural architecture, the LEGOLAND resort in Shanghai, China, demonstrates buildings and motifs referring to the Chinese culture, like the boat ride that shows the LEGO versions of old Chinese water towns and modern Shanghai. Everything in the scenery is made from LEGO bricks, and it is 25 times smaller than the real buildings. There’s also a LEGO Monkie Kid live show exhibiting the dubbed world’s largest LEGO minifigure, as well as two new areas built just for the LEGOLAND resort in Shanghai, China: the Brick Street and the Bricktopia.all images courtesy of Merlin Entertainmentsworld’s biggest LEGOLAND resort in shanghai, chinaThroughout the LEGOLAND resort and theme park in Shanghai, China, there are six large restaurants, lots of smaller food stands, and around ten retail stores, spread across the entire area. Each location follows the brick theme, with places like Pigsy’s Food Court, CITY Restaurant, and Bricks Family Restaurant serving meals on LEGO-themed plates and cups. The food stands around the park also offer LEGO-themed snacks, such as LEGO brick-shaped ice cream. Aside from being the world’s largest LEGOLAND resort at the time of publishing, this theme park in Shanghai, China, houses The BIG Shop, which is also considered the largest LEGO store in Asia.Inside the store, visitors can go through and own the brand’s toys, sets, clothing, and souvenirs, as well as limited-edition items that can only be found in Shanghai. The design team also constructed the LEGOLAND Hotel next to the theme park in case they want to stay on-site. The grand opening of this resort in Shanghai, China, came after years of collaborative work between the LEGO Group, Merlin Entertainments, and local government and businesses. The LEGOLAND resort and theme park in Shanghai, China, is now open, and it also hosted the start of the 36th Shanghai Tourism Festival during the opening, which is a summer tourism initiative by the local government, running from July 5th, the same opening date of the theme park, until August 31st, 2025.the dubbed world’s biggest LEGOLAND resort opens in Shanghai, Chinathe resort covers 318,000 square meters, with eight themed areas and more than 75 ridesview of the opening on July 5th, 2025the grand opening week spans between July 5th and 13th, 2025project info:name: LEGOLAND Resort location: Fengjing Town, Jinshan District, Shanghai, Chinacompanies: LEGO Group, Merlin Entertainments | @lego",
