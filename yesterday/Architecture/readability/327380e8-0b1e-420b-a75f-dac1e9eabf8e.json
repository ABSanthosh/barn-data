  "text": "Dagher Hanna \u0026 Partners extends Collège Louise WegmannLocated on a steep site in Jouret El Ballout, Lebanon, the recently completed extension of Collège Louise Wegmann by Dagher Hanna \u0026 Partners addresses both the challenges of terrain and evolving educational needs through a topographically responsive design. The new wing forms a U-shaped volume that turns back toward the school’s original L-shaped structure. This layout consolidates the existing courtyard and introduces a second one, strengthening spatial coherence across the campus. The extension accommodates a series of new programmatic elements, including a double-height library, a multipurpose auditorium, administrative offices, classrooms, and a covered playground.Architecturally, the building steps down the hillside in a sequence of layered volumes. This approach transforms the sloped terrain into a structured learning landscape and organizes circulation through a combination of axial and diagonal paths. The resulting spatial rhythm supports clarity of movement and reinforces site integration. Material selection combines smooth painted concrete surfaces with areas of fair-faced concrete bearing a custom relief pattern. These textures, which reference the surrounding natural context, help modulate the building’s visual scale and contribute to its tactile character. A key visual element of the facade is the use of circular windows in varied sizes and colors. These openings are designed to bring daylight deep into the interiors while establishing moments of visual permeability across the building envelope. Larger glazed sections are fitted with operable aluminum louvers to provide solar control and enhance thermal performance.all images courtesy of Dagher Hanna \u0026 PartnersConnecting Learning Spaces Through Light and CirculationThe architectural team at Dagher Hanna \u0026 Partners designed interior spaces to extend the learning environment beyond the classroom. Circulation zones double as informal gathering spaces, fostering flexibility and interaction. Daylight is prioritized throughout, enhancing spatial continuity and supporting visual orientation. The internal courtyard serves as a shared void, providing outdoor space for gathering, recreation, and cross-campus visibility. Its position in the plan also supports passive ventilation and strengthens connections between programmatic zones.Structurally, the building is composed of cast-in-place concrete slabs and load-bearing walls. Long-span conditions accommodate the larger volumes of the gymnasium and library, while ceiling heights are calibrated to meet acoustic and spatial requirements. Classroom orientations are optimized for daylight access and views to the surrounding landscape. Through an integration of form, material, and site, the project supports contemporary pedagogical models while remaining anchored in its local context. The extension of Collège Louise Wegmann offers a functional and spatially responsive environment for learning, activity, and engagement.a U-shaped addition reconnects with the original L-shaped school structuretwo courtyards organize the layout and strengthen campus continuitythe massing steps down the hillside in layered volumespainted and fair-faced concrete define the material palette",
