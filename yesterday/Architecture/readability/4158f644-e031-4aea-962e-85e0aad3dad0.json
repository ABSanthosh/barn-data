  "text": "anchor Photo: Zol87/Flickr (CC BY-SA 2.0) A rare early example of Frank Lloyd Wright’s residential designs in Chicago, the Walser House from 1903, has been identified as endangered by the group Preservation Chicago.  The house is located in Chicago’s western Austin neighborhood and has significant deterioration/need for repairs estimated to cost around $500,000, according to the Frank Lloyd Wright Building Conservancy. It is one of just five Prairie Style designs in the city (incl. the recently donated Emil Bach House) and has been unoccupied for the last six years, left to vandalism and unprotected from weather conditions. Preservation Chicago's Executive Director told Artnet its pending foreclosure now requires an \"emergency advocacy effort.\" Other entries that have made their 2025 'Chicago 7' list include The Delaware Building in The Loop, an Italianate structure notable for its early precast concrete facade usage that dates to a fastidious building period in the aftermath of the 1871 Fire.",
