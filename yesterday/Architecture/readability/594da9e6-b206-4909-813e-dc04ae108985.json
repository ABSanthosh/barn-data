  "text": "She’s an international superstar, but where does Shakira live? The Colombian singer-songwriter’s houses reflect her globetrotting lifestyle. The “Hips Don’t Lie” hitmaker, who recently walked the red carpet at the Met Gala in a powder pink gown by Prabal Gurung, is currently performing on her Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran world tour, but when she’s not on the road, Shakira has more than one luxurious property to retreat to. Born in Barranquilla, Colombia, she has made her home in countries around the world, including residences in the United States, Spain, Uruguay, and Cyprus. Her homes typically put her modern, minimalist style on full display and draw inspiration from her background. Read on to learn about the Grammy-winning singer’s real estate portfolio.Miami homes on La Gorce IslandAn aerial view of Allison Island and La Gorce Island, in Miami’s Biscayne Bay. Photo: Jeff Greenberg/Getty ImagesAs Shakira climbed the American charts, she also put down roots in Miami. In 2001, the singer purchased a Mediterranean-style home for $1.075 million on La Gorce Island in Biscayne Bay, an exclusive private-island neighborhood that has been home to celebs like Cher, Matt Damon, and Ricky Martin. The four-bedroom, three-and-a-half-bath home was built in 1988 and was outfitted with a garden, patio, and pool. She sold the house in 2005 for $1.8 million.But Shakira wasn’t done house hunting in the Magic City. The same year she purchased the Mediterranean-style house, she bought a second home on La Gorce Island for $3.38 million, and this one boasted an amenity the other lacked: a water-front address. The six-bedroom, seven-and-a-half bathroom house boasts a heated outdoor pool, gym/dance studio, a dock with 100 feet of access to the bay, and stunning water views. The home was built in 1951 but was updated over the years, including by the singer, who built a three-bedroom, three-bath addition. Shakira collaborated with architects Ben Lopez and Associates and interior decorator Renata Lessa Bastos of Trace Design Studio on the property. “Shakira’s taste is airy, bright, and warm, with a mixture of white textures, and there are touches of silver metallics—she doesn’t like gold—with complements of lavender, lilac, and fuchsia here and there for a bit of color,” Bastos told AD in 2018. “There are also traces of her Lebanese and Middle Eastern heritage infused throughout the otherwise minimalist interiors, including bone-inlaid pieces, handmade decorative mirrors, and a low-profile hookah lounge area.”Shakira has put the 8,700-square-foot home on market three times, in 2013 for $14.95 million, in 2018 for the reduced price of $11.6 million, and finally in 2021 for $15.9 million. She later removed it from the market, and following her breakup from soccer star Gerard Piqué and move from Barcelona, Shakira and her two children have made this Miami mansion their home base.Uruguay farmhouseThe songstress began dating lawyer Antonio de la Rúa, son of former Argentine president Fernando de la Rúa, in 2000. During their relationship the couple shared a seven-bedroom farm near Punta del Este, Uruguay, called La Colorada. Shakira used the scenic 12-acre property as a vacation spot and creative retreat, spending a month there in 2008 to work on new music. “This is a very special, magical place, and I come looking for the muses of Juana Ibarbourou, my favorite poet, to see if she enlightens me,” she told El Pais at the time. She also showed the newspaper the two-story recording studio that had been created in the property’s barn. The farm’s other amenities included a gym, heated pool, tennis court, sauna, and lake with boats.The couple announced their breakup in 2011, and the next few years were tumultuous and filled with lawsuits, with de la Rúa suing the singer for $100 million and attempting to gain control of her Swiss bank account. De la Rúa retained possession of La Colorada following the split.Barcelona mansionThe exterior of the Barcelona home Shakira once shared with her ex-boyfriend Gerard Pique while it was undergoing renovations in 2013. Photo: Europa Press Entertainment/Getty ImagesFollowing her split from de la Rúa, Shakira started seeing Spanish soccer star Gerard Piqué. The two met on the music video set for “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” which was the 2010 FIFA World Cup anthem. In 2013, they had their first child, Milan Piqué Mebarak, and a second son, Sasha Piqué Merbarak, followed in 2015. The couple settled in Barcelona, building a large home in the Esplugues de Llobregat area of the city in 2012. The house has five stories—three above ground and two below—and includes a gym, recording studio, cinema, pool, and multiple terraces. The complex also includes a guest house with its own pool.The purchase of the home would contribute to the singer’s later legal troubles. In 2018, Shakira was charged with tax evasion, with prosecutors claiming that Spain was her official residence from 2012 to 2014. The singer listed the Bahamas as her residence during that time and made the move to Spain official in 2015. “I didn’t spend 183 days per year at that time at all,” Shakira told ELLE in 2022. “I was busy fulfilling my professional commitments around the world.”Barcelona family homeA few years later, the couple purchased another home in Barcelona, this one on Avenida Pearson in Pedralbes, for a reported $5.4 million. The 16,000-plus-square-foot house boasted seven bedrooms, two kitchens, a gym, and a pool complete with a waterfall. The pair had been interested in the property for years and were able to snag it for far less than the original $11.9 million price.The home in Esplugues de Llobregat remained the family’s primary residence, and control of the house became an issue when Shakira and Piqué split up in June 2022. In November, the couple reached a custody agreement, and in April of 2023, Shakira and her two sons left Barcelona for her mansion in Miami. “I settled in Barcelona to provide my children with stability, the same thing we now search for in another corner of the world next to family, friends, and the sea,” Shakira posted on Instagram on April 2.Moving back to the States was always in the cards for the singer and her family. “The plan was always that when my ex retired from professional soccer, we’d go to the States and live there and finish raising our kids there, because of all the sacrifice I’d made all those years accompanying him to play,” Shakira told Rolling Stone in 2024. “The idea was to come here, but that moment coincided right with the separation. In the end, the plans all come true. Just in a different way.”Cyprus getawayEven after settling in Barcelona, Shakira continued to expand her real estate portfolio. In 2019, she reportedly purchased a villa in Peyia, a town in the Paphos District of Cyprus. The six-bedroom vacation home overlooks the Mediterranean and is located in the Cap St. George resort. Each of the 200 villas on the property have access to the resort’s amenities, including the beach cove, spa, and restaurants.",
