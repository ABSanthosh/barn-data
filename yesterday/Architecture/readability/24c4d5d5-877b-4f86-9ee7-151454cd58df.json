  "text": "Tucked into a five-acre wooded site just outside Seattle, Washington, the Interurban Residence is a quietly bold family home designed by Heliotrope Architects. Created for a family of four, this home turns its back on urban hustle and instead reaches deep into the forest, embracing sun, air, and natural materials with equal parts elegance and restraint. With interiors crafted by Amy Baker Interior Design and a landscape thoughtfully composed by Land Morphology, Interurban feels not simply placed within the forest, but deeply rooted in it. From material choices to room orientation, every element of the home reflects a commitment to comfort, sustainability, and everyday beauty. Exterior: Wood, Light, and Simplicity The house presents a trio of connected, gabled volumes clad in vertical Kebony siding, a thermally modified wood that weathers over time into a soft gray. The gabled metal roofs drain into exposed half-round gutters, combining clean lines with durable function. Floor-to-ceiling windows wrap each wing, bringing sunlight deep into the interior and giving the home a lantern-like glow at night. Though the site offered no distant views, the architecture turns the immediate forest into a rich visual backdrop. Outdoor Spaces: Outdoor Living Room, Pool, and Sauna Retreat Outdoor life at Interurban is central to the family’s daily rhythm. A generous lawn stretches out from the home, giving space for play and relaxation. At its far edge, a swimming pool and spa sit in full sun, paired with a stone-paved lounging terrace and outdoor shower. Tucked into the treeline, there’s also a plunge pool and sauna offering a quieter experience. Near the main living areas, a covered outdoor living room blurs the line between interior and exterior, a shaded retreat that functions as a true extension of the house. Entryway: Grounded and Textured Arrival The approach to the home winds through preserved native trees, leading to an entry sequence made of poured-in-place concrete pavers and matching wood decking. These materials create continuity between landscape and architecture. A wood front door provides a warm, tactile welcome. As it swings open, the transition from exterior to interior is seamless, the same materials and tones continue inside, reinforcing a sense of connection. Living Room: Open, Airy, and Framed by Forest The living room is located in one of the long, linear wings and sits open to both the kitchen and dining areas. Generous glazing frames views of the surrounding trees, while high ceilings, a fireplace, and a restrained material palette give the space an easy, grounded elegance. Natural light is abundant, balanced across the day thanks to the wing’s narrow profile and window placement. Dining Area: Seamless Transition, Communal Energy Just off the living space, the dining area continues the open layout, while the clean-lined furnishings are designed to complement the architecture without overpowering it. This is a space that invites lingering conversations and unhurried meals. Kitchen: Functional, Durable, and Bright The kitchen is designed for daily use and family gatherings alike. A neutral palette of light-toned wood, and matte finishes creates a feeling of calm utility. Open sightlines to the rest of the living wing keep the space connected, while durable surfaces and practical layouts support a busy lifestyle. Within the kitchen’s clean-lined design lies a subtle surprise, a hidden bar tucked within the seamlessly integrated cabinetry. Designed for both function and discretion, the bar offers a dedicated space for cocktails without interrupting the kitchen’s minimalist aesthetic. Media Room: Cozy and Contained A more intimate space within the home, the media room is set slightly apart from the open-plan core. Designed for family movie nights or quiet reading, it balances the openness of the rest of the house with a cozier, enclosed atmosphere. Thoughtful lighting and soft finishes enhance the relaxed tone. Home Office: Focused and Light-Filled The home office benefits from the same attention to light and material found throughout the rest of the home. Floor-to-ceiling windows bring in views of the forest, creating a serene environment for work and focus. The furnishings are minimal but warm, designed to support productivity without visual clutter. Laundry Room: Practicality with a Light Touch Tucked within the support wing of the house, the laundry room balances utility with design. Natural light filters in through the door, making the space feel open and pleasant rather than utilitarian. Simple cabinetry, durable countertops, and easy-to-clean finishes support the daily rhythms of family life. Like the rest of the home, the materials are chosen for longevity and ease, reinforcing a quiet elegance even in the most functional spaces. Powder Room: Small Scale, Strong Identity Though compact in size, the powder room is designed with the same care and intention found throughout the home. It offers a moment of contrast and personality, a space where wallpaper can take center stage. Primary Bedroom: Calm, Private, and Connected to Nature Positioned for privacy, the primary bedroom looks out onto untouched woodland. The room’s design emphasizes tranquility, neutral tones, soft textures, and high ceilings that draw the eye upward. Oversized windows let the forest into the space, creating a deeply restful retreat. Primary Bath: Spa-Like and Elemental In the primary bath, impervious tile meets natural light in a calm, refined composition. Views to the outside maintain the connection to nature, and a sense of openness defines the space without sacrificing privacy. Tiles lend a quiet uniformity to the floors and walls, enhancing the spa-like atmosphere and standing up to daily wear with ease. A custom wood vanity brings warmth and texture to the room, with a streamlined design that includes an open shelf below for neatly stowed towels or baskets. Above, a large mirror reflects the light, expanding the sense of openness. A built-in bathtub offers a peaceful spot to unwind while looking out to the trees beyond. Guest Suite Bunks: Comfortable and Playful The guest suite includes thoughtfully designed built-in bunk beds fitted with queen-sized mattresses, offering both flexibility and comfort. This area is made with guests and growing teens in mind, a playful but practical space that feels casual without being cramped. Guest Suite Bath: Durable and Refined The guest bath continues the home’s themes of simplicity and resilience. Hard-wearing tile and clean-lined fixtures create a bathroom that can handle high traffic while remaining beautiful. The materials echo those found in the rest of the home. Interurban is not simply a house among the trees. It is a home shaped with them. Designed by Heliotrope Architects and supported by a team that includes Amy Baker Interior Design and Land Morphology, it reflects a shared vision of sustainability, ease, and enduring beauty.
