The ambitious transformation will be one of the most significant cultural renovations worldwide, reconfiguring the architecture and display of key artifacts within the historic museum by the middle of 2026. ‘My team and I are thrilled to embark on this journey for the renovation of the Western Range of the British Museum,’ shares the Lebanese-born architect. ‘This competition has been an exciting process shaped by dialogue and multiple voices. I am looking forward to continuing this rich and collaborative process as we work towards transforming this section of the museum into an extraordinary space — a place of connections for the world and of the world.’all images courtesy of Lina Ghotmeh, unless stated otherwisethe architect’s ‘archaeological’ approach wins the juryLed by Lina Ghotmeh, the Paris-based practice was selected for its sensitivity to the context of the museum, demonstrating a profound understanding of collections display and visitor interaction. The jury particularly resonated with the architect’s ‘archaeological’ approach, which aligns with the historical and curatorial ethos of the British Museum.The competition drew over 60 international teams, culminating in a nine-month selection process. It tasked participants with reimagining key gallery spaces within the Western Range, including the architecture and display of significant artifacts. Five finalists advanced to the second stage, where Lina Ghotmeh—architecture emerged as the unanimous choice.Lina Ghotmeh’s proposal includes a reconfigured space dedicated to the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus—one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World—situated in present-day Bodrum, Turkey. The selection process was overseen by a distinguished jury, including Yvonne Farrell, Meneesha Kellay, Mahrukh Tarapor, and Sarah Younger, alongside George Osborn, Chairman of the British Museum, and Dr. Nicholas Cullinan, the Museum’s Director. Representatives of the Board of Trustees, including Tracey Emin, Charlie Mayfield, and Alejandro Santo Domingo, also played a role in the decision-making process.Lina Ghotmeh—Architecture (LG—A) to redesign the Western Range galleries of the British Museumthe project to be delivered by the middle of 2026Ghotmeh approaches each project as a layered excavation—unearthing a building’s past to inform its reimagined future. Prioritizing sustainability and natural materials, her vision resonated with the collection of the museum, which spans two million years of human history. ‘Lina Ghotmeh is an architect of extraordinary grace and gravitas. Her team’s proposals demonstrated an exceptional and materially sensitive architectural vision for the British Museum, and their ‘archaeological’ approach clearly understood the ambition for this project to be as much an intellectual transformation as an architectural one,’ explains Dr. Nicholas Cullinan, director of the British Museum. ‘Lina and her team have a track record for delivering unique and human-centred design with a timeless elegance. I am delighted we will be working together and excited for the years ahead at such a pivotal chapter for the Museum, embarking on a generationally significant project that will transform a third of our gallery space.’Lina Ghotmeh will work alongside a multidisciplinary team, including artist Ali Cherri, Plan A for design team coordination, Purcell as executive and conservation architect, Arup for structural and civil engineering, and Holmes Studio for graphic design and wayfinding. Together, they will refine their winning concept into a final design approach set to be delivered by mid-2026.the competition tasked participants with reimagining key gallery spaces | image via @nicholascullinanthe jury particularly resonated with the architect’s ‘archaeological’ approach | image via @nicholascullinanthe Paris-based practice was selected for its sensitivity to the context of the museum | image via @nicholascullinanLina Ghotmeh and Nicholas Cullinan in the Western Range | © The Trustees of the British Museummodel submitted by Lina Ghotmeh Architecture for competitionproject info:name: British Museum’s Western Range galleries renovation architect: Lina Ghotmeh—Architecture | @linaghotmeh_architecture location: British Museum | @britishmuseum, London, United Kingdom",
