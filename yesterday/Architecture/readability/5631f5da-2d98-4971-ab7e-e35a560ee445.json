The scene looks more like somewhere in England or France, but it is instead in the small German village of Schorfheide in the state of Brandenburg, about 30 miles north of Berlin. When Lossberg walked through that gate for the first time, she knew immediately this was the exact house that she and her partner had been looking for. It was a place to escape the whirlwind of city life and allow their two children to grow up surrounded by nature. “As much as we like Berlin, sometimes you need a break from the big city,” says Lossberg, who grew up in southern Germany before starting to model at a young age and eventually living in Paris, New York, and Australia.Built around 1850, Lossberg’s country home includes a small half-timbered house that was once used as a daycare center, which some current-day village residents attended. The house had been renovated before and its 2,000 square feet of livable space was in excellent condition when Lossberg and her partner bought it two years ago. The previous owner’s passion for historical renovation worked out great for them. “He had torn down the entire barn, leaving only the beams standing,” says Lossberg. He had added details true to the house’s history like a clinker brick façade and beaver-tail roof tiles, and skillfully installed antique fittings and 200-year-old windows. That allowed Lossberg to focus on renovating the interiors however she wished.The previous owners had used a large cabinet to hide a bookcase set into a wall in the dining area. Lossberg chose instead to have it painted in Farrow \u0026 Ball’s Inchyra Blue to create a contrast with the wall around it. Lossberg worked with a Farrow \u0026 Ball color consultant to mock up various moods for the different rooms. They used bold wall colors and varnishes with soft beige as the basic tone to add distinct accents and to create an appealing atmosphere. She’s especially proud of the furniture choices, which include a number of family heirlooms. Even the new items they bought were refurbished vintage pieces from a small family business in Austria. The family spends most of its time in the open kitchen with adjoining living and dining areas. Keeping the large doors and windows open in summer means the line between home and nature is blurred.“Since we don’t have food delivery services or many restaurants around here, we started cooking and baking from scratch,” says Lossberg. “We lose ourselves in gardening, and we get creative and make pottery. In summer, there are lots of nice swimming spots around, and fall is great for collecting mushrooms in the woods and baking twist bread in our fire pit. In winter we sit in front of the fireplace and take long walks in the woods.” The tranquility that Lossberg’s family enjoys means that “sometimes you can hear horses from the farm across the way, roosters from the village, or a tractor driving by.” When their routines in Berlin allow it, they come to Schorfheide as often as they can, whether on long weekends or on holidays. Lossberg even comes out to the countryside for half-day breaks—outings that she’s discovered can feel like mini-vacations.Caroline Lossberg’s country home was originally published by AD Germany. It was translated by John Oseid.The family enjoys a lot of time in the property’s big garden. Lossberg and her partner were taken with the open-plan living and dining areas from their very first visit. Lossberg would have loved to have grown up in this children’s room. The cupboards and stairs are painted in Beverly by Farrow \u0026 Ball, the wall in Kittiwake. The bedroom looks directly at a nearby paddock and the nature that surrounds the house. Lossberg came across the Brinjal color accent during a consultation with Farrow \u0026 Ball paint makers. She gave that eggplant tone to the wall and radiator (on the left side of this photo) in the stone bathroom. Sign up for our daily newsletter to get the best of design in your inbox.Not a subscriber?

Prefabricated architecture has always posed a more affordable and sustainable future for housing as they’re fast and cheaper to build and produce less waste in the long run, so why hasn’t it taken over? Wyetzner delves into the history of prefab and why it failed to take off how many architects have hoped it would. ASSETS J. Paul Getty Trust. Getty Research InstituteInside Kendall Jenner’s Home at ChristmasToday, AD is welcomed back by Kendall Jenner to tour her LA home while it’s decorated for Christmas. Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has become known for their flamboyant Christmas decorations but Kendall’s approach to holiday decorating is much more traditional. With the help of florist to the stars, Jeff Leatham, green garlands, a classic tree, and vintage decorations lace the halls of her home creating a nostalgic atmosphere. Much of this nostalgia stems from decorations from Kendall’s childhood handed down from her mom Kris–most notably her collection of Christopher Radko tree ornaments. “Growing up with [those ornaments] every year, they became so special to me,” she says. “And I can’t wait to share that with my kids one day, but I love sharing this with my friends. I love entertaining, I love hosting, and so these decorations get used really well.” 2024 Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New YorkHelp!

An illustrious modeling career means Elsesser is often jet-setting the globe, and as a result, her time at home has become her vacation time. Brooklyn was always where the supermodel wanted to end up setting up home, with Gregory Rockwell and Hester Hodde of Gregory Rockwell Interiors helping bring her oasis to life. Her home takes its cues from Milan design, mixing vintage and artisanal pieces, a style Elsesser has been drawn to since her many travels to Italy’s fashion capital. As the model settles into her dream home, it’s already been a place of great personal evolution–“I feel like I became a woman here,” she admits. “I learned to navigate so many things—a breakup, a contractor, having agency over my decisions and my money. I’m under no one else’s jurisdiction. It’s scary, but also very freeing.”Bad Bunny’s New Album Is a Love Letter to Puerto Rico—and These Are the Most Important DetailsDeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS touches on the issues facing the island, from gentrification to potential statehood49 Bright Kitchen Ideas from the AD ArchiveBecause we adore spending time in our kitchens tooInside the Spirited London Home of a French Fashion DesignerDesigner Peter Mikic worked with Caroline Sciamma to create a bold and fashionable dwellingThe 13 Best Indoor Plants for Gorgeous Greenery and Healthier AirBring your lush interior paradise to life with our guide to the best indoor plants—including impossible-to-kill options",

Prefabricated architecture has always posed a more affordable and sustainable future for housing as they’re fast and cheaper to build and produce less waste in the long run, so why hasn’t it taken over? Wyetzner delves into the history of prefab and why it failed to take off how many architects have hoped it would.\n\nASSETS\nJ. Paul Getty Trust.

Over the years, the Kardashian-Jenner clan has become known for their flamboyant Christmas decorations but Kendall’s approach to holiday decorating is much more traditional. With the help of florist to the stars, Jeff Leatham, green garlands, a classic tree, and vintage decorations lace the halls of her home creating a nostalgic atmosphere. Much of this nostalgia stems from decorations from Kendall’s childhood handed down from her mom Kris–most notably her collection of Christopher Radko tree ornaments. “Growing up with [those ornaments] every year, they became so special to me,” she says. “And I can’t wait to share that with my kids one day, but I love sharing this with my friends. I love entertaining, I love hosting, and so these decorations get used really well.”\n\n2024 Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, Inc. / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv data-item=\"{\u0026#34;dangerousHed\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;Help!

An illustrious modeling career means Elsesser is often jet-setting the globe, and as a result, her time at home has become her vacation time. Brooklyn was always where the supermodel wanted to end up setting up home, with Gregory Rockwell and Hester Hodde of Gregory Rockwell Interiors helping bring her oasis to life. Her home takes its cues from Milan design, mixing vintage and artisanal pieces, a style Elsesser has been drawn to since her many travels to Italy’s fashion capital. As the model settles into her dream home, it’s already been a place of great personal evolution–“I feel like I became a woman here,” she admits. “I learned to navigate so many things—a breakup, a contractor, having agency over my decisions and my money.
