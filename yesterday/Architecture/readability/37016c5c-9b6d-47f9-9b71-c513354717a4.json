Submit your work ahead of the Final Entry Deadline on July 11th! Staying on top of industry news, trends and best practices is important, but to be honest, it can also be overwhelming. In a feed flooded with image overload, finding thoughtful architectural content can feel like a ….needle-in-a-hashtag situation. Between endless AI generated images and influencer hauls, it’s easy to scroll past what actually matters. That’s why we’re spotlighting a few Instagram accounts that consistently rise above the noise. Whether you’re looking for visual inspiration, career insights or just a smarter scroll, these profiles are worth your time and attention. Architecture Hunter (IG: @architecture_hunter) Founded by Amanda Ferber in 2013, Architecture Hunter has grown into one of the most recognizable design accounts on Instagram — and for good reason. What began as a passion project now reaches over 3 million followers across platforms, sharing architecture that inspires, informs and occasionally surprises. The account is known for its slow, story-driven approach to content. Instead of chasing algorithms, Amanda and her team focus on what deserves to be seen: carefully curated buildings, cinematic videos and thoughtful commentary that brings the essence of architecture to the forefront. Whether it’s a short film or a spotlight on overlooked design gems, Architecture Hunter is proof that high-quality content still wins in a noisy feed. Follow Architecture Hunter \u003e  Troy Donovan (IG: @the_donnies) Run by façade designer Troy Donovan, @the_donnies is a consistently smart and technical feed focused on architectural details. From close-up shots of façades and material assemblies to annotated diagrams and construction drawings, the account highlights the kind of work that’s often overlooked in fast-moving design media. Donovan curates each post with care, selecting projects that are not only well executed but rich in clarity and construction intelligence. His background in façade consultancy comes through in the precision of what he shares, making this a valuable resource for architects who want to better understand how buildings come together, layer by layer. Follow Troy Donovan \u003e Parametric Architecture (IG: @parametric.architecture) Parametric Architecture is a media platform dedicated to exploring how emerging technologies — from computational design to AI — are reshaping architecture. Founded by Hamid Hassanzadeh in 2016, it has grown into a global resource through articles, interviews, podcasts and an educational arm, PAACADEMY, which hosts live courses with industry leaders in tools like Rhino, Grasshopper and Midjourney. On Instagram, the account curates some of the most visually bold and forward-looking design content around. Expect algorithmic forms, digital fabrication and experimental work that challenges conventional design boundaries. It’s also where they share updates on upcoming workshops, talks and interviews — making it a useful follow for anyone interested in staying close to the edge of architectural innovation. Follow Parametric Architecture \u003e Illustarch (IG: @illustrarch) Illustrarch began as an Instagram page in 2016, combining a love of architecture and illustration into a growing platform for students, young professionals and curious followers alike. Since then, it’s expanded into a larger online resource, but the feed remains central to its mission: highlighting creative student work and helping designers build their visual voice. The account regularly features bold project presentations, clean diagrams and layout strategies that offer practical value — especially for those building portfolios or refining studio work. There’s also a steady mix of templates, career tips and educational content that makes the page feel more like a mentoring tool than a moodboard. Follow Illustarch \u003e  Future Architecture (IG: @future.architects_) Future Architecture highlights the more speculative and experimental side of design, with a feed full of renderings, AI-generated concepts and unbuilt projects from around the world. The focus is on visual storytelling — often surreal, futuristic or dramatically bold — and each post typically tags the software or tools used, offering a quick window into how the image was made. Whether you’re interested in unbuilt work, experimenting with new visual tools, or just keeping up with where design might be headed, Future Architecture is an engaging daily scroll. Follow Future Architecture \u003e Let’s Show It Better (IG: @letsshowitbetter) Originally launched as a YouTube channel by architect Steven Rubio, Show It Better has become a go-to resource for anyone looking to sharpen their architectural communication skills. While its in-depth tutorials live primarily on YouTube, the Instagram account offers a steady stream of diagrams, visual breakdowns and quick how-tos that make architectural representation more approachable. The posts are thoughtful and often directly useful, covering everything from drawing techniques to layout tips. For architects who care about how their ideas are seen and understood, @letsshowitbetter is a smart follow since it offers equal parts inspiration and instruction. Follow Let’s Show It Better \u003e  Archimarathon (IG: @archimarathon) Founded by Kevin Hui and Andrew Maynard in 2018, Archimarathon is an architecture education platform that trades jargon for clarity, while still managing to go deep. What started as a YouTube channel has grown into a global learning community, offering tours, mentorship and approachable design commentary shaped by both academic insight and real-world practice. Their Instagram account offers a steady stream of ideas, project highlights and sneak peeks into the topics they unpack in more detail across their other channels. Whether it’s a breakdown of a student concept, a thoughtful critique of a recent project, or simply a useful reminder of how design can be taught with clarity and humor, @archimarathon is a smart follow for architects at any stage of their learning curve. Follow Archimarathon \u003e  Madame Architect (IG: @madamearchitect) Madame Architect is a digital magazine that highlights the women shaping architecture and the many fields connected to it. Founded by architect and writer Julia Gamolina, the platform focuses on career stories, thoughtful interviews and the people behind the work—whether they’re running firms, rethinking practice models, or leading cultural conversations. The Instagram account offers a steady stream of quotes, article excerpts, event snapshots and interview previews. It’s a resource for those curious about how people actually build a career in architecture and a space where professional paths are discussed with honesty and clarity. If you’re looking for meaningful industry insight beyond portfolios and project shots, @madamearchitect is worth adding to your feed. Follow Madame Architect \u003e Architizer (IG: @architizer) Last but definitely not least, Architizer’s Instagram is your shortcut to discovering the world’s best architecture. The feed is curated by a sharp editorial team and highlights outstanding projects from around the globe — always with a focus on relevance, innovation and design excellence. Many of the featured works are winners of the A+Awards, selected by an expert jury as some of the most compelling contemporary architecture being built today. Alongside project highlights, the account shares updates on competitions, open calls and opportunities to engage with Architizer’s global design community.
