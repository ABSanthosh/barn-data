The project aims to transform the artificial landscape into a harmonious blend of cultural and environmental sensitivity, following a government initiative to reclaim a 100-meter strip of land along the coast.The project, named Kep West, consists of three distinct structures arranged to create an outdoor plaza intended for events and public gatherings. The central feature, The Wave, incorporates several restaurants and bars opening up toward the ocean. The building’s rooftop slab twists in a subtle wave-like gesture, reflecting the rolling sea while contrasting with the horizon’s linearity. The design emphasizes openness, with limited enclosed sections, except for a glass-covered air-conditioned restaurant.all images by Greg Mo unless stated otherwiseKep West’s Layered Design Merges Context, and Spatial FlexibilityFor the Wave’s structure, BLOOM Architecture’s team employs three architectural layers. The first is its bold concrete form, a monolithic single-story construction with a spiral staircase leading to the rooftop. The use of a waffle slab, columns, and curved edges tested the limits of the material. The second layer is a striking pink sandstone wall, sourced locally, which contrasts the concrete and provides visual and functional separation. The third layer, termed ‘the comfort layer,’ comprises adaptable elements such as railings, blinds, glazing, fitted and loose furniture, and audiovisual systems, designed for flexibility over time. The adjacent pier extends into the sea at an angle designed to frame the peak-season sunset. Split into two levels, it offers a dynamic connection between the reclaimed land and the water, enhancing the site’s engagement with its surroundings.Kep West represents a new architectural identity for the reclaimed shoreline, integrating with the natural environment and the broader cultural context. Through meticulous research and design sensitivity, it establishes a foundation for the future development of the area while maintaining harmony with its environmental and social setting.BLOOM Architecture reclaims Kep’s shoreline with a private restaurant and recreation facilitythe project blends cultural sensitivity with environmental harmony on Cambodia’s reclaimed Western coastKep West is composed of three structures forming a central outdoor plaza for public gatherings and eventsthe Wave, Kep West’s central feature, hosts restaurants and bars opening toward panoramic ocean views",
