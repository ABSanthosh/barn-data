  "text": "five galleries beneath a conical roofSO – IL unveils a sculptural new pavilion, dubbed Anima, as a contribution to the Art Omi Mini Pavilions in Chatham, New York. Dotting the serene meadows of the Hudson Valley, the fluid structure is designed to offer visitors a unique experience at the meeting point of art and nature. The structure comprises five interconnected gallery spaces, each purposefully varied in size and lighting to create distinct environments for displaying art.The pavilion’s five galleries are connected, each accessible through a singular entrance and exit, ensuring a focused, undisturbed experience in each space. The dimensions of these galleries differ, with some featuring large windows that open up to the landscape, while others draw natural light from skylights above. This strategic variation in form and light enhances the viewer’s engagement with each piece of art. The new pavilion is expected to open in 2026.visualizations © SO – ILSO – IL to stack thousands of wooden blocksThe team at SO – IL will clad its Anima pavilion in a dark gray skin, allowing it to subtly integrate with the meadows of Art Omi. The curving, understated facades serve as a quiet backdrop to the art within, emphasizing simplicity and contemplation. This exterior expression contrasts with the dynamic texture of the pavilion’s roof structure, composed of thousands of stacked wooden blocks. Rising asymmetrically from 7 to 35 feet, the roof forms a cone-like shape that shifts in appearance depending on the viewing angle.The roof, with its intricate lattice of wooden blocks, creates a gauzy, light-filtering effect. This delicate structure casts soft, diffused shadows that animate the spaces below. The varying heights of the roof frame expansive views of the horizon, connecting visitors with the landscape and distant mountain ranges. This visual relationship underscores the pavilion’s intention of bridging architecture with the natural world.SO – IL unveils the Anima pavilion among the Hudson Valley meadows of Chatham, NYan introspective experience at art omiWith the design of Anima, SO – IL continues Art Omi’s mission of slowing visitors down and immersing them in an introspective journey. Each gallery features a single work of art, encouraging prolonged observation and a deeper connection to the piece. Between galleries, small pauses reveal glimpses of the surrounding meadows, providing moments of transition before re-entering another quiet space.SO – IL co-founders Florian Idenburg and Jing Liu describe the core philosophy of Anima: ‘What we create is not just what you see — it is what you feel, what you cannot escape encountering. This pavilion invites stillness, where architecture becomes a reflection of your own experience, unfolding with each light and shadow.’ This sentiment captures the pavilion’s essence as a structure that engages visitors through its spatial and sensory design.Art Omi Co-Executive Directors Francis Greenburger and Natalie Diaz express their enthusiasm for the new pavilion: ‘The Mini Pavilions will offer visitors a unique, durational viewing experience that cultivates privacy and intimacy with a singular work of art. We aim to counter the false urgency of our culture by encouraging viewers to pause and sit with a piece, creating meaningful encounters with a work of art that allows its properties to be revealed and studied beyond a glance, drive-by, or a crowded view.’clad in dark gray, the galleries create a quiet backdrop to allow the art to take center stagethe pavilion consists of five interconnected gallery spaces, each uniquely proportioned and lit",
