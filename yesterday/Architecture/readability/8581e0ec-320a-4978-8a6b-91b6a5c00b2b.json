  "text": "sankt lukas hospice: A Village in NatureThe newly unveiled Sankt Lukas Hospice by Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG) will be located in Denmark and will serve as a palliative care center rooted in the history of the Sankt Lukas Foundation, which dates back to the 1930s. Designed as a village surrounded by serene natural landscapes, the 8,500 square-meter (91,500 square-foot) facility houses Denmark’s first day hospice, along with specialized units for children, youth, and adults.With the capacity to care for approximately 2,100 patients annually, the facility will more than triple the previous capacity. The design prioritizes three core principles — safety and a sense of home, solitude and togetherness, and arrival and farewell. The architecture will be scattered among its woodland context, while the buildings will echo the surrounding historic structures with pitched roofs and repurposed yellow bricks.images © Bjarke Ingels Group (BIG)bjarke ingels designs gardened spaces for Life’s Final DaysEach patient room at Sankt Lukas Hospice is designed by Bjarke Ingels Group with direct access to a private terrace and views of the surrounding green garden. The architects link ground-floor rooms to the courtyard through adjacent corridors, reinforcing the integration of indoor and outdoor spaces.Bjarke Ingels, Founder and Creative Director of BIG, describes the project as ‘a peaceful and poetic environment’ where individuals can connect with nature and observe the changing seasons. ‘Instead of the linear corridors of hospitals, we have created an environment of smaller buildings arranged around protected natural gardens,’ he explains. One of the key features is the farewell garden, a space where the roof opens fully toward the sky, providing room for final moments and symbolic journeys.the project will include Denmark’s first day hospice and units for children, youth, and adultsA Landscape for Healing and ReflectionGuests are welcomed by an open foyer with views of lush courtyard gardens. The central heart spaces in both buildings function as gathering areas for community and well-being. Lukashuset includes family rooms for privacy and togetherness, along with activity spaces for play and reflection. The adult hospice provides larger common areas for activities and meetings.David Zahle, Partner at BIG, emphasizes the importance of care in the design approach. ‘By repurposing bricks from the existing buildings and drawing inspiration from the site’s traditional craftsmanship, the project is deeply rooted in its environment,’ he notes. Bright, open spaces foster a sense of peace, with large windows that bring nature indoors, framing moments of grief, healing, and reflection.designed to care for 2,100 patients annually, the hospice will triple the current capacity of the siteThe surrounding landscape acts as a natural buffer from the city while extending the park’s character. The interconnected environments include open lawns, intimate gardens, a sensory garden, and winding paths. Specific areas feature a wild grass meadow, seasonal flowering plants, and gardens inspired by Danish natural landscapes. A rainwater pond promotes biodiversity, while benches and niches along pathways provide spaces for rest and contemplation.At the western end of the hospice, a woodland-inspired atrium houses the farewell garden.
