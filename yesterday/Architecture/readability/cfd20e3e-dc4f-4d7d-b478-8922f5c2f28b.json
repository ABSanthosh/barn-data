  "text": "The UK’s Architects Registration Board (ARB) has published research finding widespread discrimination and sexual misconduct within the UK architecture profession. The study, resulting from a survey of almost 900 individuals, reveals that architecture professionals experience higher rates of discrimination and sexual misconduct compared to other sectors such as academia and healthcare. According to the research, over a third of all professionals working in architecture have experienced insults, stereotypes, or jokes relating to protected characteristics. One in four female professionals has experienced unwelcome sexual advances, while a third of professionals would not feel confident raising concerns if they experienced or observed misconduct.   On the specific topic of misconduct in the profession, 41% of respondents have experienced bullying while 33% have experienced discrimination. 10% have experienced sexual misconduct. In addition, 38% have experienced insults, stereotypes, or jokes relating to protected characteristics, a figure which is higher for female professionals (53%), those from ethnic minorities (46%), and those with disabilities (46%). 19% of all professionals and 38% of female professionals have experienced unwelcome sexual comments while 12% of all respondents and 24% of female respondents have experienced unwelcome sexual advances. A third of professionals told the survey they would not feel confident raising concerns if they experienced or observed misconduct, doubting it would be taken seriously and fearing it would impact their career. There is also a lack of clarity about the correct process.  Related on Archinect: African American women significantly less supported in architecture schools, says NCARB and NOMA report. Image credit: Burst/PexelsOn the topic of workplace culture, the survey found that architects feel they embody many of the values and attributes the public and clients would expect of the profession such as integrity, honesty, commitment, and accountability, but not all, citing empathy, respect, inclusion, and confidence raising concerns. Only half of respondents agree the working environment is inclusive, a figure that drops lower for underrepresented groups including women, ethnic minorities, and professionals with disabilities. Architects are also concerned about lower quality of work, ethical behavior, and well-being as a result of excessive workloads and hierarchies that sometimes create significant power imbalances.  “The vast majority of architects are good professionals who behave ethically,” ARB Chair Alan Kershaw said about the findings. “But we are appalled to learn that many of them suffer higher levels of discrimination and sexual misconduct than some other professions. There is a clear need for leadership here; all professionals in the built environment sector need to support a better culture for a better built environment.”  “RIBA is deeply concerned by the findings of ARB's research, which reveals widespread discrimination and sexual misconduct in the profession,” RIBA President Muyiwa Oki said, meanwhile. “This type of behavior cannot—and will not—be ignored. While some practices are already leading by example, encouraging inclusive and respectful cultures, the evidence is clear that the entire profession must act.” Related on Archinect: NOMA/NCARB report exposes exam disparities for people of color and older candidates. Image credit: RODNAE Productions/PexelsConducted in 2024 by Thinks Insight \u0026 Strategy, the research surveyed 898 architecture professionals across various career stages and included in-depth interviews with 15 participants. It was commissioned to support the development of ARB’s new Code of Conduct and Practice and to address concerns raised in previous consultations about workplace mistreatment in the sector.  The findings will also inform recommendations by the Professional Practical Experience Commission in early 2025. ARB is urging sector-wide participation in a public consultation on the proposed Code of Conduct, open until December 12, 2024. While the ARB study was confined to the UK profession, a previous report by NCARB and NOMA of the U.S. profession found that almost one-third of architecture employees have faced or witnessed discrimination. Race, age, and gender discrimination were the most common types of discrimination to be reported.",
