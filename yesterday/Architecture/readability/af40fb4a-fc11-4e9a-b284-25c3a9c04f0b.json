  "text": "franck bohbot captures theatricality of teatro regio in turinAn architectural masterpiece reborn in the 20th century, the Teatro Regio di Torino — one of Italy’s most celebrated opera houses — becomes the subject of Franck Bohbot’s new photo series. Inaugurated in 1740, the theater stood as a prestigious cultural landmark for nearly two centuries before being destroyed by a fire in 1936, and for almost 40 years, the site remained dormant until Carlo Mollino was commissioned to design a radical new iteration. The Italian architect’s approach was one that sought to reimagine conventions of opera house architecture, breaking away from the traditional baroque opulence of opera house houses in favor of more sculptural modernist aesthetics.Aligned with Mollino’s surreal, fluid approach, Bohbot continues his pursuit of collecting places that hold stories, textures, and emotions. With a penchant for poetry beyond mere documentation, he spotlights Teatro Regio’s striking interiors to reveal an inherent cinematic narrative. The photos highlight the structure’s grandeur, enigmatic atmosphere, and rhythms through a focus on form, shadow, texture, and color, framing the opera house as a stage in itself.all images by Franck Bohbotcarlo mollino’s modernist reimagining of the opera houseUnlike the gilded balconies and elaborate frescoes typical of historic European opera houses, Carlo Mollino’s Teatro Regio is a study in modernist theatricality. French photographer Franck Bohbot captures the theatrical and otherworldly element of the monumental yet intimate interiors, from the theater spaces to the vast and winding hallways bathed in rich reds and velvety blacks. From the moment one enters, sweeping red velvet walls envelop the auditorium, creating a warm yet mysterious ambiance, while carefully orchestrated lighting illuminates the sculptural elements of the space. The curved, organic forms of the balconies and corridors eschew rigid symmetry, instead evoking a sense of fluid movement, almost as if the architecture itself is engaged in performance.Mollino, fascinated by surrealism, aerodynamics, and esoteric symbolism, conceived the Teatro Regio as an experiential space that favors emotion and atmosphere over conventional ornamentation. The main auditorium, which seats over 1,500 spectators, is characterized by deep hues, dramatic contrasts, and an interplay of shadow and light that creates a hypnotic, almost dreamlike effect. Enhancing this, the absence of traditional proscenium arch detailing and the integration of lighting elements make the space feel at once intimate and monumental. Beyond the auditorium, the theater’s foyer and public areas continue Mollino’s signature aesthetic, featuring geometric patterns, warm wood finishes, and a labyrinthine quality that urges discovery. Franck Bohbot’s photo series illuminates these details with an acute sensitivity to form and atmosphere. His lens accentuates the contrast between vastness and intimacy, revealing an almost hypnotic rhythm, much like the cadence of a symphony.the Teatro Regio di Torino is one of Italy’s most celebrated opera housesthe main auditorium, which seats over 1,500 spectators, is characterized by deep hues, dramatic contrasts",
