  "text": "Tucked within the manicured grounds of a private estate in Surrey, England, a newly completed Music Pavilion by SHH Architecture \u0026 Interiors redefines what it means to design for sound. This purpose-built structure blends refined acoustic performance with architectural elegance, creating a sanctuary tailored for a true audiophile. The story behind the Music Pavilion began years ago with a renovation of the client’s Arts \u0026 Crafts main residence. That relationship evolved when the client, an art collector and music enthusiast, commissioned a standalone space to enjoy his favorite music surrounded by nature. The result is a one-of-a-kind building that serves as a listening room, gallery, and retreat all at once. Designed as a “building within a building,” the pavilion’s double-walled shell provides exceptional sound isolation. Acoustically transparent wall linings and panels ensure studio-grade sound while eliminating interference from the outside world. Visually, the 150-square-meter pavilion draws on both modern and natural inspirations. Materials like Japanese charred timber and Corten steel offer a tactile warmth that complements the adjacent greenhouse and surrounding greenery. A living wall and green roof further integrate the structure into the landscape, while expansive glazing transforms the pavilion into a light-filled observatory of passing time. The interplay of light and texture is key. Carefully placed architectural and task lighting accentuate colors and contrasts, while natural light shifts throughout the day to create a dynamic interior experience. Inside, the design reflects the client’s global sensibility and deep appreciation for music and art. Custom joinery doubles as both display and storage, housing a curated collection of artifacts with museum-like precision. Metal mesh panels and track lighting subtly frame each piece, offering depth and dimension without overwhelming the space. The mood is minimal yet immersive, with grey micro cement floors forming a neutral base for layered textures and color. Wall lighting by Holly Hunt adds softness, while a showstopping pendant light installation by Wonderglass hovers overhead like ripples on water—its reflections playing across the surfaces below. The pavilion isn’t just beautiful, it’s engineered for listening. Achieving exceptional acoustic isolation and quality meant consulting with specialists to fine-tune the proportions, materials, and even service buffering. Every element, from the geometry of the room to the placement of absorptive materials, was considered in pursuit of sonic perfection. Audio-visual integration was led by Ideaworks, who helped unite lighting, sound, shading, and environmental controls. Together with SHH, they delivered a space that functions effortlessly and invisibly, with features like concealed blinds, ASHP energy-efficient heating, and intelligent climate systems all working behind the scenes. This Music Pavilion goes beyond its original brief. Though designed for music, it also invites work, reflection, and relaxation. It’s a modern temple to personal expression, where architecture, interiors, and acoustics work in concert. From textured materials to immersive soundscapes, every detail has been crafted for impact. The result is a building that’s not only visually and sonically rich but deeply personal, a true extension of the client’s lifestyle, passions, and artistic vision. At night, the pavilion transforms into a glowing sculptural form. Discreet exterior lighting highlights the charred timber cladding and Corten steel details, casting shadows that accentuate the building’s geometry. The warm illumination enhances the natural textures while allowing the pavilion to gently emerge from the landscape, creating an inviting presence after dark without overpowering its surroundings. Watch the following video to learn more about this project from everyone involved. Whether filled with music, art, or quiet reflection, the pavilion offers a space that feels both grounded and elevated, a place where every detail resonates. Photography by Richard Chivers",
