From skins used as blankets and cave decorations to the chic animal magnetisms of Eartha Kitt and Diana Vreeland (who famously said “I never met a leopard print I didn’t like”) to the zoological free-for-all of Trixie Mattel’s TV set and Los Angeles home, animal prints pack associations of authenticity, glamour, and camp. So it’s no surprise they’re a favorite of some of our most beloved designers. Here, we speak to eight of them about how, when, and why (and why not?) to incorporate the odd tiger, leopard, or zebra pattern into a project.In this SoHo loft by AD100 designer Gachot, a vintage chaise and matching pouf are upholstered in Dedar’s Tiger Mountain jacquard velvet by JM Upholstery. Photo: Nicole FranzenSasha BikoffPony fabric, in Palomino, by Old World Weavers Photography courtesy of Scalamandré“Animal prints are a real classic. They’ve been used for centuries and centuries, over and over again. Anytime you incorporate one into a room, it automatically teleports you. When you go with a neutral color palette, it’s just a pattern thing—but it’s a neutral with a glamorous, exotic form. Each animal print evokes a different feeling. I did a project in Wellington, Florida, which is horse country, and so I did Scalamandré’s Pony print in Palomino on the dining chairs. In a farmhouse, a cow print would make sense with the environment. Maybe you might want to do a deer print for a country house, inspired by the nature of the area. My personal favorite would probably be a tiger print, ultimately. I feel like it has a Middle Eastern reference that I feel connected with, as I’m half Persian.” —BikoffJoin NowAD PRO members enjoy exclusive benefits.

We wrapped the entire dining room walls with Ralph Lauren’s Aragon wallpaper—a flocked, leopard print wallpaper. It had this velvety touch, and we had a six-foot-tall wainscotting lacquered in a dark emerald green so it was really maximalist. I use leopard print all the time because it gives this level of sexiness and glamour to every space.” —Damen JenkinsNicole R. Fisher, BNR InteriorsOcelot wallpaper by Farrow \u0026 Ball Photography courtesy of Farrow \u0026 Ball“I love an animal print wallpaper or large upholstery piece for full-on glamour. On the walls, a smaller-scaled leopard in a muted color tone is a great way to go bold without feeling overpowered by the print. Farrow and Ball’s Ocelot paper is so subtle but statement-worthy. I consider leopard to be a neutral, and it balances so well with a bold color or act as a pop against all-white upholstery. In a recent project, we added an animal print lumbar to a classic Eames chair in our client’s home office. It made the room a little less formal with a touch of fun and unexpected flair.” —FisherVictoria Sass, Prospect Refuge Studio“I love how an animal motif feels like a touch of cultured eclecticism—a way to add a bit of playful spirit that works especially well if you are working in a very traditional space. Some of the greats like Lee Radziwill and Madeleine Castaing would lean on this little trick to infuse a touch (or a heap in some cases) of irreverence to cheer up a more serious space. I tend to prefer a ‘one and done’ philosophy. Pick one space to feature your statement animal print, then move on. This adds to its mystery—like the piece just fell into the room and you are too fabulous to be bothered.” —SassPhotographer Nick Mele, with designer Danielle RollinsFelix carpet, in Sea, by Stanton Photography courtesy of Stanton“In terms of animal prints, I’m firmly in the leopard camp. In my own home, we actually embraced the classic leopard print in a rather dramatic way. Working with interior designer Danielle Rollins, we chose an oversized leopard print area rug by Stanton that nearly spans the entire sitting room. What I love about this particular application is how it manages to be both bold and neutral at the same time. The pattern reads almost like a sophisticated texture against our blue-and-white chinoiserie-covered walls and upholstery. While some might think leopard print could overwhelm a space, it actually grounds all the other patterns in the room beautifully. The key was choosing a subtle gray colorway rather than the traditional brown tones—it gives the classic print a fresh, modern twist while maintaining its timeless appeal.” —MeleAdam Rolston, INC Architecture and Design“The further we imagine ourselves from ‘nature,’ the more art typically works to connect us to it. In art and design a copy is just a copy, a copy of a copy is kitsch, a copy of a copy of a copy is camp. Animal print is always camp. Because we define nature as wild, dangerous, and uncontrollable, animal print will always be a symbol of strength and independence from social constrain. My favorite INC chair of all time is a reproduction of a 1933 side chair by Frits Henningsen. We specified it with a hair-on-hide from Tiger Leather in the renovation of the 20-seat, ultra-fine-dining Restaurant Latour at the Crystal Springs Resort in New Jersey.” —RolstonDedar’s Tiger Mountain jacquard velvet upholsters a bolster in the living room of this New York carriage house by Gachot. Photo: Nicole FranzenChristine Gachot, GachotTiger Mountain jacquard velvet, in Fauve, by Dedar Photography courtesy of Dedar“One of our go-to interpretations of an ‘animal print’ textile is the Tiger Mountain pattern, a unique abstract combination of a tiger and landscape line work from Dedar. The rich golden ochre colorway can be subtle enough to play well with other elements, but also makes you look twice in a thoughtful and charming way! While we love the subtle charm of animal prints in our residential projects, we’re currently designing a hotel in Palm Beach, and now we’re taking it to the next level, so get ready to see these bold prints pop up in a big way!” —GachotMimi PlangeVictoria fabric, in driftwood, by Mimi Plange for The Shade Store Photo: Julian Huarte“I’ve always loved snake patterns and wild cats of all kinds, but I recently discovered gyotaku, a traditional Japanese printing technique that uses real fish to print their size and patterns by rubbing the fish with ink and stamping or pressing a sheet of paper on the fish to capture its print. I’m really fascinated by the accuracy of the technique and beauty of these fish prints, and they have become a new source of inspiration. For my collection with The Shade Store, I wanted to create my own little animal kingdom, a surreal kind of world that showcased the beauty of vintage Victorian zoological illustrations. The animals themselves became the repeating pattern. I really loved this idea of being in a room adorned with a sense of playfulness and whimsy and wanted to capture that spirit with the print in a way that felt new and uplifting. The idea was to elevate the concept of animal prints beyond the skin and to create something sophisticated, fun, and fresh.” —PlangeAPPLY NOWGrow your business with the AD PRO DirectoryArrow",
