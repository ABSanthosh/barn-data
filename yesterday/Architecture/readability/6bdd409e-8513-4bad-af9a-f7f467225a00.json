  "text": "Delordinaire elevates residence in quebec with their stilt designLocated on the shores of Lake Saint-Jean in Quebec, The Cache residence by Delordinaire Architects in collaboration with Annie Sylvain Architects utilizes a modular system designed to integrate into its secluded surroundings. Building on the innovative legacy of their 2020 project High House, Delordinaire continues rethinking residential typologies with their signature elevated stilt design. Prefabricated in northern Montreal, this typology reduces the environmental footprint, requiring minimal foundations and preserving the natural terrain. This approach creates a shaded outdoor space beneath the dwelling, ideal for warmer months, offering elevated interior views that immerse residents in the stunning landscape.all images by Félix Michaud, courtesy of Delordinairethe prefabricated cache houses are tailored to their locationTrue to Delordinaire’s architectural philosophy, the 50-square-meter residence is clad in larch wood, with clean lines and geometric forms. Carefully transported and installed on-site, each home is uniquely tailored to its specific location, with adjustments in height and orientation optimizing sunlight, ventilation, and views. The central living area, a focal point of the design, features expansive bay windows that offer views of the vast horizon of Lake Saint-Jean. Delordinaire describes their approach as more than functional—it’s about creating spaces that ‘resonate.’ This means encouraging mindfulness and cultivating a heightened sensitivity to the environment. Through the thoughtful use of natural materials, precise proportions, and strategic openings, The Cache creates a link between its inhabitants and the natural surroundings. The elevated design, meticulous craftsmanship, and intimate scale of the Cache draw occupants into an intimate communion with the natural beauty of Lake Saint-Jean. ‘Through our creations, we aim to offer more than a functional habitat. It is a way of living—contemplative moments suspended in time,’ the team at Delordinaire explains.The Cache is located on the shores of Lake Saint-Jean in Quebecutilizing a modular system designed to integrate into its secluded surroundingsDelordinaire continues their rethinking of residential typologiesprefabricated in northern Montreal, this typology reduces the environmental footprint",
