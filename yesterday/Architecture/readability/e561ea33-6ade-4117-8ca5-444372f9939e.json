  "text": "The latest newsletter in our US edition of Dezeen Agenda features all the news from the US, including office-to-residential plans in New York and 3D-printed houses in Texas . Subscribe today! In this US edition of our Dezeen Agenda newsletter, we reported on plans for two major projects: Foster + Partners redevelopment of Television City in Los Angeles and Gensler's conversion of Pfizer's former New York HQ into apartments. Gensler featured elsewhere in our American coverage across the last fortnight with the studio designing  a pair of data centres for Microsoft in northern Virgina, which feature a noteworthy hybrid, CLT structure. Elsewhere in the newsletter, Cara Greenberg examined the impact of Brooklyn's first supertall skyscraper – and talking of supertalls, we have put together everything you need to know about America's next tallest building, planned for Oklahoma City. In an exclusive interview, National Civic Art Society president Justin Shubow weighed in on Donald Trump's push to promote classical architecture – wonder what they'd both think of 3D-printed homes, one of which has recently been completed in Texas. GRT Architects converts Harlem rectory into home for an artistThis week's newsletter also featured GRT Architects' conversion of a Harlem rectory, a serpentine installation at Santiago Calatrava's Oculus and plans for a series of luxury residences in the Utah desert.
