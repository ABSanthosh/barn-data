So, a few years ago when she saw Instagram stories about the latest phase of Al Barari being snapped up, Stanbury knew straight away that this was her chance. And just like that, a property materialized backing onto the lake that runs through the neighborhood.Caroline Stanbury in her Dubai living room. Portrait: Ziga MihelcicStanbury and Carrallo started dating in 2019, and their December 2021 wedding was a key story arc in the first season of The Real Housewives of Dubai. In the series’ second season, after many construction hold-ups and frayed nerves, the couple finally moved into their their new home. For the first few nights, they slept on a mattress on the floor—not the glamour Stanbury was accustomed to, but waking up to birdsong and the sound of water trickling by made it all worthwhile. “We wanted everything to be perfect before we moved in, but there were delays that were out of our hands, and we wanted to be by ourselves, get on with our lives, and let our friends get on with theirs,” recalls Carrallo.The house is brimming with a fun mix of iconic design from different eras and styles. From the living room, one has views out to the swimming pool and the internal courtyard. One of the design elements that caused much concern was a gigantic bonsai tree that had to be air-lifted into the central glass-lined courtyard. This is where Stanbury’s designer of choice, Kate Instone, comes in with her mastery of combining locality with modernity: As the first thing one sees when they enter Stanbury and Carrallo’s Dubai villa, the landscaped court tips its hat to the Arab traditions of privacy and spatial hierarchy. On one hand, it screens the private lounge and dining areas from immediate view, and on the other, it separates the home from Stanbury’s Barbie-pink home office and podcast studio, without cutting anything out of sight.The glass-lined central courtyard with the towering bonsai overlooking the home office. Every element of The Real Housewives of Dubai star’s home office was custom-made. “I’ve been good friends with Caroline since our days in London, so I already had a strong sense of her personality, preferences, and how she moves through life,” says Instone. “Most people tend to design homes that reflect what they think others expect of them, using their interiors as status symbols to showcase wealth, style, or sophistication. Caroline was determined not to fall into that trap. She wanted her home to be a true reflection of who she is—unpretentious, personal, and deeply connected to her own tastes and lifestyle.” The Real Housewives star’s brief was refreshingly simple: she wanted a modern, light-filled home connected to nature.“Nothing of what you see in this home today is an original feature from when we bought it,\" explains Stanbury. “The only thing we said to the team was to not touch the plants growing by the lake. I wanted it to feel like a jungle and that is so refreshing in Dubai.”Caroline Stanbury in her jungle-like outdoor dining area that overlooks the lake that runs through Al Barari.

And while the bonsai soars through the atrium to visually connect the upper floors with nature, where that is not possible, tropical plants bring nature indoors, or as per recent decoration developments in the Stanbury-Carrallo household, to the rooftop terrace lounge.The living room opens up to the swimming pool and lounge. faisal khatibFans of the franchise would recall a pivotal scene in season two of The Real Housewives of Dubai: Stanbury and Carrallo are throwing a house-warming party and all hell breaks loose. At the center of the on-screen drama between Taline Marie and Caroline Brooks was Stanbury’s milk white M. Bellini Camaleonda sofa by B\u0026B Italia. “This sofa went viral on The Real Housewives of Dubai,” laughs the TV star. “And yes, on the show I did say that I don’t want anyone near it, but honestly, we all use it every day.” Chandeliers in opaline Murano glass anoint the space filled with Stanbury’s art collection and family pictures.The infamous Bellini couch. faisal khatibThe house is brought to life with Stanbury’s fun art collection. faisal khatibUpstairs, Stanbury and Carrallo’s bedroom is a calm, blush pink cocoon. Just a mirror and marble ledge (which also conceals a TV that pops out at the press of a button) separates the sleeping area from the bathroom. “I really wanted a hotel vibe here,” says Stanbury. “One of the biggest investments in my house is luxury bedding. I’ve got the world’s finest bedding and it’s no joke. It’s all Scandia Home and it can cost you a second mortgage.”A mirror and marble plinth separates the sleeping area from the hotel-style integrated bathroom. The plinth also conceals a TV installed on a hydraulic system. A hand-painted de Gournay wall covering, in a soft, swirly pattern becomes both the de facto headboard and statement wall, its soft tones mirrored in the Italian marble and mosaic tiles that complete the wet area.Also connected to the main suite is Stanbury’s walk-in wardrobe, brimming with power suits, Birkins, and Chanel dresses that the reality TV star has had altered to her taste. “People ask me where my stuff is, but I’m slowly inching my way in here,” laughs Carrallo pointing to his section in this Hollywood-style dressing room fitted out in bespoke cabinetry by Ornare Dubai.Caroline Stanbury’s Dubai villa was originally published in AD Middle East, which you can find here.Step inside Stanbury’s walk-in wardrobe. faisal khatibThe Hollywood-style dressing area features wall-to-wall cabinetry by Ornare Dubai.

In Dubai, they are working on a series of branded rental apartments (also designed in collaboration with Instone and her studio, Blush) and in Bali, a sculptural resort has just started taking shape.“Before we started work on this house, I seriously thought we would end up in LA, because these type of homes didn’t exist in the Middle East until a few years ago—and here I am, in my glass-lined home in Dubai, with my hot, young husband,” says Stanbury. “I told you I believe in manifesting!”The lift, lined with a jungle scene by de Gournay, features a fun nod to Caroline Stanbury’s Ladies of London days: a phone booth. faisal khatib",
