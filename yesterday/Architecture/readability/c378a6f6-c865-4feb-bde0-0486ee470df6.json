  "text": "March 31, 2025 Architect-K has shared photos of MIGIUI, a modern cafe and various social spaces that lies within the hanok village of Ulju-gun, South Korea. The building was designed to blend seamlessly into this natural setting, and was inspired by a forest path. Major tree species, rocks, and water flows were scattered across the site to reawaken memories of nature, while a green roof has also been added. Three courtyards connect with the surrounding landscape, blurring the visitor’s perception of interior and exterior spaces. Stainless steel eaves were installed throughout the building to help regulate solar exposure, and at the same time follow the building’s curves, emphasizing its streamlined form. Curved glass walls follow the curved walls and provide uninterrupted views of the gardens from the various gathering places, like the event spaces and cafe.
