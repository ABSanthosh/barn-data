  "text": "designing for barcelona’s seaside neighborhoodAn apartment, or ‘piso’ designed by Isern Serra, sits in the vibrant heart of the Barcelona‘s seaside neighborhood of Barceloneta. Within its walls, collectible design and Mediterranean sensibilities meet to create an interior that feels at once curated and deeply personal, all documented by photographer Salva López. Barceloneta’s narrow streets and maritime character provide a fitting backdrop for an apartment that balances contemporary expression with a respect for history. The project begins with the removal of the original partitions that fragmented the space, making way for an open-plan layout that draws natural light across the living, kitchen, and dining areas. A balcony extending the length of the facade connects the apartment to its surroundings, while the more private bedroom suites are tucked near the entrance.images © Salva Lópezisern serra’s gallery for living in barcelonetaIsern Serra conceives the interiors of his Piso Balconetta are conceived as a living gallery. The Catalan designer assembles a selection of objects, furniture, and artworks chosen as much for their emotional resonance as their aesthetic value. Pieces from emerging artists and established designers stand side by side, forging connections between eras and disciplines.

Warm woods, hand-finished ceramics, and patinated metals contribute a tactile richness.
