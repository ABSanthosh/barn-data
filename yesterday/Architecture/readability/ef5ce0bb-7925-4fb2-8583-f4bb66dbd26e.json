Architizer is thrilled to publish the definitive — and beloved — compendium of the 12th Annual A+Awards winners. Founded on the premise of democratizing architecture, the A+Awards is the industry’s largest and most international awards program and honors the best architecture, spaces, and products from across the globe. The latest collection of winners reflects a collective desire to regenerate, reuse, rethink, reinvent or reimagine architecture and spaces, forming a positive precedent for the next generation. Order Book Now This year’s volume is a true atlas of the world’s best architecture, with scores of countries represented. All told, Architizer’s publication celebrates the ability of architects to create buildings that improve the lives of people around the globe. It is this far-reaching context that makes “Architizer: The World’s Best Architecture” an essential addition to the library of discerning design lovers everywhere. This year’s winners include work by signature firms like Foster + Partners, Mecanoo, Neri\u0026Hu and more. Many smaller, younger or more specialized studios, such as  VAN VAN Atelier, Steffen Welsch Architects and FrankFranco Architects, also grabbed their opportunity, submitting winning projects that wowed the jury and the public alike — now they are published internationally alongside some of the most renowned names in the profession. Tower 15 by OODA, Leça da Palmeira, Portugal | Jury Winner, Multi Unit Housing – High Rise, 12th Annual A+Awards  The judges were consistently awed by the new architectural directions signaled by the cohort of this year’s finalists, with many citing the renewed importance of contextualization, both with the immediate surroundings and with history, through an emphasis on regional materials, labor and techniques that respond to local conditions and heritage. The increasing prominence of landscape-driven design and building reuse across the globe was also remarkable. All of these tendencies highlight the industry’s shift towards greener, more environmentally minded practices, proving that high-tech innovations are not the only way forward; low-tech innovations in passive heating and cooling, water reuse, and natural ventilation and illumination abound. With projects ranging from rural community centers to national transportation infrastructure, this year’s winners demonstrate the extraordinary impact of architecture at both local and global scales, highlighting works that act as new models for communities and cities worldwide. Order Book Now Left: Perelman Performing Arts Center at the World Trade Center by REX, New York City, New York | Popular Choice Winner, Hall / Theater, 12th Annual A+Awards Right: Richard Gilder Center for Science, Education, and Innovation by Studio Gang, New York City, New York | Jury Winner, Museum, 12th Annual A+Awards Half of the projects included in the book came out on top with the prestigious A+Awards jury, made up of more than 400 luminaries from fields as diverse as construction, fashion, publishing, product design, real-estate development and technology. The jury represents a sought-after segment of design-savvy professionals, and the Jury Winners therefore have a stamp of industry-wide approval. The other half secured Popular Choice awards, having been voted the best according to hundreds of thousands of votes by a global, public audience. The resulting collection of projects is therefore a true and comprehensive reflection the world’s finest architecture, in the eyes of all that experience it.
