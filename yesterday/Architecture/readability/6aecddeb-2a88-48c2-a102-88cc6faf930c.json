  "text": "The Main Entry Deadline for Architizer's 2025 A+Product Awards is Friday, December 6. Get your brand in front of the AEC industry’s most renowned designers by submitting today. In 2024, the idea of “workplace” and what that represents has significantly shifted. Whether spaces for permanent, hybrid or freelance workers, over the last five years, the office as a concept has undergone a massive transformation. The high expectations and shifting requirements of employees and employers are being researched and understood better than ever before. Offices are no longer designed with ultimate productivity at the core of their ethos. Today, the workplace has become somewhere that is expected to nourish creativity, nurture its inhabitants and adapt to the unique needs of every individual. This year’s Architizer A+Product Awards winners capture this ambition brilliantly, offering solutions for workspaces that are adaptive, intuitive and unapologetically innovative. Enter the A+Product Awards What makes an office the best in the world? It’s not bean bags, beers or bland breakout spaces. Today, the office is a balanced ecosystem of both products and people— thoughtfully considered, seriously sustainable, highly inclusive and at the forefront of design strategy. Each product on this list shapes the experience of being at work in a positive way to help architects and designers create the best environments possible for the workforce of tomorrow.

Qwel Acoustic Ceiling Tiles By Genesis Products Jury Winner, Finishes, Ceiling, 2024 A+Product Awards Qwel Acoustic Ceiling Tiles are a combination of bold aesthetics with quiet function, using sustainable PET fibers to bring sound-absorbing serenity to otherwise busy and noisy workplaces.
