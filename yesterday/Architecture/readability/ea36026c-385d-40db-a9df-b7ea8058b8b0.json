  "text": "Presented by ThumaThe corner of Spring and Wooster in SoHo has seen a flurry of activity recently, as shoppers flock to a new generation of stylish showrooms (including the first-ever brick-and-mortar space for It brand Jacquemus). But last month, all eyes were on its neighbor, Thuma, as the chic home brand welcomed the design in-crowd to its new flagship at 99 Wooster for an evening of mingling and experiencing the company’s warm, minimalist line IRL. Alex Hamilton, Thuma’s design and trade lead, played master of ceremonies alongside AD PRO associate director Lila Allen, with the pair touring designers through the airy environs—and even, at times, getting hands-on with Thuma’s display of the brand’s signature Japanese joinery.AD PRO’s associate director Lila Allen and Thuma’s design and trade lead Alex Hamilton hosted the soiree. Sean SimeWith two floors of display—including pint-size, three-dimensional models of Thuma’s signature products—the showroom offered ample space to explore the brand’s collection. Sean SimeThe store, Thuma’s inaugural flagship, is the brainchild of architect Stephan Wiemer, who rubbed elbows with attendees including Yaiza Armbruster, Kevin Greenberg, and Madelynn Ringo. Occupying a structure first erected in 1881 and landmarked five years ago, Thuma’s showroom goes far beyond the typical look-and-see approach of standard retail spaces, instead offering a serene place to gather, explore, and get inspired. Lending a helping hand in that endeavor are features like Cafe Thuma, a hospitality space serving French pastries and expertly brewed coffee (though on this particular evening, rosemary gimlets and sparkling wine were the drinks of choice), and an upstairs lounge where designers and their clients can explore material samples and discover reading materials aplenty. The brand’s partnership with Uprise Art meant that walls were decked out with arresting works too.Members of the AD PRO Directory toasted new Thuma arrivals—such as the Essential Bed—against the backdrop of the new store. In addition to offering a place to browse materials and products, the space showcases the construction of the brand’s most iconic wares (including the display of joinery on a wall on the ground floor, seen here). Sean SimeDanu Kennedy of Parts and Labor Design flips through the latest issue of AD during the event. Sean SimeThuma’s Essential Bed was in the spotlight at the event on the second floor, alongside other products from the brand. Sean SimeA material palette of bleached oak, polished concrete, and travertine—a surface that is having a moment, according to AD’s senior design editor Hannah Martin—set an inviting backdrop for the evening’s guests, who caught up about new ventures, shifts in operations models, recent travels, and products they’re loving now. Among them: the Essential Bed, which made quite the impression on the brand’s second floor. The low-profile platform bed, which is made from recycled rubber wood, embodies Thuma’s clean-lined, light-footprint approach to design—an ethos that resonated throughout the showroom. During the festivities, guests also caught a sneak peek of Thuma’s new loungewear line, which arrives just in time for holiday gifting. (What better to go with a new bed than an übercozy robe?)“Thuma is not just creating beautiful products, but also crafting spaces that inspire, connect, and invite calm,” Hamilton noted in his remarks to guests, adding that Wiemer’s design was “guided by the belief that good design is good hospitality.” Staggered among the plush benches, interactive displays, and clean-lined surroundings, designers seemed to already be settling right in. Good hospitality, indeed.",
