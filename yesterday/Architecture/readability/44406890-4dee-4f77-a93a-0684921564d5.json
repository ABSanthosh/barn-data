  "text": "WHY designs first major contemporary art museum in thailandNamed after the Thai word for ‘raw’ or ‘authentic,’ Dib Bangkok, Thailand’s first major museum dedicated to international contemporary art, is set to open in December 2025. Kulapat Yantrasast and WHY Architecture transform a 1980s warehouse in downtown Bangkok to host the 6,600-square-meter, three-story institution featuring eleven gallery spaces, a central courtyard, an outdoor sculpture garden, and a penthouse for special events.Including over 1,000 works by more than 200 artists, the museum’s collection spans painting, sculpture, photography, large-scale installations, and new media, with most pieces dating from the 1990s to the present. Dib Bangkok’s inaugural exhibition, Invisible Presence, honors the artistic vision of art collector and singer Petch Osathanugrah, showcasing major works from this expansive collection. Including artists such as Montien Boonma, Lee Bul, Anselm Kiefer, and Alicja Kwade, the exhibition explores the interplay between visible and hidden forces in contemporary art.images courtesy of Dib BangkokDib Bangkok unfolds across three levelsThe museum, founded by Purat (Chang) Osathanugrah, carries forward the artistic legacy of his late father, Petch Osathanugrah, whose renowned private collection serves as the foundation for Dib Bangkok’s exhibitions. Reflecting Bangkok’s evolving role as an international art hub, American practice WHY architecture’s design follows a contemplative journey across three levels. The ground floor retains the industrial origins of the former warehouse with exposed concrete surfaces, creating a raw, grounding experience. The second floor, inspired by introspection, features an old Thai-Chinese window grille—a vestige of the building’s past—encouraging a deeper connection between space and history. The top floor is dedicated to white-cube galleries illuminated by natural skylights, culminating in the sawtooth roof that defines the silhouette of the museum. Additional architectural highlights include The Chapel, a cone-shaped gallery clad in mosaic tiles, designed as a meditative space for immersive installations.‘At Dib Bangkok, we see art as the ripest fruit of human imagination—something to be savored, questioned, and shared. But more than that, we’re building Dib Bangkok to be a true creative oasis, a bridge between Thailand, Southeast Asia, and the global art scene— where deep art circles and the simply curious can come together.’ says founder Purat (Chang) Osathanugrah. ‘Bangkok, with all its energy, creativity, and unstoppable spirit, has long been overdue for an anchor to its contemporary art scene that matches its vibrancy—somewhere that celebrates art in a way as dynamic and bold as the city itself.Dib Bangkok is Thailand’s first major museum dedicated to international contemporary arta global platform for artistic exchange and creative learningDib Bangkok’s leadership team brings together international expertise. Dr. Miwako Tezuka, former Gallery Director of the Japan Society in New York, serves as the museum’s director, while Ariana Chaivaranon, with experience at Harvard Art Museums and UCCA Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, takes on the role of curator. Together, they aim to position Dib Bangkok as a global platform for artistic exchange and creative learning. Beyond its exhibitions, Dib Bangkok willl also serve as a cultural hub, fostering dialogue among artists, curators, and the public. As Thai art scene continues to expand, the museum marks a significant step in connecting Bangkok with the international contemporary art world.WHY Architecture transforms a 1980s warehouse in downtown Bangkok into a three-story institutionthe museum houses eleven gallery spaces, a central courtyard, an outdoor sculpture garden, and a penthousePetch Osathanugrah’s private collection serves as the foundation for the exhibitions at Dib Bangkok",
