Many architects were influenced by the country’s intercultural identity. Most notably, the national Artist for Architecture, Leandro Locsin, was known for his distinct style, crafting masterpieces like the Cultural Center of The Philippines. During the 1920s, architect Juan Nakpil paved the way for environmentally conscious construction techniques. He utilized bamboo as a locally sourced component for his designs instead of relying on imported materials such as stone and brick. Conversely, cities like Makati or Manila have now been transformed into bustling urban centers, filled with high-rise structures incorporating solar framing and rainwater collection systems, thus responding to the challenging tropical climate. Filipino architects have reveled in the country’s intercultural, diverse nature. By creating new “assemblies” between architectural typologies and practices, they are constantly progressing the country’s built environment without sacrificing its cultural heritage. With so many architecture firms, it’s challenging for clients to identify the industry leaders that will be an ideal fit for their project needs. Fortunately, Architizer is able to provide guidance on the top design firms in the Philippines based on more than a decade of data and industry knowledge. How are these architecture firms ranked? The following ranking has been created according to key statistics demonstrating each firm’s architectural excellence level. The following metrics have been accumulated to establish each architecture firm’s ranking in order of priority: The number of A+Awards won (2013 to 2025) The number of A+Awards finalists (2013 to 2025) The number of projects selected as “Project of the Day” (2009 to 2025) The number of projects selected as “Featured Project” (2009 to 2025) The number of projects uploaded to Architizer (2009 to 2025) The foot of this article explains each of these metrics in more detail. This ranking list will be updated annually, taking into account the new achievements of Philippine architecture firms throughout the year.

T. Jordan Ong graduated B.S. in Architecture from the College of Architecture and Fine Arts (Now College of Architecture) at the University of Santo Tomas. He has worked in various reputable architectural firms and has always risen among the top key employees. He has handled hundreds of residential and high-rise projects in one of his previous firms, where he worked as department head for construction. But having the drive and passion to pursue his goal, he humbly started his own practice in the summer of 2007. He has since expanded his portfolio, designing various projects ranging from high-end residential projects, townhouses, mid-rise buildings, high rise buildings, restaurants and commercial buildings. He embraced the modern minimalist style, which shows in all his works, but has added his own style in the process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSome of TJSO ARCHITECTS’ most prominent projects include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/scrap-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eSCRAP HOUSE: BICYCLE FRAME HOUSE\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/modern-tropical-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eMODERN TROPICAL HOUSE\u003c/a\u003e, Pinamalayan, Philippines\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/yu-house/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eYu house\u003c/a\u003e, Quezon City, Philippines\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/uno-resort-hotel/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eUno resort hotel\u003c/a\u003e, Puerto Princesa, Philippines\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/projects/cogeo-commercial-building/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eCogeo Commercial Building\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n  \u003cp\u003eThe following statistics helped TJSO ARCHITECTS achieve 2nd place in the 8 Best Architecture Firms in the Philippines:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n  \u003ctable\u003e\n    \u003ctbody\u003e\n              \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eFeatured Projects\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e2\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n                \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eTotal Projects\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e7\u003c/td\u003e\n        \u003c/tr\u003e\n            \u003c/tbody\u003e\n  \u003c/table\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003chr/\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003e1. \u003ca href=\"https://architizer.com/firms/wta-architecture-design-studio/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"\u003eWTA Design Studio\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\n\t\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=1680\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip\" data-src=\"https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=1680\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip\" data-srcset=\"https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=1680\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip 1680w,https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=1080\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip 1080w,https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=760\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip 760w,https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=625\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip 625w,https://architizer-prod.imgix.net/media/mediadata/uploads/1732862231727IMG_20241127_091039-01.jpeg?fit=max\u0026amp;w=368\u0026amp;q=60\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;auto=compress\u0026amp;cs=strip 368w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1680px) 1680px,(min-width: 1080px) 1080px,(min-width: 760px) 760px,(min-width: 625px) 625px,368px\" alt=\"© WTA Design Studio\" itemprop=\"contentUrl\"/\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e© WTA Design Studio\u003c/p\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe believe in and socially relevant practice architecture.
