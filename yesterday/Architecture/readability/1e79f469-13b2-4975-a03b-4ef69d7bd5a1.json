  "text": "Lluís Bort Documents the forgotten architecture of MallorcaPhotographer Lluís Bort’s project Empty Architectures documents abandoned buildings in Mallorca, emphasizing their architectural significance and potential for rehabilitation. The photographic project explores how these structures, originally designed for specific functions, have become obsolete over time and now stand as remnants of the built environment.The series presents various building typologies, including a former hospital left unused after the construction of a new facility on the city’s outskirts, a Mallorcan textile factory that played a key economic role during the Civil War, and the island’s largest wine cellar, which ceased operations in the 1990s following multiple expansions. Each building is captured against a gradient blue sky, visually isolating its form and highlighting its spatial qualities.Discoteca Dhraa Nite City [1986-1993] (Porto Cristo, Islas Baleares) 2021 | all images by Lluís BortEmpty Architectures highlights the potential for adaptive reuseFrom an urban planning perspective, photographer Lluís Bort’s project addresses strategies for repurposing these spaces. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) provides financial support for adaptive reuse initiatives, enabling the transformation of these buildings into new community facilities. Additionally, master planning plays a key role in establishing phased interventions, ensuring a structured approach to their rehabilitation.Since the project’s inception in 2019, some of the documented sites have undergone restoration efforts, integrating them into the city’s cultural landscape. The work underscores the potential of strategic rehabilitation, proposing alternative uses such as museums, exhibition spaces, and community centers. By reconsidering the role of these structures within contemporary urban contexts, Empty Architectures highlights the intersection of historical preservation and future functionality.Estadio de Fútbol Lluís Sitjar [1945-1999] (Palma, Islas Baleares) 2021Discoteca Es Fogueró Palace [1989-1992] (Alcúdia, Islas Baleares) 2021Cementerio Bon Sosec [1993] (Marratxí, Islas Baleares) 2021Bodega Es Sindicat [1921-1993] (Felanitx, Islas Baleares) 2021",
