  "text": "Now open for entries, the Architizer Vision Awards is expanding its mission with the launch of the Visionary 100, a new global spotlight on architecture’s best concept designers, storytellers and visual thinkers. Set for publication later in 2025 and validated by Architizer’s international jury, including renowned architects such as Steven Holl, Winka Dubbeldam and Daniel Libeskind, this vital new platform will shine a light on those defining the visual culture of architecture — today and tomorrow. To apply, simply enter the 2025 Vision Awards in one or more of the 50+ available categories. Every Winner in this year’s program is guaranteed a place in the Visionary 100, an exclusive editorial directory that will be updated each season and republished annually. Firms, individual professionals and students are eligible for inclusion. The Vision Awards Main Entry Period is open for just 4 weeks, so don’t miss out: Start your Vision Awards submission to secure a place in the running for the Visionary 100 and a host of other prizes for your work! Apply for the Visionary 100 Photograph by Kevin Scott, 2023 Vision Awards Special Mention, Architectural Photographer of the Year. Why the Visionary 100 Matters Featured on Architizer.com and shared with our audience of 4.75 million+ architects, clients and collaborators, this is your chance to be recognized for how you think and communicate about design, from the smallest details to the most ambitious concepts for buildings, cities and beyond. Architecture is evolving at breakneck speed, and so too is the way it’s communicated. The Visionary 100 will serve as a critical reference point for editors, curators, clients, and design leaders seeking to understand and celebrate who is shaping the visual culture of architecture today—and who will shape it tomorrow. This widely published feature will be more than a list: It will form a launchpad for architectural discourse and a benchmark for the next generation of creative leaders. Whether you’re an independent visualizer or part of an international design firm, inclusion in the Visionary 100 signals that your work is setting the pace for the profession.

A Program Built for Creative Thinkers Each winner of the 2025 Vision Awards, across every category, will automatically earn a place in the Visionary 100.

Architectural Vision – Celebrating single images and videos that capture the essence of architecture through renderings, photography, film, drawing, and physical models. Architectural Visionary – Recognizing firms and creators for outstanding portfolios of work across their chosen medium. Explore the categories in full here. Each submission will be judged by a world-class jury of architects, designers, and visual communication experts, with a strong focus on concept, clarity, innovation, and visual impact.
