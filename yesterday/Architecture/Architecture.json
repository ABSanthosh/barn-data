    "description": "Located in East York, Toronto, Periscope House is a renovation-addition project in which the existing one-story bungalow is renovated and a second floor is added on top. It was commissioned by a young professional couple with two children, to create a more personalized and sustainable setting for their lives. Coinciding with the pandemic, however, which has doubled or even tripled the material costs, it eventually went through a drastic revision, which resulted in removing half of the second floor and relocating children's bedrooms to the ground floor. Yet, by utilizing the removed area as a void, the project has gained a series of double-height spaces on the ground floor, which has bestowed a distinctive exterior form that resembles a periscope or an antique camera with an accordion bellow.",

    "description": "Since 1919, Sociedade de Cultura Artística has cherished the dream of having its own theater. Designed in 1942 by architects Rino Levi, Roberto Cerqueira Cesar, and F. Pestalozzi, the TEATRO CULTURA ARTÍSTICA was built between 1947 and 1949. The inauguration, held on the evenings of March 8 and 9, 1950, was marked by two extraordinary concerts conducted by Heitor Villa-Lobos and Camargo Guarnieri, prepared specifically for the occasion. These concerts celebrated the opening of what was then one of the largest and most modern cultural complexes in Latin America. Initially, the auditorium had 1,500 seats arranged in a wide fan shape, with a double rear wall to shield the interior from external noise. The visibility and acoustics had been carefully studied, providing excellent conditions.",
