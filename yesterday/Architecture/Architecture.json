    "description": "This is a project to convert a property with a poor approach into a men's salon on the third floor of a tenant building in an arcade in Naka Ward, Hiroshima City, which is entered from a closed and narrow spiral staircase. By using the poor visibility and approach as a backhand, the shop proposes fashion, art, and lifestyle that only those who arrive here can know. We wondered if we could create a space like a members-only online salon that only you know about and don't want to share with others, making you want to come back again. The name of the shop is derived from the British musician of the same name, The 1975, and I had listened to his albums in the past, so music became a common image source with the client.",
