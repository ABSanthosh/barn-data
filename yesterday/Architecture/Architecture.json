    "description": "The Mapfre Chiclayo Cemetery is located in the province of Monsefú, Lambayeque, Peru. The area was occupied by crops and rice fields, distributed over flat and slightly uneven terrain corresponding to the Chancay River basin. This river branches into canals, turning the area into a fertile valley. In the distance, 'Cerro El Reque' stands out as the only monumental element amidst the vast landscape, becoming a significant landmark for both the site and its residents. Cerro El Reque and the valley are accompanied by several archaeological complexes within the property, such as 'Siete Techos' and 'Ventarrón.' The latter, with over 4,500 years of history, preserves the oldest murals on the American continent.",
