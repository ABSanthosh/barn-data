It is situated in the wine growing Breede River Valley, an hour and a half's drive outside of Cape Town. The farm's attractions also include the Bosjes Chapel designed by Steyn Studio, a restaurant, a large visitors garden, and a garden caf√© and shop designed in collaboration with Steyn Studio. Lower down the farm is also the Botha's Halte Primary School designed by Meyer \u0026 Associates. Dating back to 1790, the Bosjes Farm Herehuis (manor house) sits at the foot of the Waaihoek mountains, with its characteristic Cape Dutch gable addressing the valley. Beside it, arranged along the contour are Schuur (historical barn) and Stalle (historical horse stables) buildings - a typical arrangement of Cape Dutch farms.",
