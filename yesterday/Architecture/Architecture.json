After more than 70 years of organic growth without a defined master plan for its campus, a historic opportunity arose to rethink and project it for the next 50 years. The plan required the sale of almost a third of the land to finance the project, which necessitated a complete rethinking of the arrangement of the new buildings within the campus.",

    "description": "In the hills of Palo Alto, California, an iconic Eichler home has been respectfully transformed by architect-artist Gustave Carlson. Originally built in 1971 and custom-commissioned by architect John S. Lynd, a personal friend of Joseph Eichler, the home carries a rare pedigree among the region’s mid-century residences. Today, it belongs to a couple with four daughters and an expansive art collection, much of it by emerging female artists. Carlson’s thoughtful update bridges past and present, enhancing the home’s functionality while preserving its optimistic spirit.",
