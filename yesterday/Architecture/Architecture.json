A false phenomenon that seems real but does not exist is the dictionary definition of \"virtual.\" Now that unprecedented technologies are being incorporated into everyday life and are living together, we have entered an era where we cannot help but consider various virtualities as real. The act of entrusting work to AI, the lack of fandom between avatar singers and real singers, and the popularization of AR-based games make us feel that the scope of virtuality has changed significantly.",

The building's original features—exposed brick and steel—speak to this era’s emphasis on functionality over ornament.",
