    "description": "In recent years, housing prices in Vietnam's big cities have been rocketing and have quickly become unaffordable to most young, average-income singles and couples, who have no choice but to live in small, poorly-designed and uncomfortable rental rooms crammed in typical tube-houses. As a result, improving the living quality of the occupants while ensuring financial affordability has been a critical dual objective of designing inner-city rental co-living projects. Cloud House is a boutique co-living building in a busy urban area of Ho Chi Minh City. The 70 square-meter site is located in a 4-meter-wide alleyway and surrounded by many townhouses, which are varied in sizes and heights. The design proposal is driven by three interconnected concepts: contemporary loft-style private suites, multifunctional semi-public spaces, and a glimpse of nature within a high-density urban context.",
