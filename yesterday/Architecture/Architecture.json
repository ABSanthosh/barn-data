    "description": "\"The architecture cannot be totally explained but must be experienced.\" TropiBox Kochi features interconnected levels and open spaces, with pavilions designed to surprise and create a cohesive whole. Careful attention to detail, scale, and proportion enhances the human experience. Inspired by Sri Lankan architect Geoffrey Bawa, TAB has crafted a unique blend of greenery-filled architecture and tropical modernism. The primary challenge was to design a home that provides each inhabitant with their own space while encouraging interaction. The building is organized using a vertical stacking strategy, with gardens and glass walls nestled between two main concrete façades. This design approach improves the microclimate by introducing natural ventilation and daylight into every room while the alternating openings enhance visibility and interaction among family members.",
