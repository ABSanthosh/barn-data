The arrangement of volumes and voids beneath this roof defines the rhythm of the structure, dissolving the boundaries between the house and its surroundings. The architecture blends with the sky and the horizon of the Cerrado, creating a continuous connection with the landscape and allowing the natural environment to permeate daily life.",
