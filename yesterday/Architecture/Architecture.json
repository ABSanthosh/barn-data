After taking over a vast kitchen and warehouse originally designed for large-scale food service, ABA's client—a team of cooking and event planning professionals known for innovative cuisine, bespoke presentation techniques, and an award-winning cookbook—approached the Architects with what they described as a \"happiness project.\" Their goal was to attract both current and potential employees back to in-office work post-pandemic by transforming their new space into a welcoming, light-filled workplace for planners and chefs alike, and to craft an immersive experience for their own clients.",
