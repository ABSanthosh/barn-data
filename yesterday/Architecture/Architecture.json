Set on a trapezoidal site in a medium-density suburb of western Bangkok, the building turns its angular face toward a busy main road, shielding its interior behind minimalist surfaces. Designed in close collaboration with its owner—a tattoo artist known for his craft—the project goes beyond function, creating a space for expression, narrative, and creativity.",
