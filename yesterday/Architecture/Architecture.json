    "description": "Veron The Shop is located in a former garage of a central building owned by the clients' family since its completion. Due to the successive layers of pavement added to the sidewalk and the degradation of the access ramp, the garage remained unused for decades. The client sought to revitalize the unused space by converting it into a small boutique for accessories and fashion items. The 22 sqm space consists of a main room that was intended for parking and a small storage room that, in the proposal, became the fitting room. The challenge was to create a contemporary identity for a small shop that, although street-facing, was not visible to passersby, as it is located in the basement level.",
