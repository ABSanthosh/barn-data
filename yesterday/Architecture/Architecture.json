    "description": "The proliferation of villas on Tehran's outskirts reflects more than a desire to escape the city's clamor and density. These homes embody a spirited pursuit of leisure and conviviality. The dynamic interplay of indoor and outdoor spaces, coupled with a playful exploration of different design eras, creates an atmosphere of intrigue and vitality. These villas are stages for the celebration of life, where residents and guests alike can wander, discover, and immerse themselves in a world of endless fascination. Spaces that offer a heightened incentive to stimulate the taste and curiosity of their subjects, where the unexpected leaves a special sensory quality in the mind of the viewer. The play of solid and void volumes, diverse paths, and stairways, not only strengthens the permeability of spaces but also offers a potential opportunity for viewers to climb over the building and become one with the fluidity of the spaces as their memories evolve.",

    "description": "True to its name Retreat Home by Neogenesis+Studi0261 is a get-away house to escape the frenzied hustle and bustle of city life. A holiday home to a diamond merchant in Surat, this elemental yet contemporary house has been designed to embrace extended families making room for warm interactions as it seamlessly connects the indoor with the outdoor. The idea was to envisage a space where rustic extravagance entwines with comfort, where every detail is meticulously crafted to create lasting memories. In its first appearance, the abode reveals itself as a two-tiered linearly designed structure partly camouflaged in the greens. The house sits there with a picturesque pitched roof, overlooking an abundance of greens waiting to express its narrative.",
