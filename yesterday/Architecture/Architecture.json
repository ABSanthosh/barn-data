    "description": "Hai Au Restaurant is located on the land of the old restaurant, in the Hoan My Resort. The land is adjacent to Nguyen Thi Minh Khai Street connecting to Binh Son Beach, which is the main traffic axis for people in the whole city to go swimming. With the characteristic of a narrow land shape, stretching along the East-West axis towards the sea. Therefore, the design plan is placed in the relationship between: the overall existing resort - people - natural landscape along the coast. The plan is carefully studied for a friendly, open architectural form, adapting the existing values on the land. The project has a scale of 1 floor, with a reasonably distributed layout that allows the green core to be interwoven deep into the project and condensed in architectural lines.",
