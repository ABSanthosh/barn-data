The barn hadn't been touched in over 60 years but for the turkey vultures who had made it their home. Despite its rough condition, the barn is an integral part of the farmstead and demolishing and/or replacing it was quickly ruled out. We created a plan that would preserve its weathered character while stabilizing the structure and protecting it for the long term.",
