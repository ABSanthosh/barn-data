Additionally, to the east, there is a trail created by reclaiming an existing stream. Within this context, the architecture harmonizes with its surroundings while balancing the urban and natural environments. To address height restrictions and the dense residential setting, the lower floor incorporates a fence to block views, while the upper floor is designed with interior windows to establish a gentle boundary with the downtown area. The design prioritizes privacy for the surrounding residential environment while maintaining a connection to the cityscape.",

    "description": "The village house is located at the top of the slope, above the village of Paredes de Coura Due to its location, shape and size, the house is a prominent element that imposes itself on the village experience. It was built for commercial use – Pharmacy. Elegant, large spans, decorated with stonework elements, such as jambs, lintels, among others. This house is different from the local architecture. The location, the ornamental elements and the exterior proportions lead us to an image of a spatially refined house. It leads us to imagine spaces decorated with shapes and materials very much in the “Art Nouveau” style.",
