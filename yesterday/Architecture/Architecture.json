    "description": "Planned and built in the early 1970's, Black Butte Ranch sits the base of The Three Sisters mountains in the Oregon's Central Cascades, the gateway to Oregon's high desert from the Central Willamette Valley. The 1,800-acre site is now both a home for year-round residents and a popular vacation destination. The Ranch community began a comprehensive redevelopment plan in 2013, and after working with Hacker on the new Lakeside recreation and dining complex (completed in 2016) and a new General Store (completed in 2021), the team's attention turned to the resort's 50-year-old Lodge. As one of the Ranch's original structures, the Lodge's iconic period architecture made it beloved by many, including the Hacker design team. Hacker's analysis found accessibility issues, aging mechanical systems, and an outdated layout, making a renovation impractical. After the decision for new construction was made, Hacker began an extensive year-long outreach process to understand the community's vision and priorities for its replacement.",
