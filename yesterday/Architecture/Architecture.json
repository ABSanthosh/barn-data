    "description": "The Staymore flagship store is located on a site with a view of the pedestrian park along the Suwoncheon River and the subway passing by beyond it. The 300-pyeong site, located at the corner of three roads, was an irregular trapezoidal shape. Reflecting the brand's characteristics of offering a comfortable bedroom lifestyle, the building was designed to be as low and wide as possible, and the building was naturally derived as a polygonal mass following the maximum building-to-land ratio. As a result, the building blends in well with the low-development rate surrounding landscape and the Suwoncheon pedestrian park, and the observer experiences different faces of the building depending on the point of view from which they stand.",
