    "description": "For the people of rural Vietnam, the \"Chái\" is an extension of the main house, a space that embodies simplicity, functionality, and familiarity. Whether serving as a kitchen, a veranda, or a communal area, the \"Chái\" always evokes a sense of warmth and closeness. Typically open or with minimal doors, it allows for natural ventilation from front to back, with an extended roof providing shade and shelter. Much like the \"Thảo Bạt\" houses in Southern Vietnam, which serve as gathering spaces for guests, celebrations, or relaxation, Trúc Lâm Anh Retreat embraces the essence of a \"Chái,\" a transitional, expansive, and connective space.",
