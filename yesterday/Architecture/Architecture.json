    "description": "Tan Hapjeong is the second location of the Tan brand, following the first store in Yeonnam, both designed by oftn Studio. Before beginning the design of the Hapjeong branch, two primary points were emphasized. The first was to create a space with a distinctly different mood from the Yeonnam store. Interestingly, before starting the design, the team explored the hair portfolios and social media profiles of the designers who would work in this space. The goal was to reflect the personality and style of the actual users in the design, thereby completing the brand's identity. The client also aimed to differentiate this location by appealing to designers with unique styles or those pursuing alternative approaches to hairstyling compared to the first store.",

The space, designed by Simone Ferkul Projects, evolves the iconic, innovative designs of the first two locations, but with a twist. Rather than being expressed in a new material, Milky's distinctive elongated diamond is unfolded into three dimensions. Metal, wood and stone surfaces were used to create the 3d pattern. Creative thinking found functional uses for the shape which is apparent in the shelving, displays, even a door handle.",
