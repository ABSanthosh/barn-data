    "description": "Historically, architecture has been anchored to the ground on which it stands. However, in contemporary cities, architecture needs greater agility and freedom to increase its chances of participating in and intervening with the qualities of everyday life. Contemporary architectural discourse has been exploring methods of creating temporary and alternative relationships with the ground, aiming to produce provisional and adaptive spaces. The Walking Canopy, situated in the historic city of Isfahan, is a project that pursues this idea to define a new relationship between architecture and urban life at a very small scale, where a radical idea meets low-budget and low-tech conditions.",
