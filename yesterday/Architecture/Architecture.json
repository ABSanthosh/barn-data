    "description": "The interior employs the design principle of \"less is more\" to match the modern, white facade, reaching a rational balance between the volumes and divisions of each space. Limited colors and single materials expand the visual scale and embody a modern ambience. The 3-story floor plan coordinates the westward mountain-facing floor-to-ceiling windows. The outdoor pool serves as a micro-climate control factor. Natural lighting, views, and ventilation are prioritized in order to maintain a comfortable, livable indoor climate. Minimal materials, shapes, and cabinets were employed to retain spaciousness.",

Through an open call and several visits, the chosen school in Brazil was the Municipal Rural School Nossa Senhora da Conceição, a public elementary school in Mogi das Cruzes, São Paulo. Occupying a building from the 1950s, it had only two classrooms, bathrooms whose sewage was directed to the nearby stream, and makeshift offices for administration and teachers in small spaces, all while surrounded by a large grassy area and beautiful landscape.",
