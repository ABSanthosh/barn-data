Situated high above the Sonoma Valley, the home embraces sweeping views while integrating seamlessly with the landscape. Created for a young San Francisco couple, the residence steps down the ridge line, weaving around oak trees and carefully following the land's natural contours. Designed by Holder Parlette, a firm known for its integration of architecture, landscape, and interiors, the Ridge House exemplifies a deep commitment to connecting the built and natural environment, capturing the beauty of its site.",
