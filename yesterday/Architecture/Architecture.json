    "description": "The project combines three architectural expressions that resonate with the urban challenges of the neighborhood. The first, a structural grid in white concrete, represents a Mediterranean identity and speaks of the thickness, shadow, porosity, rhythm, and framing of the large landscape. It complements the thickness of the loggias and becomes the very language of the architecture. The second is a more restrained composition, allowing the poetic landscape of the area to emerge in the heart of the block. The last expression refers to a domestic scale, seen in the white concrete-roofed houses and the pathways through the project.",
