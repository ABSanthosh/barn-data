With the social areas strategically placed in the center of the lot, the project was designed to encourage residents to spend time with their families, integrate indoor and outdoor spaces and make the most of natural light. “From the beginning, our intention was to ensure fluid circulation, while at the same time preserving moments of intimacy, with solutions that value both socializing and seclusion,” explain the architects.",

In Eindhoven, a 1970s villa in disrepair has been thoughtfully transformed by Wenink Holtkamp Architecten into an energy-neutral home that honors its architectural roots. Tucked beneath tall trees on the edge of the city, the house now balances past and present through a renovation that prioritizes preservation over demolition. The result is a quiet evolution of form and function, where original character meets contemporary comfort.",
