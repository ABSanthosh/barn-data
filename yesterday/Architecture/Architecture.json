    "description": "A Reinterpretation of the Speakeasy Through Materiality and Spatial Choreography – Renesa Architecture Design Interiors Studio presents Lair, an immersive hospitality experience that redefines the traditional idea of the speakeasy through a contemporary lens. Designed as an architectural journey of concealment and revelation, the Lair fuses raw materiality, layered spatial transitions, and oriental undertones to create a sanctuary of curated indulgence. Located in the heart of Gurgaon, the Lair plays with the ideas of secrecy and intimacy. It is not just a bar—it is a meticulously constructed narrative that slowly unveils itself through light, shadow, and form. The design choreographs a movement from openness to enigma, from bustling social zones to hidden private corners.",

    "description": "House CF, designed by Sandra Sayeg, was born from a genuine desire: that of a young family with two children seeking a countryside retreat that could combine warmth, togetherness, and functionality. The starting point was an existing house with a structure that was limited in relation to the extensive program of needs - five suites, a game room, gym, sauna, wine cellar, gourmet area, among others. The challenge was to enhance the existing architecture while expanding the spaces in a sensitive, coherent, and contemporary way.",

The Suzhou Tongli Villa, designed by Hangzhou Shihe Design, isn’t lavish in the traditional sense. There’s no overstatement, no grand gesture. Instead, its beauty is born of stillness, breath, and deep personal resonance.",
