In February 2025, five finalist teams were selected by the Queen Elizabeth Memorial Committee to develop a master plan honoring and celebrating the late Queen. The memorial aims to provide visitors with a space for reflection in London's St James's Park, a site of historical and constitutional significance. Foster + Partners' winning proposal features a new bridge inspired by the Queen's wedding tiara, a Prince Philip Gate, and new gardens. The design will continue to be developed until April 2026.",

Its spirit is unapologetically bold, with vibrant hues of red, blue, and yellow woven throughout the interiors—an ode to the optimism, color, and playful composition that defined mid-century design. These tones do more than decorate; they infuse the space with warmth, character, and a sense of joyful nostalgia.",
