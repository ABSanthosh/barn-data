Situated on Delaware Street in the trendy South Broadway district, the company has transformed a historic 1910 industrial train depot into a modern hub of creativity and innovation. Astroscale enlisted Denver-based, women-owned architecture firm Neoera to design a space that preserved the building's rich history while reflecting the company's innovative, forward-thinking nature and fostering an environment that welcomed scientists, visionaries, industry partners, and governmental agencies. The thoughtful, creative design resulted in a flexible, friendly, and inspiring 13,500-square-foot office space that pays homage to the structure's past and Astroscale's Japanese roots.",
