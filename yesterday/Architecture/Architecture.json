The central design element is an orange curve, symbolizing the unending path of growth and knowledge, which begins in early childhood and extends throughout life.

    "description": "The Music Center Tel Aviv-Jaffa is a re-designed Jewish-Arab cultural hub that encourages coexistence through musical education. Situated in the heart of Groningen Garden, it serves diverse young communities in the southern neighborhoods of Tel Aviv-Jaffa. Nestled among eucalyptus trees and constructed in stages, this “garden building” consists of the old wing (1965) — a modernist concrete and silicate structure housing administrative offices, rehearsal halls, and classrooms — and the new wing (1992), which features a lobby, a 385-seat concert hall, and backstage facilities. Originally established as the “Orchestra House,” the building employed a shell and volume approach, with each space defined as a separate acoustic volume. Though it is not listed for municipal preservation, the renovation project seeks to uncover the building’s historical layers and original geometry.",
