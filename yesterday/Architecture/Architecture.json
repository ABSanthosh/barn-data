The existing structures used to belong to an old organ atelier, called Manufacture d'Orgues de Bruxelles. To uncover the qualities of the factory building, a process of 'matchmaking' resulted in an innovative approach towards the programming of the new offices: the existing structures, as well as the interior and surrounding climates, were analyzed and matched with specific activities from the Greenpeace team (from formal meetings to wall climbing), resulting in a low-tech project and a high-quality work environment.",
