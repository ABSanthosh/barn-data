    "description": "The name In-Between House draws from its very form—a composition of four cuboid volumes arranged with deliberate gaps in between. These interstitial spaces are where landscape is invited in: pockets of greenery, planters, and water features that soften the geometry and activate the voids. It is in these \"in-between\" spaces that daylight pours in, casting shifting patterns across interior surfaces and creating conditions for planting to thrive. These voids not only connect the masses visually and experientially, but also serve as spatial buffers, providing a sense of privacy from adjacent neighbors while still drawing in light and ventilation deep into the home.",

Set on a wooded plot, the house is composed of a series of gabled volumes built with a metal structure, forming a fragmented composition that defines different areas of use and reinforces the connection with the surroundings.",
