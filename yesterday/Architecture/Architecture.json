    "description": "In the 19th arrondissement of Paris, within Parc de la Villette, the architectural firm Loci Anima (led by Françoise Raynaud) delivered in December 2024 the renovation of La Géode and its hemispherical cinema, originally designed by Adrien Fainsilber, for Universcience (owner) and Pathé Cinémas (concessionaire). While the IMAX screen was already immersive, it is now the whole cinema that has been transformed into a fully immersive experience. Even before entering, the dichroic façade invites visitors into a realm of illusion, where natural light seems to flow through a coffered ceiling. This façade echoes the aesthetics of contemporary stained glass, playing with light and reflections. Its raw, geometric design evokes a monolithic stained-glass effect, where transparency and color blend seamlessly with architectural rigor—an ode to the cinema itself.",
