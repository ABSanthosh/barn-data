    "description": "Happy Fursday, feline fam. We don't have to tell you how weird and wonderful cats are because you already know it. That's what makes cats so meowgical - they are these graceful, beautiful, sleek creatures….and also the derpiest things with four legs that walk on this Earth. They can be purrfectly perched on a windowsill looking like a gift from the heavens in all of their meowjestic beauty, and then you call their name, and they look at you with a face only a mother could love.Cats have the best qualities of us, combined with an accidental silliness that just makes the purrfect recipe for cuteness. They are quirky. They are weird. They are silly. They are gorgeous. They are soft. They are fluffy. They are the purrfect pets and companions. They are also our greatest source of entertainment, as well as the rulers of the internet. Please enjoy this kitty compilation of cats simply being cats because there is nothing better than a cat that embraces their own silly nature.",

    "description": "House cats combine two things that we hoomans so dearly revere. One is their ability to stay young in their mind, retaining moments of innocence and wonder that we have long forgotten about. And two, is their ability to do exactly what they want and have a plethora of ideas stored up. This inevitably leads them to having the time of their lives no matter what they get up to, because it is always full of wonder and always something they really want to do. And seeing how they usually get up to their shenanigans at night while we sleep or when we are away at work, we figured we would share some of these sweet moments with you such that you don't miss out.So without further delay we hope these hilarious house cats make your day.",

    "description": "We've all heard of the evil step-mothers from Disney movies growing up, but an evil step-father is an entirely different ball game. This usually includes way more physical altercations and sometimes even a prison sentence. If you have seen any toxic man with anger issues raised with misogyny, then you get the picture. And they used to totally get away with it! But it isn't the 1950s anymore, and more and more people are standing up to these \"evil step-feathers.\"  Take for instance this young man who made his sister beam with pride! When they were young, their parents got divorced and their mother started dating a man who turned out to be horrible. Lucky, their mom eventually left him and even got a restraining order. So, even though the trauma was done, they were given a chance to heal, and heal they did. Healing is never linear, however, and there is no limit to healing. So, when this guy came across his ex-evil-step dad 25 years later, he still was able to enact something he needed for his healing process: Shame. That's right! Sometimes you just have to shame the person who caused you trauma in front of your society to get some final satisfaction.",

    "description": "Favors need reciprocation, never in complete equity, as no two exchanges or circumstances are going to be the same. But in spirit. It's not even about the act of the reciprocation either, it's more about the fact that you are capable of thinking of others outside of yourself, recognizing the things they have done for you, experiencing the gratitude and mirroring it back. It sounds complicated but it's actually really simple if you remain open and aware of the things other people are going out of their way to do for you.But don't expect everyone to understand this, there are many out there who will take the favor without ever thinking, and this extends to all forms of giving and reciprocation in relationships. If you've ever been locked into a relationship with someone who is completely incapable of reciprocating you'll know exactly what this is like.",

    "description": "I remember in some intro-level compsci class learning that credit card numbers were checksummed, and writing basic functions to validate those checksums as an exercize. I was young and was still using my \"starter\" credit card with a whopping limit of $500, so that was all news to me. Alex's company had a problem processing credit cards: they rejected a lot of credit cards as being invalid. The checksum code seemed to be working fine, so what could the problem be? Well, the problem became more obvious when someone's card worked one day, and stopped working the very next day, and they just so happened to be the first and last day of the month. protected function validateExpirationCcDate($i_year, $i_month) { return (((int)strftime('%y') \u003c= $i_year) \u0026\u0026 ((int)strftime ('%m') \u003c= $i_month))? true : false; } This function is horrible; because it uses strftime (instead of taking the comparison date and time as a parameter) it's not unit-testable. We're (ab)using casts to convert strings into integers so we can do our comparison. We're using a ternary to return a boolean value instead of just returning the result of the boolean expression. But of course, that's all the amuse bouche: the main course is the complete misunderstanding of basic logic. According to this code, a credit card is valid if the expiration year is less than or equal to the current year and the month is less than or equal to the current month. As this article goes live in March, 2025, this code would allow credit cards from April, 2026, as it should. But it would reject any cards with an expiration of February, 2028. Per Alex, \"This is a credit card date validation that has been in use for ages.\" [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "We previously discussed some whitespacing choices in a C++ codebase. Tim promised that there were more WTFs lurking in there, and has delivered one. Let's start with this class constructor: QBatch_arithExpr::QBatch_arithExpr(QBatch_unOp, const QBatch_snippet \u0026, const QBatch_snippet \u0026); You'll notice that this takes a parameter of type QBatch_unOp. What is that type? Well, it's an enumerated type describing the kind of operation this arithExpr represents. That is to say, they're not using real inheritance, but instead switching on the QBatch_unOp value to decide which code branch to execute- hand-made, home-grown artisanal inheritance. And while there are legitimate reasons to avoid inheritance, this is a clear case of \"is-a\" relationships, and it would allow compile-time checking of how you combine your types. Tim also points out the use of the \"repugnant west const\", which is maybe a strong way to word it, but definitely using only \"east const\" makes it a lot easier to understand what the const operator does. It's worth noting that in this example, the second parameters is a const reference (not a reference to a const value). Now, they are using inheritance, just not in that specific case: class QBatch_paramExpr : public QBatch_snippet {...}; There's nothing particularly wrong with this, but we're going to use this parameter expression in a moment. QBatch_arithExpr* Foo(QBatch_snippet *expr) { // snip QBatch_arithExpr *derefExpr = new QBatch_arithExpr(enum_tag1, *(new QBatch_paramExpr(paramId))); assert(derefExpr); return new QBatch_arithExpr(enum_tag2, *expr, *derefExpr); } Honestly, in C++ code, seeing a pile of \"*\" operators and raw pointers is a sign that something's gone wrong, and this is no exception. Let's start with calling the QBatch_arithExpr constructor- we pass it *(new QBatch_paramExpr(paramId)), which is a multilayered \"oof\". First, the new operator will heap allocate and construct an object, and return a pointer to that object. We then dereference that pointer, and pass the value as a reference to the constructor. This is an automatic memory leak; because we never trap the pointer, we never have the opportunity to release that memory. Remember kids, in C/C++ you need clear ownership semantics and someone needs to be responsible for deallocating all of the allocated memory- every new needs a delete, in this case. Now, new QBatch_arithExpr(...) will also return a pointer, which we put in derefExpr. We then assert on that pointer, confirming that it isn't null. Which… it can't be. A constructor may fail and throw an exception, but you'll never get a null (now, I'm sure a sufficiently motivated programmer can mix nothrow and -fno-exceptions to get constructors to return null, but that's not happening here, and shouldn't happen anywhere). Then we dereference that pointer and pass it to QBatch_arithExpr- creating another memory leak. Two memory leaks in three lines of code, where one line is an assert, is fairly impressive. Elsewhere in the code, shared_pointer objects are used, wit their names aliased to readable types, aka QBatch_arithExpr::Ptr, and if that pattern were followed here, the memory leaks would go away. As Tim puts it: \"Some folks never quite escaped their Java background,\" and in this case, I think it shows. Objects are allocated with new, but never deleted, as if there's some magical garbage collector which is going to find the unused objects and free them.
