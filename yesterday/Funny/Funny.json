    "description": "I do genuinely believe that there is a psychological power to having a good tool, even if the tool's ability to complete the job is more than adequate. The very quality of whatever you're using to complete whatever you're doing makes your brain take to the task that much more earnestly.As someone with more-than-an obsession with music production, there are many instances where having a high-end instrument or equipment for making music really just becomes unnecessary, especially with how good \"in the box\" digital computer programs, known as Virtual Studio Technologies (VSTs), are now. Now, I love the tactical feel of analog outboard gear as much as the next producer, and it's really hard to admit, but it is just easier to get a clean recording with a VST that sounds almost imperceptibly the same as the real deal. Certainly, by the time the audio has been recorded, mixed, and mastered, 99.5% of listeners are never going to be able to tell the difference.This is an endless debate for producers and musicians, with staunch supporters on either side. And despite being the source of endless debate for guitarists who like to endlessly debate about what about an electric guitar determines a guitar's sound or \"tone,\" it's pretty well accepted that a decent enough electric guitar can make the same sounds as a top-of-the-line expensive one.What can't be recreated, though, is the feel and effortlessness of playing a top-end instrument. That spine-chilling knowledge that you hold in your hands something that is itself a work of art. The same goes for synthesizers, whose unique quirks (read: limitations) bear the fruit if streamlined decision making and creativity. With this tactile feel is born inspiration that most won't find with a mouse and keyboard.I'd argue that the same thing applies to any tool for any job, right down to the pen and paper you have on your desk, and to the chair that you're sitting in while you're working. If you're doing serious work, there's something about a space that feels and looks serious, and tools for a job that match the part that really sets the mood. Being comfortably and ergonomically positioned will further encourage the focus and productivity of the 40+ hours a week you spend sitting there.I mean, can you imagine walking into your attorney's office and they're all decked out with RGB LED gaming hardware and a see-through LED computer case that screams, \"I watch Linus Tech Tips on my breaks.\" On the one hand, you might be impressed that your attorney is doing their work with some impressive computing power, but you might also be wondering how much work they're actually getting done when they're spending all of their time in the office pubstomping on CS:GO.The same thing goes for creative contractors you might hire. Run of the mill IT-issued refurbished PC? Boring. $4000 MacBook Pro that is mainly just used for word processors? Now you're talking. Besides, it's the same logical reasoning I used when, as a \"serious\" writer in university, I bought myself a fountain pen and leather-bound notebook. The effect worked, and in that period of my life, I got a lot of writing done, and successfully convinced a girl that I was thoughtful and \"deep.\" I'm not sure if she's figured it out yet, but the novel I was working on remains, to this day, unfinished.",

    "description": "Getting food or a drink when you're in a rush can be a high-stress activity. Sometimes you're running late to work or an interview, and you know if you arrive hungry or uncaffeinated, your performance will suffer. So you make the choice to stop and grab a coffee, and of course, that's the one time they take forever to make your order. It'll be the one time that the barista decides to clean the espresso machine surface before making your beverage, or they'll be out of that sandwich you ordered, and they'll have to grab it from the back room. The whole time, they'll be moving as slowly as possible, as so often happens when we're rushing.¬†This person had a maddening experience while trying to grab a coffee. The baristas took so long to make the drink that they made this person late! And that's not all to the story, as you can read about below.¬†After that, read about some dates that went wrong, like one person who sadly \"Made cake for a girl and got stood up and ghosted.\"",

Do we always have room for one more? Yes. Do we wish the new cat was a teeny tiny maine coon kitten that is more fluff than body? Absolutely yes. But, Blake, you might say, how would you go about getting a brand new kitten on such short notice? Turns out we have a secret technique that works for capturing new feline friends without even needing the CDS's help.It's purrfectly easy and diabolically simple. You only need two ingredients for this plan to work: a box (or some other container that a cat will want to squeeze into) and patience. Patience is the hardest part, honestly. Step one is to set out the container in any place where you know cats roam, and the second is to wait until one hops in! We've gathered some pics below of some silly success stories, they're purrfectly hissterical!Fluff. Chaos. Drama! Our weekly cat newsletter has it all -¬† subscribe here.",

    "description": "I am on record as not particularly loving JSON as a serialization format. It's fine, and I'm certainly not going to die on any hills over it, but I think that as we stripped down the complexity of XML we threw away too much. On the flip side, the simplicity means that it's harder to use it wrong. It's absent many footguns. Well, one might think. But then Hootentoot ran into a problem. You see, an internal partner needed to send them a JSON document which contains a JSON document. Now, one might say, \"isn't any JSON object a valid sub-document? Can't you just nest JSON inside of JSON all day? What could go wrong here?\" \"value\":\"[{\\\"value\\\":\\\"1245\\\",\\\"begin_datum\\\":\\\"2025-05-19\\\",\\\"eind_datum\\\":null},{\\\"value\\\":\\\"1204\\\",\\\"begin_datum\\\":\\\"2025-05-19\\\",\\\"eind_datum\\\":\\\"2025-05-19\\\"}]\", This. This could go wrong. They embedded JSON inside of JSON‚Ä¶ as a string. Hootentoot references the hottest memes of a decade and a half ago to describe this Xzibit: Yo dawg, i heard you like JSON, so i've put some JSON in your JSON [Advertisement] BuildMaster allows you to create a self-service release management platform that allows different teams to manage their applications.
