    "description": "The divvying up of the household duties will be an ongoing issue with the people you live with for your entire life. First with your siblings and parents, then roommates, then with your spouse or cats. Who does what, and how much and when will be a matter of constant ongoing debate, while it's important to keep in mind that everyone overestimates their own percentage of overall contribution and underestimates the contributions of others, it becomes readily apparent that some people just have a knack for not pulling their own weight.When you're a young adult living at home with your family, things can get a bit more complicated, there's this shifting dynamic both psychologically and realistically of you now being an adult yourself and finding your own way while still being under your parents' roof and wing. It's different from simply moving out when you're 18 or 19, in which case the dynamic of the relationship changes in a moment, since you're not seeing each other every day.",

Unless you're one of the lucky people living in Arizona, the rest of us are stuck in this biannual nightmare that wreaks havoc on our sleep schedules. Yeah, getting an extra hour in the fall feels amazing, and yeah, having more sunlight in the evening during spring is cool, but is it worth the disruption, or rather, destruction, of our daily routines that were still trying to figure out? The answer is no.Every year, without fail, daylight savings sneaks up on us like it hasn't been happening our entire lives. One minute, you're fine, and the next, you're showing up to work half-conscious and pushing buttons on your keyboard like you're in an episode of Severance. Afternoon coffee consumption has to be skyrocketing nationwide, while post-work naps become the new norm for the next week. At this point, we're all just barely surviving. Am I being dramatic? Yes, but I'm also sleep deprived. Can you blame me?",

A cat that is friendly and sweet, and does not take no for an answer. That is precisely the type of outdoor cat that loves adventures and the great outdoors that we would love to have one day.A cat like Askhim is the ultimate dream—a fearless explorer with a heart full of adventure. He doesn't just tolerate the outdoors; he thrives in it, embracing the salty sea breeze and the ever-changing landscapes of the ocean. While most cats are content to curl up in sunbeams indoors, Askhim prefers the open sea, basking in the sun on the deck of his human's boat as they journey from one breathtaking destination to the next.With his boat captain human by his side, Askhim experiences the world in a way few felines ever do. He's not just a passenger—he's a co-captain, a watchful companion who keeps an eye on the horizon and enjoys the gentle sway of the waves. Whether he's lounging under the sky, inspecting the ropes and sails with intense curiosity, or watching fish dance beneath the surface, every day is a new adventure.",

He has done a ton of research on Sam, as he has for other \"rot economy\" tech figures, and thus has a sophisticated factual scaffold built around them he can hold them to. For me, it's just like a… taste, or smell. I'm receiving information from some kind of sense, and it is setting off red lights on the panel. Is that fair? I dunno. If I saw a huge lizard gnawing at the roots of Yggdrasil, to what extent am I required to give it the benefit of the doubt? We clown ourselves when we hold ourselves to baroque standards of fairness around malefactors like this. They know about the rules, they just think those rules are for other people. They depend on this asymmetry. They rely on it.",

Rudi A. reported this Errord, chortling \"Time flies when you're having fun, but it goes back when you're walking along the IJ river!\" Is the point here that the walking time is quoted as 77 minutes total, but the overall travel time is less than that? I must say I don't recommend swimming the Ij in March, Rudi.   I had to go back quite a while for this submission from faithful reader Adam R., who chimed \"I found a new type of datetime handling failure in this timestamp of 12:8 PM when checking my past payments at my medical provider.\" I hope he's still with us.   Literary critic Jay commented \"Going back in time to be able to update your work after it gets published but before everyone else in your same space time fabric gets to see your mistakes, that's privilege.\" This kind of error is usually an artifact of Daylight Saving Time, but it's a day too late.   Lucky Luke H. can take his time with this deal. \"The board is proud to approve a 20% discount for the next 8 millenia,\" he crowed.   At nearly the other end of the entire modern era, Carlos found himself with a nostalgic device. \"Excel crashed. When it came back, it did so showing this update banner.\" Some programmer confused \"restore state\" with the English Restoration. Not that state, bub.   [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.

    "description": "I remember in some intro-level compsci class learning that credit card numbers were checksummed, and writing basic functions to validate those checksums as an exercize. I was young and was still using my \"starter\" credit card with a whopping limit of $500, so that was all news to me. Alex's company had a problem processing credit cards: they rejected a lot of credit cards as being invalid. The checksum code seemed to be working fine, so what could the problem be? Well, the problem became more obvious when someone's card worked one day, and stopped working the very next day, and they just so happened to be the first and last day of the month. protected function validateExpirationCcDate($i_year, $i_month) { return (((int)strftime('%y') \u003c= $i_year) \u0026\u0026 ((int)strftime ('%m') \u003c= $i_month))? true : false; } This function is horrible; because it uses strftime (instead of taking the comparison date and time as a parameter) it's not unit-testable. We're (ab)using casts to convert strings into integers so we can do our comparison. We're using a ternary to return a boolean value instead of just returning the result of the boolean expression. But of course, that's all the amuse bouche: the main course is the complete misunderstanding of basic logic. According to this code, a credit card is valid if the expiration year is less than or equal to the current year and the month is less than or equal to the current month. As this article goes live in March, 2025, this code would allow credit cards from April, 2026, as it should. But it would reject any cards with an expiration of February, 2028. Per Alex, \"This is a credit card date validation that has been in use for ages.\" [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.
