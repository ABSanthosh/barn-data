    "description": "Try to name a more iconic pair than cats and sleep. Go ahead, we'll wait. Actually, we might just curl up and nap while we do. And snooze. And stretch. And snooze some more. Why? Because deep down, we might actually be cats. And cats? They practically invented the art of sleeping. Their love affair with sleep is the most enduring romance we've ever seen.Cats sleep so much that the internet is basically full to the brim with memes and jokes about their eternal naptime. Honestly, there's plenty of time to make them while cats are snoozing their days away. They don't know, of course. They're completely oblivious. Why? Because they are- can you guess it?- asleep. Very surprising, they're asleep. Shhh… don't disturb them - they look far too precious when they're curled up and sleep like this.Celebrate the nap masters themselves with these adorable sleepy cat memes. Just don't let them make you too drowsy… unlike us… yawn… zZzZzZzZ…",

    "description": "Well, here we are again, feline fam. Another cat rescue story, but this time, there is more than a happily ever after….there is sweet, sweet revenge. Imagine getting a cat and then wanting to give it away - actually, we literally cannot imagine it. We cannot imagine ever wanting to part with any of our cats, but then again, not everybody loves cats as much as we do. One feline lover rescued this awwdorable grumpy cat from their owner, who wanted to sell him for the ripe price $5. Not only did he get a completely unique cat, whose naturally grumpy face is priceless, but now the cat is actually internet famous (obviously), and the wholesome feline savior is going to make some extra tuna money for her social media following. Some say revenge is a dish best-served cold, but we say that it's best when served with a big, fat check. Scroll down to see more pictures of this cute, cantankerous kitty below!",

    "description": "The struggle is real returning to work after a long weekend. Thanksgiving weekend gave us a glorious break filled with family, food, and an unreasonable number of leftovers we promised ourselves we'd \"get creative with.\" But now here we are, back at our desks, daydreaming about turkey sandwiches and that last slice of pumpkin pie waiting for us at home. The chaos of holiday gatherings has seamlessly transitioned into the chaos of work, and it seems impossible to get back into the swing of things. Maybe we should just take off until the new year.The Sunday scaries were at an all-time high this weekend, and now they're vying a little too close to a Monday meltdown as you stare at a calendar full of meetings you barely remember scheduling. Your inbox is overflowing, your coffee is lukewarm, and you can't even begin to think about the spreadsheet you completely \"forgot\" to finish before the long weekend. If you're struggling to stay awake after a carb-heavy holiday binge and the long break, you're not alone. These 25 work memes are here to help you laugh through the pain. Let's survive the workday together.",

    "description": "By now, we all know that job interviews are basically a game of strategy. As a candidate who wants to win the game, all you need to do is find the best answers to satisfy the interviewer, regardless of your thoughts or feelings, and you are one step closer to securing the job. It is well established that people constantly lie in job interviews and simply say what the interviewer wants to hear, just to get the job.'Why do you want to work for our company?' is an age-old question and its reply is the perfect example of lying to get the job. Job candidates have to come up with some nonsense answer about what they think is special about the company and role they are interviewing for, as if they haven't gone through dozens of interviewers who ask the same questions and expect the same answers. At some point, you become a master at replying with the perfect answers. So when the candidate in this story decided to tell the truth instead of supplying that perfect answer, it took both the interviewer and us by surprise.Keep scrolling to read the whole tale.

Steven J Pemberton deserves full credit for this finding. \"My bank helpfully reminds me when it's time to pay my bill, and normally has no problem getting it right. But this month, the message sent Today 08:02, telling me I had to pay by tomorrow 21-Nov was sent on... 21-Nov. The amount I owed was missing the decimal point. They then apologised for freaking me out, but got that wrong too, by not replacing the placeholder for the amount I really needed to pay. \"   Faithful Michael R. levels a charge of confusion against what looks like.. Ticketmaster, maybe? \"My card indeed ends with 0000. Perhaps they do some weird math with their cc numbers to store them as numerics.\" It's not so much weird math as simply reification. Your so called \"credit card number\" is not actually a number; it is a digit string. And the last four digits are also a digit string.   Marc Würth, who still uses Facebook, gripes that their webdevs also don't understand the difference between numbers and digit strings. \"Clicking on Mehr dazu (Learn more), tells me: \u003e About facebook.com on older versions of mobile browsers \u003e [...] \u003e Visit facebook.com from one of these browsers, if it’s available to download on your mobile device: \u003e [...] \u003e Firefox (version 48 or higher) \u003e [...] Um...

Grumbles DC \"Somebody please explain to me how 5+2+2+2+2+2+2+0.75+2+2=23. If WebAssign itself can't even master basic arithmetic, how can I trust it teaching me calculus? \"   Finally Andrew C. has a non-mathematical digit or two to share, assuming you're inclined to obscure puns. \"As well as having to endure the indignity of job seeking, now I get called names too!\" This probably requires explanation for those who are not both native speakers of the King's English and familiar with cryptographic engineering.   [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.

    "description": "Today is holiday in the US, where we celebrate a cosplay version of history with big meals and getting frustrated with our family. It's also a day where we are thankful- usually to not be at work, but also, thankful to not work with Brad. Original --Remy Anita parked outside the converted garage, the printed graphic reading Global Entertainment Strategies (GES) above it. When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct. “Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner. He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him. “Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.” “I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.” Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.” Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl. “We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.” Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.” Sticky Escalation Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harder to read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that have nothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed with development. -Anita Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?” “Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!” “I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him. The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!” Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space. “Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!” Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage. The Avalanche “Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business. “Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica. We even have a wiki for our framework!” “Well, listen to this. The day after you quit, the AC unit in the garage broke. I came into work to see Brad crying in a corner in his office. All of the sticky notes had curled in the humidity and fallen to the floor. The day after he got us all copies of Word. “Too bad we still don’t know what the title of the game is.” [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds.
