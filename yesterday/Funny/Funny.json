    "description": "What would you do if your boss told you to do something you knew was wrong? It's not just a casual thing, either: this person's boss seemed to have no idea that they were breaking a federal law. I don't know about you, but at many workplaces, you have to watch hours' worth of workplace instructional videos about employee rights and company responsibilities. These videos are mandated, and they're also incredibly boring. It's like watching paint dry. But it contains important information about the way employees should handle issues that come up in the workplace, as well as letting employees know what resources they have. Well, maybe this boss fell asleep during these annual instructional videos, or just doesn't listen to anything HR says, because he texted an employee something really shocking. It'd be egregious even if he verbally explained this to their employee… but to put it in writing is even worse for the boss. Let's hope that u/thanyou gives us an update if anything happens with this guy, and best of luck to them at the new gig. Up next, read about some hilariously bad presents people received during gift swaps, like one person who got a \"takeout box filled with broken cookies\" that were also leftovers from a party weeks ago!",

    "description": "Typically around the holiday season, corporate employers bosses go out of their way to make it seem like their employees are treated well. This can manifest itself in several ways, from treating time off like it's a luxury and not a right to extravagant, over-the-top Holiday parties that might make employees feel better if it weren't for the fact that the budget for said party could probably be used to pay employees better, but we digress… Here, we have a team of employees who weren't given any of those \"benefits.\" Instead, they were pressured by their HR representatives to each pitch in $20 for Christmas gifts for their CEO and CTO. These are the same folks who make at least five times what their employees make, as this Redditor pointed out. Shouldn't they be pitching in some of their own money for gifts to their employees?Keep scrolling below for the full story and for some commentary from yours truly.

It feels like we have been waiting for an entire year for this merry day to come again, like every hurdle we have passed led us a little closer to this beautiful, meowgical, purrfect day. And now, we're here. Finally. The morning after, and the first thing that we want to do - no, the first thing that we need to do… is start our morning with some purrfectly cheerful cat memes. Because hey, even Christmas morning has to start on the right paw, and some funny cat memes first thing are the best way to do it. In this sense, Christmas morning is no different. Silly cat memes like these kept us going while we waited for this day to come, and they will keep helping us thrive in the new year as well. So, enjoy these memes, friends, and happy holidays!",

    "description": "This story, we think, is a real Christmas miracle. A boy saved a kitten that was being harmed by a bunch of other kids by trading his skateboard for it. That's amazing. That is something that does not happen every day, and both he and the parents who raised him deserve all the praise in the world. But that's not the miracle. It's not the kitten getting rescued, not really. Of course, that's a miracle in and of itself, but the real miracle here is the kid and all the hope that he had given us for the world right in time for Christmas.It's not every day that we see someone being so kind to an animal - selflessly putting the animal first, rescuing the kitten and not caring about his toy being taken from him. In fact, we see the opposite much more often. So, on Christmas morning, it's only right to focus on the good things, and this… this might be one of the best, most uplifting things to happen all year long.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/best-of-2024-a-bit-about-the-hp3000",
    "description": "As we enter that little gap between Christmas and New Year's, we explore some of the highlights of 2024. We start with this historical computing story. And unlike the subject, this shipped ready to read (and reprint). --Remy Today's anonymously submitted story is a case where the WTF isn't the code itself, per se. This arguably could be a CodeSOD, and we'll get to the code, but there's so much more to the story. Our submitter, let's call them Janice, used to work for a financial institution with a slew of legacy systems. One such system was an HP3000 minicomputer. \"Mini\", of course, meant \"refrigerator sized\". The HP3000 itself is an interesting, if peripheral story, because it's one of the tales of a product launch going incredibly wrong. Let's talk a little history. We start with the HP2100 in 1966, which Hewlett Packard did nothing to design, and instead purchased the company that designed it. The core innovation of the HP2100 was that it was architecturally similar to a PDP-8, but supported full 16-bit memory, instead of PDP's 12-bit. HP didn't really know what they had bought- they marketed it as a \"test and instrumentation\" system, and were surprised when businesses purchased it for back office operations. They ended up with one of the most popular minicomputers for office use, despite it not being designed for that purpose. Thus began the projects \"Alpha\" and \"Omega\". Alpha was a hardware refresh of the 2100, with a better memory model. Omega was a ground-up redesign for 32-bit memory, which would allow it to support a whopping 4MB of RAM. There was just one problem with the Omega design: they didn't have funding to actually finish it. The project was killed in 1970, which threw some of the staff into \"wear black armbands to work\" levels of mourning. Unfortunately, while work was done on Omega, the scope of Alpha crept, which resulted in another project management wasn't sure could be delivered. But the market was there for a time-sharing minicomputer, so they pressed on despite the concerns. The HP2000-line had time sharing system that used multiple processors. There was a front-end processor which handled user interactions. Then there was the actual CPU, which ran programs. This meant that time-sharing was simplified- the CPU just ran programs in a round-robin fashion, and didn't have to worry about pesky things like user inputs. Essentially, it was really just a batch processing system with a multi-user front-end. The designers of Alpha wanted to support full multiprogramming, instead of this hybrid-ish model. But they also needed to support traditional batch processing, as well as real-time execution. So the team split up to build the components of the \"Multi-Programming Executive\" module, which would allow all of these features. The Alpha, which was still 16-bit, didn't have the luxurious 4MB of RAM- it had 128kB. The MPE used much more memory than 128kB. This led to a massive crunch as the programmers worked to shrink MPE into something usable, while marketing looked at the deadlines and said, \"We were supposed to be selling this thing months ago!\" The result was a massive war between engineering and marketing, where marketing gave customers promises about what the performance would be, engineering told marketing what the actual performance would be (significantly worse than what marketing was promising), and then management would demand engineering \"prove\" that marketing's over-promises could be met. The initial ship-date was November, 1972, and by god, they shipped on time. Nothing actually worked, but they shipped. The first computer out the door was returned almost immediately. It could only handle two simultaneous users before slowing to a crawl, and crashed every ten minutes. By December, HP had gotten that to \"crashes every two hours\". They kept shipping machines even as they had to cut features and reliability promises. Those frequent crashes also concealed another bug: after running for 24 days, the HP3000's clock would overflow (2^31 milliseconds) and the clock would magically reverse by 25 days. As one sysop of a purchased HP3000 put it: \"The original designers of MPE never thought the OS would stay up for 25+ days in a row\". After a bunch of management shuffling, the titular Packard of Hewlett Packard sent a memo: production was stopping and all sold computers were being recalled. Customers were offered HP2000s in its place, or they could wait until fall 1973 for a revised version- that would only support 4-6 users, far fewer than marketing's initial promises of 64. This pleased no one, and it's reported that some customers cried over the disappointment. With sales paused, the entire computer underwent a design overhaul. The resulting machine was faster and cheaper and could actually handle 8 simultaneous users. One year after the botched launch, the HP3000 went back on the market, and ended up being a full success. It was so successful, HP continued supporting the HP3000 until 2010, which is where Janice enters our story. Circa 2006, she needed to update some Pascal code. That code used a lot of bit-masks to handle flags, which is normally a pretty easy function in Pascal- the language has a standard set of bitwise operations. So Janice was surprised to see: FUNCTION BITON(A , B : INTEGER): BOOLEAN; VAR C : INTEGER; BEGIN CASE A OF 15 : C:=1; 14 : C:=2; 13 : C:=4; 12 : C:=8; 11 : C:=16; 10 : C:=32; 9 : C:=64; 8 : C:=128; 7 : C:=256; 6 : C:=512; 5 : C:=1024; 4 : C:=2048; 3 : C:=4096; 2 : C:=8192; 1 : C:=16384; 0 : C:=32768; OTHERWISE BITON:=FALSE; END; IF ((B DIV C) MOD 2) = 1 THEN BITON:=TRUE ELSE BITON:=FALSE; END; FUNCTION SETBITON(A, B : INTEGER) : INTEGER; VAR C : INTEGER; BEGIN CASE A OF 15 : C:=1; 14 : C:=2; 13 : C:=4; 12 : C:=8; 11 : C:=16; 10 : C:=32; 9 : C:=64; 8 : C:=128; 7 : C:=256; 6 : C:=512; 5 : C:=1024; 4 : C:=2048; 3 : C:=4096; 2 : C:=8192; 1 : C:=16384; 0 : C:=32768; OTHERWISE C:=0; END; IF NOT BITON(A,B) THEN SETBITON:=B + C ELSE SETBITON:=B; END; FUNCTION SETBITOFF(A, B : INTEGER) : INTEGER; VAR C : INTEGER; BEGIN CASE A OF 15 : C:=1; 14 : C:=2; 13 : C:=4; 12 : C:=8; 11 : C:=16; 10 : C:=32; 9 : C:=64; 8 : C:=128; 7 : C:=256; 6 : C:=512; 5 : C:=1024; 4 : C:=2048; 3 : C:=4096; 2 : C:=8192; 1 : C:=16384; 0 : C:=32768; OTHERWISE C:=0; END; IF BITON(A,B) THEN SETBITOFF:=B - C ELSE SETBITOFF:=B; END; FUNCTION LAND(A,B : INTEGER) : INTEGER; VAR I : INTEGER; BEGIN I:=0; REPEAT IF BITON(I,A) THEN IF BITON(I,B) THEN A:=SETBITON(I,A) ELSE A:=SETBITOFF(I,A) ELSE A:=SETBITOFF(I,A); I:=I + 1; UNTIL I \u003e 15; LAND:=A; END; This is a set of hand-reinvented bitwise operations, culminating in an LAND, which does a bitwise and (not a logical and, which makes it annoyingly misnamed). I wouldn't call the code a horrible approach to doing this, even if it's definitely an inefficient approach (and when you're running a 33 year old computer, efficiency matters), but absent built-in bitwise operations, I can't see a lot of other options. The biggest problem is that LAND will set bits on that are already on, which is unnecessary- an AND should really only ever turn bits off. Which, as it turns out, is the root WTF. The developer responsible wasn't ignorant about bitwise operations. The version of Pascal that shipped on the HP3000 simply didn't have any. No and, or, not, or xor. Not even a shift-left or shift-right operation. In any case, this is what happens when I start doing research on a story and end up getting sucked down a rabbit hole. As always, while Wikipedia's true value is as a bibliography. A lot of those links have much more detail, but I hope this quick overview was an interesting story.

    "description": "Last year, we spent our Christmas looking at some Christmas movies and specials, and rated them based on the accuracy of their portrayal of the IT industry. We're going to continue with that this year. Just like last year, we'll rate things based on a number of floppy disks- 💾💾💾💾💾 means it's as accurate as Office Space, whereas 💾 puts it someplace down around Superman III. Gremlins Technology has conquered the world, but none of it actually works. As Mr. Futterman (played by the classic character actor Dick Miller) points out: they've all got gremlins in them. Except, thanks to a goofy dad's last minute Christmas gift and some careless 80s teens, the gremlins aren't just taking over technology, but the entire town with their goofy violence. This was the most mentioned film left out last year. As far as tech industry representation, we've got a lot to discuss here. First, the father who purchases Gizmo- the Mogwai that becomes the source of all the gremlins- is an inventor. This is the 80s, and thus we're all recovering from the fads of Rubik's Cubes and Pet Rocks, so Randy Petlzer is trying to crash whatever the next fad is. He's got a collection of goofy gadgets, including the orange juicer above, which is itself a premonition of the Juicero startup, itself a goofy disaster of venture capital. An independent inventor with no real business model but a bunch of goofy ideas also thinks he's a genius. Where have I heard that before? At least, he did \"read the manual\" (listened to the instructions given to him by the very 80s orientalist stereotype) and even communicated them, so credit to that. But nobody actually followed those instructions anyway, which leads to all the chaos. Do you think I used the word \"goofy\" enough to describe this movie? It's very goofy, and I think it's gotten goofier with age, honestly. Without nostalgia, I wouldn't call it good, but it is goofy. The highlight of the film is Phoebe Cates's monologue about why she hates Christmas: a grisly tale about her father's death. Rating: 💾 The Apartment Bud Baxter has an apartment conveniently close to work- so convenient that all the executives at his company bring their mistresses there. It's great for Bud's career, but less good for his reputation and his own personal love life. So, this may be a stretch as Christmas movies go. It takes place around Christmas, but doesn't have a lot of Christmas themes. You know what it does have? A load of entitled management types who not only control Bud's life around the office, but his life at home, and definitely don't care about how that affects him. If this were in 2024, they'd be using bossware to track him and smart door locks to keep him out of his own house. Rating: 💾💾💾 The Knight Before Christmas A modern gal in Ohio has given up on love. A 14th century knight is magically transported to Ohio. Together, they discover the true meaning of Christmas- and love. This is Netflix's stab at a Hallmark level Christmas movie. The whole thing revolves around the Ohio town having a Christmas tradition of erecting a \"Christmas Castle\" and doing a pseudo-Ren Faire thing every Christmas which is not, as far as I know, a thing anywhere, except perhaps a few small towns in Europe, where they have naturally occurring castles. Our gallant knight gets to be flummoxed by modern technology, like the Alexa, but basically figures all this stuff out over the course of a few days. For IT accuracy, this is definitely: Rating: 💾 However, it's also worth noting that the plot kicks off with our modern gal hitting the befuddled knight with her car at the Christmas Castle. They go to the hospital, where everyone assumes he's an actor from the Castle, and now has amnesia after being hit by a car. Since he has no ID, instead of providing medical care for what they believe to be severe brain damage, they just… let her take him home with her. So, if we were rating this for accurately representing the health care system in the US: Rating: 💉💉💉💉💉 The Bear: Feast of the Seven Fishes \"The Bear\" focuses on Carmy, who is trying to turn his deceased brother's sandwich shop into a Michelin rated fine-dining restaurant. This episode flashes back to a Christmas before his brother died, and shows us what his family life was like, as his mother prepares the traditional \"Feast of the Seven Fishes\" for Christmas. So, unlike Christmas Castles, Feasts of Seven Fishes are real. I grew up with the loud Italian family. My grandmother was so Italian she came through Ellis Island and also had one of these to point at her Christmas Tree. We did not do the complete Feast of the Seven Fishes, because nobody wanted to work that hard, but deep fried kippers were always featured. These were whole fish, which you'd eat. Bones, faces and all. That was fine, but I was honestly really there for the ginettes (everyone else calls them anise cookies, but we called them ginettes). Our Christmas wasn't as stressful as Carmy's, and while folks got drunk, it was strictly \"the old guys drink too much and fall asleep in their chairs\" levels of drunk. Rating: 🍝🍝🍝🍝🍝 Dominic the Donkey When Santa wants to visit his \"paisans\" in Italy, his reindeer can't handle the hills- so he relies on his friend, Dominic, the Italian Christmas Donkey. Look, I had to suffer through this song growing up, so now you do to. Hit play. Put it on loop. You're trapped in here with us. Jingety jing! HEE HAW HEE HAW! IT'S DOMINIC THE DONKEY. Rating: 🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏🫏 The Iron Giant An alien war-bot crashes on Earth and gets amnesia, forgetting that it's a war-bot. Young Hogarth befriends the bot, and adventures ensue. Meanwhile 1950s Fox Mulder tries to track down the \"monster\" and put a stop to the Communist threat it represents. I know what you're saying: \"there's nothing Christmas here!\" But, based on this list so far, amnesia is a Christmas tradition! Setting that aside, I'm not religious, but if we're talking about keeping the \"Christ\" in \"Christmas\", you can't do better than a giant robot who dies for our sins and is reborn days later. Honestly, the Bible could have used more giant robots. Maybe a Godzilla or two. While the movie leans hard into Superman as its metaphor for heroism, Superman has frequently been appropriated as a Christ metaphor. Which, there's a whole lot to unpack there, given that Superman's creators were Jewish. This story features incompetent government agents trying to regulate technology they don't understand. While the film colors it in with Red Scare tones, it echoes the same constant shrieking from the FBI and NSA that regular citizens shouldn't have access to strong encryption (and they need a magical backdoor into all encryption algorithms to keep you SAFE). Or the countless \"think of the children!\" bills that attempt to police the Internet and always fail. Or the classic \"Felony Contempt of Business Model\"- the sections of the DMCA that make it illegal for you to refill your printer cartridges or jailbreak your phones.
