I leaned over to Noah in the theater and shook him shouting “BLADE” when Wesley Snipes appeared. While I liked seeing Gambit on screen and I appreciate that Channing Tatum likes the character, I have to say I don’t really see him as Gambit. He tried very hard and I don’t even hate the accent but he just doesn’t physically look like Gambit to me. If they want to get serious I think they need to hire someone like Austin Butler who I think would kill the role accent and all.",

If you think about it for just a few seconds, you will realize that it is true. So, is it really a surprise that cats and foxes are such good friends sometimes, that if their paths cross, they end up getting along? We don't think so. But after such a long time writing for ICHC, we have seen it many times. We have seen cats and foxes play together. We have seen cats groom foxes. We have seen foxes reunite with cats that they grew up with, and it's as emotional as any reunion video we've seen. This duo just kind of makes sense, so coming across this video didn't even surprise us. It did make us aww though. And we're sure it will do the same to you. Because no matter how many times you see it, watching cats and foxes be such good friends is one of the cutest, most wholesomest things in the world.",

    "description": "When \"dog guys\" gather together on the internet, things get… wholesome. You'll see what we mean shortly. Cats are an ideal pet for kids who want a sweet companion and parents who don't want a big lift in responsibilities. Cats are low maintenance, all they need is food, a clean litter box, water, and lots of love. Their charming nature can turn even the most extreme \"dog guy\" into a cat-loving king. And this phenomenon often occurs after dads provide their children with a friendly feline companion. It's no secret why dads nearly always become best friends with the cats they got for their kids or didn't even want to begin with. Get ready for a series of sweet, funny, and downright adorable photos that show just how irresistible a cat can be!",

But if you have a gap in your resume—for whatever reason—that makes the search nearly impossible. This guy in our next story exposed a flawed and discriminatory system by recording the conversation that pushed his patience to the limit.If you're chronically ill, life is hard enough as is without the job market breathing down your neck alongside your medical bills. The delicate balance of continued employment coupled with the existential dread of being unhealthy is enough to make any job searcher crack under pressure. But without pressure, we'd never have diamonds. The gem in this next story makes us all want to cheer him on after he caught a manager at a prospective job telling him that the only reason he was \"unhirable\" was because he was disabled.Keep scrolling for the satisfying story of a dude calling out a corrupt company for judging a book by its cover—for a cashier's job, no less.",

    "description": "As a gamer myself, and having lived with other gamers, once that mechanical keyboard gets clacking and the team call-outs start rolling in intense moments, it's going to be noisy for everyone else around you. With absolute certainty, when you're intently focused on something, you underestimate the amount of noise you're making. In the early hours of the morning, these sounds are amplified by the relative quiet of the world around us.And when you add paper-thin walls to the equation, you're going to end up with some pretty irate and sleep-deprived neighbors and roommates. Most people will wait until they're at the absolute shreds of sanity before saying anything, too.I once had a roommate who was otherwise great but would noisily play a team based game in the early hours of the morning on his gaming PC that he had cleverly situated in the room directly above mine. Needless to say, the noise-canceling headphones he wore didn't. He would always be apologetic before doing the same thing again the following night.The bottom line is that late-night noises are probably a lot louder than you think, and regardless of what your personal schedule is when you live with or adjacent to other people, there's definitely a moral responsibility not to upset their more socially accepted schedule.",

    "description": "ArSo works at a small company. It's the kind of place that has one software developer, and ArSo isn't it. But ArSo is curious about programming, and has enough of a technical background that small tasks should be achievable. After some conversations with management, an arrangement was made: Kurt, their developer, would identify a few tasks that were suitable for a beginner, and would then take some time to mentor ArSo through completing them. It sounded great, especially because Kurt was going to provide sample code which would give ArSo a head start on getting things done. What better way to learn than by watching a professional at work? DateTime datTmp; File.Copy(strFileOld, strFileNew); // 2 seconds delay datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); File.Delete(strFileOld); This code copies a file from an old path to a new path, and then deletes the old path after a two second delay. Why is there a delay? I don't know. Why is the delay written like this? I can't possibly explain that. Check the time at the start of the loop. When the second part of that time stops matching the second part of the current time, we assume one second has passed. This is, of course, inaccurate- if I check the time at 0:00:00.9999 a lot less than a second will pass. This delay is at most one second. In any case, ArSo has some serious questions about Kurt's mentorship, and writes: Now I don't know if I should ask for more coding tasks. Honestly, I think you should ask for more. Like, I think you should just take Kurt's job. You may be a beginner, but honestly, you're likely going to do a better job than this.
