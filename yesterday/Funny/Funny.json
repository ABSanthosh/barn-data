Has anyone gotten a week straight of a good night's rest? Has anyone not been completely exhausted by the end of the each day? Has anyone been able to afford to even eat healthy for a whole month?? Literally, where are the alien overlords already? Just take over, we're tired. Until then, use your PTO. It's time. Heck, even if you're out of PTO, take a vacation anyways. Who knows how many more days we have that is perfect breathable weather. Wow. I sound pretty dark… I could really use a week on the beach. That would definitely have me returning with a new appreciation for life. Like, who can hate the world right after getting treated so well by it? Don't answer that…",

You need to recognize the individual needs of each child, which includes helping them where they fall short and fostering in the areas they're interested.For instance, with this mother, who, after moving to a new city with her son and daughter to be closer to her aging parent, offered each of her children a chance to \"rent\" their room to her to work from for her hybrid working arrangement a couple of times a week. While her son quite aggressively declined, her daughter happily took her up on the offer, meaning that the $60 hybrid working allowance that the mother was receiving went straight to her daughter's pocket. Her son, now frustrated that he wasn't receiving a similar payment, complained about how unfair the situation was, sparking a feud in the family, with the mother's mother (her kid's grandmother) siding with the teenage boy.",

    "description": "We know that some people still don't believe this, but cats have feelings. Yes, shocking, we know. Cats are not aloof and uncaring and unfeeling like some haters still say that they are. Cats feel deeply - everything from love to pain. And hard as it may be for those haters to understand, cats love their owners a lot. More than we know. And for a cat to get abandoned by its owner is one of the worst things that you could do to it.Now, the cat in this story wasn't exactly abandoned. Her owner passed away, sadly, and even more sadly, the cat was found - with her owner - a week after their passing. We don't know how much the cat understood - we don't know if it was abandonment that she was feeling or just plain loss. What we do know is that she was angry, she was anxious, the rest of her family gave up on her, and the shelter she ended up in deemed her \"unadoptable\". It was the end of the road for Barbara… until, thankfully, someone took a chance on her.",

We have our meowgnificent office cats that keep us company while we work:First, we have the meowjestic queen of the house, named Queeny after her queenliness. She's so floofy and regal, and if she stops by your office chair and stares at you - you have to stop whatever you're doing and pet her soft white fur. Then, we have Krampus. He's a ginger berserker cat with no brain cells whatsoever between his two big ears. When he's calm, he'll stare at blank walls. But when he's not, he runs around like a zoomies demon. And lastly, we have the cutie patootie kitten Mitten. He's still so smol we don't know what he'll be like when he grows up, but we all love him so much.But assuming you don't have cats running around your workplace, but you still want to have this feline feel-good feeling on a Monday morning - what can you do? Well, that's not complicated - all there is to do is look at some feel-good feline funnies. Your Monday is bound to be better.",

    "description": "Kate inherited a system where Java code generates JavaScript (by good old fashioned string concatenation) and embeds it into an output template. The Java code was written by someone who didn't fully understand Java, but JavaScript was also a language they didn't understand, and the resulting unholy mess was buggy and difficult to maintain. Why trying to debug the JavaScript, Kate had to dig through the generated code, which led to this little representative line: dojo.byId('html;------sites------fileadmin------en------fileadmin------index.html;;12').setAttribute('isLocked','true'); The byId function is an alias to the browser's document.getElementById function. The ID on display here is clearly generated by the Java code, resulting in an absolutely cursed ID for an element in the page. The semicolons are field separators, which means you can parse the ID to get other information about it. I have no idea what the 12 means, but it clearly means something. Then there's that long kebab-looking string. It seems like maybe some sort of hierarchy information? But maybe not, because fileadmin appears twice? Why are there so many dashes? If I got an answer to that question, would I survive it? Would I be able to navigate the world if I understood the dark secret of those dashes? Or would I have to give myself over to our Dark Lords and dedicate my life to bringing about the end of all things? Like all good representative lines, this one hints at darker, deeper evils in the codebase- the code that generates (or parses) this ID must be especially cursed. The only element which needs to have its isLocked attribute set to true is the developer responsible for this: they must be locked away before they harm the rest of us.

David doesn't know. \"Microsoft Teams seems to have lost count (it wasn't a very big copy/paste)\"   A follow-up from an anonymous doesn't know either. \"Teams doing its best impression of a ransom note just to say you signed out. At least it still remembers how to suggest closing your browser. Small victories.\"   Bob F. just wants to make memes. \"I've been setting my picture widths in this document to 7.5\" for weeks, and suddenly after the latest MS Word update, Microsoft thinks 7.5 is not between -22.0 and 22.0. They must be using AI math to determine this.\"   Ewan W. wonders \"a social life: priceless...?\". Ewan has some brand confusion but after the Boom Battle Bar I bet I know why.   Big spender Bob B. maybe misunderstands NaN. He gleefully exclaims \"I'm very happy to get 15% off - Here's hoping the total ends up as NaN and I get it all free.\" Yikes. 191.78-NaN is indeed NaN, but that just means you're going to end up owing them NaN. Don't put that on a credit card!   [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod. Restrict NuGet feed privileges with ProGet. Learn more.",
