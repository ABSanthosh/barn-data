    "description": "We all want and need an advocate in the workplace, someone to have our backs in case other coworkers or authority figures start taking us for granted. Of course, in an ideal world, that's what human resources should be, but let's be realistic for a second. Human resources is all about protecting the company at the end of the day. Sure, they might project an image of solidarity with employees but always be careful not to be fooled by this facade.Now, this manager was against their boss's request to have their assistant come in and work on their requested day off, especially considering that this was all happening during Thanksgiving week! Just because employees can check their emails and Slack team chats on their phones, that does not mean they need to answer those missed calls and messages on their days off or even after their designated work hours. If you're someone who tends to feel guilted into being that responsive at all times, you might want to reconsider your work ethic so as to not give the impression that your employers can walk all over you. Time to find an advocate who will have your back!Keep scrolling below for the full story. For more, check out this post about a Karen coworker's temper tantrum.",

And seeing as yesterday was Thanksgiving we would not be at all surprised if you have had a little more than a little taste of what that maelstrom is like. So we figured you might need some help cooling off, which is why we made this list of hilarious cat child memes to help you calm down after a tumultuous Thanksgiving with your own family.From the simple-minded house cat who cannot help but hoover dry crunchies and puke them back up, to the freeloading feline who has a warning attached to its collar for all those who might try to feed him, to the surprising fur baby who not only loves a visit to the vet, but also particularly enjoys the sink at the vet's.",

But this month, the message sent Today 08:02, telling me I had to pay by tomorrow 21-Nov was sent on... 21-Nov. The amount I owed was missing the decimal point. They then apologised for freaking me out, but got that wrong too, by not replacing the placeholder for the amount I really needed to pay. \"   Faithful Michael R. levels a charge of confusion against what looks like.. Ticketmaster, maybe? \"My card indeed ends with 0000. Perhaps they do some weird math with their cc numbers to store them as numerics.\" It's not so much weird math as simply reification. Your so called \"credit card number\" is not actually a number; it is a digit string.

    "description": "Today is holiday in the US, where we celebrate a cosplay version of history with big meals and getting frustrated with our family. It's also a day where we are thankful- usually to not be at work, but also, thankful to not work with Brad. Original --Remy Anita parked outside the converted garage, the printed graphic reading Global Entertainment Strategies (GES) above it. When the owner, an old man named Brad, had offered her a position after spotting her in a student computer lab, she thought he was crazy, but a background check confirmed everything he said. Now she wondered if her first intuition was correct. “Anita, welcome!” Brad seemed to bounce like a toddler as he showed Anita inside. The walls of the converted garage were bare drywall; the wall-mounted AC unit rattled and spat in the corner. In three corners of the office sat discount computer desks. Walls partitioned off Brad’s office in the fourth corner. He practically shoved Anita into an unoccupied desk. The computer seemed to be running an unlicensed version of Windows 8, with no Office applications of any kind. “Ross can fill you in!” He left the office, slamming the door shut behind him. “Hi.” Ross rolled in his chair from his desk to Anita’s. “Brad’s a little enthusiastic sometimes.” “I noticed. Uh, he never told me what game we’re working on, or what platform. Not even a title.” Ross’s voice lowered to a whisper. “None of us know, either. We’ve been coding in Unity for now. He hired you as a programmer, right? Well, right now we just need someone to manage our documentation. I suggest you prepare yourself.” Ross led Anita into Brad’s office. Above a cluttered desk hung a sagging whiteboard. Every square inch was covered by one, sometimes several, overlapping sticky notes. Each had a word or two written in Brad’s scrawl. “We need more than just random post-its with ‘big guns!’ and ‘more action!’” Ross said. “We don’t even know what the title is! We’re going crazy without some kind of direction.” Anita stared at the wall of sticky notes, feeling her sanity slipping from her mind like a wet noodle. “I’ll try.” Sticky Escalation Brad, can we switch to Word for our documentation? It’s getting harder to read your handwriting, and there’s a lot of post-its that have nothing to do with the game. This will make it easier to proceed with development. -Anita Two minutes after she sent the email, Brad barged out of his office. “Anita, why spend thousands of dollars on software licenses when this works just fine? If you can’t do your job with the tools you have, what kind of a programmer does that make you?” “Brad, this isn’t going to work forever. Your whiteboard is almost out of room, and you won’t take down any of your non-game stickies!” “I can’t take any of them down, Anita! Any of them!” He slammed the door to his office behind him. The next day, Anita was greeted at the door by the enthusiastic Brad she had met before the interview. “I listened to reason, Anita. I hope this is enough for you to finish this documentation and get coding again!” Brad led Anita into his office. On every wall surface, over the door, even covering part of the floor, were whiteboards. Sticky notes dotted nearly a third of the new whiteboard space. “Now, Anita, if I don’t see new code from you soon, I may just have to let you go! Now get to work!” Anita went to sit at her desk, then stopped. Instead, she grabbed a bright red sticky note, wrote the words “I QUIT” with a sharpy, barged into Brad’s office, and stuck it to his monitor. Brad was too stunned to talk as she left the converted garage. The Avalanche “Are you doing better?” Jason called Anita a few weeks later. Their short time together at GES has made them comrades-in-arms, and networking was crucial in the business. “Much,” she said. “I got a real job with an indie developer in Santa Monica.
