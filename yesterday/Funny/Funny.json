    "description": "Where to begin… The employers of healthcare facilities aren't always looking out for their employees' and patients' best interests. The same can be said for any other employer in every other field, but messing with the health of real humans' lives seems like a pretty messed-up thing to do, especially when you're treating an elderly population who are especially vulnerable.Messing with the essential workers who ensure that patients are receiving the best care they possibly can is another level of arrogance and malpractice. Where do we draw the line between casual understaffing and malpractice? There's no line to be drawn—they are the same thing in a setting like a nursing home.That's where this next story takes place, and an employee is running about how their nursing home is understaffed. Their employers insist they \"take\" their break without actually taking a break, so it looks like they gave them one, which is highly illegal. Even when the employee fights back, they tell her to take it easy and deal with it. Scroll below to read the story and what commenters have to say.",

    "description": "Isn't it the best feeling when you've finally made and accepted the decision to quit that deadend job you've been working at for way too long? That job that has totally compromised your mental health and only paid you pennies? Yeah, it feels so job to say goodbye to all of that. You could be the bigger person and do it the societally acceptable way of giving a two week's notice and saying cordial goodbyes yadda yadda yadda. But why give them that dignity? Did they ever return that kind of respect?? NO. So drop the mic and quit on the spot—walk out feeling satisfied that justice was served! You can see a beautiful example of that with this delivery woman. She was already planning on quitting, but was going to try and do it a little bit more politely. Even though the job was the worse. But after a snarky remark from a coworker, she pivoted and decided to quit in a spicier way.",

    "description": "Misha has a co-worker who has unusual ideas about how database performance works. This co-worker, Ted, has a vague understanding that a SQL query optimizer will attempt to find the best execution path for a given query. Unfortunately, Ted has just enough knowledge to be dangerous; he believes that the job of a developer is to write SQL queries that will \"trick\" the optimizer into doing an even better job, somehow. This means that Ted loves subqueries. For example, let's say you had a table called tbl_updater, which is used to store pending changes for a batch operation that will later get applied. Each change in updater has a unique change key that identifies it. For reasons best not looked into too deeply, at some point in the lifecycle of a record in this table, the application needs to null out several key fields based on the change value. If you or I were writing this, we might do something like this: update tbl_updater set id = null, date = null, location = null, type = null, type_id = null where change = @change And this is how you know that you and I are fools, because we didn't use a single subquery. update tbl_updater set id = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set date = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set location = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set type = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set date = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) update tbl_updater set type_id = null where updater in (select updater from tbl_updater where change = @change) So here, Ted uses where updater in (subquery) which is certainly annoying and awkward, given that we know that change is a unique key. Maybe Ted didn't know that? Of course, one of the great powers of relational databases is that they offer data dictionaries so you can review the structure of tables before writing queries, so it's very easy to find out that the key is unique. But that simple ignorance doesn't explain why Ted broke it out into multiple updates. If insanity is doing the same thing again and again expecting different results, what does it mean when you actually do get different results but also could have just done all this once? Misha asked Ted why he took this approach. \"It's faster,\" he replied. When Misha showed benchmarks that proved it emphatically wasn't faster, he just shook his head. \"It's still faster this way.\" Faster than what? Misha wondered.
