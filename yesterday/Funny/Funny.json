    "description": "We know that people say that cats are independent creatures who like their space and their alone time. We know that cats are not always known for being the friendliest. We know that cats don't always have the easiest time connecting with others. We know it. We just haven't seen it many times. Seriously. In our experience, cats bond with humans or other animals incredibly hard and fast. Maybe they are not the most social creatures, but cats sure do love their cuddles. And when cats lose someone that they love, someone that they are close to, one of those creatures that they have bonded with… they certainly feel that loss very strongly. All that love that they have to give - and there is a lot of it - needs a place to go. And that's certainly true for the kittens in this story - both of them. Both orphaned, one losing its brother too… they found one another and connected because they were meant to. And although they are not biologically related, these kittens will be siblings for life.",

    "description": "What is it about landlords and pushing everything to the absolute limit when it comes to financial recompensation? Damage one little corner of a 15-year-old carpet or a horrifically sun-faded curtain, and suddenly, they're quoting you for full replacement and the consequential loss involved with that replacement—purely as a means to keeping your entire deposit, money that they feel entitled to.Meanwhile, your time and your things are valueless to them and they will be slothful about anything that needs repairing. Plus, should they accidentally damage your things while on-site, they'll dismiss complaints with a wave of their handReally, in any situation, it's not ok to push something to your complete and absolute advantage, but especially when you're in a position of power. The reality is when it comes to renting and landlord, there's a distinct power imbalance; even excluding everything else involved in the arrangement, housing is a finite resource, and in many areas, it's becoming increasingly difficult to secure someplace to live. Landlords in these areas, knowing this, will milk tenants for all they're worth. This is particularly bad in areas surrounding universities, lower-income areas, or anywhere else where landlords know that relative inexperience or ability to fight back falls directly into their favor.These tenants got back at their cheap landlord by ensuring that he didn't see a dime from his endeavors to overcharge them for petty damage to items at the house where they were living.",

    "description": "Some kids are too smart for their own good. This teen is also too entrepreneurial for her own good!Even from a young age, some children just crave money. It's hard not to, since money buys basically everything good in this world. However, kids don't always know that there are ethical ways to make some cash, and ways to make some money that are a bit shady. That kid is so desperate to buy the newest game or some snacks that they might start pilfering from their classmates or stealing pocket money from their siblings. This person is infuriated at their 17-year-old niece, who may be old enough to know that what she's doing is completely unacceptable. It's a truly incredible story, as u/Kind-Yesterday-3237 told the people of the r/AmItheA****** subreddit. They shared that they're a long-time perfume collector, with some costing hundreds of dollars. Their niece not only broke in and stole some of the perfumes, decanting them into other containers for herself, but she turned it into a full side hustle that should make her mom worry about her future. Even though she stole hundreds of dollars worth of perfumes, her mother is taking a very laissez-faire approach to it all. Check it all out below, and see if you think the original poster is doing the right thing with her sister and niece.Next up, this cosmetics store employee realized that a nurse she was interviewing for a part-time job wanted the unbelievable salary of… $55 per hour!",

    "description": "Horror movies, as of late, have gone to great lengths to solve the key obstacle to horror movies- cell phones. When we live in a world where help is a phone call away, it's hard to imagine the characters not doing that. So screenwriters put them in situations where this is impossible: in Midsommar they isolate them in rural Sweden, in Get Out calling the police is only going to put our protagonist in more danger. But what's possibly more common is making the film a period piece- like the X/Pearl/Maxxxine trilogy, Late Night with the Devil, or Netflix's continuing series of R.L. Stine adaptations. I bring this up, because today's horror starts in 1993. A Norwegian software company launched its software product to mild acclaim. Like every company, it had its ups and downs, its successes and missteps. On the surface, it was a decent enough place to work. Over the years, the company tried to stay up to date with technology. In 1993, the major languages one might use for launching a major software product, your options are largely C or Pascal. Languages like Python existed, but weren't widely used or even supported on most systems. But the company stayed in business and needed to update their technology as time passed, which meant the program gradually grew and migrated to new languages. Which meant, by the time Niklas F joined the company, they were on C#. Even though they'd completely changed languages, the codebase still derived from the original C codebase. And that meant that the codebase had many secrets, dark corners, and places a developer should never look. Like every good horror movie protagonist, Niklas heard the \"don't go in there!\" and immediately went in there. And lurking in those shadows was the thing every developer fears the most: homebrew date handling code. /// /// /// /// /// public static DateTime LastDayInMonth(DateTime dt) { int day = 30; switch (dt.Month) { case 1: day = 31; break; case 2: if (IsLeapYear(dt)) day = 29; else day = 28; break; case 3: day = 31; break; case 4: day = 30; break; case 5: day = 31; break; case 6: day = 30; break; case 7: day = 31; break; case 8: day = 31; break; case 9: day = 30; break; case 10: day = 31; break; case 11: day = 30; break; case 12: day = 31; break; } return new DateTime(dt.Year, dt.Month, day, 0, 0, 0); } /// /// /// /// /// public static bool IsLeapYear(DateTime dt) { bool ret = (((dt.Year % 4) == 0) \u0026\u0026 ((dt.Year % 100) != 0) || ((dt.Year % 400) == 0)); return ret; } For a nice change of pace, this code isn't incorrect. Even the leap year calculation is actually correct (though my preference would be to just return the expression instead of using a local variable). But that's what makes this horror all the more insidious: there are built-in functions to handle all of this, but this code works and will likely continue to work, just sitting there, like a demon that we've made a pact with. And suddenly we realize this isn't Midsommar but Ari Aster's other hit film, Hereditary, and we're trapped being in a lineage of monsters, and can't escape our inheritance. .comment {border: none;} [Advertisement] Utilize BuildMaster to release your software with confidence, at the pace your business demands.

    "description": "Once again, we take a look at the traditional \"if (boolean) return true; else return false;\" pattern. But today's, from RJ, offers us a bonus twist. public override bool IsValid { get { if (!base.IsValid) return false; return true; } } As promised, this is a useless conditional. return base.IsValid would do the job just as well. Except, that's the twist, isn't it. base is our superclass. We're overriding a method on our superclass to… just do what the base method does. This entire function could just be deleted. No one would notice. And yet, it hasn't been. Everyone agrees that it should be, yet it hasn't been. No one's doing it. It just sits there, like a pimple, begging to be popped.
