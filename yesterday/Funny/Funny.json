    "description": "Valentine's Day is the day of love… so you better make sure you don't have a shift to work before making plans. Nobody wants to work on a day dedicated to love if they can help it, but work doesn't stop for anyone. Some folks might decide to not show up for their shifts at all or try to burden others with their special plans that they \"can't miss,\" but this is your PSA: Your coworker's job is not your problem. If they try to guilt-trip you into taking their shift, remember that they probably wouldn't do the same for you, unfortunately.In this story, a nurse explains that their coworker is very unreliable and calls out frequently. This coworker needed someone to pick up her shift last minute, so the nurse told her that they'd pick up her shift if she could cover theirs on Valentine's Day. This coworker refused to do so, claiming that she had really important plans with her husband on V-Day… If that's the case, then find other coverage. Scroll below to see what comes of this coworker's fate.",

Ask for a raise for the extra and exceptional work you've been doing, you're going to get denied. They're not going to recognize your additional efforts, contributions, or abilities. The point here, after all, is to save money by reducing staffing.",

We could identify them if you blindfolded us, spun us around ten times, and then put us in a room filled with 100 other cats. We like to think we could, anyway. But in reality, if you put one of our cats next to one of their siblings, we might not be able to tell them apart if it were a real expurriment.In the thread below, you'll meet a feline pawrent and the cute cat they adopted. They went in knowing exactly which cat they wanted, and left with what they thought was their cat. Fast forward 1.5 meowgnificent years of love and care, and after looking through some old photos, they realized that their cat looked different than the pictures at the rescue shelter! What a cat-astrophe! Scroll down to read the full story below and figure out what caused this meowrvelous mixup.",

    "description": "Well, feline fans, yet another Valentine's Day has arrived and we're still choosing our cats as our dates. It's okay, we actually prefurr it. Cats are way better than hoomans anyway. Sure, they may wake us up at 5 AM every day to feed them, but they don't text us for days and then randomly ghost us, or tell us that they \"don't eat vegetables because vegetables are for women.\" No, our cats are there for us when we're feeling down, when we're happy, and are actually way better cuddlers than any of the hoomans we've met.So this year, we're skipping the Valentine's Day drama by staying in and scrolling through some pawsitively hissterical cat posts instead. It's us on the couch with our cats, a pizza, and reruns of our current favorite binge-watch. It's better than getting all dressed up and braving the winter weather, just to be disappointed a few hours later. If you've read this far, we prrrobably didn't even need to convince you anyway. Enjoy!",
