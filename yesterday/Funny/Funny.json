Well, we know what they would be like if they were hoomans - our adorable velcro cat would be that guy who follows you around everywhere and just goes with the flow. Our tuxedo cat, on the other hand, would be that goth girl that growled at people in middle school if they tried to sit with her at lunch. Let's just say that she really likes her purrsonal space. However, we have no idea what they would look like if they were hoomans. Well, now you can! Thanks to our ever-evolving friend, ChatGPT, you can now have it imagine what your cats would look like as hooman beans. A few feline fans already tried it, and let's just say that the results were…. interesting. It's purrfectly sweet, pawsitively unnerving, and 100% silly. Scroll down to see their ridiculous results below and have yourself a hearty laugh. Enjoy!",

    "description": "We look at our cats at home sometimes, and we think about just how much we spoil them, how we try to spend every moment with them making them happy. That happiness matters. We think it helps them live longer and healthier lives. But not every cat is this lucky. The cats that grow up outside, in the harsh conditions of the outside world… those cats don't always have the best starts at life. Cats like the one in this story is why we rescue cats off the streets - because this is no way to live. Today's story is proof that rescuing sick cats is the best thing that you can do for them. They need your help, whether they know it or not. His start may not have been a good one, but with a little love and care and time, this cat has made a huge transformation. You would not even recognize him now, and that is a good thing. He went from emaciated to an absolute rock star. The one thing that hasn't changed is just how much he loves and appreciates the people who have helped him.",

    "description": "As long as the work gets done, employees should be allowed the courtesy of needing to dip out early if they need to... When micromanagers are strict about this sort of thing, it's usually because they have an insecurity or superiority complex. They need to feel like they are being strong managers, so they focus their energy on the silliest of details, such as clocking in and out a minute behind or ahead of schedule. Of course, any confident and intelligent person would know that unless an early or late departure seriously jeopardizes the work day—and it usually does not—then it really should not be a problem at all.",

    "description": "If you get fired for standing up for yourself, at least you know that you lived up to your own moral standards. While many companies care about their employees, there are tons of places who could care less. There are others that seem to go out of their way to make their employees miserable! For example, some retail places schedule their employees, including their best and most hardworking people, to do \"clopening\" shifts. These dreaded shifts are often something like 4 PM to midnight to close the store. Then, the very next day, just a few hours later, the employee is scheduled for a shift of 5 AM to 1 PM. It's a brutal shift to be assigned to. You basically close the store, sleep for a couple of hours, then drag yourself out of bed to reopen the store all over again. This is very bad for employees, obviously, but many places simply do not care. In office environments, some bosses just lack any tact or grace. Below there are a few stories of workers who needed to call out of work for good reasons, and yet were still scolded for it. If a worker needs to attend to something urgent and their boss still thinks that it's more important that the employee show up and sweep the floors, well, it might just be time to walk out the door and never return. Next, check out some businesses whose LED signs went out, leaving them with signs saying less appealing things like \"Red Loser\" and \"Rat Beef Sandwich.\"",

    "description": "You know what definitely never changes? Shipping prices. Famously static, despite all economic conditions and the same across all shipping providers. It doesn't matter where you're shipping from, or to, you know exactly what the price will be to ship that package at all times. Wait, what? You don't think that's true? It must be true, because Chris sent us this function, which calculates shipping prices, and it couldn't be wrong, could it? public double getShippingCharge(String shippingType, bool saturday, double subTot) { double shCharge = 0.00; if(shippingType.Equals(\"Ground\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 4.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 7.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 9.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .05; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Two-Day\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 14.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 19.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 29.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .10; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Next Day\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 24.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 34.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 44.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .15; } } else if(shippingType.Equals(\"Next Day a.m.\")) { if(subTot \u003c= 29.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 0) { shCharge = 29.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 99.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 29.99) { shCharge = 39.95; } else if(subTot \u003c= 299.99 \u0026\u0026 subTot \u003e 99.99) { shCharge = 49.95; } else if(subTot \u003e 299.99) { shCharge = subTot * .20; } } return shCharge; } Next you're going to tell me that passing the shipping types around as stringly typed data instead of enums is a mistake, too!

    "description": "Singletons is arguably the easiest to understand design pattern, and thus, one of the most frequently implemented design patterns, even- especially- when it isn't necessary. Its simplicity is its weakness. Bartłomiej inherited some code which implemented this pattern many, many times. None of them worked quite correctly, and all of them tried to create a singleton a different way. For example, this one: public class SystemMemorySettings { private static SystemMemorySettings _instance; public SystemMemorySettings() { if (_instance == null) { _instance = this; } } public static SystemMemorySettings GetInstance() { return _instance; } public void DoSomething() { ... // (this must only be done for singleton instance - not for working copy) if (this != _instance) { return; } ... } } The only thing they got correct was the static method which returns an instance, but everything else is wrong. They construct the instance in the constructor, meaning this isn't actually a singleton, since you can construct it multiple times. You just can't use it. And you can't use it because of the real \"magic\" here: DoSomething, which checks if the currently active instance is also the originally constructed instance. If it isn't, this function just fails silently and does nothing. A common critique of singletons is that they're simply \"global variables with extra steps,\" but this doesn't even succeed at that- it's just a failure, top to bottom.
