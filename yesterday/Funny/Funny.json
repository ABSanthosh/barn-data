    "description": "Hey there, almost-30 crowd. Millennials who remember dial-up but also know what TikTok is. People who now groan as they're sitting down. You've made it this far. And honestly? That deserves a gold star, a nap, and probably a cat or two curled on your lap for emeowtional support.Adulting is weird. One moment you're buying a rug and feeling proud, the next you're crying because someone finished your oat milk. But through it all, one thing has stayed constant: cats. Their little bleps. Their dramatic stares. Their chaotic 3 AM zoomies. Their refusal to respect personal space (but only when you're busy).These wholesome cat memes are like a fuzzy little blanket for your soul. They're here to remind you that even if your back hurts for no reason, even if your inbox has 87 unread emails, and even if your dinner is just vibes and cereal... you're doing okay. So take a break, breathe deep, and scroll through these almost-30-approved feline funnies. It's not a hug from your childhood cat, but it's pretty darn close.Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly. Subscribe here.",

    "description": "Purrsonally, we understand the desire to help every cat you meet. It's something instinctual in us. We see a cat on the street and we are swept up by the urge to take them home, feed them some tuna, and teach them to snuggle. However, not every cat needs saving, despite how they may look on the outside. Some cats have a pawsitively enjoyable neighborhood life, with one main family and several side-families that feed them, love them, and house them. You might be surprised how common it is for a cat to have multiple families.So, when the cat lover in this post wrote about how she wanted to save this cat from a life outside, we get it. However, she goes on to say that the cat is clean and well-cared for, so at what point does she need to convince herself that she's not actually saving the cat, but stealing it? We'll leave it to you to find out what happens in the end, but let's just say that everyone gets a purrfectly happy ending!Your inbox deserves hissterical cat content. We deliver. Weekly.

    "description": "I've always maintained that labeling your things, including food, in a flat sharing/roommate arrangement is strange. While it is easy to see how people reach this conclusion, being that it's the easiest way to remember whose things are whose, the act of getting a Sharpie or a label maker out to label everything you own is actually quite bizarre and petty and really is an insane act to take if you stop to think about it. Some people don't even give the arrangement a chance before doing this, either, and are marking or labeling everything in the place the moment you step in the door, before you've even had a chance to touch their stuff.But it remains a fact that you need to respect other people's things and accept that just because this may be a home you're living in, it doesn't automatically entitle you to everything in it. Really, in a flat-sharing/roommate arrangement, the space is shared, and reasonable things like couches and appliances are common use out of necessity, but everything else isn't necessarily up for grabs.That's part of the whole \"sharing\" part of the arrangement. People often mistake sharing for meaning \"This person has to share this with me,\" when in reality, the lesson of sharing is more about knowing the ins and outs of setting appropriate boundaries: that is knowing when something is or isn't yours or when you should be letting other people use your things. If your memory really is just that bad and you can't remember what is yours or where you put your food in the fridge, then maybe having a way to easily identify everything does make sense. But, by the time you're passively aggressive, keeping all your food and dishes in your room to keep other people from using them, then it's time to move out.Really, the issue here is that we weren't meant to be living with other adults who weren't our partner in our 30s, but that's a whole can of worms of a social issue that will have to be saved for another day.",

You walk around the office and try to come up with meaningless tasks that would keep you busy and allow you to forget about your real responsibility. You help a coworker fix to copy machine, ask HR if they need help setting up the office Happy Hour, and reorganize your desk drawer for the 100th time. Everything to look busy but not do any real work.For every 5 employees who pull stunts like this, there might be one who would actually go out of their way to help with those little tasks. They don't do it because they don't want to work; they do it because they really do want to help, and to make the office a better place to work in. To prove that their goal is not to waste working hours, they might even do it while they are off the clock, just like the employee in the story below.",

    "description": "Maybe we'll just try and read a book. That's a good way to spend your vacation. This can't possibly go badly! Original --Remy \"Have you had a chance to look at that JIRA ticket yet?\" Marge debated pretending she hadn't seen the Slack message yet—but, if she did, she knew Gary would just walk over to her desk and badger her further. In truth, she didn't want to look at the ticket: it was a low priority ticket, and worse, it only affected a small fraction of one client's customers, meaning it was likely to be some weird edge case bug nobody would ever run into again. Maybe if I ignore it long enough, it'll go away on its own, she thought. The client was a bookseller with a small but signifigant-to-them online presence; the software they used to sell books, including your standard e-commerce account functionality, was made by Marge's company. The bug was somewhere in the password reset feature: some customers, seemingly at random, were unable to use the password reset link the software emailed out. Marge pulled up the ticket, looking over the half-hearted triage work that had been done before it landed on her desk to solve. The previous guy had pulled logs and figured out that all the customers who were complaining were using the same ISP based out of Germany. He'd recommended reaching out to them, but had been transferred to another division before he'd gotten around to it. When Marge realized that the contact information was all in German, she almost gave up then and there. But with the magic of Google Translate, she managed to get in touch with a representative via email. After a bit of back and forth, she noticed this gem in one of his (translated) replies: We want to display mails in our webmail client as close to the original as possible. Since most mails are HTML formatted, the client supports the full HTTP protocol and can display (almost) all HTML tags. Unfortunately, this means that \"evil\" JS-Content in such mails can do all kinds of stuff in the browser and therefore on the customer's PC. To avert this, all mails are processed by a \"SafeBrowsing\"-module before they are displayed, to recognize and circumvent such manipulations. One of those security measures is the recognition of js-modules that begin with \"on...\", since that are mostly js functions that are triggered by some event in the browser. Our \"countermeasure\" is to just replace \"on...\" with \"no...\" before the HTML content is sent to the rendering process. Marge frowned at the answer for a bit, something nagging at her mind. \"There's no way,\" she murmured as she pulled up the access logs. Sure enough, the url for the reset link was something like https://bookseller.com?oneTimeToken=deadbeef ... and the customers in question had accessed https://bookseller.com?noeTimeToken=deadbeef instead. A few lines of code and it was resolved: a conditional would check for the incorrect query string parameter and copy the token to the correct query string parameter instead. Marge rolled her eyes, merged her change into the release branch, and finally, at long last, closed that annoying low-priority ticket once and for all. hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad(); code { font-family: Consolas, monospace; } [Advertisement] Keep the plebs out of prod.
