    "description": "This person has been flaunting his new technological toy in all the wrong ways. Have you ever flown a drone before? Until a few years ago, these things weren't super common. However, they really took off in recent years (get it?!), and they became a household item for some technology lovers and video creators alike. Using the flying camera apparatus, you can take breathtaking footage from high in the air. Your device can soar across the sky, skim a lake, or check out a mountainous area with ease. All the while, the footage looks impressively smooth, like you're a director creating a movie of your own. Before you put a down payment on that drone, though, you may want to just search the phrase \"drone fails.\" You'll discover that there are many ways that a drone can be demolished, since they're both fragile and not waterproof. Some people fly too close to the surface of a lake to get pretty footage, only to watch as their drone splashes into the water, never to be seen again. Others fly too high and get their drones stuck in trees or on mountaintops. Then there are people like this dude, who let their drones interact with a dog.",

    "description": "Desperate times call for desperate measures, but desperate measures do not always pan out. In this day and age, who among us has not come into contact with an online scammer or a choosing beggar on the internet? These are the folks who lurk around on sites like Facebook Marketplace, desperately hoping to find the next innocent soul they can cheat, scam, and manipulate. In this instance, we are dealing with an entitled choosing beggar who claimed she did not have the resources fill her holiday stockings with gifts for her kids. An online seller, who shared this story from his own perspective, agreed to help out. After some back and forth, the two agreed upon $250 for a same-day pickup order, an audacious request that was already a generous one to fulfill. By the time their meeting approached in which the sale was to be completed, the choosing beggar revealed that she had no plans to pay this guy and instead thought she could appeal to his emotions to get all of her requested gifts and items for free!",

    "description": "There are some things about having a cat that simply cannot be explained to non-cat owners. When your cat comes to cuddle you - on their own, making their own decision, taking the long track from their spot in the living room to go be with you in the office. Or when you gently pet your cat after said cat has spent an hour in the sun, warming up, and they turn onto their back for you to pet them there. Or when the little cat goes chaos mode and runs straight across your face in the middle of the night for no apparent reason. And of course there's purring. If you have never had a cat sit on your lap and purr their little hearts out… if you have not felt those vibrations and heard that sound that cannot be replicated by anything else ever… you're missing out on one of the best feelings in life. So, when you guys told us all of these amazing stories of you getting hearing implants and hearing your cats purr and meow for the first time… believe us when we say that we shed a tear.",

People might wrongly assume the napping champions would be sloths, but they're wrong. While sloths earned their full respect for their sleeping abilities - cats do it all while living with us, haughty hoomans, who would, in theory, disrupt every attempt for cats to sleep - but somehow, they succeed. Despite hoomans making all this noise around the house, despite hoomans deciding to pet the cats while they take their afternoon nap - cats can sleep for like a bajillion amount of time.Since cats are the kings and queens of memes, and also the running champions of wild wide napping - it's no wonder there are so many memes with these combined concepts in them. We gathered a bunch of sleepy cat memes for you to show your cat, only once they wake up, of course… We wouldn't want to interrupt their cutie patootie sleep… Would we?",

    "description": "Bejamin's team needed to generate a unique session ID value that can't easily be guessed. The traditional way of doing this would be to generate cryptographically secure random bytes. Most languages, including PHP, have a solution for doing that. But you could also do this: protected function _createId() { $id = 0; while (strlen($id) \u003c 32) { $id .= mt_rand(0, mt_getrandmax()); } $id = md5(uniqid($id, true)); return $id; } Now, mt_rand is not cryptographically secure. They generate a random number (of arbitrary size) and concatenate it to a string. When the string is 32 characters long (including a leading zero), we call that enough. This is not generating random bytes. To the contrary, the bytes it's generating are very not random, seeing as they're constrained to a character between 0 and 9. We then pass that through the uniqid function. Now, uniqid also generates a non-cryptographically secure unique identifier. Here, we're specifying our large number is the prefix to that unique ID, and asking for more randomness to be added (the true parameter). This is better than what they did with the while loop above, though still not the \"correct\" way to do it. Finally, we pass it through the md5 algorithm to reduce it to a hash, because we just love hash collisions. It's impressive that, given a chance to make a choice about security-related features, they were able to make every single wrong choice. This is also why you don't implement this stuff yourself. There are far more ways to get it wrong than there are ways to get it right.

And as you might be gathering from the code, this is the first line in a long block that constructs JSON through string concatenation. And yes, JavaScript has built in functions for this, which work better than this. While it's possible that they need to generate custom JSON to support a misbehaving parser on the other side, that's it's own WTF- and it isn't the case here. The developers responsible simply didn't know how to handle JSON in JavaScript. Do you know what else they couldn't understand? Source control and collaboration tools, so all of the JavaScript files were named things like david.js and lisa.js- each developer got their own JS file to work on, so they didn't conflict with anyone else.
