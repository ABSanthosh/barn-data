    "description": "Mark sends us a very simple Java function which has the job of parsing an integer from a string. Now, you might say, \"But Java has a built in for that, Integer.parseInt,\" and have I got good news for you: they actually used it. It's just everything else they did wrong. private int makeInteger(String s) { int i=0; try { Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { i=0; return i; } i=Integer.parseInt(s); return i; } This function is really the story of variable i, the most useless variable ever. It's doing its best, but there's just nothing for it to do here. We start by setting i to zero. Then we attempt to parse the integer, and do nothing with the result. If it fails, we set i to zero again, just for fun, and then return i. Why not just return 0? Because then what would poor i get to do? Assuming we didn't throw an exception, we parse the input again, storing its result in i, and then return i. Again, we treat i like a child who wants to help paint the living room: we give it a dry brush and a section of wall we're not planning to paint and let it go to town. Nothing it does matters, but it feels like a participant. Now, Mark went ahead and refactored this function basically right away, into a more terse and clear version: private int makeInteger(String s) { try { return Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { return 0; } } He went about his development work, and then a few days later came across makeInteger reverted back to its original version. For a moment, he wanted to be mad at someone for reverting his change, but no- this was in an entirely different class. With that information, Mark went and did a search for makeInteger in the code, only to find 39 copies of this function, with minor variations. There are an unknown number of copies of the function where the name is slightly different than makeInteger, but a search for Integer.parseInt implies that there may be many more.

    "description": "You should never be forced into buying someone a present--- it's an act that's supposed to come from the heart. That's why they say it's the thought that counts. Even if you're gifted a sweater you'd never wear, or a clunky coffee mug you can't stand the sight of, the gift-giver thought of you and bought something they thought you'd enjoy. It's less about the value of the gift, and more about the bond that brings you and that person together, whether that's through a long-standing friendship, family ties, or a workplace BFF. This guy is frustrated after giving his little stepbrother a gift that was, admittedly, much cheaper than he gave to his actual brother. They just aren't as close, so this guy figured it'd be fine to give a $25 gift card to the dude he barely sees or interacts with. His stepmom and stepbrother should've just thanked him for the gift (even if they talked about him behind his back after the fact). But instead, a simple gift turned into a whole family debate that isn't going to bring any of them closer together any time soon. Check out the full story below, and see if you think this guy's gifting needs work, or if his dad and stepmom are being unreasonable. Next, read about this mom who banned her 16-year-old daughter from going on spring break… with good reason!",

    "description": "This dude's chaotic brother and girlfriend are pure trouble. After getting evicted from their apartment, the older brother was generous enough to allow them to crash at his place while they were taking the time they needed to rebound and get back on their feet. The catch was that the older brother had house rules. Nothing over-the-top, but he needed the place to remain orderly and stable for the sake of his 6-year-old son. Unfortunately, this backfired quickly as the younger brother and his girlfriend were simply unable to follow said house rules after about a month. At that point, the older brother was likely already wondering when they were planning on moving out, so when they started to bend his rules, he had plenty of cause to kick them out. However, the straw that really broke the camel's back had to do with the 6-year-old's mother when she came one weekend to drop her son off at the apartment. The drama that ensued led to even more family conflict!",

You don't have a couch anymore - you have a sittable lump of cat hair. You don't have food anymore - you have edible fur in various tastes. You don't have a floor anymore - you have a wall-to-wall carpet made of everything your cat is shedding this season. So, you know, it's time to take out that broom, the vacuum cleaner, the Dyson, or whatever you use to clean the house - and get some spring work done.If you cleaned well and no more fur is clinging to everything you own, you can now see the hidden comical cat memes that were under that fluffy coat. They might not be as floofy as your feline friend, but they're definitely as funny as cats, as cute as cats, as hilarious as cats, and as wholesome as cats. It's a great way to have a laugh on this lovely spring day.",

Sure, some cats like their purrsonal space, but you would never know that if you stepped even one paw into our house. Our partner was a \"dog person\" before they met us. Now they say they can't sleep unless one of our cats is curled up next to them.It's always the boyfriends, husbands, or dads who say they don't want a cat. And in the end, they all fall prey to the kitten's or cat's love. We know it's going to happen, we've seen it countless times, and yet it never fails to pull on our little heartstrings.
