    "description": "What could be better for workplace morale than dumping your least favorite customer? It really brings people together to bond over a customer who just cannot be satisfied, as this car dealer could tell you all about. There are plenty of jobs that require employees to deal with impolite customers, but working at a car dealership takes the customer service aspect to a whole new level. These people are often paid handsomely for their work, and they have plenty of leeway to decide who will purchase their vehicles and how much they'll pay for them. Car dealers use tons of tricks to get their customers to buy more expensive vehicles or opt into pricey add-ons. Unfortunately for this car salesperson, one of their customers had a crazy approach to buying their vehicle. First of all, they forged a document in order to snag a $3,000 discount, which seems ethically dubious if not straight-up illegal. This employee did the right thing by flagging this and contacting their manager. The manager then got a bright idea and had his employee send an email, which you can read all about in the satisfying tale below. After that, read the eye-opening tale of a newlywed couple who were \"devastated\" to learn that they were only going to make $3,000 off of their $60,000 wedding, leading commenters to wonder, \"Did they think they were gonna make money from their wedding?\"",

    "description": "This was not exactly the wedding of anyone's dreams.Let's start with the bride and groom of this event, who had to switch wedding planners about ten days prior to the ceremony. Just when it seemed like all the stress and chaos was under control, the food and beverage caterer completely bailed on the day of the wedding, taking the money and running without any ability to contact her. To make matters more upsetting, this was a Wish Upon a Wedding event (keep scrolling below for further details).From the wedding planner's perspective, this was about as disastrous as it could get. She inherited the prior planner's mess and had entrusted that the catering was all good to go, having confirmed with her about the details the day before. Unfortunately, the wedding planner was left scrambling and eventually found help in a nearby restaurant, who she gives a shout-out to at the end of her account of this debacle. Keep scrolling below for the full story.

    "description": "We think that everyone knows at this point that foxes are just… cat software running on dog hardware. If you think about it for just a few seconds, you will realize that it is true. So, is it really a surprise that cats and foxes are such good friends sometimes, that if their paths cross, they end up getting along? We don't think so. But after such a long time writing for ICHC, we have seen it many times. We have seen cats and foxes play together. We have seen cats groom foxes. We have seen foxes reunite with cats that they grew up with, and it's as emotional as any reunion video we've seen. This duo just kind of makes sense, so coming across this video didn't even surprise us. It did make us aww though. And we're sure it will do the same to you. Because no matter how many times you see it, watching cats and foxes be such good friends is one of the cutest, most wholesomest things in the world.",

    "description": "When \"dog guys\" gather together on the internet, things get… wholesome. You'll see what we mean shortly. Cats are an ideal pet for kids who want a sweet companion and parents who don't want a big lift in responsibilities. Cats are low maintenance, all they need is food, a clean litter box, water, and lots of love. Their charming nature can turn even the most extreme \"dog guy\" into a cat-loving king. And this phenomenon often occurs after dads provide their children with a friendly feline companion. It's no secret why dads nearly always become best friends with the cats they got for their kids or didn't even want to begin with. Get ready for a series of sweet, funny, and downright adorable photos that show just how irresistible a cat can be!",

I leaned over to Noah in the theater and shook him shouting “BLADE” when Wesley Snipes appeared. While I liked seeing Gambit on screen and I appreciate that Channing Tatum likes the character, I have to say I don’t really see him as Gambit. He tried very hard and I don’t even hate the accent but he just doesn’t physically look like Gambit to me. If they want to get serious I think they need to hire someone like Austin Butler who I think would kill the role accent and all.",

    "description": "ArSo works at a small company. It's the kind of place that has one software developer, and ArSo isn't it. But ArSo is curious about programming, and has enough of a technical background that small tasks should be achievable. After some conversations with management, an arrangement was made: Kurt, their developer, would identify a few tasks that were suitable for a beginner, and would then take some time to mentor ArSo through completing them. It sounded great, especially because Kurt was going to provide sample code which would give ArSo a head start on getting things done. What better way to learn than by watching a professional at work? DateTime datTmp; File.Copy(strFileOld, strFileNew); // 2 seconds delay datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); datTmp = DateTime.Now; while (datTmp.Second == DateTime.Now.Second); File.Delete(strFileOld); This code copies a file from an old path to a new path, and then deletes the old path after a two second delay. Why is there a delay? I don't know. Why is the delay written like this? I can't possibly explain that. Check the time at the start of the loop. When the second part of that time stops matching the second part of the current time, we assume one second has passed. This is, of course, inaccurate- if I check the time at 0:00:00.9999 a lot less than a second will pass. This delay is at most one second. In any case, ArSo has some serious questions about Kurt's mentorship, and writes: Now I don't know if I should ask for more coding tasks. Honestly, I think you should ask for more. Like, I think you should just take Kurt's job. You may be a beginner, but honestly, you're likely going to do a better job than this.
