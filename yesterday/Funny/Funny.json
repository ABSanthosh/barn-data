    "description": "I bet you thought Timothée was a shoe-in for \"Best Actor\"—well, the Academy said, \"no way!\" Nominated for his role as Bob Dylan in the beloved biopic A Complete Unknown, fans of the star and film critics alike are wondering why Chalamet didn't pull a win and take home Oscar gold for \"Best Actor.\" There are a lot of factors at play here, but we're thinking that he might be following in previous heartthrobs' footsteps—hear me out.Timothée Chalamet started young and was thrust into the limelight on an Oscar campaign trail for Call Me By Your Name when he was just 22 years old. His overall presence in the public eye, in addition to his multiple romantic partners of the past and present—Lily-Rose and Kylie Jenner—paired with fan reception/obsession, are eerily comparable to other cinema stars who have also seemingly never gotten it right in the eyes of the Academy awards.Johnny Depp and Leonardo DiCaprio, for two. Both were deeply loved by many in their heydays, yet always got the short end of the stick as Oscar nominees. Leo DiCaprio only won one Oscar after seven nominations, Johnny Depp has won none after three nominations, and Timothée has won none after two Oscar noms and four Golden Globe noms. Is he on the same trajectory, or is it too soon to tell? Getting the lead roles in the best movies might not be what it's cut out to be… Could his public image take part in the campaign against an Oscar win? Evidently, yes.",

    "description": "There's a certain value in knowledge and experience and novelty that's why things like patents and copyright and NDAs and noncompete agreements exist. Companies use these types of things all the time to protect their \"knowledge\" and \"retain\" it. I even know a barista who was asked to sign an NDA by a boutique cafe over their process for preparing (barista-ing?) coffees… even though they prepared coffee exactly the same as any other cafe in existence. Don't get me wrong, it's really easy to make a bad cup of joe but and NDA… really?This incessant drive to retain the knowledge and uniqueness of a company is why it's all the more confusing that this same effort and vigor isn't put into staff retention, you know, to keep the people around whose brains and muscle memory hold the keys to that same company's success and processes—whose ideas developed that same success and process.In fact, they'll go as far as to have mass layoffs of the most experienced staff to keep the cost of labor at a minimum… even though the company is still profitable? Wait… What?",

    "description": "Some animal friendships are unlike any others. They cross every boundary. And they can happen anywhere. It can be a cat who is best friends with a cockatoo, a pairing that has been friends for years. It can be a black panther who is best friends with a Rottweiler, a duo that hangs out together and plays together and experiences new things together. It can be a white lion and a Bengal tiger who became friends in captivity. Or it can be even crazier, and instead of an unexpected duo, you get a trio. These three - a bear cub, a lion and a tiger got rescued together from the house of a drug dealer. Their conditions there were awful, and it took a while for them to be found and released. The one thing that they consistently had there, in captivity, was each other, and they bonded like no other animals that we have seen. Once rescued, they stayed together, comforting one another and helping each other stay sane and happy. Their caretakers were sure that, as the animals got older, they would have to be separated, because they are so vastly different. But they were too bonded to separate, and they loved each other too deeply, and so, they never were separated.",

    "description": "Hey there, feline fans. If you're of a certain age (that's a nice way of saying millennial or older), you probably have the same appreciation for memes as we do. You probably love cat memes just as much as we do, and maybe even more. How could you not? They are the purrfect form of memes - both hissterical and heartwarming, full of whiskery whimsy and wholesomeness.But as new generations of hoomans are born, memes become less and less impawtant to their culture. But not us. If we could, we would transport everyone back to the 2000s when our biggest problem was making sure our mom wasn't on the phone so we could connect to the internet. That's why we are here - to keep cat memes alive. To keep cats where they should be: as kings and queens of the internet. So enjoy this scroll of feline funnies, and make sure to share it with literally everyone you know. Bless you, you're doing Ceiling Cat's work.",

    "link": "https://thedailywtf.com/articles/the-sales-target",
    "description": "The end of the quarter was approaching, and dark clouds were gathering in the C-suite. While they were trying to be tight lipped about it, the scuttlebutt was flowing freely. Initech had missed major sales targets, and not just by a few percentage points, but by an order of magnitude. Heads were going to roll. Except there was a problem: the master report that had kicked off this tizzy didn't seem to align with the department specific reports. For the C-suite, it was that report that was the document of record; they had been using it for years, and had great confidence in it. But something was wrong. Enter Jeff. Jeff had been hired to migrate their reports to a new system, and while this particular report had not yet been migrated, Jeff at least had familiarity, and was capable of answering the question: \"what was going on?\" Were the sales really that far off, and was everyone going to lose their jobs? Or could it possibly be that this ancient and well used report might be wrong? The core of the query was basically a series of subqueries. Each subquery followed this basic pattern: SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_A) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_B None of this was particularly readable, mind you, and it took some digging just to get the shape of the individual queries understood. But none of the individual queries were the problem; it was the way they got stitched together: SELECT SUM(subtotal) FROM (SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_A) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_B UNION SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_C) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_D UNION SELECT SUM(complex_subquery_E) as subtotal FROM complex_subquery_F); The full query was filled with a longer chain of unions, but it was easy to understand what went wrong, and demonstrate it to management. The UNION operator does a set union- which means if there are any duplicate values, only one gets included in the output. So if \"Department A\" and \"Department C\" both have $1M in sales for the quarter, the total will just be $1M- not the expected $2M. The correct version of the query would use UNION ALL, which preserves duplicates. What stunned Jeff was that this report was old enough to be basically an antique, and this was the kind of business that would burn an entire forest down to find out why a single invoice was off by $0.15. It was sheer luck that this hadn't caused an explosion before- or maybe in the past it had, and someone had just written it off as a \"minor glitch\"? Unfortunately for Jeff, because the report was so important it required a huge number of approvals before the \"UNION ALL\" change could be deployed, which meant he was called upon to manually run a \"test\" version of the report containing the fix every time a C-suite executive wanted one, until the end of the following quarter, when he could finally integrate the fix.

    "description": "There are things which are true. Regular expressions frequently perform badly. They're hard to read. Email addresses are not actually regular languages, and thus can't truly be validated (in all their many possible forms) by a pure regex. These are true. It's also true that a simple regex can get you most of the way there. Lucas found this in their codebase, for validating emails. function echeck(str) { var at=\"@\"; var dot=\".\"; var lat=str.indexOf(at); var lstr=str.length; var ldot=str.indexOf(dot); if (str.indexOf(at)==-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(at)==-1 || str.indexOf(at)==0 || str.indexOf(at)==lstr){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(dot)==-1 || str.indexOf(dot)==0 || str.indexOf(dot)==lstr){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(at,(lat+1))!=-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.substring(lat-1,lat)==dot || str.substring(lat+1,lat+2)==dot){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(dot,(lat+2))==-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } if (str.indexOf(\" \")!=-1){ alert(\"You must include an accurate email address for a response.\"); return false; } return true; } It checks that the string contains an \"@\", and the \"@\" is not at the beginning or end of the string. Then it does the same check for a \".\". Then it checks that there isn't a second \"@\". Then it checks that there are at least two non-\"@\" characters before the \".\". Then it checks that there's at least one \".\" after the \"@\". Then it checks that there are no spaces. Like a regex, I don't think this covers the entire space of valid and invalid email addresses, but that's just because the email address spec is complicated. It likely qualifies as \"good enough\", on that front. But it's the most awkward way to express that series of tests, especially since they create variables which might be useful, but never use them, thus calling str.indexOf many, many times. The awkwardness becomes more obvious with the way it outputs the same error message in multiple branches. Outputs them using alert I might add, which is the kind of choice that should send someone to the Special Hell™.
