    "description": "During chill autumn times like these, there is one thing that we love to do that we simply cannot do during the summer. We love grabbing our softest blankets and wrapping ourselves tightly in them. There's something about being cocooned like that, wrapped up in all that warm and comforting goodness. That is simply the best feeling in the world. And we know that all those summer-loving people out there don't know what we are talking about, but our cats know. Because cats love being wrapped up tight just as much as we do. We even have a name for it. We call cats wrapped up in blankets like this… purritos. Because purr… and burrito. It just makes sense. And every single purrito picture that you will ever see, no matter the time of year, will fill you with that purrfect feeling. But especially when it's cold. Because you can get right up in that purrito alongside your kitty.",

    "description": "Hello cat pawrents, how are you doing this week? Whether you're doing great or a little less, you have one thing that makes any day better - a cat. Or two. Or five. Who counts, really? When it comes to cats math loses its meaning, 1 cat + 1 cat can sometimes be equal to 6 cats in total. It is known that cats constantly break the laws of physics, with them being liquid and all, but the laws of math also don't really apply to them. But that works best for us, cat pawrents, because even 1 cat can bring us the happiness that at least 10 cats bring. Or, like, at least 17 cats, we think. Cat math is complicated.So we bring you here a bunch of cat memes that hold the power to spread joy. Since there are 24 cat memes here, it means that it can bring happiness equivalent to about 1,743 cats, if not more.",

    "description": "My life is just sort of nonsense, generally. For the last twenty six years or so there's always something bizarre happening that you might be able to project, but a few of them just don't make any sense at all. We started putting comics online because it seemed clear to us that nobody in their right mind would publish them physically, and it ended up being a whole thing. In 2003 we started a donation drive called Child's Play in the most aggressive way a charity has ever been started I think, and its modern incarnation is an entity that is at the forefront of using VR and AR as therapeutic tools - one that is about to release a certification process for technicians who merge technology and child life. It seemed like more people should be able to go to E3, but they couldn't, and so we made another thing and that one is still going - we're coming up on PAX Unplugged, and the three-day badges just sold out. We made a D\u0026D Podcast before podcasts were super a thing, and it's entirely possible we started Actual Play accidentally. In fact, that's how I came to know the Secretary of State, Steve Hobbs: He's a fan of Acquisitions Incorporated, somehow…?",

Ticket scalping is just one of those things that offer no value, allowing the entitled and uncaring a way to turn a profit and personal gain off a terrible system.Back in 2023, this now 18-year-old saw a chance and took it. He could see how popular and hotly contested tickets for Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" were becoming and decided to take a stab and see if he could win the ticket lottery and secure some tickets of his own to sell for profit at a later date. Now, in 2024, he had been dating his girlfriend for 5 months when, back in July, she learned about the tickets. Having tried and failed to get tickets herself, she was desperate to get them from him, offering to pay face value to take the tickets off his hands.",

    "description": "This worker has taken a hilariously petty tactic to get employees to reply to them. Rest assured, their boss completely hates this tactic, and the internet has informed them how dumb it is, too. Some people refer to \"email jobs\" as fake work. It's the type of job where you get paid a nice salary and benefits to work 40ish hours per week. Your boss probably doesn't care if you come in a few minutes late or decide to take a long lunch with your colleagues. That's in contrast with retail work or food service, where being even a minute late is a punishable offense, you'll have to be on your feet all day long, and you're probably not making much money at all. Email jobs aren't usually fake work necessarily, they're just much more relaxed environments where smart employees work just as much as they need to, and not a second more. This person is about to learn a hard lesson about email jobs, and it's common when you're early in your career. You might think that meeting every deadline and completing every task is key. It's not. What's really important is being a pleasant person to work with. Instead of impressing their bosses with how diligent they are about following up on projects, this person is showing their immaturity and poor communication skills. As commenters pointed out, they might be shown the door fairly quickly if they don't nip this behavior in the bud. Next up, check out some bakery mistakes and messed-up cakes, like one person who experienced a \"slight misunderstanding at the bakery.\"",

    "description": "There's the potential for endless installments of \"programmers not understanding how UUIDs work.\" Frankly, I think the fact that we represent them as human readable strings is part of the problem; sure, it's readable, but conceals the fact that it's just a large integer. Which brings us to this snippet, from Capybara James. if (!StringUtils.hasLength(uuid) || uuid.length() != 36) { throw new RequestParameterNotFoundException(ErrorCodeCostants.UUID_MANDATORY_OR_FORMAT); } StringUtils.hasLength comes from the Spring library, and it's a simple \"is not null or empty\" check. So- we're testing to see if a string is null or empty, or isn't exactly 36 characters long. That tells us the input is bad, so we throw a RequestParameterNotFoundException, along with an error code. So, as already pointed out, a UUID is just a large integer that we render as a 36 character string, and there are better ways to validate a UUID. But this also will accept any 36 character string- as long as you've got 36 characters, we'll call it a UUID. \"This is valid, really valid, dumbass\" is now a valid UUID. With that in mind, I also like the bonus of it not distinguishing between whether or not the input was missing or invalid, because that'll make it real easy for users to understand why their input is getting rejected.

    "description": "Since it's election day in the US, many people are thinking about counting today. We frequently discuss counting here, and how to do it wrong, so let's look at some code from RK. This code may not be counting votes, but whatever it's counting, we're not going to enjoy it: case LogMode.Row_limit: // row limit excel = 65536 rows if (File.Exists(personalFolder + @\"\\\" + fileName + \".CSV\")) { using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(personalFolder + @\"\\\" + fileName + \".CSV\")) { countRows = reader.ReadToEnd().Split(new char[] { '\\n' }).Length; } } Now, this code is from a rather old application, originally released in 2007. So the comment about Excel's row limit really puts us in a moment in time- Excel 2007 raised the row limit to 1,000,000 rows. But older versions of Excel did cap out at 65,536. And it wasn't the case that everyone just up and switched to Excel 2007 when it came out- transitioning to the new Office file formats was a conversion which took years. But we're not even reading an Excel file, we're reading a CSV. I enjoy that we construct the name twice, because that's useful. But the real magic of this one is how we count the rows. Because while Excel can handle 65,536 rows at this time, I don't think this program is going to do a great job of it- because we read the entire file into memory with ReadToEnd, then Split on newlines, then count the length that way. As you can imagine, in practice, this performed terribly on large files, of which there were many. Unfortunately for RK, there's one rule about old, legacy code: don't touch it. So despite fixing this being a rather easy task, nobody is working on fixing it, because nobody wants to be the one who touched it last. Instead, management is promising to launch a greenfield replacement project any day now… [Advertisement] Keep all your packages and Docker containers in one place, scan for vulnerabilities, and control who can access different feeds.
