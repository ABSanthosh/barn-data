    "description": "Monday: the universally acknowledged villain of the workweek, rising like a fluorescent-lit specter over the heads of office workers everywhere, striking fear into the hearts of anyone with a calendar, a commute, or a faint memory of weekend joy.  Let me tell you, I personally despise nothing more than seeing the light in a young adult's eyes shut off and replaced with the thousand-yard stare of office despair, a sort of glazy eyed realization that sets in by week three of moving a mouse while scrolling through brainrot, pretending to work, and inwardly screaming for a single neuron to fire in the name of purpose.Our young adult, a 20-year-old digital marketer on the cusp of graduation, once hopped out of bed to play \"corporate girlie\" with all the enthusiasm of a motivational Pinterest board. But fast-forward to today, and the commute alone could qualify as its own endorphin-chasing hobby, sixty, sometimes seventy-five glorious minutes each way just to scroll the internet in professional attire while perfecting the art of pretending to look busy.The office vibe? Less Devil Wears Prada, and more Senior Citizen Bingo Ball, but with more Instagram reels and less actual accomplishments. Most colleagues are either cosplaying as extroverted teenagers despite their advanced ages, or have simply transcended the need for productivity, achieving a zen-like acceptance of prolonged nothingness. Meanwhile, the only thing thinner than the work assignments is the line between existential crisis and caffeine overabundance.",

    "description": "There is no worse human being than one who treats service industry staff like they are less than humans. Seriously, what is your problem? Where did all of that entitlement even come from?! Are you that stupid that you think you are so \"respected\" that the staff won't ruin your food or \"not be able to find\" your forgotten item you left at the table? Like, you don't even have the funds to be acting with that much entitlement. If you're going to treat the wait staff like you're better than them, then you have to at least tip 50%. Leaving a $2 tip on a tab that was over $100 is just absurd.  And yet, that is exactly what happened to this service industry employee. They were serving an absolutely swamped restaurant during a holiday weekend and, of course, they were understaffed. This one table waltzed in like they owned the place and quickly dug themselves into a grave after being disrespectful to the entire staff…",

When you could just spend a chill day, without worrying, doing nothing but laughing at silly little cat memes all day long? Well, we do. And we miss it. We miss it so much. And although we don't know if recreating that same feeling is pawssible in today's world, with the pace of everything today, but we can certainly try. The one exceptionally good thing about everything remaining on the internet forever is that we actually do have access to those some hilarious cat memes that we saw back in the day. All of them are still here. And we can still, even amidst the madness, sit down and snort at some silly cat memes every once in a while. So, today, we're bringing you a taste. Some classic memes featuring the funniest felines that might just give you that nostalgic feeling that you are looking for.",

But we can safely assume you are well, or that you're at least a general feline fanatic fan yourself. And you're probably a cat pawrent, too (and if you're not - take this as a sign to go and adopt a fluffy feline friend, and make your own wholesome adoption story about it). So you understand us when we say that cat adoption stories are our favorite stories.But we never could've imagined that the cat adoption story that will melt our hearts this week will be… a cat's adoption story. Yeah, a cat adopting a kitten. It's the cat's story, and the cat adopts a kitten. How absolutely adorable. We need to wipe our hearts from the floor, because they've all melted. Not just because it's an adopted cat that's adopting a kitten - but because the entire online feline family came forward with similar stories. So we actually got a bunch of stories about cats adopting kittens, and we can basically call it for this week. We're done. This is too cute to continue.You know what? We feel inspired. After this week is over, we're all going to the shelter to have our adorable I Can Has Cheezburger office cats adopt them a new kitten sibling. It's a win-win situation for everyone - a kitten looking for a home will get adopted, our cats will have a new smol member in their pack, and we will have another cat. Seriously, there's no more wholesome than that.",

What could go wrong? static String[] readFile(String filename) { String record = null; Vector vURLs = new Vector(); int recCnt = 0; try { FileReader fr = new FileReader(filename); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fr); record = new String(); while ((record = br.readLine()) != null) { vURLs.add(new String(record)); //System.out.println(recCnt + \": \" + vURLs.get(recCnt)); recCnt++; } } catch (IOException e) { // catch possible io errors from readLine() System.out.println(\"IOException error reading \" + filename + \" in readURLs()!\\n\"); e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(\"Reading URLs ...\\n\"); int arrCnt = 0; String[] sURLs = new String[vURLs.size()]; Enumeration eURLs = vURLs.elements(); for (Enumeration e = vURLs.elements() ; e.hasMoreElements() ;) { sURLs[arrCnt] = (String)e.nextElement(); System.out.println(arrCnt + \": \" + sURLs[arrCnt]); arrCnt++; } if (recCnt != arrCnt++) { System.out.println(\"WARNING: The number of URLs in the input file does not match the number of URLs in the array!\\n\\n\"); } return sURLs; } // end of readFile() So, we start by using a FileReader and a BufferedReader, which is the basic pattern any Java tutorial on file handling will tell you to do. What I see here is that the developer responsible didn't fully understand how strings work in Java. They initialize record to a new String() only to immediately discard that reference in their while loop. They also copy the record by doing a new String which is utterly unnecessary. As they load the Vector of strings, they also increment a recCount variable, which is superfluous since the collection can tell you how many elements are in it. Once the Vector is populated, they need to copy all this data into a String[]. Instead of using the toArray function, which is built in and does that, they iterate across the Vector and put each element into the array. As they build the array, they increment an arrCnt variable. Then, they do a check: if (recCnt != arrCnt++). Look at that line. Look at the post-increment on arrCnt, despite never using arrCnt again. Why is that there? Just for fun, apparently. Why is this check even there? The only way it's possible for the counts to not match is if somehow an exception was thrown after vURLs.add(new String(record)); but before recCount++, which doesn't seem likely. Certainly, if it happens, there's something worse going on. Now, I'm going to be generous and assume that this code predates Java 8- it just looks old. But it's worth noting that in Java 8, the BufferedReader class got a lines() function which returns a Stream that can be converted directly toArray, making all of this code superfluous, but also, so much of this code is just superfluous anyway. Anyway, for a fun game, start making the last use of every variable be a post-increment before it goes out of scope.

    "description": "Combining Java with lower-level bit manipulations is asking for trouble- not because the language is inadequate to the task, but because so many of the developers who work in Java are so used to working at a high level they might not quite \"get\" what they need to do. Victor inherited one such project, which used bitmasks and bitwise operations a great deal, based on the network protocol it implemented. Here's how the developers responsible created their bitmasks: private static long FFFFFFFF = Long.parseLong(\"FFFFFFFF\", 16); So, the first thing that's important to note, is that Java does support hex literals, so 0xFFFFFFFF is a perfectly valid literal. So we don't need to create a string and parse it. But we also don't need to make a constant simply named FFFFFFFF, which is just the old twenty = 20 constant pattern: technically you've made a constant but you haven't actually made the magic number go away. Of course, this also isn't actually a constant, so it's entirely possible that FFFFFFFF could hold a value which isn't 0xFFFFFFFF. [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy.
