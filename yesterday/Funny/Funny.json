    "description": "There's nothing more awkward than having a stranger fix something in your home while you're pointlessly and silently standing there watching them do their job. Yet, this is one of those things in life that you have to put up with, because the alternatives are much less preferable. You can't leave the room and let a stranger roam freely in your private place, and trying to make conversation with this person sounds like living an actual nightmare.Sometimes, your landlord is the one who comes to fix stuff in your place, and the situation is even more awkward. A landlord is not fully a stranger, so making conversation while they are there is pretty mandatory. This means that not only are you standing there and watching them do their thing, but you have to fill in the quiet and act like you care about anything they have to say. But again, what are the alternatives? Leaving them be and walking out? Does anyone trust their landlord enough to do that?Apparently, that is what the lady in the story below thought…",

    "description": "Do you have that one coworker who you watch do nothing during the workday, mess up when they actually decide to do their job (which isn't often), and the boss still loves them somehow? You've likely dealt with a colleague like this at least once in your life, and that's because underqualified employees exist everywhere in the workforce. If you have one on your team, it'll turn into a sour reflection of your work ethic, even though you know you're a top performer in your company. When you have a \"useless\" slacker on your team, all it takes is one big mess-up for you to open your eyes to just how much your coworker has impacted your work life.In this next story, an employee is left frustrated after their clearly underqualified coworker deletes over 15 hours of completed work from a project their team was working on. The employee proceeds to explain how \"useless\" their coworker is in every capacity and is now going to their boss to light a fire under her. Scroll to read.",

    "description": "Being a cat momma is a hard job, that is a fact. Think of how hard it is to raise one human at a time and then think about how cat mommas have to raise whole litters of babies at once. It's rough. There is a lot that you have to teach your kittens. You have to teach kittens how to drink from a bowl without getting water up their noses, for example. You have to teach kittens how to communicate with their future humans so that they can give us the orders that we're supposed to follow. Really, it's not surprising that some cat mommas get overwhelmed sometimes. And it's even less surprising that some cat mommas ask humans to help… to babysit. They need a break every once in a while too. And for you, the human that was chosen to babysit, that is a very big and impurrtant responsibility that they are bestowing upon you. So, you have to take it seriously, just like the person in today's story did.",

We took a few days off to travel, and we have to say that we've come back purrfectly… sleepy! It may have been a vacation, but now we feel like we need a vacation from our vacation. We may be back at work, but we're not the same purrson that left. We've successfully adopted the \"if I fits, I sits\" meowntality to our work days, and let us tell you, it feels great.That's right - we left and came back pawsitively ungovernable. There isn't anybody in the world that can tell us to do something if we don't want to (except our cats… we listen to them no matter how tired we are), and the power is flowing purrfectly through us. We do enjoy sharing these hissterical cat memes with you, so don't worry, there's plenty more where these came from. We will, however, be promptly leaving after eight hours, without so much as a word goodbye. And that, dear friends, is the \"if I fits, I sits\" mentality at its finest.",

    "description": "Do you know what I had forgotten until this morning? That VBScript (and thus, older versions of Visual Basic) don't require you to use parentheses when calling a function. Foo 5 and Foo(5) are the same thing. Of course, why would I remember that? I thankfully haven't touched any of those languages since about… 2012. Which is actually a horrifyingly short time ago, back when I supported classic ASP web apps. Even when I did, I always used parentheses because I wanted my code to be something close to readable. Classic ASP, there's a WTF for you. All the joy of the way PHP mixes markup and code into a single document, but with an arguably worse and weirder language. Which finally, brings us to Josh's code. Josh worked for a traveling exhibition company, and that company had an entirely homebrewed CMS written in classic ASP. Here's a few hundred lines out of their navigation menu. class=menuMain\u003e \u003c% if menu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Home\" else Response.Write \"Home\" end if if menu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"About us\" else Response.Write \"About us\" end if if menu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"How to book\" else Response.Write \"How to book\" end if if menu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Expeditions\" else Response.Write \"Expeditions\" end if if menu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Safety\" else Response.Write \"Safety\" end if if menu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Fundraising\" else Response.Write \"Fundraising\" end if if menu = \"7\" then Response.Write \"Work for us\" else Response.Write \"Work for us\" end if if menu = \"8\" then Response.Write \"Contact us\" else Response.Write \"Contact us\" end if Response.Write \"\" Response.Write \"\" if menu = \"1\" then end if if menu = \"2\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Who we are\" else Response.Write \"Who we are\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"CSR\" else Response.Write \"CSR\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Partners and accreditation\" else Response.Write \"Partners and accreditation\" end if if submenu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Curriculum links\" else Response.Write \"Curriculum links\" end if if submenu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Expedition advice\" else Response.Write \"Expedition advice\" end if if submenu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Press resources\" else Response.Write \"Press resources\" end if end if if menu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"\" end if if menu = \"4\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Central and North America\" else Response.Write \"Central and North America\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"South America\" else Response.Write \"South America\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"South East Asia\" else Response.Write \"South East Asia\" end if if submenu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Asia\" else Response.Write \"Asia\" end if if submenu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Africa\" else Response.Write \"Africa\" end if if submenu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Europe\" else Response.Write \"Europe\" end if if submenu = \"7\" then Response.Write \"Community projects\" else Response.Write \"Community projects\" end if if submenu = \"8\" then Response.Write \"Independent\" else Response.Write \"Independent\" end if end if if menu = \"5\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Safe people\" else Response.Write \"Safe people\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Safe places\" else Response.Write \"Safe places\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Safe practices and policies\" else Response.Write \"Safe practices and policies\" end if if submenu = \"4\" then Response.Write \"Safe resources\" else Response.Write \"Safe resources\" end if if submenu = \"5\" then Response.Write \"Operations Centre\" else Response.Write \"Operations Centre\" end if if submenu = \"6\" then Response.Write \"Travelsafe course\" else Response.Write \"Travelsafe course\" end if end if if menu = \"6\" then ' if submenu = \"1\" then ' Response.Write \"Fundraising team\" ' else ' Response.Write \"Fundraising team\" ' end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Fundraising ideas\" else Response.Write \"Fundraising ideas\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Fundraising events\" else Response.Write \"Fundraising events\" end if end if if menu = \"7\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Lead an expedition\" else Response.Write \"Lead an expedition\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Office based positions\" else Response.Write \"Office based positions\" end if end if if menu = \"8\" then if submenu = \"1\" then Response.Write \"Request a brochure\" else Response.Write \"Request a brochure\" end if if submenu = \"2\" then Response.Write \"Sign up for e-news\" else Response.Write \"Sign up for e-news\" end if if submenu = \"3\" then Response.Write \"Press resources\" else Response.Write \"Press resources\" end if end if %\u003e This renders the whole menu, but based on the selected menu and submenu, it adds an activ class to the HTML elements. Which means that each HTML element is defined here twice, once with and without the CSS class on it. I know folks like to talk about dry code, but this code is SOGGY with repetition. Just absolutely dripping wet with the same thing multiple times. Moist. [Advertisement] ProGet’s got you covered with security and access controls on your NuGet feeds. Learn more.",
