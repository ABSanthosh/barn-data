    "description": "Do you get nervous when you find yourself having to call your boss and tell them you can't come to work?Even if one has a perfectly good reason for calling out, for some reason, that conversation might make one a bit uneasy, like they're doing something wrong. Maybe this experience only happens to those of us who also had perfect attendance in school, or never missed a day of college. For other people, having to tell their boss they can't come to work is not a big deal whatsoever. They do it, get the okay, and move on with their lives. They don't think anyone hates them, and they definitely do not think they are going to get fired, stuff that constantly crosses the minds of those who dread these sorts of calls.If you have a family emergency, you shouldn't feel bad if you cannot come to work, and any normal boss would agree with this statement. However, if you are a person who constantly misses work, your boss might not believe you when you have an actual reason to not be there, and that can lead to a real threat to your job.",

    "description": "In the retail world, getting to say \"But I AM the manager\" feels so righteous. There are few phrases that can throw a crabby customer off their game faster than realizing that they aren't berating a minimum wage worker. Instead, they're berating the boss, the head person in charge, and now they're not going to get anything they originally wanted. Though it's not how I'd spend my time, there's a certain type of customer who wakes up in the morning ready to make the lives of retail workers miserable. This person loves to go out to eat, order a steak, and then wants the steak remade 5 times because it's not to their liking. This type of person will show up at a clothing store with something they bought 10 years ago, and will try to return it for a full refund. They're not even really trying to accomplish their goal. They just want to feel powerful as they berate some 16-year-old worker who's making minimum wage and trying his or her very best. Up next, read about an attention-seeking \"entitled rich kid\" who tried to blare loud music in the school parking lot, only to ruin his car's paint job: \"Kevin hopped in his car [and] turned it on with the sound cranked up.\"",

    "description": "One of the things that we love most about cats, feline fam, is that they can really bring people together. We all live so much in our own worlds nowadays that it can be difficult to connect with others. However, cats are the great barrier-breakers - and this video proves it. One unsuspecting guest at a hotel was shocked to find an unaccompanied cat carrier just sitting in their hotel lobby. No pawrents around or anyone to claim the poor cat, so they started asking around. Unfortunately, they didn't have much luck and found out that the cat was abandoned there.Other guests helped them in their search, and one even offered to let it stay with them for the night while its future was being decided. Long story short, the kitty is now off to its furrever home, thanks to these wholesome hotel guests who rallied together to save this poor, scared cat.

When we think about this we get anxious, so we simply prefer to not think about this possibility ever and go to cuddle our cute cat immediately. Because how's that even possible to comprehend a life without a cat in it? We want to always have cats in our lives, in every moment. We're sure that every cat pawrent feels the same way about their fluffy feline friends.We don't want you either to think of this depressing state of not having cats in your life. On the contrary - we want you to have as many cats as you want in your life! Now, we cannot, unfortunately, bring you a cat right to your doorstep - but we can definitely increase the amount of wholesome cat memes you look at. We gathered some of the cutest cat memes for this exact reason, so, enjoy!",

    "description": "Today's Anonymous submitter was reviewing some C++ code, and saw this perfectly reasonable looking pattern. class SomeClass { public: void setField(int val); int getField(); } Now, we can talk about how overuse of getters and setters is itself an antipattern (especially if they're trivial- you've just made a public variable with extra steps), but it's not wrong and there are certainly good reasons to be cautious with encapsulation. That said, because this is C++, that getField should really be declared int getField() const- appropriate for any method which doesn't cause a mutation to a class instance. Or should it? Let's look at the implementation. void SomeClass::setField(int val) { setGetField(true, val); } void SomeClass::getField() { return setGetField(false); } Wait, what? Why are we passing a boolean to a method called setGet. Why is there a method called setGet? They didn't go and make a method that both sets and gets, and decide which they're doing based on a boolean flag, did they? int SomeClass::setGetField(bool set, int val) { static int s_val = 0; if (set) { s_val = val; } return s_val; } Oh, good, they didn't just make a function that maybe sets or gets based on a boolean flag. They also made the state within that function a static field. And yes, function level statics are not scoped to an instance, so this is shared across all instances of the class. So it's not encapsulated at all, and we've blundered back into Singletons again, somehow. Our anonymous submitter had two reactions. Upon seeing this the first time, they wondered: \"WTF? This must be some kind of joke. I'm being pranked.\" But then they saw the pattern again. And again. After seeing it fifty times, they wondered: \"WTF? Who hired these developers? And can that hiring manager be fired? Out of a cannon? Into the sun?\" [Advertisement] Picking up NuGet is easy. Getting good at it takes time.
